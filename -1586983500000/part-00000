Introduced in ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters]]'', he is an American fighter who enters the worldwide tournaments called \"The King of Fighters\" to kill [[Geese Howard]], a criminal who killed his father, Jeff Bogard. Following Geese's death during a fight, Terry decides to become the guardian of Geese's son [[Rock Howard]]. He is also a regular character in the [[gaming crossovers|crossover]] video game series ''[[The King of Fighters]]'', where he continues participating in tournaments. He has also been a guest character in multiple games, most notably [[Nintendo]]'s crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. In addition to video games, Terry has appeared in [[anime]] films based on his adventures from the ''Fatal Fury'' series, as well as soundtracks and [[manga]] serialized in Japanese monthly manga magazine ''[[Comic Bom Bom]]''.\n\nSNK created Terry with the idea of a \"macho\" fighter which is reflected in his design. After several installments, Terry was redesigned to give him a more updated look in ''[[Garou: Mark of the Wolves]]'' where he is a more peaceful person. This had an impact on his design which was also altered for ''The King of Fighters'' games. Terry's popularity led SNK to create a female version of him that appears in the game ''[[SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy]]''. Multiple voice actors have portrayed Terry since his introduction in the first ''Fatal Fury'' game. The character has been well received by video game players; he is ranked highly in several popularity polls conducted by SNK and video game magazines. Publications have praised the character's personality and movesets and how he was developed from ''Fatal Fury'' to ''The King of Fighters''. However, Terry's genderbent version was the subject of mixed reception. Terry is featured prominently on merchandise from SNK and their crossover series, becoming an icon for them.\n\n== Creation and design ==\n===Design===\nTerry Bogard originates in [[Capcom]]'s fighting game ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]''. After its developers, Hiroshi Matsumoto and Takashi Nishiyama, moved to [[SNK]], they explained that their previous work included a Caucasian male who appears wearing a leather jacket. He did not appear in ''Street Fighter'' since they had decided the main character would be a dougi-clad karate fighter. But they wanted to include this Caucasian male in their next game if they could. As a result, he was reused in ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters]]'' as a playable character.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Udon|title=SF25: The Art of Street FIghter|year=2014|isbn=978-1927925195}}</ref> This mysterious Caucasian ended up being the model for Terry. The SNK staff described his character design in the first ''Fatal Fury'' as \"the most macho, stand-out, original Terry\". He would be in line with the \"original clashing of fists\".<ref name=PreXII/> Youchiro Soeda was in charge of the animation of most of the characters in the first ''Fatal Fury''.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Youchiro Soeda|last=Soeda|first=Youchiro|user=SOESOE_329|number=1169583321812066304 |date=September 5, 2019 |title=\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30d6\u30e9\u53c2\u6226\u3067\u3001\u9913\u72fc\u4f1d\u8aac\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3066\u5b09\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059 \u9913\u72fc\u4f1d\u8aac1\u306f\u3001\u79c1\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a\u306b\u95a2\u308f\u3063\u305f\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u3060\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059|language=Japanese|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref> In the making of the series, Terry and his brother Andy were characterized as the heroic leads. In contrast, Joe Higashi was comical. For the release of the ''Fatal Fury 3'' game, Terry was quickly added because of his popularity with fans. When it came to his moves, SNK had different ideas and altered the special moves he could perform. While Terry's appearance changes across ''Fatal Fury'', there were two rejected sketches. One involved a design with cowboy boots, a tattoo, and a pendant he had received from an unidentified woman.<ref name=\"moves\">{{cite web|author=blackoak|url=http://shmuplations.com/fatalfury3/|title=Fatal Fury 3 \u2013 1995 Developer Interview|publisher=Shmuplations|accessdate=September 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001014227/http://shmuplations.com/fatalfury3/|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The fourth title, ''[[Real Bout Fatal Fury]]'', was made to end the conflict between Terry and his nemesis, Geese Howard.

Sakurai preferred using his ''Fatal Fury 2'' design in ''Smash'' as he believes it is one of the most recognizable ones, most notably in the 1990s. In so doing, Terry was made to automatically look at his opponents in one-on-one fights, including jumps where the character spins. He was designed to be slower than most characters. A new move known as the Somersault Kick was created for ''Smash'' although the original moves were also retained. An airbased variation of his original projectile technique, the Power Wave, was also used to balance the character. In order to accommodate his full moveset, Terry is the only character who has different side special moves depending on whether the player inputs left or right, and can use Desperation Moves if his health reaches a critical point rather than as his Final Smash, which is a completely new move melding together his different Desperation Moves.<ref name=\"smash\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK3VltKv3JI&t=2405s|title=Super Smash Bros.

Introduced in ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters]]'', he is an American fighter who enters the worldwide tournaments called \"The King of Fighters\" to kill [[Geese Howard]], a criminal who killed his father, Jeff Bogard. Following Geese's death during a fight, Terry decides to become the guardian of Geese's son [[Rock Howard]]. He is also a regular character in the [[gaming crossovers|crossover]] video game series ''[[The King of Fighters]]'', where he continues participating in tournaments. He has also been a guest character in multiple games, most notably [[Nintendo]]'s crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. In addition to video games, Terry has appeared in [[anime]] films based on his adventures from the ''Fatal Fury'' series, as well as soundtracks and [[manga]] serialized in Japanese monthly manga magazine ''[[Comic Bom Bom]]''.\n\nSNK created Terry with the idea of a \"macho\" fighter which is reflected in his design. After several installments, Terry was redesigned to give him a more updated look in ''[[Garou: Mark of the Wolves]]'' where he is a more peaceful person. This had an impact on his design which was also altered for the ''The King of Fighters'' games. Terry's popularity led SNK to create a female version of him that appears in the game ''[[SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy]]''. Multiple voice actors have portrayed Terry since his introduction in the first ''Fatal Fury'' game.\nThe character has been well received by video game players; he is ranked highly in several popularity polls conducted by SNK and video game magazines. Publications have praised the character's personality and movesets and how he was developed from ''Fatal Fury'' to ''The King of Fighters''. However, Terry's genderbent version was the subject of mixed reception. Terry is featured prominently on merchandise from SNK and their crossover series, becoming an icon for them.\n\n== Creation and design ==\n===Design===\nTerry Bogard originates in [[Capcom]]'s fighting game ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]''. After its developers, Hiroshi Matsumoto and Takashi Nishiyama, moved to [[SNK]], they explained that their previous work included a Caucasian male who appears wearing a leather jacket. He did not appear in ''Street Fighter'' since they had decided the main character would be a dougi-clad karate fighter. But they wanted to include this Caucasian male in their next game if they could. As a result, he was reused in ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters]]'' as a playable character.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Udon|title=SF25: The Art of Street FIghter|year=2014|isbn=978-1927925195}}</ref> This mysterious Caucasian ended up being the model for Terry. The SNK staff described his character design in the first ''Fatal Fury'' as \"the most macho, stand-out, original Terry\". He would be in line with the \"original clashing of fists\".<ref name=PreXII/> Youchiro Soeda was in charge of the animation of most of the characters in the first ''Fatal Fury''.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Youchiro Soeda|last=Soeda|first=Youchiro|user=SOESOE_329|number=1169583321812066304 |date=September 5, 2019 |title=\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30d6\u30e9\u53c2\u6226\u3067\u3001\u9913\u72fc\u4f1d\u8aac\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3066\u5b09\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059 \u9913\u72fc\u4f1d\u8aac1\u306f\u3001\u79c1\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a\u306b\u95a2\u308f\u3063\u305f\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u3060\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059|language=Japanese|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref> In the making of the series, Terry and his brother Andy were characterized as the heroic leads. In contrast, Joe Higashi was comical. For the release of the ''Fatal Fury 3'' game, Terry was quickly added because of his popularity with fans. When it came to his moves, SNK had different ideas and altered the special moves he could perform. While Terry's appearance changes across ''Fatal Fury'', there were two rejected sketches. One involved a design with cowboy boots, a tattoo, and a pendant he had received from an unidentified woman.<ref name=\"moves\">{{cite web|author=blackoak|url=http://shmuplations.com/fatalfury3/|title=Fatal Fury 3 \u2013 1995 Developer Interview|publisher=Shmuplations|accessdate=September 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001014227/http://shmuplations.com/fatalfury3/|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The fourth title, ''[[Real Bout Fatal Fury]]'', was made to end the conflict between Terry and his nemesis, Geese Howard.

Sakurai preferred using his ''Fatal Fury 2'' design in ''Smash'' as he believes it is one of the most recognizable ones, most notably in the 1990s. In so doing, Terry was made to automatically look at his opponents in one-on-one fights, including jumps where the character spins. He was designed to be slower than most characters. A new move known as the Somersault Kick was created for ''Smash'' although the original moves were also retained. An airbased variation of his original projectile technique, the Power Wave, was also used to balance the character. In order to accommodate his full moveset, Terry is the only character who has different side special moves depending on whether the player inputs left or right, and can use Desperation Moves if his health reaches a critical point rather than as his Final Smash, which is a completely new move melding together his different Desperation Moves.<ref name=\"smash\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK3VltKv3JI&t=2405s|title=Super Smash Bros.

Phon ([[Natthawut Jenmana]]) and Ter ([[Chanagun Arpornsutinan]]), the two hitmen working for Thana, are tasked to kill Neo and punish Vanika. Upon finding the pair, Ter tries to shoot Neo, but accidentally shoots and kills Vanika instead. Neo runs to the strip club where he works and is followed by Phon; earlier, Shin ([[Tawan Vihokratana]]), Thana's only son who happens to be a reluctant heir of his father's mob empire, comes to the same bar with his friends and meets Miw ([[Lapassalan Jiravechsoontornkul]]), a hostess at the bar. Shin's friends pay Miw to sleep with Shin (unbeknownst to them, Shin is gay, and doesn't actually sleep with Miw). Afterwards, Shin and Miw both return to the bar. In the bathroom, Shin runs into Neo, who is hiding from Phon, and who has apparently met Shin before (this is revealed later in the series). Phon discovers them, but is stopped by Miw, who accidentally shoots and kills Phon.  Neo, Miw, and Shin escape together and begin a harrowing journey that takes them from a seedy [[Bangkok]] motel, to the jungle and to the ocean as they try to evade those who are trying to find them.  \n\nPhon's death devastates not only Ter, but Phon's lover, Mae ([[Watchara Sukchum]]), a transgender female waitress who has long wanted Phon to leave the life of a gangster. Mae and Ter vow to take revenge on Phon's killers and follow the trio to the jungle, where they are hiding out with the assistance of Leo ([[Suphakorn Sriphothong]]), Neo's brother. The trio also seeks refuge in Miw's hometown and receives help from her ex-boyfriend, Luang ([[Pumipat Paiboon]]), while simultaneously dealing with Boss John, a mob leader in direct conflict with Thana, and the brother of Miw's step-father (who had tried to rape her years earlier and was accidentally killed by Miw). As their survival adventure continues, the trio develop strong feelings of friendship and loyalty towards each other with Neo, Miw, and Shin finding themselves in a love triangle.

Phon ([[Natthawut Jenmana]]) and Ter ([[Chanagun Arpornsutinan]]), the two hitmen working for Thana, are tasked to kill Neo and punish Vanika. Upon finding the pair, Ter tries to shoot Neo, but accidentally shoots and kills Vanika instead. Neo runs to the strip club where he works and is followed by Phon; earlier, Shin ([[Tawan Vihokratana]]), Thana's only son who happens to be a reluctant heir of his father's mob empire, comes to the same bar with his friends and meets Miw ([[Lapassalan Jiravechsoontornkul]]), a hostess at the bar. Shin's friends pay Miw to sleep with Shin (unbeknownst to them, Shin is gay, and doesn't actually sleep with Miw). Afterwards, Shin and Miw both return to the bar. In the bathroom, Shin runs into Neo, who is hiding from Phon, and who has apparently met Shin before (this is revealed later in the series). Phon discovers them, but is stopped by Miw, who accidentally shoots and kills Phon.  Neo, Miw, and Shin escape together and begin a harrowing journey that takes them from a seedy [[Bangkok]] motel, to the jungle and to the ocean as they try to evade those who are trying to find them.  \n\nPhon's death devastates not only Ter, but Phon's lover, Mae ([[Watchara Sukchum]]), a transgender female waitress who has long wanted Phon to leave the life of a gangster. Mae and Ter vow to take revenge on Phon's killers and follow the trio to the jungle, where they are hiding out with the assistance of Leo ([[Suphakorn Sriphothong]]), Neo's brother. The trio also seeks refuge in Miw's hometown and receives help from her ex-boyfriend, Luang ([[Pumipat Paiboon]]), while simultaneously dealing with Boss John, a mob leader in direct conflict with Thana, and the brother of Miw's step-father (who had tried to rape her years earlier and was accidentally killed by Miw). As their survival adventure continues, the trio develop strong feelings of friendship and loyalty towards each other with Neo, Miw, and Shin finding themselves in a love triangle. By the end of the series, all three must face the repercussions of their actions and the actions of others.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref>{{cite web |title=3 Will Be Free \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e14 [Official Trailer] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct9fPlMJSDw |website=youtube.com |publisher=[[GMMTV]] |accessdate=7 April 2020 |date=9 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=\"\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e14\u0e4c-\u0e40\u0e15-\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e2a\" \u0e1f\u0e32\u0e14\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1d\u0e35\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e36\u0e01\u0e14\u0e38\u0e40\u0e14\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14!!! |url=https://www.newsplus.co.th/171951 |website=newsplus.co.th |publisher=News Plus |accessdate=7 April 2020 |language=Thai |date=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n=== Main ===\n* [[Lapassalan Jiravechsoontornkul]] (Mild) as Miw\n* [[Way-ar Sangngern]] (Joss) as Neo\n* [[Tawan Vihokratana]] (Tay) as Shin\n\n=== Supporting ===\n* [[Watchara Sukchum]] (Jennie Panhan) as Mae\n* [[Chanagun Arpornsutinan]] (Gunsmile) as Tur\n* [[Natthawut Jenmana]] (Max) as Phon\n* [[Pumipat Paiboon]] (Prame) as Luang\n* [[Suphakorn Sriphothong]] (Podd) as Leo (Neo's brother)\n* [[Jirakit Kuariyakul]] (Toptap) as PP\n* [[Sivakorn Lertchoochot]] (Guy) as Touch\n* [[Harit Cheewagaroon]] (Sing) as James\n* [[Naphon Phromsuwan]] (Stop) as Boss John\n* [[Sarut Vijittranon]] (Big) as Sia Thana\n* [[Inthira Charoenpura]] as Vanika (Thana's Wife)\n* [[Sarocha Watitapun]] (Tao)\n* [[Penpak Sirikul]] as Miw's mother\n* [[Arisara Wongchalee]] (Fresh)\n* [[Krittanai Arsalprakit]] (Nammon) as Ken\n\n=== Guest role ===\n* [[Theepisit Mahaneeranon]] (Frame)\n* [[Pronpiphat Pattanasettanon]] (Plustor) as Nurse/Hitman\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Song Title\n!Romanized Title\n!Artist(s)\n!Ref\n|-\n| ''\u0e1d\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32''\n| ''Fahk Welah''\n| The White Hair Cut\n| <ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e1d\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32 Ost.3 Will Be Free \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e14 - The White Hair Cut |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-nDbr2fxY |website=youtube.com |publisher=[[GMMTV]] Records |accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award Ceremony\n!Category\n!Recipient(s)\n!Result\n!Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |2020\n| LINE TV Awards 2020\n| Best Kiss Scene\n| ''3 Will Be Free''\n|{{nom}}\n|<ref>{{cite web |title=LINE TV AWARDS 2020 \u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e25\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e35\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e04\u0e23 |url=https://www.beartai.com/lifestyle/404837 |website=beartai.com |publisher=Beartai |accessdate=7 April 2020 |language=Thai |date=15 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e38\u0e1b\u0e1c\u0e25\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e25 LINE TV AWARDS 2020 \u0e01\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1f-\u0e21\u0e34\u0e27, \u0e42\u0e2d\u0e21-\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e07\u0e42\u0e15, \u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e1f-\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e04\u0e27\u0e49\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e25\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e35\u0e4a\u0e14\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21\u0e04\u0e32\u0e14 |url=https://thestandard.co/line-tv-awards-2020/ |website=thestandard.co |publisher=The Standard |accessdate=7 April 2020 |language=Thai |date=20 February 2020}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.one31.net/shows/detail/289 One31 Show Details]\n* [https://tv.line.me/3willbefree 3 Will Be Free \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e14 - LINE TV]\n* {{IMDb title | id= tt11025732 | title= 3 Will Be Free}}\n* [http://www.gmm-tv.com GMMTV]\n\n[[Category:Television series by GMMTV]]\n[[Category:Thai LGBT-related television shows]]\n[[Category:2019 Thai television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2019 Thai television series endings]]\n[[Category:One31 television programmes]]\n[[Category:2010s LGBT-related drama television series]]\n[[Category:Thai action television series]]\n", "name_user": "Emperork", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Will_Be_Free"}

WNYZ's television signal was broadcast in [[NTSC|analog]] on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 6. It had transmitted a [[Digital broadcasting|digital]] signal over channel 6 with a [[virtual channel]] of 1.1.\n\nProgramming consisted of [[Silent film|Silent Films]] starring [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]]. The station aired this programming without commercials. Viewers could hear the audio of [[WWRU]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], which is likewise intended for the radio audience listening on 87.7FM.\n\nDuring most of its life while operating on channel 6, the station has been operated more as a radio station than a television station. WNYZ-LP broadcasts video, usually silent movies which are repeated throughout the day, for the likely reason to fulfill the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requirement that some sort of video be broadcast on the frequency because WNYZ-LP is licensed as a television facility.\n\n==History==\n\n===As W33BS Darien (Connecticut)===\nThe station's history originated in 1987. However, it first signed on in 1998 as W33BS Darien (Connecticut), then on UHF channel 33. The station was subsequently moved to VHF channel 6 in 2003. Rev. Dr. Carrie L. Thomas, the original owner, sold the station to Island Broadcasting Company after its transition to channel 6. After the transition, it was re-licensed to New York City, and dropped its religious format. It had, since moving to channel 6, effectively operated as an FM radio station. As is true in most other major U.S. cities, the New York City FM radio dial is significantly crowded. As such, the market had not added a station to the FM band since 1985, effectively necessitating the rather unconventional extension of the FM band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/091116/nerw.html|title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush|work=fybush.com|access-date=2009-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219002803/http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/091116/nerw.html|archive-date=2009-12-19|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===As WNYZ-LP New York===\nThe call sign changed to WNYZ in 2003 and moved to its current channel 6 making it the seventh station to be added to VHF dial next to WBQM-LP. The audio programming on WNYZ was originally [[Russian pop|Russian Top 40]] (Radio Vsyo - Russian for \"Radio Everything\"). Late in 2007, it was announced that the station would be changing the audio format to a Dance-intensive [[Rhythmic Top 40]] format as \"Pulse 87\". After several delays, the station flipped to the new format on February 11, 2008 at Midnight.\n\n===Brief digital operation===\nIn November 2008, Island Broadcasting installed an Axcera DT325B digital VHF transmitter with the Axciter/Bandwidth Enhancement Technology (BET) option, which permitted WNYZ-LP to simultaneously transmit a single 480i SD digital stream using [[virtual channel]] 1.1, along with the analog audio carrier on 87.75&nbsp;[[MHZ]]. This allowed the station to serve both its radio and television audiences. At first, WNYZ broadcast color bars, a legal ID, and a message telling viewers to listen to 87.7 FM. Then in 2009, the station broadcast '''The Jared Whitham Channel''' featuring Jared Whitham, a bespectacled local area comic/musician. The station operated in this hybrid analog/digital mode for just over one year.\n\n===Pulse 87===\n{{main article|Pulse 87}}\n\nFrom 2008 to October 30, 2009, WNYZ-LP operated as the [[dance music]] format [[Pulse 87]].\n\nJoel Salkowitz, the station's program director and a former employee of [[WQHT]] during their early days told the online website All Access about Pulse 87's musical direction: \"The station is a Top 40/Rhythmic, leaning away from Rock and Rap and more towards Club and Dance sounds in their place. Familiar, rhythmic hits mixed with the very best new music. This is a current/recurrent-based radio station.\" The station's format, which features more cutting-edge dance music, is unique in New York City as [[WKTU]] currently plays a more classic [[Rhythmic Adult Contemporary]] dance format. The format is also rarely seen in the US as only a handful of stations carry this format in America.\" \nIts transmitter is on top of the [[Citicorp Building]] in [[Long Island City, Queens]], and Pulse 87.7 IDs alluded to it as \"that big blue building in Queens\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-info.com/smf/index.php/topic,92386.0.html|title=RadioInfo - The Music Radio Trade Publication|work=RadioInfo}}</ref>\n\nThe station's audio signal reached the five boroughs, Nassau and Western Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Northeastern New Jersey. Before June 12, 2009, the signal of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[WPVI-TV]] Channel 6 in Philadelphia made WNYZ-LP unavailable in most of central and parts of Northern New Jersey; [[WRGB]] Channel 6 in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] also had similar effects in parts of the [[Hudson Valley]] in New York. After the transition to digital TV on June 12, 2009, reception of WNYZ improved in Central New Jersey and the Hudson Valley. However, it continued to impact reception of WPVI and WRGB's digital signals in these areas because they stayed on the channel 6 frequency.\n\nOn March 10, 2008, the station made a deal with [[Arbitron]] that would allow the station to be rated in its PPMs, but because it is a television station, WNYZ could not be rated in the official Arbitron radio books for the New York Metropolitan market.  On March 31, 2009 it was announced that, according to a Mega Media press release, \"due to the recent policy change at Arbitron, effective April 1, 2009 Pulse 87 will now be included and measured under the standard PPM Radio Ratings report effective April 2009 survey period.\"  Pulse 87 was later added to the Rhythmic and Dance panels at [[Mediabase]], while [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]/[[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|Nielsen BDS]] had the station monitored as a reporter on the [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]] panel.\n\nPulse 87 has since been relaunched as an Internet station at http://www.pulse87ny.com/ ;the station is operated by Salkowitz, who purchased the Pulse 87 automation equipment and the intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maltzauctions.com/auction_detail.php?id=125701|title=DAVID R.

This came to a head on August 12, 2009 when Mega Media filed for bankruptcy, reporting $3.5 million in liabilities against assets of just $180,000. Mega says it hopes to continue operating Pulse while it restructures under Chapter 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/090817/nerw.html|title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush|work=fybush.com|access-date=2009-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820041516/http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/090817/nerw.html|archive-date=2009-08-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn October 30, 2009, the current lease between Mega Media Group and Island Broadcasting ended because Island Broadcasting did not receive the $500,000 it was owed according to the Stipulation and Order regarding the Time Brokerage Agreement. Island Broadcasting was under no obligation to continue allowing Pulse 87 to use their signal without payment for the lease. However, there was a tentative deal in place for a new company to buy out Mega Media and pay off the debt owed to Island Broadcasting. The new company planned to continue the dance format but nothing ever came to fruition. The WNYZ-LP license was offered for sale by Island Broadcasting for $15 million. Pulse 87 went off the air on October 30, 2009 at 5:00 PM.\n\n===Party 105 era===\nA new format for WNYZ was announced on November 2, 2009, at 6 am. JVC Broadcasting's [[WPTY]] \"Party 105\" took over the 87.7 frequency. The same programming airing on WPTY, Party 105, in Suffolk County was heard on 87.7, but the music was not the same that the Pulse 87 audience had grown accustomed to.  It was a hip-hop based format, with some dance music, but mostly nostalgic 1980s and 1990s rhythmic hits and current R&B and hip-hop.  The studios and programming originated on Long Island, while WNYZ served as a simulcast to WPTY. Pulse 87's audience, which had grown to over 1 million listeners per week before they went off the air, eventually stopped tuning into this new format, and the inability of many potential listeners in the New York area to tune into the 87.7 signal made the simulcast unprofitable for JVC Broadcasting. On January 21, 2010, WPTY stopped simulcasting on WNYZ-LP. Island Broadcasting let the signal go silent for one day and then began playing dance music for two hours the next morning. Due to a non-compete agreement, Island Broadcasting was not allowed to broadcast the dance music. Later in the day, a filler format of Jazz and Blues standards with station identification aired until January 27, 2010.\n\n===Indie Darkroom and Russian Radio===\nThe following day, the station later implemented an [[independent music]] format on its audio channel known as the '''Indie Darkroom'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/note.php?note_id=279680326949|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|access-date=2010-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924153115/http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/note.php?note_id=279680326949#/note.php?note_id=279680326949|archive-date=2008-09-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn March 21, 2010, the station announced that '''Indie Darkroom''' would soon be relegated to the overnight hours on weekends. During other hours of Saturdays and Sundays, the station becomes CaribStar 87.7FM (Sat/Sun 6am-midnight). Although a number of stations offer brokered programming for New York's estimated 1.5 million English/French Caribbean nationals (including a number of [[Pirate radio|pirate]] stations in Bronx and Brooklyn), CaribStar represents the most significant effort to develop programing for this consumer market.\n\nOn March 31, 2010, the station added Russian language programming ([http://www.danuradio.com \"Danu Radio\"], a successor of \"Radio Vsyo\"). \"Danu Radio\" airs on weekdays 5am-8pm, and Fridays until 3am.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danuradio.com/shows|title=Russian Radio New York 105.1 FM HD2 - Russkoe Radio - Russian Music|work=Danu Radio|access-date=2013-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122091335/http://www.danuradio.com/shows|archive-date=2013-01-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 2010, the station began airing Hindi-language programming on Sunday mornings.\n\nOn July 25, 2010, the station began airing Korean programing simulcasted from [[WWRU]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]].\n\n==Accidental license cancellation==\nOn June 29, 2011, the FCC canceled the license of WNYZ-LP and deleted its call sign; the station had filed an extension for its Construction Permit (CP) for its digital facilities, after the original CP had expired. According to FCC regulations, a CP extension could only be filed only if the current CP is still valid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=26580|title=FCC letter of cancellation of WNYZ-LP, June 29, 2011.|work=fcc.gov|access-date=2011-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026074235/http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=26580|archive-date=2012-10-26|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Scott Fybush, the cancellation was eventually undone due to the cancellation being a mistake on the FCC's part; the FCC meant to only deny the digital CP extension, not revoke the analog one as they had mistakenly done. The station's license was renewed in 2015 for an 8-year term.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{TVQ|WNYZ-LP}}\n*[http://indiedarkroom.com/idr/ Official IndieDarkroom Radio]\n*[http://blog.indiedarkroom.com/ Official IndieDarkroom Magazine]\n\n{{NYC TV}}\n{{New York Radio}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wnyz-Lp}}\n[[Category:Television stations in New York City|NYZ-LP]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in New York City|NYZ-LP]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1998]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2011]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox broadcast \n| call_letters             = WNYZ-LP\n| city                     = \n| station_logo             = \n| station_slogan           = \n| station_branding         = KRB NY Radio Korea\n| analog                   = 6 ([[Very high frequency|VHF]])\n| digital                  = 49 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]) (application)\n| other_chs                = 87.75 WNYZ-LP\n| affiliations             =[[Independent station|Independent]]/audio\n| founded                  = July 2, 1987\n| location                 = [[New York City|New York, New York]]\n| country                  = [[United States]]\n| callsign_meaning         = '''W''' '''N'''ew '''Y'''ork '''Z'''(C)ity\n| former_callsigns         = W33BS (1998-2003)\n| former_channel_numbers   = 33 (1998-2003)\n| owner                    = K Media, LLC|\n| licensee                 = Sound of Long Island, Inc.|\n| former_affiliations      = [[Pulse 87]] (2008-2009)<br>[[WPTY]] (2009-2010)\n| effective_radiated_power = 3.0 [[Kilowatt|kW]](Analog)<br>.3 [[kilowatt|kW]](Digital)|\n| HAAT                     = 200 meters\n| class                    = \n| facility_id              = 56043\n| coordinates              = {{Coord|40|44|50.30|N|73|56|36.40|W|type:landmark_region:US-NY_source:FCC|display=inline,title}}\n| homepage                 = http://www.nyradiokorea.com\n}}\n\n'''WNYZ-LP''' is a [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power]] [[television station]] licensed to [[New York City]], owned by K Media, LLC. WNYZ's television signal was broadcast in [[NTSC|analog]] on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 6. It had transmitted a [[Digital broadcasting|digital]] signal over channel 6 with a [[virtual channel]] of 1.1.\n\nProgramming consisted of [[Silent film|Silent Films]] starring [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]]. The station aired this programming without commercials. Viewers could hear the audio of [[WWRU]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], which is likewise intended for the radio audience listening on 87.7FM.\n\nDuring most of its life while operating on channel 6, the station has been operated more as a radio station than a television station. WNYZ-LP broadcasts video, usually silent movies which are repeated throughout the day, for the likely reason to fulfill the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requirement that some sort of video be broadcast on the frequency because WNYZ-LP is licensed as a television facility.\n\n==History==\n\n===As W33BS Darien (Connecticut)===\nThe station's history originated in 1987. However, it first signed on in 1998 as W33BS Darien (Connecticut), then on UHF channel 33. The station was subsequently moved to VHF channel 6 in 2003. Rev. Dr. Carrie L. Thomas, the original owner, sold the station to Island Broadcasting Company after its transition to channel 6. After the transition, it was re-licensed to New York City, and dropped its religious format. It had, since moving to channel 6, effectively operated as an FM radio station. As is true in most other major U.S. cities, the New York City FM radio dial is significantly crowded. As such, the market had not added a station to the FM band since 1985, effectively necessitating the rather unconventional extension of the FM band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/091116/nerw.html|title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush|work=fybush.com|access-date=2009-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219002803/http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/091116/nerw.html|archive-date=2009-12-19|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===As WNYZ-LP New York===\nThe call sign changed to WNYZ in 2003 and moved to its current channel 6 making it the seventh station to be added to VHF dial next to WBQM-LP. The audio programming on WNYZ was originally [[Russian pop|Russian Top 40]] (Radio Vsyo - Russian for \"Radio Everything\"). Late in 2007, it was announced that the station would be changing the audio format to a Dance-intensive [[Rhythmic Top 40]] format as \"Pulse 87\". After several delays, the station flipped to the new format on February 11, 2008 at Midnight.\n\n===Brief digital operation===\nIn November 2008, Island Broadcasting installed an Axcera DT325B digital VHF transmitter with the Axciter/Bandwidth Enhancement Technology (BET) option, which permitted WNYZ-LP to simultaneously transmit a single 480i SD digital stream using [[virtual channel]] 1.1, along with the analog audio carrier on 87.75&nbsp;[[MHZ]]. This allowed the station to serve both its radio and television audiences. At first, WNYZ broadcast color bars, a legal ID, and a message telling viewers to listen to 87.7 FM. Then in 2009, the station broadcast '''The Jared Whitham Channel''' featuring Jared Whitham, a bespectacled local area comic/musician. The station operated in this hybrid analog/digital mode for just over one year.\n\n===Pulse 87===\n{{main article|Pulse 87}}\n\nFrom 2008 to October 30, 2009, WNYZ-LP operated as the [[dance music]] format [[Pulse 87]].\n\nJoel Salkowitz, the station's program director and a former employee of [[WQHT]] during their early days told the online website All Access about Pulse 87's musical direction: \"The station is a Top 40/Rhythmic, leaning away from Rock and Rap and more towards Club and Dance sounds in their place. Familiar, rhythmic hits mixed with the very best new music. This is a current/recurrent-based radio station.\" The station's format, which features more cutting-edge dance music, is unique in New York City as [[WKTU]] currently plays a more classic [[Rhythmic Adult Contemporary]] dance format. The format is also rarely seen in the US as only a handful of stations carry this format in America.\" \nIts transmitter is on top of the [[Citicorp Building]] in [[Long Island City, Queens]], and Pulse 87.7 IDs alluded to it as \"that big blue building in Queens\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-info.com/smf/index.php/topic,92386.0.html|title=RadioInfo - The Music Radio Trade Publication|work=RadioInfo}}</ref>\n\nThe station's audio signal reached the five boroughs, Nassau and Western Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Northeastern New Jersey. Before June 12, 2009, the signal of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[WPVI-TV]] Channel 6 in Philadelphia made WNYZ-LP unavailable in most of central and parts of Northern New Jersey; [[WRGB]] Channel 6 in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] also had similar effects in parts of the [[Hudson Valley]] in New York. After the transition to digital TV on June 12, 2009, reception of WNYZ improved in Central New Jersey and the Hudson Valley. However, it continued to impact reception of WPVI and WRGB's digital signals in these areas because they stayed on the channel 6 frequency.\n\nOn March 10, 2008, the station made a deal with [[Arbitron]] that would allow the station to be rated in its PPMs, but because it is a television station, WNYZ could not be rated in the official Arbitron radio books for the New York Metropolitan market.  On March 31, 2009 it was announced that, according to a Mega Media press release, \"due to the recent policy change at Arbitron, effective April 1, 2009 Pulse 87 will now be included and measured under the standard PPM Radio Ratings report effective April 2009 survey period.\"  Pulse 87 was later added to the Rhythmic and Dance panels at [[Mediabase]], while [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]/[[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|Nielsen BDS]] had the station monitored as a reporter on the [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]] panel.\n\nPulse 87 has since been relaunched as an Internet station at http://www.pulse87ny.com/ ;the station is operated by Salkowitz, who purchased the Pulse 87 automation equipment and the intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maltzauctions.com/auction_detail.php?id=125701|title=DAVID R.

This came to a head on August 12, 2009 when Mega Media filed for bankruptcy, reporting $3.5 million in liabilities against assets of just $180,000. Mega says it hopes to continue operating Pulse while it restructures under Chapter 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/090817/nerw.html|title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush|work=fybush.com|access-date=2009-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820041516/http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2009/090817/nerw.html|archive-date=2009-08-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn October 30, 2009, the current lease between Mega Media Group and Island Broadcasting ended because Island Broadcasting did not receive the $500,000 it was owed according to the Stipulation and Order regarding the Time Brokerage Agreement. Island Broadcasting was under no obligation to continue allowing Pulse 87 to use their signal without payment for the lease. However, there was a tentative deal in place for a new company to buy out Mega Media and pay off the debt owed to Island Broadcasting. The new company planned to continue the dance format but nothing ever came to fruition. The WNYZ-LP license was offered for sale by Island Broadcasting for $15 million. Pulse 87 went off the air on October 30, 2009 at 5:00 PM.\n\n===Party 105 era===\nA new format for WNYZ was announced on November 2, 2009, at 6 am. JVC Broadcasting's [[WPTY]] \"Party 105\" took over the 87.7 frequency. The same programming airing on WPTY, Party 105, in Suffolk County was heard on 87.7, but the music was not the same that the Pulse 87 audience had grown accustomed to.  It was a hip-hop based format, with some dance music, but mostly nostalgic 1980s and 1990s rhythmic hits and current R&B and hip-hop.  The studios and programming originated on Long Island, while WNYZ served as a simulcast to WPTY. Pulse 87's audience, which had grown to over 1 million listeners per week before they went off the air, eventually stopped tuning into this new format, and the inability of many potential listeners in the New York area to tune into the 87.7 signal made the simulcast unprofitable for JVC Broadcasting. On January 21, 2010, WPTY stopped simulcasting on WNYZ-LP. Island Broadcasting let the signal go silent for one day and then began playing dance music for two hours the next morning. Due to a non-compete agreement, Island Broadcasting was not allowed to broadcast the dance music. Later in the day, a filler format of Jazz and Blues standards with station identification aired until January 27, 2010.\n\n===Indie Darkroom and Russian Radio===\nThe following day, the station later implemented an [[independent music]] format on its audio channel known as the '''Indie Darkroom'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/note.php?note_id=279680326949|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|access-date=2010-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924153115/http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/note.php?note_id=279680326949#/note.php?note_id=279680326949|archive-date=2008-09-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn March 21, 2010, the station announced that '''Indie Darkroom''' would soon be relegated to the overnight hours on weekends.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]]. Pang was once a struggling student from Class VIII who is soon to be [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the Gifted Program through the school's Placement Exam. Through the Gifted Program, he discovers he has the power of [[Brainwashing|mind control]], in which he can compel someone to do whatever he wishes through physical contact with the subject and feeling their [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]. He becomes the Gifted Program's Head Student when Director Chueamanee removed Wave from the position after the class' midterm exams. He is close with fellow Gifted students Namtaan and Ohm.\n* [[Wachirawit Ruangwiwat]] as Wasuthorn \"Wave\" Worachotmethee\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Through the Program, Wave discovers his power of technopathy, the ability to control and manipulate electronic machines through contact, a gift associated with his advanced skills in [[mathematics]], [[Computer|computers]], and [[Computer programming|programming]]. He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms. He is apparently rude and arrogant, and hates when other students seem to overshadow him. His over-competitiveness was triggered by his bad relationship with his former teacher and crush Ms. Nara, who stole his thesis and framed him of [[plagiarism]].\n* Apichaya Thongkham as Chayanit \"Namtaan\" Prachkarit\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Namtaan discovers her power of [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], the ability to see or hear associated events on an object through contact, a gift associated on her character of being nosy. Namtaan has [[Essential hypertension|primary hypertension]] which limits her in using her psychometry in its full extent. She is close to Pang and Ohm.\n* Harit Cheewagaroon as Wichai \"Ohm\" Sai-Ngern\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Ohm has a form of [[psychokinesis]] which enables him to make objects (including humans) disappear and bringing them back again by will, which soon evolves to include [[invisibility]] and [[teleportation]] (of himself and other humans). This power is associated with his character of being forgetful and losing things most of the time. When using his power, Ohm experiences [[Nosebleed|nosebleeds]] which indicate that his power has manifested. He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club. Claire has a form of [[synesthesia]] which enables him to see a person's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and associate the color of the aura with a certain kind of emotion (e.g. blue for [[sadness]], red for [[anger]], pink for [[love]], etc). Her power is associated with her passion for [[acting]]. She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Korn has the ability to remain [[Wakefulness|awake]] for days without getting sleepy. He has a crush on his childhood friend Claire, until Claire rejected his love. His passion for [[photography]] leads him to intimately associating with Koi who, unbeknowst to him, is acting upon orders from Mrs. Ladda to gather information about the Gifted Program.\n* Napasorn Weerayuttvilai as Patchamon \"Mon\" Pitiwongkorn\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Martial Arts Club. Mon possesses superhuman strength with enhanced agility, dexterity and coordination that is useful for combat. Her potential is associated with her passion for sports. However, her body produces [[pheromones]] that are excreted through her sweat and tears. Once exposed to it, a person would turn insane, violent and, worse, murderous. She is Art's love interest.\n* Chatchawit Techarukpong as Porama \"Pom\" Wongrattana\n: The class adviser of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Mr. Pom belongs to Ritdha High School's Gifted Program Batch 3, and decided to work as a teacher in Ritdha after graduating. He has the power of memory manipulation which enables him to erase [[Memory|memories]], first, by putting the subject in [[hypnosis]] using sound with a regular tempo (through a [[metronome]]) and snapping his fingers, and second, by touching the subject's head while it is in hypnotic state. He is also able to both erase and restore his own memories. His power is associated with his ability to memorize many details. As a teacher, his power is taken into advantage by Director Chueamanee in erasing the memories of students who are involved in incidents related to the Gifted Program.\n* Chayapol Jutamat as Chanuj \"Jack\" Saeliu, and Chayakorn Jutamat as Chanet \"Jo\" Saeliu\n: The [[Twin|identical twin]] students of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Jack and Jo have the ability to respond to stimuli in sync.\n* [[Katreeya English]] as  Ladda Ngamkul\n: Head administrator of Ritdha High School. Mrs. Ladda is the school disciplinarian  and is primarily viewed as a terrible person by the students due to her strict and serious enforcement of punishments.\n* Wanchana Sawasdee as Supot Chueamanee\n: The Director of Ritdha High School and master of the Gifted Program; the drama's main [[antagonist]]. Director Chueamanee designed the Gifted Program to search for and train young people who had evolved to develop supernatural or superhuman abilities. He strongly believes in a society where the strong leads the weaker or inferior ones, as reflected in the school's student hierarchy system, his abusive treatment of low-class students, and his bias towards the Gifted. He has the same, but stronger and evolved, mind control power as Pang. Since he and Pang have the same power, they cannot use their powers against each other.\n\n=== Supporting ===\n{{colbegin}}\n* Wanwimol Jaenasavamethee as  Rawin \"Koi\" Boonrak\n: A Class III student and videographer of the Journalism Club.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]].

He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms. He is apparently rude and arrogant, and hates when other students seem to overshadow him. His over-competitiveness was triggered by his bad relationship with his former teacher and crush Ms. Nara, who stole his thesis and framed him of [[plagiarism]].\n* Apichaya Thongkham as Chayanit \"Namtaan\" Prachkarit\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club. Claire has a form of [[synesthesia]] which enables him to see a person's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and associate the color of the aura with a certain kind of emotion (e.g. blue for [[sadness]], red for [[anger]], pink for [[love]], etc). Her power is associated with her passion for [[acting]]. She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

Mr. Pom belongs to Ritdha High School's Gifted Program Batch 3, and decided to work as a teacher in Ritdha after graduating. He has the power of memory manipulation which enables him to erase [[Memory|memories]], first, by putting the subject in [[hypnosis]] using sound with a regular tempo (through a [[metronome]]) and snapping his fingers, and second, by touching the subject's head while it is in hypnotic state. He is also able to both erase and restore his own memories. His power is associated with his ability to memorize many details. As a teacher, his power is taken into advantage by Director Chueamanee in erasing the memories of students who are involved in incidents related to the Gifted Program.\n* Chayapol Jutamat as Chanuj \"Jack\" Saeliu, and Chayakorn Jutamat as Chanet \"Jo\" Saeliu\n: The [[Twin|identical twin]] students of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].\n\nTo do this, a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the ''error'' signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is ''feedback control'', which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a \"final control element\", such as a [[control valve]].<ref>Bennett, Stuart (1992).

In it the [[transfer function]], also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the [[differential equation]]s describing the system.\n\nControl theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.\n\nBy [[World War II]], control theory was becoming an important area of research. [[Irmgard Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems, and applied the [[bang\u2013bang control|bang-bang principle]] to the development of [[autopilot|automatic flight control equipment]] for aircraft.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flugge-Lotz|first1=Irmgard|last2=Titus|first2=Harold A.|title=Optimum and Quasi-Optimum Control of Third and Fourth-Order Systems|journal=Stanford University Technical Report|date=October 1962|issue=134|pages=8\u201312|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/621137.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hallion|first1=Richard P.|editor1-last=Sicherman|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=Carol Hurd|editor3-last=Kantrov|editor3-first=Ilene|editor4-last=Walker|editor4-first=Harriette|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9781849722704|pages=[https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich/page/241 241\u2013242]}}</ref> Other areas of application for discontinuous controls included [[fire-control system]]s, [[guidance system]]s and [[electronics]].\n\nSometimes, mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.\n\nThe [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics and artificial intelligence. Here, one might say that the goal is to find an [[internal model (motor control)|internal model]] that obeys the [[Good regulator|good regulator theorem]]. So, for example, in economics, the more accurately a (stock or commodities) trading model represents the actions of the market, the more easily it can control that market (and extract \"useful work\" (profits) from it). In AI, an example might be a chatbot modelling the discourse state of humans: the more accurately it can model the human state (e.g. on a telephone voice-support hotline), the better it can manipulate the human (e.g. into performing the corrective actions to resolve the problem that caused the phone call to the help-line).  These last two examples take the narrow historical interpretation of control theory as a set of differential equations modeling and regulating kinetic motion, and broaden it into a vast generalization of a [[controller (control theory)|regulator]] interacting with a [[plant (control theory)|plant]].\n\n==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==\n[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|A [[block diagram]] of a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] using a [[feedback loop]] to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value, and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error.]]\n[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]\nFundamentally, there are two types of control loops: open loop control and closed loop (feedback) control.\n\nIn open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \"process output\" (or \"controlled process variable\" - PV). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.\n\nIn closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the \"Reference input\" or  \"set point\". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.<ref>\"Feedback and control systems\" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967</ref>\n\nThe definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is \"a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.\" <ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970\n|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\nLikewise; \"A ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control.\"<ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1969|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Other examples===\nAn example of a control system is a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car, and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine delivers.\n\nA primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of non-flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an ''[[open-loop controller]]'' because there is no [[feedback]]; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.\n\nIn a ''[[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control system]]'', data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed.  The central idea of these control systems is the ''feedback loop'', the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.\n\n==Classical control theory==\n{{main|Classical control theory}}\n\nTo overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], control theory introduces [[feedback]].\nA [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|outputs]] of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is \"fed back\" as input to the process, closing the loop.\n\nClosed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:\n* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)\n* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact\n* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized\n* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations\n* improved reference tracking performance\n\nIn some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.\n\nA common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].\n\n==Closed-loop transfer function==\n{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}\nThe output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to a comparison with the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.\n\nThis is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).\n\n[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]\n\nIf we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:\n\n: <math>Y(s) = P(s) U(s)</math>\n: <math>U(s) = C(s) E(s)</math>\n: <math>E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).</math>\n\nSolving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives\n\n: <math>Y(s) = \\left( \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)F(s)} \\right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).</math>\n\nThe expression <math>H(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}</math> is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If <math>|P(s)C(s)| \\gg 1</math>, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if <math>|F(s)| \\approx 1</math>, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.\n\n==PID feedback control==\n{{main |PID Controller}}\n[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or \"set point\", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]\nA '''proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller ''' ('''PID controller''') is a  [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] control technique widely  used in control systems.\n\nA PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' <math>e(t)</math> as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.\n\nThe theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.\nThe [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design.\n\nIf ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and <math>e(t)=r(t)- y(t)</math> is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form\n\n:<math>u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \\int e(\\tau)\\text{d}\\tau + K_D \\frac{\\text{d}e(t)}{\\text{d}t}.</math>\n\nThe desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters <math> K_P</math>, <math> K_I</math> and <math> K_D</math>, often iteratively by \"tuning\" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.\n\nApplying [[Laplace transform|Laplace transformation]] results in the transformed PID controller equation\n\n:<math>u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \\frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)</math>\n:<math>u(s) =  \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right) e(s)</math>\n\nwith the PID controller transfer function\n:<math>C(s) = \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right).</math>\n\nAs an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system <math>H(s)</math>, consider a 1st order plant given by\n\n:<math>P(s) = \\frac{A}{1 + sT_P}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> and <math>T_P</math> are some constants. The plant output is fed back through\n\n:<math>F(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + sT_F}</math>\n\nwhere <math>T_F</math> is also a constant. Now if we set <math>K_P=K\\left(1+\\frac{T_D}{T_I}\\right)</math>, <math>K_D=KT_D</math>, and <math>K_I=\\frac{K}{T_I}</math>, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as\n\n:<math>C(s) =  K \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{sT_I}\\right)(1 + sT_D)</math>\n\nPlugging <math>P(s)</math>, <math>F(s)</math>, and <math>C(s)</math> into the closed-loop transfer function <math>H(s)</math>, we find that by setting\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{1}{A},   T_I = T_F,   T_D = T_P</math>\n\n<math>H(s) = 1</math>. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.\n\nHowever, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=K.H. |last2=Chong |first2=G.C.Y. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |date=2005 |title=PID control system analysis, design, and technology |journal=IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=559\u2013576|doi=10.1109/TCST.2005.847331 }}</ref> due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a [[Lead\u2013lag compensator|phase-lead compensator]] type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.\n\n==Linear and nonlinear control theory==\nThe field of control theory can be divided into two branches:\n* ''[[Linear control theory]]'' \u2013 This applies to systems made of devices which obey the [[superposition principle]], which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.  They are governed by [[linear equation|linear]] [[differential equation]]s.  A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called ''[[linear time invariant]]'' (LTI) systems.   These systems are amenable to powerful [[frequency domain]] mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the [[Laplace transform]], [[Fourier transform]], [[Z transform]], [[Bode plot]], [[root locus]], and [[Nyquist stability criterion]].  These lead to a description of the system using terms like [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[frequency response]], [[eigenvalue]]s, [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], [[zeros and poles]], which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. \n* ''[[Nonlinear control theory]]'' \u2013 This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear.  These systems are often governed by [[nonlinear differential equation]]s.  The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.  These include [[limit cycle]] theory, [[Poincar\u00e9 map]]s, [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov stability theorem]], and [[describing function]]s.  Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using [[numerical method]]s on computers, for example by [[simulation|simulating]] their operation using a [[simulation language]].  If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be [[linearization|linearized]] by approximating them by a linear system using [[perturbation theory]], and linear techniques can be used.<ref>[http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/simulink/slref/trim.html trim point]</ref>\n\n==Analysis techniques - frequency domain and time domain==\nMathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories:\n* ''[[Frequency domain]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s, the mathematical [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of [[frequency]].  The input signal and the system's [[transfer function]] are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a [[transform (mathematics)|transform]] such as the [[Fourier transform]], [[Laplace transform]], or [[Z transform]].  The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the ''[[differential equation]]s'' that represent the system are replaced by ''[[algebraic equation]]s'' in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve.  However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.\n* ''[[Time-domain state space representation]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s are represented as functions of time.  With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more [[differential equation]]s.  Since frequency domain techniques are limited to [[linear function|linear]] systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems.   Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as [[simulation language]]s have made their analysis routine.\nIn contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the \"time-domain approach\") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. \"State space\" refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.<ref>{{cite book|title=State space & linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=978-0-07-070096-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Terrell, William|title=Some fundamental control theory I: Controllability, observability, and duality \u2014AND\u2014 Some fundamental control Theory II: Feedback linearization of single input nonlinear systems|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=106|issue=9|year=1999|pages=705\u2013719 and 812\u2013828|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/some-fundamental-control-theory-i-controllability-observability-and-duality-and-some-fundamental|doi=10.2307/2589614|jstor=2589614}}</ref>\n\n==System interfacing - SISO & MIMO==\nControl systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs.\n* [[Single-input single-output system|Single-input single-output]] (SISO) \u2013 This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal.  Examples are the cruise control example above, or an [[audio system]], in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker. \n* [[MIMO|Multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) \u2013 These are found in more complicated systems.  For example, modern large [[telescope]]s such as the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] and [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an [[actuator]].  The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO [[active optics]] control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the [[wavefront]] due to turbulence in the atmosphere.  Complicated systems such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and human [[cell (biology)|cells]] are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems.\n\n==Topics in control theory==\n\n===Stability===\n\nThe ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria.\n*A [[linear system]] is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input.\n*Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability.\n\nFor simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time '''linear systems'''.\n\nMathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.  Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside\n* in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] for continuous time, when the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function.\n* inside the [[unit circle]] for discrete time, when the [[Z-transform]] is used.\nThe difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions. The continuous Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] where the <math>x</math> axis is the real axis and the discrete Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]] where the <math>\\rho</math> axis is the real axis.\n\nWhen the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.\n\nIf a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole in <math>z = 0.5</math> (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.\n\nHowever, if the impulse response was\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform is\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole at <math>z = 1.5</math> and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.\n\nNumerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.\n\nMechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use [[Ship stability#Stabilizer fins|antiroll fins]] that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.\n\n===Controllability and observability===\n{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}\n\n[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed ''stabilizable''. Observability instead is related to the possibility of ''observing'', through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.\n\nFrom a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every \"bad\" state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.\n\nSolutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.\n\n===Control specification===\nSeveral different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or aircraft cruise control).\n\nA control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have <math>Re[\\lambda] < -\\overline{\\lambda}</math>, where <math>\\overline{\\lambda}</math> is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that <math>Re[\\lambda]<0</math>.\n\nAnother typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.\n\nOther \"classical\" control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).\n\nModern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE, ISA, CQI).\n\n===Model identification and robustness===\nA control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.\n\n;System identification\n{{details|System identification}}\nThe process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass\u2013spring\u2013damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that <math> m \\ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \\Beta \\dot{x}(t)</math>. Even assuming that a \"complete\" model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called \"nominal parameters\") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.\n\nSome advanced control techniques include an \"on-line\" identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated (\"identified\") while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.\n\n;Analysis\nAnalysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.\n\n;Constraints\nA particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.\n\n==System classifications==\n\n===Linear systems control===\n{{Main|State space (controls)}}\nFor MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.\n\n===Nonlinear systems control===\n{{Main|Nonlinear control}}\nProcesses in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]], [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.  Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.<ref name=Shi_Gu_et_al>{{cite journal |author1 = Gu Shi|year = 2015 |title = Controllability of structural brain networks (Article Number 8414) |journal = Nature Communications |volume = 6 |quote = Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure.  |lay-url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9414|issue = 6 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1406.5197|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8414G |pmid = 26423222 |pmc = 4600713 |page = 8414}}</ref>\n\n===Decentralized systems control===\n{{Main|Distributed control system}}\nWhen the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.\n\n===Deterministic and stochastic systems control===\n{{Main|Stochastic control}}\n\nA stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks.\n\n==Main control strategies==\nEvery control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.\n\n;List of the main control techniques\n\n*[[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.\n*A [[hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].\n*[[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]],<ref>{{cite journal | title=A novel fuzzy framework for nonlinear system control| journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems | year=2010 | last=Liu |first1=Jie |author2=Wilson Wang |author3=Farid Golnaraghi |author4=Eric Kubica | volume=161 | issue=21 | pages=2746\u20132759 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2010.04.009}}</ref> [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] or a combination of these methods, such as [[neuro-fuzzy]] algorithms, to control a [[dynamic system]].\n*[[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain \"cost index\": for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the \"optimal control\" structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].\n*[[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=Paul|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Robustness of Adaptation in Controlled Self-Adjusting Chaotic Systems |journal=Fluctuation and Noise Letters |volume=02|issue=4|pages=L285\u2013L292|date=2002|doi=10.1142/S0219477502000919}}</ref> The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.

The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].\n\nTo do this, a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the ''error'' signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is ''feedback control'', which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a \"final control element\", such as a [[control valve]].<ref>Bennett, Stuart (1992).

In it the [[transfer function]], also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the [[differential equation]]s describing the system.\n\nControl theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.\n\nBy [[World War II]], control theory was becoming an important area of research. [[Irmgard Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems, and applied the [[bang\u2013bang control|bang-bang principle]] to the development of [[autopilot|automatic flight control equipment]] for aircraft.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flugge-Lotz|first1=Irmgard|last2=Titus|first2=Harold A.|title=Optimum and Quasi-Optimum Control of Third and Fourth-Order Systems|journal=Stanford University Technical Report|date=October 1962|issue=134|pages=8\u201312|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/621137.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hallion|first1=Richard P.|editor1-last=Sicherman|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=Carol Hurd|editor3-last=Kantrov|editor3-first=Ilene|editor4-last=Walker|editor4-first=Harriette|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9781849722704|pages=[https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich/page/241 241\u2013242]}}</ref> Other areas of application for discontinuous controls included [[fire-control system]]s, [[guidance system]]s and [[electronics]].\n\nSometimes, mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.\n\nThe [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics and artificial intelligence. Here, one might say that the goal is to find an [[internal model (motor control)|internal model]] that obeys the [[Good regulator|good regulator theorem]]. So, for example, in economics, the more accurately a (stock or commodities) trading model represents the actions of the market, the more easily it can control that market (and extract \"useful work\" (profits) from it). In AI, an example might be a chatbot modelling the discourse state of humans: the more accurately it can model the human state (e.g. on a telephone voice-support hotline), the better it can manipulate the human (e.g. into performing the corrective actions to resolve the problem that caused the phone call to the help-line).  These last two examples take the narrow historical interpretation of control theory as a set of differential equations modeling and regulating kinetic motion, and broaden it into a vast generalization of a [[controller (control theory)|regulator]] interacting with a [[plant (control theory)|plant]].\n\n==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==\n[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|A [[block diagram]] of a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] using a [[feedback loop]] to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value, and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error.]]\n[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]\nFundamentally, there are two types of control loops: open loop control and closed loop (feedback) control.\n\nIn open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \"process output\" (or \"controlled process variable\" - PV). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.\n\nIn closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the \"Reference input\" or  \"set point\". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.<ref>\"Feedback and control systems\" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967</ref>\n\nThe definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is \"a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.\" <ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970\n|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\nLikewise; \"A ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control.\"<ref>{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1969|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Other examples===\nAn example of a control system is a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car, and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine delivers.\n\nA primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of non-flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an ''[[open-loop controller]]'' because there is no [[feedback]]; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.\n\nIn a ''[[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control system]]'', data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed.  The central idea of these control systems is the ''feedback loop'', the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.\n\n==Classical control theory==\n{{main|Classical control theory}}\n\nTo overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], control theory introduces [[feedback]].\nA [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|outputs]] of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is \"fed back\" as input to the process, closing the loop.\n\nClosed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:\n* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)\n* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact\n* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized\n* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations\n* improved reference tracking performance\n\nIn some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.\n\nA common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].\n\n==Closed-loop transfer function==\n{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}\nThe output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to a comparison with the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.\n\nThis is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).\n\n[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]\n\nIf we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:\n\n: <math>Y(s) = P(s) U(s)</math>\n: <math>U(s) = C(s) E(s)</math>\n: <math>E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).</math>\n\nSolving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives\n\n: <math>Y(s) = \\left( \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)F(s)} \\right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).</math>\n\nThe expression <math>H(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}</math> is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If <math>|P(s)C(s)| \\gg 1</math>, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if <math>|F(s)| \\approx 1</math>, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.\n\n==PID feedback control==\n{{main |PID Controller}}\n[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or \"set point\", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]\nA '''proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller ''' ('''PID controller''') is a  [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] control technique widely  used in control systems.\n\nA PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' <math>e(t)</math> as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.\n\nThe theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.\nThe [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design.\n\nIf ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and <math>e(t)=r(t)- y(t)</math> is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form\n\n:<math>u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \\int e(\\tau)\\text{d}\\tau + K_D \\frac{\\text{d}e(t)}{\\text{d}t}.</math>\n\nThe desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters <math> K_P</math>, <math> K_I</math> and <math> K_D</math>, often iteratively by \"tuning\" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.\n\nApplying [[Laplace transform|Laplace transformation]] results in the transformed PID controller equation\n\n:<math>u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \\frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)</math>\n:<math>u(s) =  \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right) e(s)</math>\n\nwith the PID controller transfer function\n:<math>C(s) = \\left(K_P + K_I \\frac{1}{s} + K_D s\\right).</math>\n\nAs an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system <math>H(s)</math>, consider a 1st order plant given by\n\n:<math>P(s) = \\frac{A}{1 + sT_P}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> and <math>T_P</math> are some constants. The plant output is fed back through\n\n:<math>F(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + sT_F}</math>\n\nwhere <math>T_F</math> is also a constant. Now if we set <math>K_P=K\\left(1+\\frac{T_D}{T_I}\\right)</math>, <math>K_D=KT_D</math>, and <math>K_I=\\frac{K}{T_I}</math>, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as\n\n:<math>C(s) =  K \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{sT_I}\\right)(1 + sT_D)</math>\n\nPlugging <math>P(s)</math>, <math>F(s)</math>, and <math>C(s)</math> into the closed-loop transfer function <math>H(s)</math>, we find that by setting\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{1}{A},   T_I = T_F,   T_D = T_P</math>\n\n<math>H(s) = 1</math>. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.\n\nHowever, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=K.H. |last2=Chong |first2=G.C.Y. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |date=2005 |title=PID control system analysis, design, and technology |journal=IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=559\u2013576|doi=10.1109/TCST.2005.847331 }}</ref> due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a [[Lead\u2013lag compensator|phase-lead compensator]] type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.\n\n==Linear and nonlinear control theory==\nThe field of control theory can be divided into two branches:\n* ''[[Linear control theory]]'' \u2013 This applies to systems made of devices which obey the [[superposition principle]], which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.  They are governed by [[linear equation|linear]] [[differential equation]]s.  A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called ''[[linear time invariant]]'' (LTI) systems.   These systems are amenable to powerful [[frequency domain]] mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the [[Laplace transform]], [[Fourier transform]], [[Z transform]], [[Bode plot]], [[root locus]], and [[Nyquist stability criterion]].  These lead to a description of the system using terms like [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[frequency response]], [[eigenvalue]]s, [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], [[zeros and poles]], which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. \n* ''[[Nonlinear control theory]]'' \u2013 This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear.  These systems are often governed by [[nonlinear differential equation]]s.  The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.  These include [[limit cycle]] theory, [[Poincar\u00e9 map]]s, [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov stability theorem]], and [[describing function]]s.  Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using [[numerical method]]s on computers, for example by [[simulation|simulating]] their operation using a [[simulation language]].  If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be [[linearization|linearized]] by approximating them by a linear system using [[perturbation theory]], and linear techniques can be used.<ref>[http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/simulink/slref/trim.html trim point]</ref>\n\n==Analysis techniques - frequency domain and time domain==\nMathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories:\n* ''[[Frequency domain]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s, the mathematical [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of [[frequency]].  The input signal and the system's [[transfer function]] are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a [[transform (mathematics)|transform]] such as the [[Fourier transform]], [[Laplace transform]], or [[Z transform]].  The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the ''[[differential equation]]s'' that represent the system are replaced by ''[[algebraic equation]]s'' in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve.  However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.\n* ''[[Time-domain state space representation]]'' \u2013 In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s are represented as functions of time.  With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more [[differential equation]]s.  Since frequency domain techniques are limited to [[linear function|linear]] systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems.   Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as [[simulation language]]s have made their analysis routine.\nIn contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the \"time-domain approach\") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. \"State space\" refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.<ref>{{cite book|title=State space & linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=978-0-07-070096-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Terrell, William|title=Some fundamental control theory I: Controllability, observability, and duality \u2014AND\u2014 Some fundamental control Theory II: Feedback linearization of single input nonlinear systems|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=106|issue=9|year=1999|pages=705\u2013719 and 812\u2013828|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/some-fundamental-control-theory-i-controllability-observability-and-duality-and-some-fundamental|doi=10.2307/2589614|jstor=2589614}}</ref>\n\n==System interfacing - SISO & MIMO==\nControl systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs.\n* [[Single-input single-output system|Single-input single-output]] (SISO) \u2013 This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal.  Examples are the cruise control example above, or an [[audio system]], in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker. \n* [[MIMO|Multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) \u2013 These are found in more complicated systems.  For example, modern large [[telescope]]s such as the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] and [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an [[actuator]].  The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO [[active optics]] control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the [[wavefront]] due to turbulence in the atmosphere.  Complicated systems such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and human [[cell (biology)|cells]] are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems.\n\n==Topics in control theory==\n\n===Stability===\n\nThe ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria.\n*A [[linear system]] is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input.\n*Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability.\n\nFor simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time '''linear systems'''.\n\nMathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.  Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside\n* in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] for continuous time, when the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function.\n* inside the [[unit circle]] for discrete time, when the [[Z-transform]] is used.\nThe difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions. The continuous Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] where the <math>x</math> axis is the real axis and the discrete Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]] where the <math>\\rho</math> axis is the real axis.\n\nWhen the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.\n\nIf a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole in <math>z = 0.5</math> (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.\n\nHowever, if the impulse response was\n\n:<math>\\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]</math>\n\nthen the Z-transform is\n\n:<math>\\ X(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhich has a pole at <math>z = 1.5</math> and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.\n\nNumerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.\n\nMechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use [[Ship stability#Stabilizer fins|antiroll fins]] that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.\n\n===Controllability and observability===\n{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}\n\n[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed ''stabilizable''. Observability instead is related to the possibility of ''observing'', through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.\n\nFrom a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every \"bad\" state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.\n\nSolutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.\n\n===Control specification===\nSeveral different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or aircraft cruise control).\n\nA control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have <math>Re[\\lambda] < -\\overline{\\lambda}</math>, where <math>\\overline{\\lambda}</math> is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that <math>Re[\\lambda]<0</math>.\n\nAnother typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.\n\nOther \"classical\" control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).\n\nModern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE, ISA, CQI).\n\n===Model identification and robustness===\nA control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.\n\n;System identification\n{{details|System identification}}\nThe process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass\u2013spring\u2013damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that <math> m \\ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \\Beta \\dot{x}(t)</math>. Even assuming that a \"complete\" model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called \"nominal parameters\") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.\n\nSome advanced control techniques include an \"on-line\" identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated (\"identified\") while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.\n\n;Analysis\nAnalysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.\n\n;Constraints\nA particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.\n\n==System classifications==\n\n===Linear systems control===\n{{Main|State space (controls)}}\nFor MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.\n\n===Nonlinear systems control===\n{{Main|Nonlinear control}}\nProcesses in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]], [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.  Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.<ref name=Shi_Gu_et_al>{{cite journal |author1 = Gu Shi|year = 2015 |title = Controllability of structural brain networks (Article Number 8414) |journal = Nature Communications |volume = 6 |quote = Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure.  |lay-url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9414|issue = 6 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1406.5197|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8414G |pmid = 26423222 |pmc = 4600713 |page = 8414}}</ref>\n\n===Decentralized systems control===\n{{Main|Distributed control system}}\nWhen the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.\n\n===Deterministic and stochastic systems control===\n{{Main|Stochastic control}}\n\nA stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks.\n\n==Main control strategies==\nEvery control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.\n\n;List of the main control techniques\n\n*[[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.\n*A [[hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].\n*[[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]],<ref>{{cite journal | title=A novel fuzzy framework for nonlinear system control| journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems | year=2010 | last=Liu |first1=Jie |author2=Wilson Wang |author3=Farid Golnaraghi |author4=Eric Kubica | volume=161 | issue=21 | pages=2746\u20132759 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2010.04.009}}</ref> [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] or a combination of these methods, such as [[neuro-fuzzy]] algorithms, to control a [[dynamic system]].\n*[[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain \"cost index\": for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the \"optimal control\" structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].\n*[[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=Paul|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Robustness of Adaptation in Controlled Self-Adjusting Chaotic Systems |journal=Fluctuation and Noise Letters |volume=02|issue=4|pages=L285\u2013L292|date=2002|doi=10.1142/S0219477502000919}}</ref> The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.

The control strategy is formulated in terms of interconnection (in a power-preserving manner) in order to achieve a desired behavior.\n*[[Self-organized criticality control]] may be defined as attempts to interfere in the processes by which the [[self-organized]] system dissipates energy.\n\n==People in systems and control==\n{{Main|People in systems and control}}\nMany active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory including\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] invented the [[Z-transform]] in his work on [[probability theory]], now used to solve discrete-time control theory problems. The Z-transform is a discrete-time equivalent of the [[Laplace transform]] which is named after him.\n* [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of [[bang-bang control|discontinuous automatic control]] and applied it to [[autopilot|automatic aircraft control systems]].\n* [[Alexander Lyapunov]] in the 1890s marks the beginning of [[stability theory]].\n* [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S.

Lviv National Philharmonic Orchestra professor Shtriks, opera conductor Mund and other famous Jewish musicians were among the members. \n\nDuring hanging the Nazis ordered the orchestra to play tango, and during tortures the musicians had to play foxtrot.

The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.<ref name=\":0\">Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17</ref> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired many [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

libraries existed in both Greece and in the ancient Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=13}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The earliest recorded archive of written materials comes from the ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Uruk]] in around 3400 BC, when writing had only just begun to develop.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} Scholarly curation of literary texts began in around 2500 BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} The later kingdoms and empires of the ancient Near East had long traditions of book collecting.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The ancient [[Hittites]] and [[Assyria]]ns had massive archives containing records written in many different languages.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} The most famous library of the ancient Near East was the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] in [[Nineveh]], founded in the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]] (ruled 668\u2013{{circa}} 627 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} A large library also existed in [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] ({{circa}} 605\u2013{{circa}} 562 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} In Greece, the Athenian tyrant [[Peisistratos]] was said to have founded the first major public library in the sixth century BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1}} It was out of this mixed heritage of both Greek and Near Eastern book collections that the idea for the Library of Alexandria was born.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}\n\nThe Macedonian kings who succeeded [[Alexander the Great]] as rulers of the Near East wanted to promote Hellenistic culture and learning throughout the known world.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2\u20133}} Historian [[Roy MacLeod]] calls this \"a programme of [[cultural imperialism]]\".{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}} These rulers, therefore, had a vested interest to collect and compile information from both the Greeks and from the far more ancient kingdoms of the Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2\u20133}} Libraries enhanced a city's prestige, attracted scholars, and provided practical assistance in matters of ruling and governing the kingdom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=341}} Eventually, for these reasons, every major Hellenistic urban center would have a royal library.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=340}} The Library of Alexandria, however, was unprecedented due to the scope and scale of the Ptolemies' ambitions;{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|pages=340\u2013341}} unlike their predecessors and contemporaries, the Ptolemies wanted to produce a repository of all

''Letter of Aristeas'' claims that the Library was founded during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] ({{circa}} 323\u2013{{circa}} 283 BC) and that it was initially organized by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], a student of [[Aristotle]] who had been exiled from Athens and taken refuge in Alexandria within the Ptolemaic court.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}<ref>''Letter of

instead created under the reign of Ptolemy I's son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (283\u2013246 BC).{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}\n\nModern scholars agree that, while it is possible that Ptolemy I may have laid the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen out of favor with the Ptolemaic court and could not, therefore, have had any role in establishing the Library as an institution.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343\u2013344}} Stephen V. Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Library's collection.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343\u2013344}} In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and [[Theophrastus]], which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was a distinguished member of the [[Peripatetic school]].{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=344\u2013345}}\n\nThe Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) as part of the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]].{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis|2015|p=19}}{{efn|\"Mouseion\" means \"House of Muses\", whence the term \"museum\".<ref>Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912160936/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 |date=12 September 2007 }} at [[Liddell & Scott]].</ref>}} Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,<ref name=\"Lindberg1980\">{{cite book|author=David C.

large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a [[:wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|synodos}}, \"community\").{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} One likely apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's son.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nThe first recorded head librarian was [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] (lived {{circa}} 325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}\n\n[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|According to legend, the Syracusan inventor [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw]], a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}]]\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n\nThe third head librarian, [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (lived {{circa}} 280\u2013{{circa}} 194 BC), is best known today for his scientific works, but he was also a literary scholar.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=114}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Eratosthenes's most important work was his treatise ''Geographika'', which was originally in three volumes.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} The work itself has not survived, but many fragments of it are preserved through quotation in the writings of the later geographer [[Strabo]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Eratosthenes was the first scholar to apply mathematics to geography and map-making{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=116}} and, in his treatise ''Concerning the Measurement of the Earth'', he calculated the circumference of the earth and was only off by less than a few hundred kilometers.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=116}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=41}} Eratosthenes also produced a map of the entire known world, which incorporated information taken from sources held in the Library, including accounts of [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's campaigns in India]] and reports written by members of Ptolemaic elephant-hunting expeditions along the coast of [[East Africa]].{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=41}}\n\nEratosthenes was the first person to advance geography towards becoming a scientific discipline.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=116\u2013117}} Eratosthenes believed that the setting of the Homeric poems was purely imaginary and argued that the purpose of poetry was \"to capture the soul\", rather than to give a historically accurate account of actual events.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Strabo quotes him as having sarcastically commented, \"a man might find the places of Odysseus's wanderings if the day were to come when he would find the leatherworker who stitched the goatskin of the winds.\"{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Meanwhile, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria also displayed interest in scientific subjects.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=6\u20137}} [[Bacchius of Tanagra]], a contemporary of Eratosthenes, edited and commented on the medical writings of the [[Hippocratic Corpus]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} The doctors [[Herophilos|Herophilus]] (lived {{circa}} 335\u2013{{circa}} 280 BC) and [[Erasistratus]] ({{circa}} 304\u2013{{circa}} 250 BC) studied [[human anatomy]], but their studies were hindered by protests against the [[dissection]] of human corpses, which was seen as immoral.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}}\n\nAccording to Galen, around this time, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original manuscripts of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]], for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] ({{convert|1000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) of a precious metal as guarantee that he

Athens during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003}} As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to house the scrolls in its collection, so, during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, it opened a satellite collection in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]]

According to a legend recorded by the Roman writer [[Vitruvius]], Aristophanes was one of seven judges appointed for a poetry competition hosted by Ptolemy III Euergetes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|pages=148\u2013149}} All six of the other judges favored one competitor, but Aristophanes favored the one whom the audience had liked the least.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}} Aristophanes declared that all of the poets except for the one he had chosen had committed plagiarism and were therefore disqualified.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}} The king demanded that he prove this, so he retrieved the texts that the authors had plagiarized from the Library, locating them by memory.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=38}}{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}} On account of his impressive memory and diligence, Ptolemy III appointed him as head librarian.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=149}}\n\nThe librarianship of Aristophanes of Byzantium is widely considered to have opened a more mature phase of the Library of Alexandria's history.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} During this phase of the Library's history, [[literary criticism]] reached its peak{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}} and came to dominate the Library's scholarly output.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=7\u20138}} Aristophanes of Byzantium edited poetic texts and introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 93}} He also invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 92\u201393}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} wrote important works on [[lexicography]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and introduced a series of signs for textual criticism.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=93}} He wrote introductions to many plays, some of which have survived in partially rewritten forms.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} The fifth head librarian was an obscure individual named Apollonius, who is known by the epithet {{lang-grc-gre|\u1f41 \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}} (\"the classifier of

forms.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=129}}\n\nDuring the early second century BC, several scholars at the Library of Alexandria studied works on medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} Zeuxis the Empiricist is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library's collection.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} After the [[Battle of Raphia]] in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with [[Upper Egypt]] became largely disrupted.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}\n\n[[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] (lived {{circa}} 216\u2013{{circa}} 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full ''[[hypomnema]]ta'', or long, free-standing commentaries, on them.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems,{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} A portion of one of Aristarchus's commentaries on the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] has survived in a papyrus fragment.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} In 145 BC, however, Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported [[Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator]] as the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}} Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of [[Cyprus]], where he died shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern Mediterranean.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}\n\n== Decline ==\n\n=== After Ptolemy VIII's expulsions ===\nPtolemy VIII Physcon's expulsion of the scholars from Alexandria brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170\u2013{{circa}} 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Dionysius Thrax wrote the [[The Art of Grammar|first book on Greek grammar]], a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the first century BC by [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] ({{circa}} 100\u2013{{circa}} 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}\n\n=== Burning by Julius Caesar ===\n[[File:C\u00e9sar

Watts.{{sfn|Watts|2008|pages=149\u2013150}}\n\nBy the second century AD, the Roman Empire grew less dependent on grain from Alexandria and the city's prominence declined further.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} The Romans during this period also had less interest in Alexandrian scholarship, causing the Library's reputation to continue to decline as well.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} The scholars who worked and studied at the Library of Alexandria during the time of the Roman Empire were less well known than the ones who had studied there during the Ptolemaic Period.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} Eventually, the word \"Alexandrian\" itself came to be synonymous with the editing of texts, correction of textual errors, and writing of commentaries synthesized from those of earlier scholars\u2014in other words, taking on connotations of pedantry, monotony, and lack of originality.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=9}} Mention of both the Great Library of Alexandria and the Mouseion that housed it disappear after the middle of the third century AD.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}} The last known references to scholars being members of the Mouseion date to the 260s.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}\n\nIn 272 AD, the emperor [[Aurelian]] fought to recapture the city of Alexandria from the forces of the [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrene]] queen [[Zenobia]].{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} During the course of the fighting, Aurelian's forces destroyed the Broucheion quarter of the city in which the main library was located.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} If the Mouseion and Library still existed at this time, they were almost certainly destroyed during the attack as well.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} If they did survive the attack, then whatever was left of them would have been destroyed during the emperor [[Diocletian]]'s siege of Alexandria in 297.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=150}}\n\n== Successors to the Mouseion ==\n[[File:Alexandrian World Chronicle -

The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.<ref name=\":0\">Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17</ref> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired many [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen

large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a [[:wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|synodos}}, \"community\").{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} One likely apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's son.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nThe first recorded head librarian was [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] (lived {{circa}} 325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}\n\n[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|According to legend, the Syracusan inventor [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw]], a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}]]\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n\nThe third head librarian, [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (lived {{circa}} 280\u2013{{circa}} 194 BC), is best known today for his scientific works, but he was also a literary scholar.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=114}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Eratosthenes's most important work was his treatise ''Geographika'', which was originally in three volumes.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} The work itself has not survived, but many fragments of it are preserved through quotation in the writings of the later geographer [[Strabo]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Eratosthenes was the first scholar to apply mathematics to geography and map-making{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=116}} and, in his treatise ''Concerning the Measurement of the Earth'', he calculated the circumference of the earth and was only off by less than a few hundred kilometers.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=116}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=41}} Eratosthenes also produced a map of the entire known world, which incorporated information taken from sources held in the Library, including accounts of [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's campaigns in India]] and reports written by members of Ptolemaic elephant-hunting expeditions along the coast of [[East Africa]].{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=41}}\n\nEratosthenes was the first person to advance geography towards becoming a scientific discipline.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=116\u2013117}} Eratosthenes believed that the setting of the Homeric poems was purely imaginary and argued that the purpose of poetry was \"to capture the soul\", rather than to give a historically accurate account of actual events.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Strabo quotes him as having sarcastically commented, \"a man might find the places of Odysseus's wanderings if the day were to come when he would find the leatherworker who stitched the goatskin of the winds.\"{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=115}} Meanwhile, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria also displayed interest in scientific subjects.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=6\u20137}} [[Bacchius of Tanagra]], a contemporary of Eratosthenes, edited and commented on the

immoral.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}}\n\nAccording to Galen, around this time, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original manuscripts of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]], for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] ({{convert|1000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) of a precious metal as guarantee that he

soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003}} As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to

introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 93}} He also invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 92\u201393}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} wrote important works on [[lexicography]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and introduced a series of signs for textual

is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library's collection.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} After the [[Battle of Raphia]] in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with [[Upper Egypt]] became largely disrupted.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}\n\n[[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] (lived {{circa}} 216\u2013{{circa}} 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full ''[[hypomnema]]ta'', or long, free-standing commentaries, on them.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems,{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} A portion of one of

Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported [[Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator]] as the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}} Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of [[Cyprus]], where he died shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern

brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170\u2013{{circa}} 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Dionysius Thrax wrote the [[The Art of Grammar|first book on Greek grammar]], a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the first century BC by [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] ({{circa}} 100\u2013{{circa}} 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}\n\n=== Burning by Julius Caesar ===\n[[File:C\u00e9sar
