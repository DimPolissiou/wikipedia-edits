Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary means. We accept that responsibility and will act in accordance with it. The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility and support the United Nations in establishing an early warning capability. </blockquote><blockquote>139. The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this context, we are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate, should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We stress the need for the General Assembly to continue consideration of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and its implications, bearing in mind the principles of the Charter and international law. We also intend to commit ourselves, as necessary and appropriate, to helping States build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and to assisting those which are under stress before crises and conflicts break out.</blockquote><blockquote>140. We fully support the mission of the Special Advisor of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide.</blockquote>\n\nThe above paragraphs in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document serve as the basis for the inter-governmental agreement to the Responsibility to Protect. The General Assembly adopted the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document in its resolution 60/1 of 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement|title=UN General Assembly Resolution 60/1 (16 September 2005)|last=|first=|date=24 October 2005|website=|publisher=UN|access-date=}}</ref> The body subsequently committed to continue consideration of the Responsibility to Protect with its Resolution A/Res/63/308 of October 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/unresolutiona63l80rev1.pdf|title=Resolution of the General Assembly 63/308: The responsibility to protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=GCR2P|access-date=}}</ref> The UN Security Council first reaffirmed the Responsibility to Protect in Resolution 1674 (2006) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, recalling in particular paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Summit Outcome regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Scope and limitations of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe report of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]], which first articulated the Responsibility to Protect in its December 2001 Report, envisioned a wide scope of application in its articulation of the principle, which included \"overwhelming natural or environmental catastrophes, where the state concerned is either unwilling or unable to cope, or call for assistance, and significant loss of life is occurring or threatened.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHeads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit refined the scope of the Responsibility to Protect to the four crimes mentioned in paragraphs 138 and 139, namely genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, which are commonly referred to as 'atrocity crimes' or 'mass atrocity crimes'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs per the Secretary-General's 2009 Report on the Responsibility to Protect, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect,'' \"The responsibility to protect applies, until Member States decide otherwise, only to the four specified crimes and violations: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity...To try to extend it to cover other calamities, such as HIV/AIDS, climate change or the response to natural disasters, would undermine the 2005 consensus and stretch the concept beyond recognition or operational utility.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/63/677|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe focused scope is part of what the UN Secretary-General has termed a \"narrow but deep approach\" to the Responsibility to Protect: A narrow application to four crimes, but a deep approach to response, employing the wide array of prevention and protection instruments available to Member States, the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations and civil society.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Three Pillars of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect consists of three important and mutually-reinforcing pillars, as articulated in the 2009 Report of the Secretary-General on the issue, and which build off of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and the intergovernmental agreement to the principle:\n# Pillar I: The protection responsibilities of the state;\n# Pillar II: International assistance and capacity-building;\n# Pillar III: Timely and decisive response.<ref name=\":3\" />\nAs seen in the 2005 World Outcome Document the UN Member States unanimously agreed to uphold their Responsibility to Protect. Pillar I being the protection responsibilities of the state, paragraph 138 (see definition) states \u201cEach individual state has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity\u201d. Under Pillar I many countries are able to uphold these principles of preventing mass atrocity crimes. As Pillar II leads on to international assistance and capacity-building. The international community is sent to help populations in need before further crises break out. States who may be willing but are either incapable or too weak to uphold their responsibility now may receive international support as a result of R2P. Pillar III is to deliver a timely and decisive response. This movement is a prevention method for mass atrocity crimes when a state fails to protect its populations. In reference to paragraph 139 \u201cThe international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the [UN] Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unu.edu/publications/articles/responsibility-to-protect-and-the-protection-of-civilians.html|title=The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 United Nations University|website=unu.edu|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UN Secretary-General's 2012 report, the three pillars of the Responsibility to Protect are not sequential and are of equal importance. \"Without all three, the concept would be incomplete. All three pillars must be implemented in a manner fully consistent with the purposes, principles, and provisions of the Charter''.''\"<ref name=\":2\" /> The pillared approach is intended to reinforce, not undermine state sovereignty. As per the 2009 report of the Secretary-General, \"By helping States to meet their core protection responsibilities, the responsibility to protect seeks to strengthen sovereignty, not weaken it. It seeks to help States to succeed, not just to react when they fail''.''\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== The Responsibility to Protect and 'Humanitarian Intervention' ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect differs from [[humanitarian intervention]] in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only refers to the use of military force, whereas R2P is first and foremost a preventive principle that emphasizes a range of measures to stem the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity before the crimes are threatened or occur. The use of force may only be carried out as a measure of last resort, when all other non-coercive measures have failed, and only when it is authorized by the UN Security Council.<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\">http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/libyaandr2poccasionalpaper-1.pdf</ref> This is in contrast to the principle of 'humanitarian intervention', which dubiously claims to allow for the use of force as a humanitarian imperative without the authorization of the Security Council.\n\nThe second point relates to the first. As a principle, the Responsibility to Protect is rooted firmly in existing international law, especially the law relating to sovereignty, peace and security, human rights, and armed conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/responsibility-protect-and-international-law|title=The Responsibility to Protect and International Law|work=brill.com}}</ref>\n\nThird, while humanitarian interventions have in the past been justified in the context of varying situations, R2P focuses only on the four mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The first three crimes are clearly defined in international law and codified in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. Ethnic cleansing is not a crime defined under international law, but has been defined by the UN as \"a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas\".<ref>https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514200247/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2F1994%2F674 |date=2011-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nFinally, while humanitarian intervention assumes a \"right to intervene\", the R2P is based on a \"responsibility to protect\".<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\" /> Humanitarian intervention and the R2P both agree on the fact that sovereignty is not absolute. However, the R2P doctrine shifts away from state-centered motivations to the interests of victims by focusing not on the right of states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk.<ref name=\"GSDRC 2013\">GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham</ref> In addition, it introduces a new way of looking at the essence of sovereignty, moving away from issues of \"control\" and emphasising \"responsibility\" to one's own citizens and the wider international community.<ref>Arbour, 2008; Evans, 2006\u20137</ref>\n\n== History of the Responsibility to Protect ==\n=== 1990s: Origins ===\nThe norm of the R2P was borne out of the international community's failure to respond to tragedies such as the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994 and the [[Srebrenica genocide]] in 1995. [[Kofi Annan]], who was Assistant Secretary-General at the UN Department for Peacekeeping Operations during the Rwandan genocide,<ref>http://www.biography.com/people/kofi-annan-9185694</ref> realized the international community's failure to respond. In the wake of the Kosovo intervention, 1999, Annan insisted that traditional notions of sovereignty had been redefined: \u201cStates are now widely understood to be instruments at the service of their peoples\u201d,<ref>\nK. Annan, Two Concepts of Sovereignty, ECONOMIST, Sept. 18, 1999, at 49, 49; http://www.economist.com/node/324795\n</ref> he said, while  U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] cited human rights concerns in 46% of the hundreds of remarks that he made justifying intervention in Kosovo.<ref>N.Kerton-Johnson, JUSTIFYING AMERICA\u2019S WARS: THE CONDUCT AND PRACTICE OF US MILITARY INTERVENTION 63\u201364 (2011).</ref>\nIn 2000, and in his capacity as [[UN Secretary-General]], Annan wrote the report \"We the Peoples\" on the role of the United Nations in the 21st Century, and in this report he posed the following question: \"if [[humanitarian intervention]] is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica \u2013 to gross and systematic violations of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?\"<ref>http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan000923.pdf</ref>\n\n=== 2000: African Union proposes a right to intervene ===\nMany critics of the R2P's third pillar claim that R2P is a Western concept, but it was the [[African Union]] (AU) that pioneered the concept that the international community has a responsibility to intervene in crisis situations if a state is failing to protect its population from mass atrocity crimes.<ref>http://www.nai.uu.se/publications/series/notes/978-91-7106-642-8.pdf</ref> In 2000, the AU incorporated the right to intervene in a member state, as enshrined in Article 4(h) of its [[Constitutive Act of the African Union|Constitutive Act]], which declares \"[t]he right of the Union to intervene in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity\".<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Constitutive Acts of the African Union\n |work        = Documents and speeches\n |publisher   = African Union Summit, South Africa 2002\n |url         = http://www.au2002.gov.za/docs/key_oau/au_act.htm\n |accessdate  = 2012-01-07\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120106025116/http://www.au2002.gov.za/docs/key_oau/au_act.htm\n |archivedate = 2012-01-06\n}}</ref> The AU also adopted the [[Ezulwini Consensus]] in 2005, which welcomed R2P as a tool for the prevention of mass atrocities.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = The common African position on the proposed reform of the United Nations: \"The Ezulwini Consensus\"\n  | work = Executive Council, 7th Extraordinary Session, March 7,8, 2005 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Ext/EX.CL/2 (VII)\n  | publisher = African Union\n  | url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:knfeO7BmdKYJ:www.africa-union.org/News_Events/Calendar_of_%2520Events/7th%2520extra%2520ordinary%2520session%2520ECL/Ext%2520EXCL2%2520VII%2520Report.doc+ezulwini+consensus&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari&redir_esc=&ei=BhwIT5CWG47jggeE9MWPAg\n  | accessdate = 2012-01-07}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000: International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty ===\nIn September 2000, following an appeal by its Foreign Minister [[Lloyd Axworthy]], the Canadian government established the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS) to answer Annan's question \"if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]], to a [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica]] \u2013 to gross and systematic violations of human rights that affect every precept of our common humanity?\" In February 2001, at the third round table meeting of the ICISS in London, [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]], [[Mohamed Sahnoun]], and [[Michael Ignatieff]] suggested the phrase \"responsibility to protect\" as a way to avoid the \"right to intervene\" or \"obligation to intervene\" doctrines and yet keep a degree of duty to act to resolve humanitarian crises.<ref name=\"Haines\">{{Citation\n  | last2 = Kassimeris\n  | first2 = George, ed.\n  | last1 = Haines\n  | first1 = Steven\n  | title = The Ashgate research companion to modern warfare\n  | place = Burlington, VT\n  | publisher = Ashgate Publishing Ltd\n  | year = 2010\n  | chapter = Chapter 18, Humanitarian Intervention: Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and the Use of Force\n  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=gnxWaFyEE0QC&pg=PA307&dq=%22Humanitarian+Intervention:+Genocide,+Crimes+against+Humanity+and+the+Use+of+Force%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U18OT5L-Gq230gGF9IG-Aw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Humanitarian%20Intervention%3A%20Genocide%2C%20Crimes%20against%20Humanity%20and%20the%20Use%20of%20Force%22&f=false\n  | pages = 307\u2013329\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gnxWaFyEE0QC\n  | isbn = 978-0-7546-7410-8\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, ICISS released a report titled [http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/ICISS%20Report.pdf \"The Responsibility to Protect\"]. In a radical reformulation of the meaning of state sovereignty, the report argued that sovereignty entailed not only rights but also responsibilities, specifically a state's responsibility to protect its people from major violations of human rights. This idea rested on earlier work by [[Francis Deng]] and Roberta Cohen regarding [[internally displaced person]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/03/25-internal-displacement-cohen|title=Reconciling Responsibility to Protect with IDP Protection|author=Roberta Cohen|date=25 March 2010|work=The Brookings Institution}}</ref> Inspiration may also be attributed to [[Jan Eliasson]], who in response to a questionnaire on internally displaced persons distributed by [[Francis Deng]], stated that assisting populations at risk within their own country was \"basically a question of striking a balance between sovereignty and solidarity with people in need.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mooney|first=Erin|year=2010|title=Something Old, Something New, Something Borrrowed...Something Blue?

(This does not mean that every measurement has to have been applied and been shown to fail, but that there are reasonable grounds to believe that only military action would work in that situation.)\n* Proportional means: The military means must not exceed what is necessary \"to secure the defined human protection objective\".\n* Reasonable prospects: The chance of success must be reasonably high, and it must be unlikely that the consequences of the military intervention would be worse than the consequences without the intervention.\n* Right authority: The military action has to have been authorized by the Security Council.\n\n=== 2005 World Summit Outcome Document ===\nAs the ICISS report was released in 2001, right around the time of the Second Gulf War, many thought that would be the end of this new norm. However, at the [[2005 World Summit]], where the largest number of heads of state and government in the history of the UN convened, the R2P was unanimously adopted.<ref>http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf</ref> While the outcome was close to the ideas of the ICISS report, there were some notable differences: the R2P would now only apply to mass atrocity crimes (genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing), rather than human rights violations; no mention was made of the criteria of intervention (see above); and the UN Security Council was made the only body allowed to authorize intervention. The paragraphs also stress the importance of regional organizations and the role they can play through Chapter VIII of the UN Charter.\n\nThe results of this summit led to world leaders agreeing on holding each other accountable if they fail to uphold the new responsibilities. Decidedly if one state fails to uphold their responsibility this is now where State Sovereignty may be broken in order to protect people in danger of such crimes. First peaceful action is to be taken through humanitarian, diplomatic, or other means. If these fail to resolve the matter, the international community should come together in a \u201ctimely and decisive manner\u201d. This shall all be worked on a case-by-case basis through the UN Security Council as well as the UN Charter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Secretary-General's 2009 report ===\nOn 12 January 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] issued a report entitled [http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/implementing%20the%20rtop.pdf ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'']. The report was the first comprehensive document from the [[UN Secretariat]] on the R2P, following Ban's stated commitment to turn the concept into policy. The Secretary-General's report set the tone and the direction for the discussion on the subject at the UN. The report proposes three-pillar approach to the R2P:\n\n* Pillar One stresses that states have the primary responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n* Pillar Two addresses the international community's commitment to help states build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and to help those under stress before crises and conflicts break out.\n* Pillar Three focuses on the responsibility of [[international community]] to act in a timely and decisive way to prevent and halt genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity when a state manifestly fails to protect its populations.\n\n=== Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect (GCR2P) is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that conducts research and [[advocacy]] for the Responsibility to protect.

These paragraphs gave final language to the scope of R2P. It applies to the four mass atrocities crimes only. It also identifies to whom the R2P protocol applies; i.e., nations first, and regional and international communities second. Since then, the UN has been actively engaged with the development of the R2P. Several resolutions, reports, and debates have emerged through the UN forum.\n\n=== Security Council ===\nThe Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to the R2P in more than 80 resolutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions and Presidential Statements Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> The first such resolution came in April 2006, when the Security Council reaffirmed the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 in [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1674(2006) Resolution 1674], formalizing their support for the R2P.

The informal interactive dialogue was held on 9 August 2010, with 49 member states, two regional organizations, and two civil society organizations speaking at the event. The discussion had a resoundingly positive tone, with virtually all of those that spoke stressing a need to prevent atrocities and agreeing that effective early warning is a necessary condition for effective prevention and early action.

M\u00e9ndez]] as Special Adviser to fill critical gaps in the international system that allowed those tragedies to go unchecked. In 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Francis M. Deng on a full-time basis at the level of Under-Secretary-General. Around the same time, he also appointed [[Edward Luck]] as the Special Adviser who focuses on the R2P, on a part-time basis at the level of Assistant Secretary-General.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/|title=Office of The Special Adviser on The Prevention of Genocide|work=un.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect leads the conceptual, political, institutional, and operational development of the R2P. The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide acts as a catalyst to raise awareness of the causes and dynamics of genocide, to alert relevant actors where there is a risk of genocide, and to advocate and mobilize for appropriate action. The mandates of the two Special Advisers are distinct but complementary. The efforts of their Office include alerting relevant actors to the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity; enhancing the capacity of the UN to prevent these crimes, including their incitement; and working with member states, regional and sub-regional arrangements, and civil society to develop more effective means of response when they do occur.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth Special Advisers Deng and Luck ended their assignments with the Office in July 2012.

On 30 December 2007, [[Mwai Kibaki]] was declared the winner of the presidential elections and was sworn in as president a couple of hours later. The announcement of the results triggered widespread and systematic violence resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and the displacement of over 500,000 civilians. Clashes were characterized by the ethnically targeted killings of people aligned with the two major political parties, the [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM) and the [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|Party of National Unity]] (PNU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-kenya|title=The Crisis in Kenya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nExternal intervention was almost immediate. French Foreign and European Affairs Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] made an appeal to the UN Security Council in January 2008 to react \"in the name of the responsibility to protect\" before Kenya plunged into a deadly ethnic conflict. On 31 December 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement expressing concern for the ongoing violence and calling for the population to remain calm and for Kenyan security forces to show restraint. On 10 January 2008, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was accepted by both the ODM and the PNU as the African Union Chief Mediator. Mediation efforts led to the signing of a power-sharing agreement on 28 February 2008. The agreement established Mwai Kibaki as President and [[Raila Odinga]] as Prime Minister, as well as the creation of three commissions: the [[Waki Commission|Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence]] (CIPEV); the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; and the [[Kriegler Commission|Independent Review Commission]] on the General Elections.

Following widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population by the Libyan regime, and language used by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] that reminded the international community of the genocide in Rwanda, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1970 on 26 February 2011, making explicit reference to the R2P. Deploring what it called \"the gross and systematic violation of human rights\" in strife-torn Libya, the Security Council demanded an end to the violence, \"recalling the Libyan authorities' responsibility to protect its population\", and imposed a series of international sanctions. The Council also decided to refer the situation to the [[International Criminal Court]].\n\nIn resolution 1973, adopted on 17 March 2011, the Security Council demanded an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to ongoing attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute \"crimes against humanity\". The Council authorized member states to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory. A few days later, acting on the resolution, [[NATO]] planes started striking at Gaddafi's forces.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml|title=Background Information on the Responsibility to Protect \u2014 Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations|work=un.org}}</ref> NATO subsequently came under scrutiny for its behavior during the air strikes; concerns included the fact that the intervention quickly moved to [[regime-change]] and that there were allegations regarding aerial bombardments that may have caused civilian casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-libya#violence|title=Crisis in Libya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Central African Republic (CAR) 2013 ===\nIn December 2012, a loose rebel coalition named the [[S\u00e9l\u00e9ka]] initiated a military campaign to overthrow the government of the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR) and its then-president, [[Francois Boziz\u00e9]]. The S\u00e9l\u00e9ka, composed mostly of factions of armed groups in the northeast of the state, accused Boziz\u00e9's government of neglecting their region. They rapidly captured several strategic towns and were poised to take the capital city of [[Bangui]]. A hasty intervention by Chad and the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS) persuaded the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka to negotiate with Boziz\u00e9's government. The result, the Libreville Agreement of January 2013, installed a three-year power-sharing arrangement.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\">{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-the-central-african-republic|title=Crisis in CAR|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ECCAS failed to monitor the implementation of the Libreville Agreement and Boziz\u00e9 did not undertake any of the reforms necessary under the transition agreement. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka resurged and took control of Bangui and fifteen of CAR's sixteen provinces on 24 March 2013. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka's leader, [[Michel Djotodia]], proclaimed himself President, set up the National Transitional Council (NTC), and suspended CAR's constitution. A hurried ECCAS summit on 4 April 2013, which did not yet recognize Djotodia as President, called for the creation of a Transitional National Council (TNC), which would create a new constitution, conduct elections in eighteen months, and select an interim President. On 13 April, the TNC chose the sole candidate vying for interim president position, Michel Djotodia.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\" />\n\nFrom December 2012 onward, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces, who are predominantly Muslim, committed grave human rights abuses against civilians throughout the country and especially targeted the majority Christian population.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In response, Christian civilians formed \"[[anti-balaka]]\" (\"anti-machete\") militias, which have conducted vicious reprisals against Muslims.

The attack against former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels sparked widespread violence throughout the capital as well as in Ouham province in the northwest. The violence marked a significant escalation of the conflict in CAR. Anti-balaka forces launched another attack against Muslim neighborhoods of Bangui on 20 December, spurring a cycle of renewed violence that led to at least 71 deaths by 24 December. A mass grave of at least 30 people who were reportedly executed and exhibited signs of torture was discovered on 25 December. The [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) estimates a further 40 civilians were killed on 25 December as violence continued between anti-balaka and ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces.

The African Union was the first to react when it announced a new African-led International Support Mission for CAR ([[MISCA]]) in July 2013. However, MISCA has not been effective in reversing the deteriorating security situation. Although its mandate is well-defined, there is general agreement that it does not have the resources to fulfill its mission. The UN General Assembly put CAR on the international agenda in September. [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2121(2013) Resolution 2121], adopted on 10 October 2013 and sponsored by France, strengthened and broadened the mandate of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA). Aware that MISCA alone is unable to adequately tackle the growing insecurity, France has changed its initial position from disengagement to military contribution, as announced by [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] on 20 November 2013, who said that French forces would be reinforced by almost 1,000 troops for a six-month period.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\" /> France began to deploy troops in CAR after receiving authorization from the Security Council on 5 December 2013 with Resolution 2127, which authorizes MISCA and French forces to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians and restore security in CAR.

The conclusion was made that the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which increased the delivery of humanitarian aid, as well as a nationwide cessation of hostilities, was required in order to help those in need. The Commission on Inquiry, mandated by the Human Rights Council, has found the Syrian government, while working with allied militias, has committed large-scale massacres, perpetrated war crimes and gross violations of international humanitarian law as a matter of state policy. The Commission of Inquiry's third report had stated that the government had committed crimes against humanity through extermination, murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance, and other inhuman acts. Due to this statement the UN Human Rights Council has adopted at least 16 different resolutions with regard to the atrocities taking place in Syria.  Despite all efforts and resolutions adopted to help uphold R2P, humanitarian aid has had limited success in reaching the affected populations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/|title=Populations at Risk: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Burundi ===\nThe country of Burundi is at grave risk for a possible civil war, if violence is not stopped. The civilians of Burundi face the serious and eminent risk of mass atrocities due to the ongoing political violence that threatens the stability of Burundi.  The citizens of Burundi are being harmed through mass atrocity crimes due to targeted killings, widespread violations and abuses of human rights. Violence had increased after President Pierre Nkurnziza had announced he was seeking a third term in the country\u2019s elections, and instructing his citizens to disarm or face action by Burundian Security forces and be labeled enemies of the nation. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reports cases of sexual violence by security forces, hate speech, and incitement to violence by some government officials. Responses by the international community include a Security Council-mandated police force with the goal of monitoring the situation. This police force has been rejected by Burundi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/burundi|title=Burundi|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Yemen Crisis===\nWith the current armed conflict in Yemen, many civilians are facing mass atrocity crimes. These crimes are a result of the violence between pro-government forces and regional military as they fight against the Houthi rebels. The Houthi rebels and pro-Saleh personnel currently control a majority of Yemen, including the country's capital, Sana\u2019a. In addition to the violence between these groups the nation has also been barraged by Saudi-led airstrikes for years. Between March 26, 2015 and November 8, 2018, the conflict has resulted in over 6,872<ref>{{cite web |title=Bachelet urges States with the power and influence to end starvation, killing of civilians in Yemen |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/bachelet-urges-states-power-and-influence-end-starvation-killing-civilians-yemen |website=ohchr.org |publisher=United Nations Human RIghts Office of the High Commissioner |accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref> civilian deaths, the majority of these from Saudi-led airstrikes.

On the second point, Bellamy finds that R2P language is used in UNSC deliberations and in the rhetoric of world leaders.\n\nInternational relations professor Amitai Etzioni notes R2P challenges the Westphalian norm that state sovereignty is \u201cabsolute.\u201d R2P establishes \u201cconditional\u201d state sovereignty contingent upon fulfilling certain domestic and international obligations. Etzioni considers the R2P norm of conditional sovereignty a communitarian approach as it recognizes states have the right to self-determination and self-governance, but they also have a responsibility to the international community to protect the environment, promote peace, and not harm their state\u2019s inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite article|title=Defining Down Sovereignty: The Rights and Responsibilities of Nations|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|year=2016|ssrn = 2741719}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism of R2P ==\nR2P and certain implementations of it have come under criticism by some states and individuals.\n\n=== Infringement of national sovereignty ===\nOne of the main concerns surrounding R2P is that it infringes upon national sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Moran\n  | first1 = Rick\n  | last2 =  Horowitz\n  | first2 = David, editor\n  | authorlink1 = \n  | authorlink2 = David Horowitz\n  | title = Libya and the Soros Doctrine\n  | journal = FrontPage Magazine\n  | date = March 28, 2011\n  | url = http://frontpagemag.com/2011/03/28/libya-and-the-soros-doctrine/\n  | accessdate = January 7, 2012}}</ref> This concern is rebutted by the Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in the report ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect''. According to the first pillar of R2P, the state has the responsibility to protect its populations from mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing, and according to the second pillar the international community has the responsibility to help states fulfill their responsibility. Advocates of R2P claim that the only occasions where the international community will intervene in a state without its consent is when the state is either allowing mass atrocities to occur, or is committing them, in which case the state is no longer upholding its responsibilities as a sovereign. In this sense, R2P can be understood as reinforcing sovereignty.<ref>Ban Ki-moon, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'', p. 7-8</ref> In 2004, the [[High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]], set up by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, endorsed the emerging norm of R2P, stating that there is a collective international responsibility \"...exercisable by the Security Council authorizing military intervention as a last resort, in the event of genocide and other large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing, and serious violations of humanitarian law which sovereign governments have proved powerless or unwilling to prevent.\"<ref name=\"un.org\" />\n\n=== Libya, 2011 ===\nOn March 19, 2011, the Security Council approved [[Resolution 1973]], which reiterated the responsibility of the Libyan authorities to protect the Libyan population.

While the doctrine was initially invoked to protect against government reprisals in rebel-held Benghazi, the resulting operation grew in scope to support the total overthrow of the government. Critics feel this experience has yielded global skepticism concerning proposed UN intervention in Syria the same year, putting the future of R2P in question.<ref>{{cite news|title=R2P, R.I.P.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/opinion/r2p-rip.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=8 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Syria, 2011: Russian and Chinese repudiation of abuse of R2P ===\nSeveral attempts were made by the U.S. government in the course of 2011 to 2013 to pass Security Council resolutions invoking R2P to justify military intervention in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. These were vetoed by Russia and China. The Russian and Chinese governments both issued statements to the effect that, in their opinion, R2P had been abused by the U.S. as a pretext for \"regime change\", more particularly in the case of Libya, and that as far as they were concerned they would be extremely suspicious of any future Security Council resolutions invoking R2P, based on past experience. According to the UN's own 4 October 2011 coverage of the meeting of the Security Council:\n\n<blockquote>[Russia's UN Ambassador [[Vitaly Churkin]]] was alarmed that compliance with Security Council resolutions in Libya had been considered a model for future actions by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It was important to see how that model had been implemented. The demand for a ceasefire had turned into a civil war, the humanitarian, social and military consequences of which had spilled beyond Libya. The arms embargo had turned into a naval blockade on west Libya. Such models should be excluded from global practice.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[\u2026] [China's UN Ambassador [[Li Baodong]]] hoped that the [Syrian] Government would follow through on reform and a process of dialogue. The Council should encourage those objectives while respecting Syria's sovereignty's [sic] and territorial integrity. Any action it took should contribute to peace and stability and comply with the United Nations Charter principles of non-interference in internal affairs.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10403.doc.htm|title=Security Council Fails to Adopt Draft Resolution Condemning Syria's Crackdown|work=un.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Military intervention ===\nThe question of military intervention under the third pillar of R2P remains controversial.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Seybolt\n  | first = Taylor B.\n  | title = Humanitarian military intervention: the conditions for success and failure\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press Inc.\n  | year = 2007\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | page = 2\n  | language = \n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=m1O1lcF2GqsC&pg=PA2&dq=%22The+concept+of+states'+responsibility+to+protect+civilians+drew+sharp+reactions%22#v=onepage&q=%22The%20concept%20of%20states'%20responsibility%20to%20protect%20civilians%20drew%20sharp%20reactions%22&f=false\n  | isbn = 978-0-19-925243-5\n}}</ref> Several states have argued that R2P should not allow the international community to intervene militarily on states, because to do so is an infringement upon sovereignty.  Others argue that this is a necessary facet of R2P, and is necessary as a last resort to stop mass atrocities.  A related argument surrounds the question as to whether more specific criteria should be developed to determine when the Security Council should authorize military intervention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stwr.org/the-un-people-politics/responsibility-to-protect-the-real-debate-on-r2p.html|title=Responsibility to Protect: The 'Real' Debate on R2P \u2013 STWR \u2013 Share The World's Resources|work=stwr.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Structural Problems ===\nPolitical scientist Roland Paris, a proponent of R2P, argues that several problems regarding usefulness and legitimacy inherent to R2P make it vulnerable to criticism: \"the more R2P is employed as a basis for military action, the more likely it is to be discredited, but paradoxically, the same will hold true if R2P\u2019s coercive tools go unused.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/09/is-it-possible-to-meet-the-responsibility-to-protect/|title=Is it possible to meet the 'Responsibility to Protect'?|last=Paris|first=Roland|date=2014-12-09|newspaper=The Washington Post|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-04-23}}</ref> Paris lists the following problems as inherent to R2P, making it difficult for proponents of R2P to defend R2P and emboldening critics:<ref name=\":4\" />\n* '''The mixed-motives problem''' \u2013 The legitimacy of R2P rests upon its altruistic aim. However, states will often be wary to engage in humanitarian intervention unless the intervention is partly rooted in self-interest. The appearance that the intervention is not strictly altruistic consequently leads some to question its legitimacy.\n* '''The counterfactual problem''' \u2013 When R2P is successful, there will not be any clear-cut evidence of its success: a mass atrocity that did not occur but would have occurred without intervention. Defenders of R2P consequently have to rely on counterfactual arguments.\n* '''The conspicuous harm problem''' \u2013 While the benefits of the intervention will not be clearly visible, the destructiveness and costs of the intervention will be visible. This makes it more difficult for proponents of the intervention to defend the intervention. The destruction caused by the intervention also makes some question the legitimacy of the intervention due to the stated purpose of preventing harm.\n* '''The end-state problem''' \u2013 Humanitarian intervention is prone to expand the mission beyond simply averting mass atrocities. When successful at averting mass atrocities, the intervenors will often be forced to take upon themselves more expansive mandates to ensure that threatened populations will be safe after the intervenors leave.\n* '''The inconsistency problem''' \u2013 Due to the aforementioned problems, in addition to the belief that a particular military action is likely to cause more harm than good, states may fail to act in situations where mass atrocities loom. The failure to intervene in any and all situations where there is a risk of mass atrocities lead to charges of inconsistency.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sovereignty]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Human security]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n* [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[International Criminal Court]]\n* [[Rwandan genocide]]\n* [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica Genocide]]\n* [[Peacekeeping]]\n* [[Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Orford, Anne.

Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary means. We accept that responsibility and will act in accordance with it. The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility and support the United Nations in establishing an early warning capability. </blockquote><blockquote>139. The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this context, we are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate, should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We stress the need for the General Assembly to continue consideration of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and its implications, bearing in mind the principles of the Charter and international law. We also intend to commit ourselves, as necessary and appropriate, to helping States build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and to assisting those which are under stress before crises and conflicts break out.</blockquote><blockquote>140. We fully support the mission of the Special Advisor of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide.</blockquote>\n\nThe above paragraphs in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document serve as the basis for the inter-governmental agreement to the Responsibility to Protect. The General Assembly adopted the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document in its resolution 60/1 of 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement|title=UN General Assembly Resolution 60/1 (16 September 2005)|last=|first=|date=24 October 2005|website=|publisher=UN|access-date=}}</ref> The body subsequently committed to continue consideration of the Responsibility to Protect with its Resolution A/Res/63/308 of October 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/unresolutiona63l80rev1.pdf|title=Resolution of the General Assembly 63/308: The responsibility to protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=GCR2P|access-date=}}</ref> The UN Security Council first reaffirmed the Responsibility to Protect in Resolution 1674 (2006) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, recalling in particular paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Summit Outcome regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Scope and limitations of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe report of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]], which first articulated the Responsibility to Protect in its December 2001 Report, envisioned a wide scope of application in its articulation of the principle, which included \"overwhelming natural or environmental catastrophes, where the state concerned is either unwilling or unable to cope, or call for assistance, and significant loss of life is occurring or threatened.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHeads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit refined the scope of the Responsibility to Protect to the four crimes mentioned in paragraphs 138 and 139, namely genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, which are commonly referred to as 'atrocity crimes' or 'mass atrocity crimes'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs per the Secretary-General's 2009 Report on the Responsibility to Protect, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect,'' \"The responsibility to protect applies, until Member States decide otherwise, only to the four specified crimes and violations: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity...To try to extend it to cover other calamities, such as HIV/AIDS, climate change or the response to natural disasters, would undermine the 2005 consensus and stretch the concept beyond recognition or operational utility.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/63/677|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe focused scope is part of what the UN Secretary-General has termed a \"narrow but deep approach\" to the Responsibility to Protect: A narrow application to four crimes, but a deep approach to response, employing the wide array of prevention and protection instruments available to Member States, the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations and civil society.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Three Pillars of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect consists of three important and mutually-reinforcing pillars, as articulated in the 2009 Report of the Secretary-General on the issue, and which build off of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and the intergovernmental agreement to the principle:\n# Pillar I: The protection responsibilities of the state;\n# Pillar II: International assistance and capacity-building;\n# Pillar III: Timely and decisive response.<ref name=\":3\" />\nAs seen in the 2005 World Outcome Document the UN Member States unanimously agreed to uphold their Responsibility to Protect. Pillar I being the protection responsibilities of the state, paragraph 138 (see definition) states \u201cEach individual state has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity\u201d. Under Pillar I many countries are able to uphold these principles of preventing mass atrocity crimes. As Pillar II leads on to international assistance and capacity-building. The international community is sent to help populations in need before further crises break out. States who may be willing but are either incapable or too weak to uphold their responsibility now may receive international support as a result of R2P. Pillar III is to deliver a timely and decisive response. This movement is a prevention method for mass atrocity crimes when a state fails to protect its populations. In reference to paragraph 139 \u201cThe international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the [UN] Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unu.edu/publications/articles/responsibility-to-protect-and-the-protection-of-civilians.html|title=The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 United Nations University|website=unu.edu|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UN Secretary-General's 2012 report, the three pillars of the Responsibility to Protect are not sequential and are of equal importance. \"Without all three, the concept would be incomplete. All three pillars must be implemented in a manner fully consistent with the purposes, principles, and provisions of the Charter''.''\"<ref name=\":2\" /> The pillared approach is intended to reinforce, not undermine state sovereignty. As per the 2009 report of the Secretary-General, \"By helping States to meet their core protection responsibilities, the responsibility to protect seeks to strengthen sovereignty, not weaken it. It seeks to help States to succeed, not just to react when they fail''.''\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== The Responsibility to Protect and 'Humanitarian Intervention' ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect differs from [[humanitarian intervention]] in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only refers to the use of military force, whereas R2P is first and foremost a preventive principle that emphasizes a range of measures to stem the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity before the crimes are threatened or occur. The use of force may only be carried out as a measure of last resort, when all other non-coercive measures have failed, and only when it is authorized by the UN Security Council.<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\">http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/libyaandr2poccasionalpaper-1.pdf</ref> This is in contrast to the principle of 'humanitarian intervention', which dubiously claims to allow for the use of force as a humanitarian imperative without the authorization of the Security Council.\n\nThe second point relates to the first. As a principle, the Responsibility to Protect is rooted firmly in existing international law, especially the law relating to sovereignty, peace and security, human rights, and armed conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/responsibility-protect-and-international-law|title=The Responsibility to Protect and International Law|work=brill.com}}</ref>\n\nThird, while humanitarian interventions have in the past been justified in the context of varying situations, R2P focuses only on the four mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The first three crimes are clearly defined in international law and codified in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. Ethnic cleansing is not a crime defined under international law, but has been defined by the UN as \"a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas\".<ref>https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514200247/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2F1994%2F674 |date=2011-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nFinally, while humanitarian intervention assumes a \"right to intervene\", the R2P is based on a \"responsibility to protect\".<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\" /> Humanitarian intervention and the R2P both agree on the fact that sovereignty is not absolute. However, the R2P doctrine shifts away from state-centered motivations to the interests of victims by focusing not on the right of states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk.<ref name=\"GSDRC 2013\">GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham</ref> In addition, it introduces a new way of looking at the essence of sovereignty, moving away from issues of \"control\" and emphasising \"responsibility\" to one's own citizens and the wider international community.<ref>Arbour, 2008; Evans, 2006\u20137</ref>\n\n== History of the Responsibility to Protect ==\n=== 1990s: Origins ===\nThe norm of the R2P was borne out of the international community's failure to respond to tragedies such as the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994 and the [[Srebrenica genocide]] in 1995.

In a radical reformulation of the meaning of state sovereignty, the report argued that sovereignty entailed not only rights but also responsibilities, specifically a state's responsibility to protect its people from major violations of human rights. This idea rested on earlier work by [[Francis Deng]] and Roberta Cohen regarding [[internally displaced person]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/03/25-internal-displacement-cohen|title=Reconciling Responsibility to Protect with IDP Protection|author=Roberta Cohen|date=25 March 2010|work=The Brookings Institution}}</ref> Inspiration may also be attributed to [[Jan Eliasson]], who in response to a questionnaire on internally displaced persons distributed by [[Francis Deng]], stated that assisting populations at risk within their own country was \"basically a question of striking a balance between sovereignty and solidarity with people in need.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mooney|first=Erin|year=2010|title=Something Old, Something New, Something Borrrowed...Something Blue?

(This does not mean that every measurement has to have been applied and been shown to fail, but that there are reasonable grounds to believe that only military action would work in that situation.)\n* Proportional means: The military means must not exceed what is necessary \"to secure the defined human protection objective\".\n* Reasonable prospects: The chance of success must be reasonably high, and it must be unlikely that the consequences of the military intervention would be worse than the consequences without the intervention.\n* Right authority: The military action has to have been authorized by the Security Council.\n\n=== 2005 World Summit Outcome Document ===\nAs the ICISS report was released in 2001, right around the time of the Second Gulf War, many thought that would be the end of this new norm. However, at the [[2005 World Summit]], where the largest number of heads of state and government in the history of the UN convened, the R2P was unanimously adopted.<ref>http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf</ref> While the outcome was close to the ideas of the ICISS report, there were some notable differences: the R2P would now only apply to mass atrocity crimes (genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing), rather than human rights violations; no mention was made of the criteria of intervention (see above); and the UN Security Council was made the only body allowed to authorize intervention. The paragraphs also stress the importance of regional organizations and the role they can play through Chapter VIII of the UN Charter.\n\nThe results of this summit led to world leaders agreeing on holding each other accountable if they fail to uphold the new responsibilities. Decidedly if one state fails to uphold their responsibility this is now where State Sovereignty may be broken in order to protect people in danger of such crimes. First peaceful action is to be taken through humanitarian, diplomatic, or other means. If these fail to resolve the matter, the international community should come together in a \u201ctimely and decisive manner\u201d. This shall all be worked on a case-by-case basis through the UN Security Council as well as the UN Charter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Secretary-General's 2009 report ===\nOn 12 January 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] issued a report entitled [http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/implementing%20the%20rtop.pdf ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'']. The report was the first comprehensive document from the [[UN Secretariat]] on the R2P, following Ban's stated commitment to turn the concept into policy. The Secretary-General's report set the tone and the direction for the discussion on the subject at the UN. The report proposes three-pillar approach to the R2P:\n\n* Pillar One stresses that states have the primary responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n* Pillar Two addresses the international community's commitment to help states build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and to help those under stress before crises and conflicts break out.\n* Pillar Three focuses on the responsibility of [[international community]] to act in a timely and decisive way to prevent and halt genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity when a state manifestly fails to protect its populations.\n\n=== Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect (GCR2P) is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that conducts research and [[advocacy]] for the Responsibility to protect. The Centre is based at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY]], [[New York City]] with an office also located in [[Geneva]].<ref>[http://www.globalr2p.org/about_us About Us, Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect]</ref>\n\n== United Nations ==\nAt the 2005 World Summit, UN member states included R2P in the Outcome Document agreeing to Paragraphs 138 and 139 as written in its Definition. These paragraphs gave final language to the scope of R2P. It applies to the four mass atrocities crimes only. It also identifies to whom the R2P protocol applies; i.e., nations first, and regional and international communities second. Since then, the UN has been actively engaged with the development of the R2P. Several resolutions, reports, and debates have emerged through the UN forum.\n\n=== Security Council ===\nThe Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to the R2P in more than 80 resolutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions and Presidential Statements Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> The first such resolution came in April 2006, when the Security Council reaffirmed the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 in [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1674(2006) Resolution 1674], formalizing their support for the R2P.

The informal interactive dialogue was held on 9 August 2010, with 49 member states, two regional organizations, and two civil society organizations speaking at the event. The discussion had a resoundingly positive tone, with virtually all of those that spoke stressing a need to prevent atrocities and agreeing that effective early warning is a necessary condition for effective prevention and early action.

The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide acts as a catalyst to raise awareness of the causes and dynamics of genocide, to alert relevant actors where there is a risk of genocide, and to advocate and mobilize for appropriate action. The mandates of the two Special Advisers are distinct but complementary. The efforts of their Office include alerting relevant actors to the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity; enhancing the capacity of the UN to prevent these crimes, including their incitement; and working with member states, regional and sub-regional arrangements, and civil society to develop more effective means of response when they do occur.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth Special Advisers Deng and Luck ended their assignments with the Office in July 2012.

On 30 December 2007, [[Mwai Kibaki]] was declared the winner of the presidential elections and was sworn in as president a couple of hours later. The announcement of the results triggered widespread and systematic violence resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and the displacement of over 500,000 civilians. Clashes were characterized by the ethnically targeted killings of people aligned with the two major political parties, the [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM) and the [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|Party of National Unity]] (PNU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-kenya|title=The Crisis in Kenya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nExternal intervention was almost immediate. French Foreign and European Affairs Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] made an appeal to the UN Security Council in January 2008 to react \"in the name of the responsibility to protect\" before Kenya plunged into a deadly ethnic conflict. On 31 December 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement expressing concern for the ongoing violence and calling for the population to remain calm and for Kenyan security forces to show restraint. On 10 January 2008, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was accepted by both the ODM and the PNU as the African Union Chief Mediator. Mediation efforts led to the signing of a power-sharing agreement on 28 February 2008. The agreement established Mwai Kibaki as President and [[Raila Odinga]] as Prime Minister, as well as the creation of three commissions: the [[Waki Commission|Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence]] (CIPEV); the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; and the [[Kriegler Commission|Independent Review Commission]] on the General Elections.

Deploring what it called \"the gross and systematic violation of human rights\" in strife-torn Libya, the Security Council demanded an end to the violence, \"recalling the Libyan authorities' responsibility to protect its population\", and imposed a series of international sanctions. The Council also decided to refer the situation to the [[International Criminal Court]].\n\nIn resolution 1973, adopted on 17 March 2011, the Security Council demanded an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to ongoing attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute \"crimes against humanity\". The Council authorized member states to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory. A few days later, acting on the resolution, [[NATO]] planes started striking at Gaddafi's forces.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml|title=Background Information on the Responsibility to Protect \u2014 Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations|work=un.org}}</ref> NATO subsequently came under scrutiny for its behavior during the air strikes; concerns included the fact that the intervention quickly moved to [[regime-change]] and that there were allegations regarding aerial bombardments that may have caused civilian casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-libya#violence|title=Crisis in Libya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Central African Republic (CAR) 2013 ===\nIn December 2012, a loose rebel coalition named the [[S\u00e9l\u00e9ka]] initiated a military campaign to overthrow the government of the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR) and its then-president, [[Francois Boziz\u00e9]]. The S\u00e9l\u00e9ka, composed mostly of factions of armed groups in the northeast of the state, accused Boziz\u00e9's government of neglecting their region. They rapidly captured several strategic towns and were poised to take the capital city of [[Bangui]]. A hasty intervention by Chad and the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS) persuaded the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka to negotiate with Boziz\u00e9's government. The result, the Libreville Agreement of January 2013, installed a three-year power-sharing arrangement.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\">{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-the-central-african-republic|title=Crisis in CAR|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ECCAS failed to monitor the implementation of the Libreville Agreement and Boziz\u00e9 did not undertake any of the reforms necessary under the transition agreement. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka resurged and took control of Bangui and fifteen of CAR's sixteen provinces on 24 March 2013. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka's leader, [[Michel Djotodia]], proclaimed himself President, set up the National Transitional Council (NTC), and suspended CAR's constitution. A hurried ECCAS summit on 4 April 2013, which did not yet recognize Djotodia as President, called for the creation of a Transitional National Council (TNC), which would create a new constitution, conduct elections in eighteen months, and select an interim President. On 13 April, the TNC chose the sole candidate vying for interim president position, Michel Djotodia.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\" />\n\nFrom December 2012 onward, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces, who are predominantly Muslim, committed grave human rights abuses against civilians throughout the country and especially targeted the majority Christian population.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In response, Christian civilians formed \"[[anti-balaka]]\" (\"anti-machete\") militias, which have conducted vicious reprisals against Muslims. Extrajudicial killings of Muslim and Christian civilians have been carried out, including \"door to door\" searches by rival militias and mobs seeking potential victims.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/central_african_republic|title=Central African Republic: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|work=globalr2p.org}}</ref>\n\nThe situation in CAR rapidly deteriorated after 5 December 2013, after an attack in Bangui by anti-balaka militias and loyalists of ousted President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9. The attack against former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels sparked widespread violence throughout the capital as well as in Ouham province in the northwest. The violence marked a significant escalation of the conflict in CAR. Anti-balaka forces launched another attack against Muslim neighborhoods of Bangui on 20 December, spurring a cycle of renewed violence that led to at least 71 deaths by 24 December. A mass grave of at least 30 people who were reportedly executed and exhibited signs of torture was discovered on 25 December. The [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) estimates a further 40 civilians were killed on 25 December as violence continued between anti-balaka and ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces. Eight African Union (AU) peacekeepers were also killed between 25 and 26 December.<ref name=CARtimeline>http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/car-timeline-22-jan-14.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to OCHA, by September 2013 there were almost 400,000 internally displaced people and about 65,000 new refugees in neighbouring countries. Humanitarian agencies have alerted public opinion to the critical situation, stressing that 2.3 million CAR citizens (half the population) are in need of humanitarian assistance.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\">http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/B096-central-african-republic-better-late-than-never.pdf</ref>\n\n==== CAR and the R2P ====\nThe crisis in the CAR is a case for the R2P, due to mass atrocity crimes being committed by both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/12/18/central-african-republic-sectarian-atrocities-escalate|title=Central African Republic: Sectarian Atrocities Escalate \u2013 Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org}}</ref> During a Security Council briefing on 25 November, UN Deputy-Secretary-General [[Jan Eliasson]] said that the world faced \"a profoundly important test of international solidarity and of our responsibility to protect\" in CAR. The Security Council passed [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2127(2013) Resolution 2127] on 5 December, emphasizing that the NTC has the primary responsibility to protect the civilian population in CAR. The resolution granted a Chapter VII mandate to AU and French forces to protect civilians and restore security, imposed an arms embargo, and established a UN Commission of Inquiry.<ref name=CARtimeline />\n\nIn the beginning, the international response to the coup was purely diplomatic: members of the International Contact Group insisted that Michel Djotodia respect the principles set out in the Libreville agreement. The African Union was the first to react when it announced a new African-led International Support Mission for CAR ([[MISCA]]) in July 2013. However, MISCA has not been effective in reversing the deteriorating security situation. Although its mandate is well-defined, there is general agreement that it does not have the resources to fulfill its mission. The UN General Assembly put CAR on the international agenda in September. [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2121(2013) Resolution 2121], adopted on 10 October 2013 and sponsored by France, strengthened and broadened the mandate of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA). Aware that MISCA alone is unable to adequately tackle the growing insecurity, France has changed its initial position from disengagement to military contribution, as announced by [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] on 20 November 2013, who said that French forces would be reinforced by almost 1,000 troops for a six-month period.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\" /> France began to deploy troops in CAR after receiving authorization from the Security Council on 5 December 2013 with Resolution 2127, which authorizes MISCA and French forces to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians and restore security in CAR. French soldiers immediately began to patrol in Bangui.<ref name=CARtimeline />\n\nOn 7 February 2014, it was reported that the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor [[Fatou Bensouda]] said that she had \"opened a preliminary investigation into possible war crimes in the Central African Republic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26089189|title=ICC opens CAR 'war crimes' preliminary investigation|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n=== Syria ===\nOver the last nine years, Syria has been in constant conflict, which has led to the death of 500,000 people, 5 million refugees, and 7 million internally displaced persons. To help stop these atrocities the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), the UN, European Union, the League of Arab States, and other countries had agreed to meet to discuss the situation at stake. The conclusion was made that the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which increased the delivery of humanitarian aid, as well as a nationwide cessation of hostilities, was required in order to help those in need. The Commission on Inquiry, mandated by the Human Rights Council, has found the Syrian government, while working with allied militias, has committed large-scale massacres, perpetrated war crimes and gross violations of international humanitarian law as a matter of state policy. The Commission of Inquiry's third report had stated that the government had committed crimes against humanity through extermination, murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance, and other inhuman acts. Due to this statement the UN Human Rights Council has adopted at least 16 different resolutions with regard to the atrocities taking place in Syria.  Despite all efforts and resolutions adopted to help uphold R2P, humanitarian aid has had limited success in reaching the affected populations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/|title=Populations at Risk: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Burundi ===\nThe country of Burundi is at grave risk for a possible civil war, if violence is not stopped. The civilians of Burundi face the serious and eminent risk of mass atrocities due to the ongoing political violence that threatens the stability of Burundi.  The citizens of Burundi are being harmed through mass atrocity crimes due to targeted killings, widespread violations and abuses of human rights. Violence had increased after President Pierre Nkurnziza had announced he was seeking a third term in the country\u2019s elections, and instructing his citizens to disarm or face action by Burundian Security forces and be labeled enemies of the nation. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reports cases of sexual violence by security forces, hate speech, and incitement to violence by some government officials. Responses by the international community include a Security Council-mandated police force with the goal of monitoring the situation. This police force has been rejected by Burundi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/burundi|title=Burundi|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Yemen Crisis===\nWith the current armed conflict in Yemen, many civilians are facing mass atrocity crimes. These crimes are a result of the violence between pro-government forces and regional military as they fight against the Houthi rebels. The Houthi rebels and pro-Saleh personnel currently control a majority of Yemen, including the country's capital, Sana\u2019a. In addition to the violence between these groups the nation has also been barraged by Saudi-led airstrikes for years.

According to the first pillar of R2P, the state has the responsibility to protect its populations from mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing, and according to the second pillar the international community has the responsibility to help states fulfill their responsibility. Advocates of R2P claim that the only occasions where the international community will intervene in a state without its consent is when the state is either allowing mass atrocities to occur, or is committing them, in which case the state is no longer upholding its responsibilities as a sovereign. In this sense, R2P can be understood as reinforcing sovereignty.<ref>Ban Ki-moon, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'', p. 7-8</ref> In 2004, the [[High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]], set up by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, endorsed the emerging norm of R2P, stating that there is a collective international responsibility \"...exercisable by the Security Council authorizing military intervention as a last resort, in the event of genocide and other large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing, and serious violations of humanitarian law which sovereign governments have proved powerless or unwilling to prevent.\"<ref name=\"un.org\" />\n\n=== Libya, 2011 ===\nOn March 19, 2011, the Security Council approved [[Resolution 1973]], which reiterated the responsibility of the Libyan authorities to protect the Libyan population.

While the doctrine was initially invoked to protect against government reprisals in rebel-held Benghazi, the resulting operation grew in scope to support the total overthrow of the government.

These were vetoed by Russia and China. The Russian and Chinese governments both issued statements to the effect that, in their opinion, R2P had been abused by the U.S. as a pretext for \"regime change\", more particularly in the case of Libya, and that as far as they were concerned they would be extremely suspicious of any future Security Council resolutions invoking R2P, based on past experience. According to the UN's own 4 October 2011 coverage of the meeting of the Security Council:\n\n<blockquote>[Russia's UN Ambassador [[Vitaly Churkin]]] was alarmed that compliance with Security Council resolutions in Libya had been considered a model for future actions by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It was important to see how that model had been implemented. The demand for a ceasefire had turned into a civil war, the humanitarian, social and military consequences of which had spilled beyond Libya. The arms embargo had turned into a naval blockade on west Libya. Such models should be excluded from global practice.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[\u2026] [China's UN Ambassador [[Li Baodong]]] hoped that the [Syrian] Government would follow through on reform and a process of dialogue. The Council should encourage those objectives while respecting Syria's sovereignty's [sic] and territorial integrity.

However, states will often be wary to engage in humanitarian intervention unless the intervention is partly rooted in self-interest. The appearance that the intervention is not strictly altruistic consequently leads some to question its legitimacy.\n* '''The counterfactual problem''' \u2013 When R2P is successful, there will not be any clear-cut evidence of its success: a mass atrocity that did not occur but would have occurred without intervention. Defenders of R2P consequently have to rely on counterfactual arguments.\n* '''The conspicuous harm problem''' \u2013 While the benefits of the intervention will not be clearly visible, the destructiveness and costs of the intervention will be visible. This makes it more difficult for proponents of the intervention to defend the intervention. The destruction caused by the intervention also makes some question the legitimacy of the intervention due to the stated purpose of preventing harm.\n* '''The end-state problem''' \u2013 Humanitarian intervention is prone to expand the mission beyond simply averting mass atrocities. When successful at averting mass atrocities, the intervenors will often be forced to take upon themselves more expansive mandates to ensure that threatened populations will be safe after the intervenors leave.\n* '''The inconsistency problem''' \u2013 Due to the aforementioned problems, in addition to the belief that a particular military action is likely to cause more harm than good, states may fail to act in situations where mass atrocities loom. The failure to intervene in any and all situations where there is a risk of mass atrocities lead to charges of inconsistency.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sovereignty]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Human security]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n* [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[International Criminal Court]]\n* [[Rwandan genocide]]\n* [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica Genocide]]\n* [[Peacekeeping]]\n* [[Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Orford, Anne.

It is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] composed of a [[sodium]] cation (Na<sup>+</sup>) and a [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>). Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is [[crystal]]line, but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, [[alkaline]] taste resembling that of washing soda ([[sodium carbonate]]). The natural mineral form is [[nahcolite]]. It is a component of the mineral [[natron]] and is found dissolved in many [[mineral spring]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nBecause it has long been known and is widely used, the salt has many related names such as '''baking soda''', '''bread soda''', '''cooking soda''', and '''bicarbonate of soda'''. The term ''baking soda'' is more common in the United States, whereas ''bicarbonate of soda'' is more common in Australia and Britain.<ref>https://www.thatslife.com.au/bicarbonate-of-soda-baking-soda-baking-powder-difference</ref> In colloquial usage, the names sodium bicarbonate and bicarbonate of soda are often truncated; forms such as sodium bicarb, bicarb soda, bicarbonate, and bicarb are common.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe word ''saleratus'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sal \u00e6ratus'' (meaning \"aerated salt\"), was widely used in the [[19th century]] for both sodium bicarbonate and [[potassium bicarbonate]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIt is known as one of the [[E number]] food additives '''E500'''.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe prefix ''bi'' in ''bicarbonate'' comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much [[carbonate]] (CO<sub>3</sub>) per sodium in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) as there is in [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). The modern chemical formulas of these compounds express their precise chemical compositions (which were unknown when the names ''sodium carbonate'' and ''sodium bicarbonate'' were coined) as sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). These names are unambiguous since sodium always has the +1 [[oxidation state]] and carbonate the \u22122 oxidation state.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Cooking===\n==== Leavening ====\n{{Main|Leavening agent}}\nIn cooking, baking soda is primarily used in [[baking]] as a [[leavening agent]]. When it reacts with acid, carbon dioxide is released, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, [[quick bread]]s, [[soda bread]], and other baked and fried foods. The acid-base reaction can be generically represented as follows:<ref>{{cite book | editor=A.J. Bent | title=The Technology of Cake Making | edition=6 | year=1997 | page=102 | publisher=Springer | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=OTy8aIWxHhQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\n:NaHCO<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sup>+</sup>   \u2192   Na<sup>+</sup>  +  CO<sub>2</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nAcidic materials that induce this reaction include [[Monohydrogen phosphate|hydrogen phosphates]], [[cream of tartar]], [[Lemon|lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[buttermilk]], [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]], and [[vinegar]]. Baking soda may be used together with [[sourdough]], which is acidic, making a lighter product with a less acidic taste.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uaf.edu/files/ces/publications-db/catalog/hec/FNH-00061.pdf|title=Sourdough, Julie Cascio, University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service, 2 May 2017, pub. FNH-00061|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHeat can also by itself cause sodium bicarbonate to act as a raising agent in baking because of [[thermal decomposition]], releasing carbon dioxide at temperatures above {{convert|80|C|F|-1}}, as follows:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://foodreference.about.com/od/Ingredients_Basics/a/What-Is-Baking-Soda.htm|title=The Many Practical Uses of Baking Soda in the Kitchen|newspaper=About.com Food|access-date=2017-01-22|quote=In a nutshell, the [https://www.thankyourbody.com/uses-for-baking-soda/ uses for baking soda] are many: It deodorizes, neutralizes, and cleans all without the toxic mess of most commercial products.}}</ref>\n\n: 2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nWhen used this way on its own, without the presence of an acidic component (whether in the batter or by the use of a baking powder containing acid), only half the available CO<sub>2</sub> is released (one CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is formed for every two equivalents of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). Additionally, in the absence of acid, thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate also produces [[sodium carbonate]], which is strongly alkaline and gives the baked product a bitter, \"soapy\" taste and a yellow color.

It is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] composed of a [[sodium]] cation (Na<sup>+</sup>) and a [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>). Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is [[crystal]]line, but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, [[alkaline]] taste resembling that of washing soda ([[sodium carbonate]]). The natural mineral form is [[nahcolite]]. It is a component of the mineral [[natron]] and is found dissolved in many [[mineral spring]]s.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nBecause it has long been known and is widely used, the salt has many related names such as '''baking soda''', '''bread soda''', '''cooking soda''', and '''bicarbonate of soda'''. The term ''baking soda'' is more common in the United States, whereas ''bicarbonate of soda'' is more common in Australia and Britain.<ref>https://www.thatslife.com.au/bicarbonate-of-soda-baking-soda-baking-powder-difference</ref> In colloquial usage, the names sodium bicarbonate and bicarbonate of soda are often truncated; forms such as sodium bicarb, bicarb soda, bicarbonate, and bicarb are common.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe word ''saleratus'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sal \u00e6ratus'' (meaning \"aerated salt\"), was widely used in the [[19th century]] for both sodium bicarbonate and [[potassium bicarbonate]].{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nIt is known as one of the [[E number]] food additives '''E500'''.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe prefix ''bi'' in ''bicarbonate'' comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much [[carbonate]] (CO<sub>3</sub>) per sodium in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) as there is in [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). The modern chemical formulas of these compounds express their precise chemical compositions (which were unknown when the names ''sodium carbonate'' and ''sodium bicarbonate'' were coined) as sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). These names are unambiguous since sodium always has the +1 [[oxidation state]] and carbonate the \u22122 oxidation state.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Cooking===\n==== Leavening ====\n{{Main|Leavening agent}}\nIn cooking, baking soda is primarily used in [[baking]] as a [[leavening agent]]. When it reacts with acid, carbon dioxide is released, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, [[quick bread]]s, [[soda bread]], and other baked and fried foods. The acid-base reaction can be generically represented as follows:<ref>{{cite book | editor=A.J.

Additionally, in the absence of acid, thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate also produces [[sodium carbonate]], which is strongly alkaline and gives the baked product a bitter, \"soapy\" taste and a yellow color. Since the reaction occurs slowly at room temperature, mixtures (cake batter, etc.) can be allowed to stand without rising until they are heated in the oven.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nWhen adding acid, alkaline ingredients such as whole milk or [[Dutch process chocolate|Dutch-processed]] [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]] are often added to baked foods to avoid an over-acidic taste from the added acid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joythebaker.com/2013/10/baking-101-the-difference-between-baking-soda-and-baking-powder|title=Baking 101: The Difference Between Baking Soda and Baking Powder|work=Joy the Baker|accessdate=2015-08-04}}</ref>\n\n==== Baking powder ====\n{{main|Baking powder}}\n[[Baking powder]], also sold for cooking, contains around 30% of bicarbonate, and various acidic ingredients which are activated by the addition of water, without the need for additional acids in the cooking medium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/food/6D.pdf|title=THE CHEMISTRY OF BAKING|author=Czernohorsky,  J.

Stowe showed that slavery touched all of society, beyond the people directly involved as masters, traders and slaves. Her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery, and aroused opposition in the South. In the South, Stowe was depicted as out of touch, arrogant, and guilty of slander.

By 1888, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that as a result of dementia the 77-year-old Stowe started writing ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' over again. She imagined that she was engaged in the original composition, and for several hours every day she industriously used pen and paper, inscribing passages of the book almost exactly word for word. This was done unconsciously from memory, the authoress imagining that she composed the matter as she went along. To her diseased mind the story was brand new, and she frequently exhausted herself with labor which she regarded as freshly created.<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/articles/n2ar19cmt.html \"Rewriting Uncle Tom\"] Retrieved September 6, 2013.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Mark Twain]], a neighbor of Stowe's in Hartford, recalled her last years in the following passage of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.

Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it.  She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes.  And she had other moods.

In the research library, which is open to the public, there are numerous letters and documents from the Beecher family. The house is open to the public and offers house tours on the hour.<ref>https://www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/visit/the-stowe-center/</ref>\n\nIn 1833, during Stowe's time in [[Cincinnati]], the city was afflicted with a serious [[cholera]] epidemic. To avoid illness, Stowe made a visit to [[Washington, Kentucky]], a major community of the era just south of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]]. She stayed with the Marshall Key family, one of whose daughters was a student at Lane Seminary. It is recorded that Mr. Key took her to see a slave auction, as they were frequently held in Maysville. Scholars believe she was strongly moved by the experience. The Marshall Key home still stands in Washington. Key was a prominent Kentuckian; his visitors also included [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]].<ref>Calvert and Klee, ''Towns of Mason County [KY]'', {{LCCN|8662637}}{{dead link|date=June 2019}}, 1986, Maysville and Mason County Library, Historical, and Scientific Association.</ref>\n\nThe Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site is part of the restored Dawn Settlement at [[Dresden, Ontario]], which is 20 miles east of [[Algonac, Michigan]]. The community for freed slaves founded by the Rev. Josiah Henson and other abolitionists in the 1830s has been restored. There's also a museum.

She came from the [[Beecher family]], a famous religious family, and is best known for her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which depicts the harsh conditions for enslaved African Americans. The book reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and Great Britain, energizing anti-slavery forces in the [[Northern United States|American North]], while provoking widespread anger in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Stowe wrote 30 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and her public stances and debates on social issues of the day.\n\n==Life and work==\nHarriet Elisabeth Beecher was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]], on June 14, 1811.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">McFarland, Philip. ''Loves of Harriet Beecher Stowe''. New York: Grove Press, 2007: 112. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-4390-7}}</ref> She was the sixth of 11 children {{sfn|Hedrick|1994|p=6}} born to outspoken [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] preacher [[Lyman Beecher]]. Her mother was his first wife, Roxana (Foote), a deeply religious woman who died when Stowe was only five years old. Roxana's maternal grandfather was General Andrew Ward of the Revolutionary War. Her notable siblings included a sister, [[Catharine Beecher]], who became an educator and author, as well as brothers who became ministers: including [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who became a famous preacher and abolitionist, [[Charles Beecher]], and [[Edward Beecher]].<ref>Applegate, Debby (2006).

Stowe showed that slavery touched all of society, beyond the people directly involved as masters, traders and slaves. Her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery, and aroused opposition in the South. In the South, Stowe was depicted as out of touch, arrogant, and guilty of slander.

By 1888, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that as a result of dementia the 77-year-old Stowe started writing ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' over again. She imagined that she was engaged in the original composition, and for several hours every day she industriously used pen and paper, inscribing passages of the book almost exactly word for word. This was done unconsciously from memory, the authoress imagining that she composed the matter as she went along. To her diseased mind the story was brand new, and she frequently exhausted herself with labor which she regarded as freshly created.<ref>[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/articles/n2ar19cmt.html \"Rewriting Uncle Tom\"] Retrieved September 6, 2013.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Mark Twain]], a neighbor of Stowe's in Hartford, recalled her last years in the following passage of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure.  She wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular Irish woman.  Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather.  Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it.  She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes.  And she had other moods.

''www.bcdb.com'', April 12, 2012</ref> It was known for introducing [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Tweety]], [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]], [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], [[Speedy Gonzales]], [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]], struggling rapist (you can\u2019t stop us), and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ \"Movie Reviews: Space Jam\".] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.</ref> the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.<ref name=\"JerryBeck\">{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}</ref> The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.\n\nIn 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nIn 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

This continued until 2008, when [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6|the final volume of the Golden Collection]] was released.

However, Warner retained the rights to the cartoons and the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' brand names, leaving their former producer Leon Schlesinger to start his own Warner Bros. studio and continue the ''Looney Tunes'' series. With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. Since then, Warner Bros. has owned all rights to all post-1933 characters created by Leon Schlesinger Productions and Warner Bros. Cartoons. The rights to individual cartoons however are in other hands.\n\nIn 1955, Warner Bros. sold the television distribution rights to 191 of its cartoons (which included the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' and the black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made after Harman and Ising left) to Guild Films.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=2005-09-03|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ/page/n5 6]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> The copyrights to those cartoons were assigned to [[Sunset Productions]], an entity owned by Warner Bros.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/variety197-1955-02/page/n185/mode/2up|title=Guild Acquires 191 WB Cartoons|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1955-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLNkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176|title=Hollywood TV: The Studio System in the Fifties}}</ref> The cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and was bought by Seven Arts.

Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]] and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ \"Movie Reviews: Space Jam\".] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.</ref> the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.<ref name=\"JerryBeck\">{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}</ref> The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.\n\nIn 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nIn 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

However, Warner retained the rights to the cartoons and the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' brand names, leaving their former producer Leon Schlesinger to start his own Warner Bros. studio and continue the ''Looney Tunes'' series. With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. Since then, Warner Bros. has owned all rights to all post-1933 characters created by Leon Schlesinger Productions and Warner Bros. Cartoons. The rights to individual cartoons however are in other hands.\n\nIn 1955, Warner Bros. sold the television distribution rights to 191 of its cartoons (which included the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' and the black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made after Harman and Ising left) to Guild Films.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=2005-09-03|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ/page/n5 6]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> The copyrights to those cartoons were assigned to [[Sunset Productions]], an entity owned by Warner Bros.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/variety197-1955-02/page/n185/mode/2up|title=Guild Acquires 191 WB Cartoons|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1955-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLNkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176|title=Hollywood TV: The Studio System in the Fifties}}</ref> The cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and was bought by Seven Arts.
