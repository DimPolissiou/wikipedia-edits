One evening, he dropped forged letters near the Maldeo's camp in such a way that they were sure to be intercepted. These letters indicated, falsely, that some of Maldeo's army commanders were promising assistance to Sher Shah.

Puran Mal's daughter was given to [[minstrels]] to be a dancing girl while his three nephews were [[castrated]]. As an excuse for the treachery, Sher Shah claimed it as a revenge for enslavement of Muslim women and that he had once, when seriously ill, pledged to wipe out the [[Rajputs of Raisen]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Eraly |first=Abraham |author-link=Abraham Eraly |year=2002 |orig-year=First published 1997 |title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04ellRQx4nMC&pg=PA91 |publisher=Penguin Books India |pages=91\u201392 |isbn=978-0-14-100143-2}}</ref>\n\n==Conquest of Marwar==\n{{Main|Battle of Sammel}}\nIn 1543, Sher Shah Suri with a huge force of 80,000 cavalry set out against [[Maldeo Rathore]] (a [[Rajput]] king of [[Marwar]]). Maldeo Rathore with an army of 50,000 cavalry advanced to face Sher Shah's army. Instead of marching to the enemy's capital Sher Shah halted in the village of Sammel in the pargana of Jaitaran, ninety kilometres east of Jodhpur. After one month of skirmishing, Sher Shah's position became critical owing to the difficulties of food supplies for his huge army. To resolve this situation, Sher Shah resorted to a cunning ploy. One evening, he dropped forged letters near the Maldeo's camp in such a way that they were sure to be intercepted. These letters indicated, falsely, that some of Maldeo's army commanders were promising assistance to Sher Shah. This caused great consternation to Maldeo, who immediately (and wrongly) suspected his commanders of disloyalty. Maldeo left for Jodhpur with his own men, abandoning his commanders to their fate.<ref name=Majumdar1>{{cite book |editor-last=Majumdar |editor-first=R. C. |editor-link=R. C.

Mill 2 burned down in 1995.  Mill 1 suffered devastating damage in a second fire in 1998.\n\nDeveloper Uri Kaufman purchased the complex in 2000.\n\nIn 2005\u20132006, a portion of Mill 3 was renovated and turned into high-end residential lofts.  The 96 loft apartments completed in this first phase were at 100% occupancy by July, 2006.

Completed in the year 1837, Mill No. 1 stood as the first textile mill to house the operations of the newly founded Harmony Manufacturing Company. Mimicking the gable-roofed like structures common to the Greek revival movement, these impressive architectural features can still be appreciated today. The construction of this mill prompted the realignment of the Erie Canal which originally sat on the east side to be shifted to the west side of the building (1837-1842). The east side was then used as a hydraulic canal for the growing company. Its location was critical since the western side of the building sat just a few yards from the Erie Canal's lock No. 16.<ref name=\"nrhpinv\" /> Despite its vast potential, the original owners failed to produce profits and in 1850 the building was acquired by Thomas Garner of New York City and Alfred Wild of Kinderhook, NY.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=Robert M.|date=1973|title=Report of the Mohawk-Hudson Area Survey|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5479/si.00810258.26.1|journal=Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology|issue=26|pages=1\u2013210|doi=10.5479/si.00810258.26.1|issn=0081-0258}}</ref> The mastermind and convincing figure behind this purchase was Robert Johnston. A skilled cotton mill worker with years of experience, Johnston was hired on as the company's new supervisor by the proprietors. Almost immediately, he proved himself worthy of the undertaking and under his leadership the company required the addition to the original Mill No.1. It consisted of an architecturally pleasing 5-story 274 foot long building and featured a large tower and arched entryway.<ref name=\"nrhpinv\" />\n\n=== '''Picker House / Storehouse / Pump House''' ===\nIn the year 1853, the inclusion of the Picker House was required to increase the efficiency of the growing production. To meet these needs, the Picker House was utilized for the opening and cleaning of the imported cotton bales as well as a storage space. This building and the structural portion of the walkway to Mill No.1 still remain today.<ref name=\"nrhpinv\" />\n\n=== '''Mill No.2''' ===\nErected in the year 1857, Mill No. 2 was a symbol of the ever growing production of cotton goods in Cohoes. This mill acted as an extension of Mill No.1 and later called for a fourth floor mansard roof addition in 1866.  <sup>\u00a0</sup>Unfortunately, the mill suffered severe damage from a fire in 1995 an has since been demolished.<ref name=\"nrhpinv\" />\n\n=== '''Mill No.3 \u00a0''' ===\nYears of continued success and an increase in production had allowed the most significant on the mills to begin construction in 1866. With the first phase completed in 1868 and the second shortly after in 1872, Mill No. 3 stood with an astonishing foot print of 1,185 feet in length and 70-76 feet wide. Standing five stories tall and featuring gorgeous Victorian styled aesthetic features such as the mansard roof and the bronze statue of Thomas Garner near the front two towers, Mill No. 3 was a symbol of tremendous success for the Harmony Factories. Housed in the basement of the mill were two 800 horsepower Boyden turbines which powered all of the machinery in that mill.<ref name=\"nrhpinv\" />\n\n=== '''Mill No.4''' ===\nIn 1872 the Harmony Company acquired what used to be the Van Benthuysen Mill and converted it into another cotton mill. This mill\u2019s main responsibility was the production cotton bags and jute. <ref name=\"nrhpinv\" />\n\n=== '''Miscellaneous Buildings''' ===\nIn addition the main mills, there was the Boiler House (c. 1911), Office and Sunday School Building (c. 1853), and the Generator Plant. Today the Office and Sunday school building is utilized as a commercial building and is currently leased out by a Salon.\n\n=== '''Tenements''' ===\nThe quick growth of the Harmony Mills accompanied by a large influx of immigrants, allotted the Johnston\u2019s the opportunity to provide an easily adaptable community to entire newcomers. To do so, they constructed over 800 tenements to house these immigrants and their families at very mere costs as long as they worked in the mills. This allowed the mills to employ over five thousand operatives and assisted Cohoes in becoming the nation\u2019s largest producers of wool knit goods in the 1860\u2019s. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Walkowitz, Daniel J.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/993276133|title=Worker city, company town : iron and cotton-worker protest in Troy and Cohoes, New York, 1855-84|date=1981|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-00915-0|oclc=993276133}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:HarmonyMills fromAcross HAER cropped.jpg|Viewed across Mohawk River, in HAER photo from 1969\nImage:HarmonyMills HAER cropped.jpg|Harmony Mill No. 3, in 1969\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Architecture|National Register of Historic Places}}\n*[[Albany Felt Company Complex]], a similar residential conversion of a historic industrial property by the same developer.\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in New York]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Albany County, New York]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Harmony Mills}}\n*[http://www.harmonymillslofts.com Harmony Mills residential lofts]\n*{{HAER |survey=NY-5 |id=ny0028 |title=Harmony Manufacturing Company, Mill Number 3, 100 North Mohawk Street, Cohoes, Albany County, NY |photos=33 |data=16 |cap=1}}\n*{{HAER |survey=NY-544 |id=ny2386 |title=Harmony Manufacturing Company, Mill Number 1, 100 North Mohawk Street, Cohoes, Albany County, NY |photos=4 |cap=1 |link=no}}\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New York}}\n\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Erie Canal parks, trails, and historic sites]]\n[[Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1872]]\n[[Category:Cohoes, New York]]\n[[Category:Cotton mills in the United States]]\n[[Category:Historic districts in Albany County, New York]]\n[[Category:Historic American Engineering Record in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, New York]]\n[[Category:Textile mills in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NRHP\n| name =Harmony Mills Historic District\n| nrhp_type = nhld | nocat = yes \n| image = Harmony Mills, Cohoes, NY.jpg\n| caption = Partial front elevation of mill building in 2008\n| location = [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]], [[New York (state)|NY]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|42|46|52|N|73|42|15|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin = New York#USA\n| area = \n| built =\n| architect= \n| architecture= [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]]\n| designated_nrhp_type = January 20, 1999<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=-1568528353&ResourceType=District|title=Harmony Mills|date=2007-09-14|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605234029/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=-1568528353&ResourceType=District|archive-date=2011-06-05|df=}}</ref>\n| added = January 12, 1978<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2007a}}</ref>\n| governing_body = Local\n| refnum=78003151\n}}\n'''Harmony Mills''', in [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]], is an industrial district that is bordered by the [[Mohawk River]] and the tracks of the former Troy and Schenectady Railroad (now the Mohawk-Hudson bike trail).

Mill 2 burned down in 1995.  Mill 1 suffered devastating damage in a second fire in 1998.\n\nDeveloper Uri Kaufman purchased the complex in 2000.\n\nIn 2005\u20132006, a portion of Mill 3 was renovated and turned into high-end residential lofts.  The 96 loft apartments completed in this first phase were at 100% occupancy by July, 2006.  A second phase containing 135 units was completed in 2010, adding a pool and spa and other luxury amenities.  This phase\u201498% leased as of July, 2012\u2014was called Harmony Mills Fallsview Luxury Apartments because of the views of the Cohoes Falls.\n\nA third phase, restoring Mills 1 & 4 was commenced in early 2013.  Mill 4 was completed in early December, 2013.  31 of its 33 loft apartments were pre-leased prior to receipt of the Certificate of Occupancy on December 6, 2013.  In all, the Harmony Mills now contains 340 luxury loft apartments.\n\nThe revival of the Mills sparked a revival of the City of Cohoes.  In the 2010 census, the City gained population for the first time since 1930.  According to a study by the Center for Economic Growth, Cohoes was the fastest growing city in New York State in both 2015 and 2016.<ref>http://www.ceg.org/articles/cohoes-repeats-states-fastest-growing-city/</ref>  The project has been hailed as a prime example of how adaptive re-use of historic buildings can revitalize cities, while clearing urban blight in an environmentally friendly manner.\n\nFor his efforts in restoring the Harmony Mills, Uri Kaufman was awarded the New York State Preservation League Excellence Award.<ref>http://www.preservenys.org/uploads/3/1/6/2/31626961/pr-harmonymills-final.pdf</ref>  The Harmony Mills is featured on the Home Page of the New York State Historic Preservation Office Website, as a leading example of historic preservation development.<ref>http://nysparks.com/shpo/</ref>\n\n=== Mill No. 1 ===\nDue to the powerful Mohawk River Falls and the introduction of the [[Erie Canal]], the location of the Harmony Mills was key to the success and vast expansion of the company. Completed in the year 1837, Mill No. 1 stood as the first textile mill to house the operations of the newly founded Harmony Manufacturing Company. Mimicking the gable-roofed like structures common to the Greek revival movement, these impressive architectural features can still be appreciated today. The construction of this mill prompted the realignment of the Erie Canal which originally sat on the east side to be shifted to the west side of the building (1837-1842). The east side was then used as a hydraulic canal for the growing company. Its location was critical since the western side of the building sat just a few yards from the Erie Canal's lock No. 16.<ref name=\"nrhpinv\" /> Despite its vast potential, the original owners failed to produce profits and in 1850 the building was acquired by Thomas Garner of New York City and Alfred Wild of Kinderhook, NY.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=Robert M.|date=1973|title=Report of the Mohawk-Hudson Area Survey|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5479/si.00810258.26.1|journal=Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology|issue=26|pages=1\u2013210|doi=10.5479/si.00810258.26.1|issn=0081-0258}}</ref> The mastermind and convincing figure behind this purchase was Robert Johnston. A skilled cotton mill worker with years of experience, Johnston was hired on as the company's new supervisor by the proprietors. Almost immediately, he proved himself worthy of the undertaking and under his leadership the company required the addition to the original Mill No.1. It consisted of an architecturally pleasing 5-story 274 foot long building and featured a large tower and arched entryway.<ref name=\"nrhpinv\" />\n\n=== '''Picker House / Storehouse / Pump House''' ===\nIn the year 1853, the inclusion of the Picker House was required to increase the efficiency of the growing production. To meet these needs, the Picker House was utilized for the opening and cleaning of the imported cotton bales as well as a storage space.

{"title_page": "Fascism and ideology", "text_new": "{{fascism sidebar}}\n[[File:Propaganda.JPG|thumb|A Fascist propaganda poster featuring the [[Duce]] of Italy]]\nThe history of '''fascist ideology''' is long and it also involves many sources. Fascists took inspiration from sources as ancient as the [[Sparta]]ns for their focus on [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and their emphasis on rule by an elite minority. [[Fascism]] has also been connected to the ideals of [[Plato]], though there are key differences between the two. Fascism styled itself as the ideological successor to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], particularly the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concept of a \"high and noble\" [[Aryan]] culture {{Dubious|date=November 2017}} as opposed to a \"parasitic\" [[Semitic culture]] was core to [[Nazism|Nazi]] racial views. From the same era, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s view on the absolute authority of the state also strongly influenced Fascist thinking. The [[French Revolution]] was a major influence insofar as the Nazis saw themselves as fighting back against many of the ideas which it brought to prominence, especially [[liberalism]], [[liberal democracy]] and [[racial equality]], whereas on the other hand Fascism drew heavily on the revolutionary ideal of [[nationalism]]. Common themes among fascist movements include; [[nationalism]] (including [[racial nationalism]]), [[hierarchy]] and [[elitism]], [[militarism]], [[Secular religion|quasi-religion]], [[masculinity]] and [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]]. Other aspects of fascism such as its \"myth of decadence\", anti\u2010egalitarianism and [[totalitarianism]] can be seen to originate from these ideas. These fundamental aspects however, can be attributed to a concept known as \"[[Palingenetic ultranationalism]]\", a theory proposed by [[Roger Griffin]], that fascism is a synthesis of totalitarianism and ultranationalism sacralized through myth of national rebirth and regeneration.\n\nIts relationship with other ideologies of its day was complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported [[private property]] rights for Aryans and the [[profit motive]] of [[capitalism]], but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by bolstering private power with the state. They shared many of the goals of the [[conservatism|conservatives]] of their day and often allied themselves with them by drawing recruits from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more [[Modernism|modern]] ideology, with less focus on things like traditional [[religion]]. Fascism opposed the egalitarian ([[V\u00f6lkisch equality]]) and international character of mainstream [[socialism]], but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative [[Nazism|\"national\" socialism]]. It strongly opposed liberalism, [[communism]], [[anarchism]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\n==Ideological origins==\n\n===Early influences (495 BC\u20131880 AD)===\n[[File:Hoplit.png|thumb|Depiction of a Greek Hoplite warrior, as ancient Sparta has been considered an inspiration for fascist and quasi-fascist movements, such as to [[Nazism]] and quasi-fascist [[Metaxism]]]]\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to [[Ancient Greece]].

These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939.

The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. By 1942, Nazi Germany annexed Poland to Germany and controlled vast sections of continental Europe, including the occupation of large portions of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1942, Fascist Italy occupied and annexed [[Dalmatia]] from Yugoslavia, Corsica and [[Nice]] from France and controlled other territories. During World War II, the [[Axis Powers]] in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Jews and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Asia]], Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany and Allied invasion of Italy and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945.

Fascists took inspiration from sources as ancient as the [[Sparta]]ns for their focus on [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and their emphasis on rule by an elite minority. [[Fascism]] has also been connected to the ideals of [[Plato]], though there are key differences between the two. Fascism styled itself as the ideological successor to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], particularly the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concept of a \"high and noble\" [[Aryan]] culture {{Dubious|date=November 2017}} as opposed to a \"parasitic\" [[Semitic culture]] was core to [[Nazism|Nazi]] racial views. From the same era, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s view on the absolute authority of the state also strongly influenced Fascist thinking. The [[French Revolution]] was a major influence insofar as the Nazis saw themselves as fighting back against many of the ideas which it brought to prominence, especially [[liberalism]], [[liberal democracy]] and [[racial equality]], whereas on the other hand Fascism drew heavily on the revolutionary ideal of [[nationalism]]. Common themes among fascist movements include; [[nationalism]] (including [[racial nationalism]]), [[hierarchy]] and [[elitism]], [[militarism]], [[Secular religion|quasi-religion]], [[masculinity]] and [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]]. Other aspects of fascism such as its \"myth of decadence\", anti\u2010egalitarianism and [[totalitarianism]] can be seen to originate from these ideas. These fundamental aspects however, can be attributed to a concept known as \"[[Palingenetic ultranationalism]]\", a theory proposed by [[Roger Griffin]], that fascism is a synthesis of totalitarianism and ultranationalism sacralized through myth of national rebirth and regeneration.\n\nIts relationship with other ideologies of its day was complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported [[private property]] rights for Aryans and the [[profit motive]] of [[capitalism]], but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by bolstering private power with the state. They shared many of the goals of the [[conservatism|conservatives]] of their day and often allied themselves with them by drawing recruits from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more [[Modernism|modern]] ideology, with less focus on things like traditional [[religion]]. Fascism opposed the egalitarian ([[V\u00f6lkisch equality]]) and international character of mainstream [[socialism]], but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative [[Nazism|\"national\" socialism]]. It strongly opposed liberalism, [[communism]], [[anarchism]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\n==Ideological origins==\n\n===Early influences (495 BC\u20131880 AD)===\n[[File:Hoplit.png|thumb|Depiction of a Greek Hoplite warrior, as ancient Sparta has been considered an inspiration for fascist and quasi-fascist movements, such as to [[Nazism]] and quasi-fascist [[Metaxism]]]]\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to [[Ancient Greece]].

These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939.

The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. By 1942, Nazi Germany annexed Poland to Germany and controlled vast sections of continental Europe, including the occupation of large portions of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1942, Fascist Italy occupied and annexed [[Dalmatia]] from Yugoslavia, Corsica and [[Nice]] from France and controlled other territories. During World War II, the [[Axis Powers]] in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Jews and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Asia]], Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany and Allied invasion of Italy and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945.

Fascism was ,in the early days, sometimes perceived as less of a mortal rival to revolutionary Marxism than as a heresy from it. Mussolini's government was one of the first in Western Europe to diplomatically recognise the USSR, doing so in 1924.

It serves as the central point for the study of the [[history of baseball in the United States]] and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, honoring those who have excelled in [[baseball positions|playing]], [[manager (baseball)|managing]], and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations.\" The word '''Cooperstown''' is often used as shorthand (or a [[Metonymy|metonym]]) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, similar to \"Canton\" for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[Canton, Ohio]].\n\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by [[Stephen Carlton Clark]], an heir to the [[Singer Sewing Machine Company|Singer Sewing Machine]] fortune. Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the [[Great Depression]], which reduced the local tourist trade, and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], which devastated the local [[hops]] industry. Clark constructed the Hall of Fame's building, and it was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (His granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.) The [[Doubleday myth|erroneous claim]] that [[American Civil War|Civil War]] hero [[Abner Doubleday]] [[Origins of baseball|invented baseball]] in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.\n\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.<ref name=\"museum history\">{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|title=Museum History|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|accessdate=2017-10-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704214127/https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|archivedate=4 July 2017}}</ref> [[Dale Petroskey]] became the organization's president in 1999.<ref name=\"Petrosky presidency\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080325&content_id=2458145&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: HOF president Petroskey resigns] from the [[Major League Baseball]] website</ref> In 2002, the Hall launched ''Baseball As America'', a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].\n\n==Inductees==\n{{see also|List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame}}\nAmong baseball fans, \"Hall of Fame\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were [[Ty Cobb]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. {{As of|2020|1}}, 333 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 234 former [[Major League Baseball]] players, 35 [[Negro league baseball]] players and executives, 23 managers, 10 umpires, and 36 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 114 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s. The Hall of Fame includes one female member, [[Effa Manley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/news/personality/woman-bronze|title=News|website=Baseball Hall of Fame}}</ref>\n\nThe newest members inducted on July 21, 2019, are players [[Harold Baines]], [[Roy Halladay]], [[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]], [[Mike Mussina]], [[Mariano Rivera]], and [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]].

The term \"Veterans Committee\" comes from the former official name of \"Committee on Baseball Veterans\". Although the Hall no longer uses \"Veterans Committee\", that term is still widely used by baseball media.</ref> which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/hall-of-fame-announces-change-to-bbwaa-voting-electorate |title=Hall of Fame Announces Change to BBWAA Voting Electorate |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> From a final ballot typically including 25\u201340 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates.

In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.<ref name=\"Walker\">{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-halloffame&prov=ap&type=lgns|title=Vets committee throws another shutout at Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-02-28|last=Walker|first=Ben|date=2007-02-28|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/baseball-hall-of-fame-changes-its-induction-rules?ymd=20140726&content_id=86398586&vkey=news_mlb|title=Hall reduces eligibility from 15 years to 10|accessdate=2014-07-26|last=Bloom|first=Barry M.|date=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1937 all stars crop FINAL2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.33|Seven of the American League's 1937 All-Star players: [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe Cronin]], [[Bill Dickey]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], and [[Hank Greenberg]]. All seven were inducted into the Hall of Fame.]]\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. [[Addie Joss]] was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. [[Roberto Clemente]]'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\n\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; [[Joe DiMaggio]] received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\n\n{{Quote box|width=15em|border=3px|align=right|bgcolor=#FAF0E6|qalign=center|title=''Lineup for Yesterday''|quote=''Z is for Zenith''<br />''The summit of fame.''<br />''These men are up there.''<br />''These men are the game.''|source= \u2014 [[Ogden Nash]], [[Sport (US magazine)|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> }}\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for [[Lou Gehrig]] (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|terminally ill]], making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\n\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot \u2014 both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives).

These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\n* One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice\u2014[[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2007 for induction in 2008]] and [[2010 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2009 for induction in 2010]].\n* One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.\n* The pre\u2013World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|for induction in 2009]].<ref name=\"HoF-VC-1942\">{{cite web|author=National Baseball Hall of Fame|title=Rules for election of pre\u2013World War II players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|year=2009|url=http://community.baseballhall.org/Page.aspx?pid=391|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Satchel Paige 1949 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1971 inductee [[Satchel Paige]]]]\nPlayers of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]] have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005, the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871\u20131946 era, called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \"Early Baseball\" era (1871\u20131949).\n\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, [[Bill James]]' 1994 book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'' goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\n\n===Non-induction of banned players===\n[[File:Shoeless Joe Jackson by Conlon, 1913-crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]] in 1913]]\nFollowing the banning of [[Pete Rose]] from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's \"permanently ineligible\" list, such as Rose or [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]]. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\n\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams\u2014Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to intentionally lose the [[1919 World Series]], and for accepting payment for losing, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his [[My Prison Without Bars|2004 autobiography]]. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer [[Bill James]], though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\".<ref>James (1995:358)</ref>\n\n===Changes to Veterans Committee process===\n{{Main|Veterans Committee}}\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.<ref name=\"NYT-2001ChassReform\">{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=More Vets Eligible For Hall In Baseball|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2001-08-07|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71E3CF934A3575BC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"TBT-2001Reform\">{{cite web|last=Enders|first=Eric|title=Same Old Story|publisher=Baseball Think Factory|date=2001-08-08|url=http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/eric_enders_2001-08-08_0/|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Traven\">{{cite web|last=Traven |first=Neal |title=A Brief History of the Veterans Committee |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]] |date=2003-01-14 |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |accessdate=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101234319/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |archivedate=1 November 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-1988Leo\">{{cite news|last=Leo|first=John|title=Housecleaning Plan for the Hall of Fame|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-01-24|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE103DF937A15752C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Miller\">{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Jay|title=Marvin Miller|work=Prospectus Q&A|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=2008-06-02|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=7608|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.<ref name=\"hof-changes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |title=Changes to Veterans Committee Procedures |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work=baseballhalloffame.org |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929063713/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |archivedate=2006-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The revamped Committee held three elections, in [[2003 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2003]] and [[2007 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2007]], for both players and non-players, and in [[2005 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2005]] for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer [[Mike Schmidt]] noted, \"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\"<ref name=\"Walker\"/> In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\n\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the [[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2008 election process]]. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2009 election process]]; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre\u2013World War II players elected [[Joe Gordon]] in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\n\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the [[2011 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2011 election]].<ref name=\"2010 changes\"/>\n\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\n* Pre-Integration Era (1871\u20131946)\n* Golden Era (1947\u20131972)\n* Expansion Era (1973 and later)\n\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Pat Gillick]] becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The [[Golden Era Veterans Committee|Golden Era committee]] voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with [[Ron Santo]] becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2016 election]].\n\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\n* Today's Game (1988\u2013present)\n* Modern Baseball (1970\u20131987)\n* Golden Days (1950\u20131969)\n* Early Baseball (1871\u20131949)\n\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that the Today's Game committee (having first met in 2016) will meet in 2021, 2023 and 2026, while the Modern Baseball committee (which first met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rules/eras-committees |title=Era Rules for Election |work=Eras Committees |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n* Players: When a player is no longer eligible on the BBWAA ballot (either 15 years after retirement\u2014five-year period and the 10 years after he first becomes eligible to appear on the BBWAA ballot or when the player is not eligible after earning less than five percent of the BBWAA ballot during a year), he will be considered by the respective committee.\n** The Hall has not yet established a policy on when players who die while active or during the standard 5-year waiting period for BBWAA eligibility will be eligible for committee consideration. As noted earlier, such players become eligible for the BBWAA ballot 6 months after their deaths.\n* Managers and umpires who have served at least 10 seasons in that role are eligible 5 years after retirement, unless they are 65 or older, in which case the waiting period is 6 months.\n* Executives are eligible 5 years after retirement, or upon reaching age 70. For those who meet the age cutoff, they are explicitly eligible for consideration regardless of their current position in an organization or their status as active or retired. Before the 2016 changes to the committee system, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.<ref name=\"2016 changes\"/>\n\n===Players and managers with multiple teams===\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \"primary team\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\"<ref name=\"FAQ-logoSelection\">{{cite web|title=Who decides what team logo will be used on Hall of Fame plaques?|work=Hall of Famers: FAQ|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|year=2009|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp#logo|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213123303/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp|archivedate=2009-02-13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frank Robinson 1961.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Frank Robinson]] with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 1961]]\n[[File:Carlton Fisk 1976.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carlton Fisk]] with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1976]]\n[[File:Dave Winfield - San Diego Padres.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dave Winfield]] with the [[San Diego Padres]] c.1977]]\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\n*'''[[Frank Robinson]]''': Robinson chose to have the [[Baltimore Orioles]] cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second [[World Series ring]] came in the [[1970 World Series]] against the Reds. Robinson also won an [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award while playing for each team.\n*'''[[Catfish Hunter]]''': Hunter chose not to have any logo on his cap when elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987. Hunter had success for both teams for which he played &ndash; the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] (his first ten seasons) and the [[New York Yankees]] (his final five seasons). Furthermore, both during and after his career he maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners ([[Charlie Finley|Charles Finley]] and [[George Steinbrenner]]), and did not wish to slight either team by selecting the other.\n*'''[[Nolan Ryan]]''': Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while raised in the Houston area and having longer and more successful tenures with the [[Houston Astros]] (nine seasons, 1980\u201388 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and [[California Angels]] (eight seasons, 1972\u201379 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan's only championship was as a member of the [[New York Mets]] in [[1969 World Series|1969]]. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters. Ryan later took ownership of the Rangers when they were sold to his Rangers Baseball Express group in 2010. He sold his Rangers interest in 2013 and is now in the Astros' front office.\n*'''[[Reggie Jackson]]''': Jackson chose to be depicted with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967\u201375, '87), winning three World Series ([[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1973 World Series|1973]], [[1974 World Series|1974]]) and the 1973 [[AL MVP|AL MVP Award]]. During his five years in New York (1977\u201381), Jackson won two World Series ([[1977 World Series|1977]]\u2013[[1978 World Series|78]]), with his crowning achievement occurring during [[1977 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1977 World Series]], when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname \"Mr. October\".\n*'''[[Carlton Fisk]]''': Fisk went into the hall with a [[Boston Red Sox]] cap on his plaque in 2000 despite playing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk's choice of the Red Sox was likely because of his being a [[New England]] native, as well as his famous \"Stay fair!\" walk-off home run in [[1975 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1975 World Series]] with which he is most associated.\n*'''[[Sparky Anderson]]''': Also in 2000, Anderson entered the Hall with a Cincinnati Reds cap on his plaque despite managing almost twice as many seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (17 in Detroit; nine in Cincinnati). He chose the Reds to honor that team's former general manager [[Bob Howsam]], who gave him his first major-league managing job. Anderson won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.\n*'''[[Dave Winfield]]''': Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had great success there, but chose to go into the Hall as a member of the [[San Diego Padres]] due to his feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nIn all of the above cases, the \"primary team\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\n\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though [[Wade Boggs]] denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm|title=Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers|accessdate=2008-05-21|work=USA Today|first1=Craig|last1=Muder|date=2005-01-06}}</ref> The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\n*'''[[Gary Carter]]''': Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy. Carter won his only championship with the [[1986 World Series|1986]] New York Mets, and wanted his induction plaque to depict him wearing a Mets cap, though he had spent twelve years (1974\u201384, 1992) with the [[Montreal Expos]] and five (1985\u201389) with the Mets. The Hall of Fame decided that Carter's impact on the Montreal franchise warranted depicting him with an Expos cap.<ref name=\"MLB-com-Carter\">{{cite web|last=Czerwinski|first=Kevin T.|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030116&content_id=191990&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null|title=Kid catches Cooperstown spotlight: Carter 'happy' to go into Hall as an Expo|date=2012-01-16|accessdate=2003-01-16}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"NewYorker-2016-02-24\">{{cite magazine\n| title=Hall of Fame Caps That Could Have Been\n| url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/hall-of-fame-caps-that-could-have-been\n| first=Andy | last=Friedman | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=February 24, 2016 | access-date=2018-03-11\n}}\n</ref>\n*'''[[Wade Boggs]]''': Boggs's only title was as a member of the [[1996 World Series|1996]] New York Yankees, for whom he played from 1993\u201397, but his best career numbers were posted during his 11 years (1982\u201392) with the Boston Red Sox. Boggs would eventually be depicted wearing a Boston cap for his 2005 induction.\n*'''[[Andre Dawson]]''': Dawson's cap depicts him as a member of the Expos, his team for eleven years, despite his expressed preference to be shown as a member of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribune-LogoAnnouncement\">{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Fred|title=Dawson 'disappointed' he won't wear Cubs cap|work=Chicago Tribune|date=2010-01-27|url=http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/01/dawson-disappointed-over-decision-not-to-wear-cubs-cap.html|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref><ref name=\"AP-LogoAnnouncement\">{{cite news|title=Hall denies Dawson's Cubs request, must enter as an Expo|agency=Associated Press|date=2010-01-27|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Baseball-Hall-of-Fame-denies-Andre-Dawson-Cubs-request-must-enter-as-Expo-012710|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref>\n*'''[[Tony La Russa]]''': Manager La Russa chose not to have a logo after managing three teams over 33 years \u2014 the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. His greatest successes were with the A's (three pennants and a World Series title in 10 years) and Cardinals (three pennants and two World Series in 16 years). Nonetheless, La Russa felt that his induction to the Hall was due to his tenures with all three teams, and stated that not including a logo meant that \"fans of all [three] clubs can celebrate this honor with me.\"<ref name=\"HoF2014-cap\">{{cite news |url=http://mlb.com/news/article/67024184/greg-maddux-tony-la-russa-wont-have-logos-on-hall-of-fame-caps/ |title=Maddux, La Russa won't have logos on Hall caps |first=Cash |last=Kruth |publisher=Major League Baseball |date=2014-01-23 |accessdate=2017-09-27 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> La Russa's biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Cardinals.\n*'''[[Greg Maddux]]''': Although Maddux had his greatest success while with the Atlanta Braves for 11 seasons, he had two stints with the Chicago Cubs for a total of 10 seasons, including the first seven of his MLB career. Maddux believed that both fanbases were equally important in his career, and so the cap on his plaque does not feature any logo.<ref name=\"HoF2014-cap\"/> His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Braves.\n*'''[[Randy Johnson]]''': Johnson played for six teams in a 22-year career, but spent the bulk of it with the Seattle Mariners (10 seasons) and Arizona Diamondbacks (8 seasons). While enjoying great success with both teams, he had more significant honors with the Diamondbacks. Four of Johnson's five Cy Young Awards (consecutively from 1999 to 2002), his only title (in [[2001 World Series|2001]]), his pitching triple crown ({{mlby|2002}}), and [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|his perfect game]] ({{mlby|2004}}) all came with Arizona. Accordingly, he and the Hall agreed his plaque should feature a Diamondbacks logo.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/randy-johnson-cap-selection |title=Cap Selection Announced for Randy Johnson |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=January 16, 2015 |accessdate=January 12, 2016}}</ref> His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Mariners.\n*'''[[Mike Mussina]]''' who played 10 seasons with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and eight seasons with the [[New York Yankees]], decided to go into the Hall without a logo on his plaque, saying \"I don\u2019t feel like I can pick one team over the other because they were both great to me.

The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere.

The items had been lent to the [[Baseball Commissioner]]'s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of [[Joe Reichler]], an assistant to Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]], who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.<ref name=\"James-HoFItemSale\">{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?|The Politics of Glory]]|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|year=1994|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofgloryh00jame/page/295 295\u2013298]|isbn=0-02-510774-7}}</ref>\n\n===2014 Commemorative coins===\n[[File:National-baseball-hall-of-fame-2014-us-mint-coins.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Examples of the National Baseball Hall of Fame coins produced by the United States Mint]]\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the [[United States Mint]] to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall.<ref>{{USPL|112|152}}</ref><ref name=\"obama\">{{cite web | url=http://baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/national-baseball-hall-fame-commemorative-coin-act-signed-law-president-obama | title=National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act Signed into Law by President Obama | publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame | work=press release | date=August 3, 2012 | accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref> The bill, {{USBill|112|HR|2527}}, was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Rep.

It serves as the central point for the study of the [[history of baseball in the United States]] and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, honoring those who have excelled in [[baseball positions|playing]], [[manager (baseball)|managing]], and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations.\" The word '''Cooperstown''' is often used as shorthand (or a [[Metonymy|metonym]]) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, similar to \"Canton\" for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[Canton, Ohio]].\n\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by [[Stephen Carlton Clark]], an heir to the [[Singer Sewing Machine Company|Singer Sewing Machine]] fortune. Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the [[Great Depression]], which reduced the local tourist trade, and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], which devastated the local [[hops]] industry. Clark constructed the Hall of Fame's building, and it was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (His granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.) The [[Doubleday myth|erroneous claim]] that [[American Civil War|Civil War]] hero [[Abner Doubleday]] [[Origins of baseball|invented baseball]] in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.\n\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.<ref name=\"museum history\">{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|title=Museum History|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|accessdate=2017-10-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704214127/https://baseballhall.org/media-info/museum-history|archivedate=4 July 2017}}</ref> [[Dale Petroskey]] became the organization's president in 1999.<ref name=\"Petrosky presidency\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080325&content_id=2458145&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: HOF president Petroskey resigns] from the [[Major League Baseball]] website</ref> In 2002, the Hall launched ''Baseball As America'', a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].\n\n==Inductees==\n{{see also|List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame}}\nAmong baseball fans, \"Hall of Fame\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were [[Ty Cobb]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. {{As of|2020|1}}, 333 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 234 former [[Major League Baseball]] players, 35 [[Negro league baseball]] players and executives, 23 managers, 10 umpires, and 36 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 114 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s. The Hall of Fame includes one female member, [[Effa Manley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/news/personality/woman-bronze|title=News|website=Baseball Hall of Fame}}</ref>\n\nThe newest members inducted on July 21, 2019, are players [[Harold Baines]], [[Roy Halladay]], [[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]], [[Mike Mussina]], [[Mariano Rivera]], and [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]].

The term \"Veterans Committee\" comes from the former official name of \"Committee on Baseball Veterans\". Although the Hall no longer uses \"Veterans Committee\", that term is still widely used by baseball media.</ref> which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/hall-of-fame-announces-change-to-bbwaa-voting-electorate |title=Hall of Fame Announces Change to BBWAA Voting Electorate |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> From a final ballot typically including 25\u201340 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.<ref name=\"Walker\">{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-halloffame&prov=ap&type=lgns|title=Vets committee throws another shutout at Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-02-28|last=Walker|first=Ben|date=2007-02-28|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/baseball-hall-of-fame-changes-its-induction-rules?ymd=20140726&content_id=86398586&vkey=news_mlb|title=Hall reduces eligibility from 15 years to 10|accessdate=2014-07-26|last=Bloom|first=Barry M.|date=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1937 all stars crop FINAL2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.33|Seven of the American League's 1937 All-Star players: [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe Cronin]], [[Bill Dickey]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], and [[Hank Greenberg]]. All seven were inducted into the Hall of Fame.]]\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. [[Addie Joss]] was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. [[Roberto Clemente]]'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\n\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; [[Joe DiMaggio]] received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\n\n{{Quote box|width=15em|border=3px|align=right|bgcolor=#FAF0E6|qalign=center|title=''Lineup for Yesterday''|quote=''Z is for Zenith''<br />''The summit of fame.''<br />''These men are up there.''<br />''These men are the game.''|source= \u2014 [[Ogden Nash]], [[Sport (US magazine)|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> }}\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for [[Lou Gehrig]] (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|terminally ill]], making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\n\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot \u2014 both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives).

These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\n* One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice\u2014[[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2007 for induction in 2008]] and [[2010 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|in 2009 for induction in 2010]].\n* One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.\n* The pre\u2013World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|for induction in 2009]].<ref name=\"HoF-VC-1942\">{{cite web|author=National Baseball Hall of Fame|title=Rules for election of pre\u2013World War II players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|year=2009|url=http://community.baseballhall.org/Page.aspx?pid=391|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Satchel Paige 1949 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1971 inductee [[Satchel Paige]]]]\nPlayers of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]] have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005, the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871\u20131946 era, called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \"Early Baseball\" era (1871\u20131949).\n\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, [[Bill James]]' 1994 book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'' goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\n\n===Non-induction of banned players===\n[[File:Shoeless Joe Jackson by Conlon, 1913-crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]] in 1913]]\nFollowing the banning of [[Pete Rose]] from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's \"permanently ineligible\" list, such as Rose or [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson]]. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\n\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams \u2014 Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to intentionally lose the [[1919 World Series]], and for accepting payment for losing, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his [[My Prison Without Bars|2004 autobiography]]. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer [[Bill James]], though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\".<ref>James (1995:358)</ref>\n\n===Changes to Veterans Committee process===\n{{Main|Veterans Committee}}\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.<ref name=\"NYT-2001ChassReform\">{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=More Vets Eligible For Hall In Baseball|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2001-08-07|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71E3CF934A3575BC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"TBT-2001Reform\">{{cite web|last=Enders|first=Eric|title=Same Old Story|publisher=Baseball Think Factory|date=2001-08-08|url=http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/eric_enders_2001-08-08_0/|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Traven\">{{cite web|last=Traven |first=Neal |title=A Brief History of the Veterans Committee |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]] |date=2003-01-14 |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |accessdate=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101234319/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml |archivedate=1 November 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-1988Leo\">{{cite news|last=Leo|first=John|title=Housecleaning Plan for the Hall of Fame|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-01-24|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE103DF937A15752C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"BP-Miller\">{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Jay|title=Marvin Miller|work=Prospectus Q&A|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=2008-06-02|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=7608|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.<ref name=\"hof-changes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |title=Changes to Veterans Committee Procedures |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work=baseballhalloffame.org |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929063713/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |archivedate=2006-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The revamped Committee held three elections, in [[2003 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2003]] and [[2007 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2007]], for both players and non-players, and in [[2005 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2005]] for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer [[Mike Schmidt]] noted, \"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\"<ref name=\"Walker\"/> In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\n\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the [[2008 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2008 election process]]. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the [[2009 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2009 election process]]; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre\u2013World War II players elected [[Joe Gordon]] in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\n\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the [[2011 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2011 election]].<ref name=\"2010 changes\"/>\n\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\n* Pre-Integration Era (1871\u20131946)\n* Golden Era (1947\u20131972)\n* Expansion Era (1973 and later)\n\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Pat Gillick]] becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The [[Golden Era Veterans Committee|Golden Era committee]] voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with [[Ron Santo]] becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2016 election]].\n\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\n* Today's Game (1988\u2013present)\n* Modern Baseball (1970\u20131987)\n* Golden Days (1950\u20131969)\n* Early Baseball (1871\u20131949)\n\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that the Today's Game committee (having first met in 2016) will meet in 2021, 2023 and 2026, while the Modern Baseball committee (which first met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/rules/eras-committees |title=Era Rules for Election |work=Eras Committees |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n* Players: When a player is no longer eligible on the BBWAA ballot (either 15 years after retirement\u2014five-year period and the 10 years after he first becomes eligible to appear on the BBWAA ballot or when the player is not eligible after earning less than five percent of the BBWAA ballot during a year), he will be considered by the respective committee.\n** The Hall has not yet established a policy on when players who die while active or during the standard 5-year waiting period for BBWAA eligibility will be eligible for committee consideration. As noted earlier, such players become eligible for the BBWAA ballot 6 months after their deaths.\n* Managers and umpires who have served at least 10 seasons in that role are eligible 5 years after retirement, unless they are 65 or older, in which case the waiting period is 6 months.\n* Executives are eligible 5 years after retirement, or upon reaching age 70. For those who meet the age cutoff, they are explicitly eligible for consideration regardless of their current position in an organization or their status as active or retired. Before the 2016 changes to the committee system, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.<ref name=\"2016 changes\"/>\n\n===Players and managers with multiple teams===\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \"primary team\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\"<ref name=\"FAQ-logoSelection\">{{cite web|title=Who decides what team logo will be used on Hall of Fame plaques?|work=Hall of Famers: FAQ|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|year=2009|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp#logo|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213123303/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp|archivedate=2009-02-13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frank Robinson 1961.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Frank Robinson]] with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 1961]]\n[[File:Carlton Fisk 1976.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carlton Fisk]] with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1976]]\n[[File:Dave Winfield - San Diego Padres.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dave Winfield]] with the [[San Diego Padres]] c.1977]]\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\n*'''[[Frank Robinson]]''': Robinson chose to have the [[Baltimore Orioles]] cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second [[World Series ring]] came in the [[1970 World Series]] against the Reds. Robinson also won an [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award while playing for each team.\n*'''[[Catfish Hunter]]''': Hunter chose not to have any logo on his cap when elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987. Hunter had success for both teams for which he played &ndash; the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] (his first ten seasons) and the [[New York Yankees]] (his final five seasons). Furthermore, both during and after his career he maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners ([[Charlie Finley|Charles Finley]] and [[George Steinbrenner]]), and did not wish to slight either team by selecting the other.\n*'''[[Nolan Ryan]]''': Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while raised in the Houston area and having longer and more successful tenures with the [[Houston Astros]] (nine seasons, 1980\u201388 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and [[California Angels]] (eight seasons, 1972\u201379 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan's only championship was as a member of the [[New York Mets]] in [[1969 World Series|1969]]. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters. Ryan later took ownership of the Rangers when they were sold to his Rangers Baseball Express group in 2010. He sold his Rangers interest in 2013 and is now in the Astros' front office.\n*'''[[Reggie Jackson]]''': Jackson chose to be depicted with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967\u201375, '87), winning three World Series ([[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1973 World Series|1973]], [[1974 World Series|1974]]) and the 1973 [[AL MVP|AL MVP Award]]. During his five years in New York (1977\u201381), Jackson won two World Series ([[1977 World Series|1977]]\u2013[[1978 World Series|78]]), with his crowning achievement occurring during [[1977 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1977 World Series]], when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname \"Mr. October\".\n*'''[[Carlton Fisk]]''': Fisk went into the hall with a [[Boston Red Sox]] cap on his plaque in 2000 despite playing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk's choice of the Red Sox was likely because of his being a [[New England]] native, as well as his famous \"Stay fair!\" walk-off home run in [[1975 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1975 World Series]] with which he is most associated.\n*'''[[Sparky Anderson]]''': Also in 2000, Anderson entered the Hall with a Cincinnati Reds cap on his plaque despite managing almost twice as many seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (17 in Detroit; nine in Cincinnati). He chose the Reds to honor that team's former general manager [[Bob Howsam]], who gave him his first major-league managing job. Anderson won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.\n*'''[[Dave Winfield]]''': Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had great success there, but chose to go into the Hall as a member of the [[San Diego Padres]] due to his feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nIn all of the above cases, the \"primary team\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\n\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though [[Wade Boggs]] denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm|title=Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers|accessdate=2008-05-21|work=USA Today|first1=Craig|last1=Muder|date=2005-01-06}}</ref> The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\n*'''[[Gary Carter]]''': Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy. Carter won his only championship with the [[1986 World Series|1986]] New York Mets, and wanted his induction plaque to depict him wearing a Mets cap, though he had spent twelve years (1974\u201384, 1992) with the [[Montreal Expos]] and five (1985\u201389) with the Mets. The Hall of Fame decided that Carter's impact on the Montreal franchise warranted depicting him with an Expos cap.<ref name=\"MLB-com-Carter\">{{cite web|last=Czerwinski|first=Kevin T.|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030116&content_id=191990&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null|title=Kid catches Cooperstown spotlight: Carter 'happy' to go into Hall as an Expo|date=2012-01-16|accessdate=2003-01-16}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"NewYorker-2016-02-24\">{{cite magazine\n| title=Hall of Fame Caps That Could Have Been\n| url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/hall-of-fame-caps-that-could-have-been\n| first=Andy | last=Friedman | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=February 24, 2016 | access-date=2018-03-11\n}}\n</ref>\n*'''[[Wade Boggs]]''': Boggs's only title was as a member of the [[1996 World Series|1996]] New York Yankees, for whom he played from 1993\u201397, but his best career numbers were posted during his 11 years (1982\u201392) with the Boston Red Sox. Boggs would eventually be depicted wearing a Boston cap for his 2005 induction.\n*'''[[Andre Dawson]]''': Dawson's cap depicts him as a member of the Expos, his team for eleven years, despite his expressed preference to be shown as a member of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribune-LogoAnnouncement\">{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Fred|title=Dawson 'disappointed' he won't wear Cubs cap|work=Chicago Tribune|date=2010-01-27|url=http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/01/dawson-disappointed-over-decision-not-to-wear-cubs-cap.html|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref><ref name=\"AP-LogoAnnouncement\">{{cite news|title=Hall denies Dawson's Cubs request, must enter as an Expo|agency=Associated Press|date=2010-01-27|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Baseball-Hall-of-Fame-denies-Andre-Dawson-Cubs-request-must-enter-as-Expo-012710|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref>\n*'''[[Tony La Russa]]''': Manager La Russa chose not to have a logo after managing three teams over 33 years \u2014 the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. His greatest successes were with the A's (three pennants and a World Series title in 10 years) and Cardinals (three pennants and two World Series in 16 years). Nonetheless, La Russa felt that his induction to the Hall was due to his tenures with all three teams, and stated that not including a logo meant that \"fans of all [three] clubs can celebrate this honor with me.\"<ref name=\"HoF2014-cap\">{{cite news |url=http://mlb.com/news/article/67024184/greg-maddux-tony-la-russa-wont-have-logos-on-hall-of-fame-caps/ |title=Maddux, La Russa won't have logos on Hall caps |first=Cash |last=Kruth |publisher=Major League Baseball |date=2014-01-23 |accessdate=2017-09-27 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> La Russa's biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Cardinals.\n*'''[[Greg Maddux]]''': Although Maddux had his greatest success while with the Atlanta Braves for 11 seasons, he had two stints with the Chicago Cubs for a total of 10 seasons, including the first seven of his MLB career. Maddux believed that both fanbases were equally important in his career, and so the cap on his plaque does not feature any logo.<ref name=\"HoF2014-cap\"/> His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Braves.\n*'''[[Randy Johnson]]''': Johnson played for six teams in a 22-year career, but spent the bulk of it with the Seattle Mariners (10 seasons) and Arizona Diamondbacks (8 seasons). While enjoying great success with both teams, he had more significant honors with the Diamondbacks. Four of Johnson's five Cy Young Awards (consecutively from 1999 to 2002), his only title (in [[2001 World Series|2001]]), his pitching triple crown ({{mlby|2002}}), and [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|his perfect game]] ({{mlby|2004}}) all came with Arizona. Accordingly, he and the Hall agreed his plaque should feature a Diamondbacks logo.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/randy-johnson-cap-selection |title=Cap Selection Announced for Randy Johnson |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=January 16, 2015 |accessdate=January 12, 2016}}</ref> His biography on the Hall's website lists his primary team as the Mariners.\n*'''[[Mike Mussina]]''' who played 10 seasons with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and eight seasons with the [[New York Yankees]], decided to go into the Hall without a logo on his plaque, saying \"I don\u2019t feel like I can pick one team over the other because they were both great to me.

The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere.

Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.<ref name=\"James-HoFItemSale\">{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?|The Politics of Glory]]|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|year=1994|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofgloryh00jame/page/295 295\u2013298]|isbn=0-02-510774-7}}</ref>\n\n===2014 Commemorative coins===\n[[File:National-baseball-hall-of-fame-2014-us-mint-coins.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Examples of the National Baseball Hall of Fame coins produced by the United States Mint]]\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the [[United States Mint]] to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall.<ref>{{USPL|112|152}}</ref><ref name=\"obama\">{{cite web | url=http://baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/national-baseball-hall-fame-commemorative-coin-act-signed-law-president-obama | title=National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act Signed into Law by President Obama | publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame | work=press release | date=August 3, 2012 | accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref> The bill, {{USBill|112|HR|2527}}, was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Rep.

Alongside these dinosaur remains were fossilized trees, suggesting that plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward. Other finds from the formation include [[tritylodonts]], [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammal|mammal-like]] [[reptile]]s and crow-sized [[pterosaur]]s. Surprisingly were the discovery of [[prosauropod]] remains, which were found commonly on other continents only until the Early Jurassic. However, the bone fragments found at the Hanson Formation were dated until the Middle Jurassic, millions of years later. In 2004, [[paleontologist]]s discovered partial remains of a large [[sauropod]] dinosaur that has not formally been described yet.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clearboth}}\n\n=== Invertebrate paleofauna ===\nThe insects ''[[Ademosynoides]]'' & ''[[Grahamelytron]]'' were claimed to be found on this formation, but they come from the Bajocian of a different formation.

In 2004, [[paleontologist]]s discovered partial remains of a large [[sauropod]] dinosaur that has not formally been described yet.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clearboth}}\n\n=== Invertebrate paleofauna ===\nThe insects ''[[Ademosynoides]]'' & ''[[Grahamelytron]]'' were claimed to be found on this formation, but they come from the Bajocian of a different formation.

They are called \"cellophane noodles\" or \"glass noodles\" because of their [[cellophane]]- or [[glass]]-like transparency when cooked.\nCellophane noodles should not be confused with [[rice vermicelli]], which are made from [[rice]] and are white in color rather than clear (after cooking in water).\n\n== Varieties ==\nCellophane noodles are made from a variety of [[starch|starches]]. In China, cellophane noodles are usually made of [[mung bean]] starch. Chinese varieties made from [[mung bean]] starch are called '''Chinese vermicelli''', '''bean threads''', or '''bean thread noodles'''. Thicker Korean varieties made with sweet potato starch are called '''sweet potato noodles''' or '''''dangmyeon'''''.\n\nCellophane noodles are available in various thicknesses. Wide, flat cellophane noodle sheets called '''[[mung bean sheet]]s''' are also produced in China. In Korea, '''''napjak-dangmyeon''''' (literally \"flat ''dangmyeon\"'') refers to flat sweet potato noodles.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Dongfen.JPG|Dried Chinese vermicelli made with [[mung bean]] starch\nFile:Dangmyeon.jpg|Dried Korean ''dangmyeon'' made with [[sweet potato]] starch\nFile:Dong bei da la pi.jpg|''D\u014dng b\u011bi d\u00e0 l\u0101 p\u00ed'' made with Chinese [[mung bean sheet]]s\nFile:Napjak-dangmyeon in jjimdak.jpg|''Napjak-dangmyeon'' in ''[[jjimdak]]''\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nIn China, the primary site of production of cellophane noodles is the town of Zhangxing, in [[Zhaoyuan, Shandong|Zhaoyuan]], [[Shandong]] province. However, historically the noodles were shipped through the port of [[Longkou]], and thus the noodles are known and marketed as Longkou ''fensi'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:\u9f99\u53e3|\u9f99\u53e3]][[wikt:\u7c89\u4e1d|\u7c89\u4e1d]]|t=[[wikt:\u9f8d\u53e3|\u9f8d\u53e3]][[wikt:\u7c89\u7d72|\u7c89\u7d72]]}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.made-in-china.com/import-export/umnEfQJVBxdZprofile1/Yantaiyinsida-Longkou-Vermicelli-Co-Ltd-.html|title=China Vermicelli Manufacturer - Yantai Yinsida Longkou Vermicelli Co., Ltd.|publisher=made-in-china.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105309/http://www.made-in-china.com/import-export/umnEfQJVBxdZprofile1/Yantaiyinsida-Longkou-Vermicelli-Co-Ltd-.html|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n== Use ==\n\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mayishangshu.jpg|thumb|''[[Ants climbing a tree]]'' (\u879e\u87fb\u4e0a\u6a39)]]\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the most commonly used names are ''f\u011bns\u012b'' ({{zh|first=c|c=[[wikt:\u7c89\u7d72|\u7c89\u7d72]]}}, literally \"noodle thread\") and ''d\u014dngf\u011bn'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:\u51ac|\u51ac]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]]}}, literally \"winter noodle\"). They are also marketed under the name ''saifun'', the [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] pronunciation of the Mandarin ''x\u00ecf\u011bn'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:\u7d30|\u7d30]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]]}}; literally \"slender noodle\"), though the name ''f\u00e1ns\u012b'' (\u7c89\u7d72) is the term most often used in Cantonese.\n\nIn China, cellophane noodles are a popular ingredient used in [[stir frying|stir fries]], soups, and particularly [[hot pot]]s. They can also be used as an ingredient in fillings for a variety of Chinese ''[[jiaozi]]'' (dumplings) and ''[[Bing (Chinese flat bread)|bing]]'' ([[flatbreads]]), especially in [[vegetarian]] versions of these dishes. Thicker cellophane noodles are also commonly used to imitate the appearance and texture of [[Shark fin soup|shark's fin]] in vegetarian soups. Thicker varieties, most popular in China's [[Northeast China|northeast]], are used in stir fries as well as cold salad-like dishes. A popular soup using the ingredient is fried tofu with thin noodles ({{zh|first=c|c=[[wikt:\u6cb9|\u6cb9]][[wikt:\u8c46|\u8c46]][[wikt:\u8150|\u8150]][[wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]][[wikt:\u6e6f|\u6e6f]]}}; [[Pinyin]]: ''y\u00f3u d\u00f2u fu-xi\u00e0n f\u011bn t\u0101ng''). A popular [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuan]] dish called ''[[ants climbing a tree]]'' consists of stewed cellophane noodles with a spicy ground pork meat sauce.\n\n==== Tibet ====\nIn [[Tibetan cuisine]], glass noodles are called ''phing'' or ''fing'' and are used in soup, pork curry or with mushrooms.\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], glass noodles are called ''falooda'' (see [[falooda]], the dessert dish), and are served on top of ''[[kulfi]]'' (a traditional ice cream). They are usually made from arrowroot starch using a traditional technique. The noodles are flavorless so they provide a nice contrast with the sweet ''kulfi''. ''Kulfi'' and ''falooda'' can be bought from numerous food stalls throughout Pakistan and northern parts of India.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn [[Indonesian cuisine]], they are called ''soun'' or ''suun''.\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn [[Japanese cuisine]], they are called ''harusame'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|[[wikt:\u6625\u96e8|\u6625\u96e8]]}}), literally \"spring rain\". Unlike Chinese glass noodles, they are usually made from potato starch. They are commonly used to make salads, or as an ingredient in [[hot pot]] dishes. They are also often used to make Japanese adaptations of Chinese and Korean dishes. [[Shirataki noodles|''Shirataki'' noodles]] are translucent, traditional Japanese noodles made from the [[konjac]] yam and sometimes [[tofu]].\n\n=== Korea ===\n[[File:Polish Korean Cuisine and Culture Exchanges Gradmother\u2019s Recipes 05.jpg|thumb|''[[Japchae]]'' from Korea]]\nIn [[Korean cuisine]], glass noodles are usually made from [[sweet potato]] starch and are called ''dangmyeon'' ([[Hangul]]: {{lang|ko-Hang|[[wikt:\ub2f9\uba74|\ub2f9\uba74]]}}; [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko-Hant|[[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]][[wikt:\u9eb5|\u9eb5]]}}; literally \"[[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] noodles\"; also spelled ''dang myun'', ''dangmyun'', ''tang myun'', or ''tangmyun'').  They are commonly stir-fried in sesame oil with beef and vegetables, and flavoured with soy and sugar, in a popular dish called ''[[japchae]]'' (hangul: \uc7a1\ucc44). They are usually thick, and are a brownish-gray color when in their uncooked form.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn [[Malaysia]] and [[Taiwan]] they are known as ''tanghoon'' ([[wikt:\u51ac|\u51ac]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]]). They are sometimes confused with ''bihun'' ([[wikt:\u7c73\u7c89|\u7c73\u7c89]]) which are [[rice vermicelli]]. Sometimes also known as suhun or suhoon.\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[File:Sotanghonjf1681.JPG|thumb|Pancit Sotanghon (Lin-Mers, [[Baliuag, Bulacan]]).]]\nIn [[Filipino cuisine]], the noodles are called a similar name: ''sotanghon'' because of the popular dish of the same name made from them using chicken and [[Cloud ear fungus|wood ears]]. They are also confused with rice vermicelli, which is called ''bihon'' in the Philippines.\n\n=== Samoa ===\nGlass noodles were introduced to [[Samoa]] by [[Cantonese]] agricultural workers in the early 1900s where they became known as \"''lialia''\", a Samoan word meaning \"to twirl\", after the method of twirling the noodles around chopsticks when eating.

'''glass noodles''', are a type of transparent [[noodle]] made from [[starch]] (such as [[mung bean]] starch, [[potato starch]], [[sweet potato]] starch, [[tapioca]], or [[canna (plant)|canna]] starch) and water.\n\nThey are generally sold in dried form, soaked to reconstitute, then used in soups, stir-fried dishes, or [[spring roll]]s. They are called \"cellophane noodles\" or \"glass noodles\" because of their [[cellophane]]- or [[glass]]-like transparency when cooked.\nCellophane noodles should not be confused with [[rice vermicelli]], which are made from [[rice]] and are white in color rather than clear (after cooking in water).\n\n== Varieties ==\nCellophane noodles are made from a variety of [[starch|starches]]. In China, cellophane noodles are usually made of [[mung bean]] starch. Chinese varieties made from [[mung bean]] starch are called '''Chinese vermicelli''', '''bean threads''', or '''bean thread noodles'''. Thicker Korean varieties made with sweet potato starch are called '''sweet potato noodles''' or '''''dangmyeon'''''.\n\nCellophane noodles are available in various thicknesses. Wide, flat cellophane noodle sheets called '''[[mung bean sheet]]s''' are also produced in China. In Korea, '''''napjak-dangmyeon''''' (literally \"flat ''dangmyeon\"'') refers to flat sweet potato noodles.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Dongfen.JPG|Dried Chinese vermicelli made with [[mung bean]] starch\nFile:Dangmyeon.jpg|Dried Korean ''dangmyeon'' made with [[sweet potato]] starch\nFile:Dong bei da la pi.jpg|''D\u014dng b\u011bi d\u00e0 l\u0101 p\u00ed'' made with Chinese [[mung bean sheet]]s\nFile:Napjak-dangmyeon in jjimdak.jpg|''Napjak-dangmyeon'' in ''[[jjimdak]]''\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nIn China, the primary site of production of cellophane noodles is the town of Zhangxing, in [[Zhaoyuan, Shandong|Zhaoyuan]], [[Shandong]] province. However, historically the noodles were shipped through the port of [[Longkou]], and thus the noodles are known and marketed as Longkou ''fensi'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:\u9f99\u53e3|\u9f99\u53e3]][[wikt:\u7c89\u4e1d|\u7c89\u4e1d]]|t=[[wikt:\u9f8d\u53e3|\u9f8d\u53e3]][[wikt:\u7c89\u7d72|\u7c89\u7d72]]}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.made-in-china.com/import-export/umnEfQJVBxdZprofile1/Yantaiyinsida-Longkou-Vermicelli-Co-Ltd-.html|title=China Vermicelli Manufacturer - Yantai Yinsida Longkou Vermicelli Co., Ltd.|publisher=made-in-china.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105309/http://www.made-in-china.com/import-export/umnEfQJVBxdZprofile1/Yantaiyinsida-Longkou-Vermicelli-Co-Ltd-.html|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n== Use ==\n\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mayishangshu.jpg|thumb|''[[Ants climbing a tree]]'' (\u879e\u87fb\u4e0a\u6a39)]]\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the most commonly used names are ''f\u011bns\u012b'' ({{zh|first=c|c=[[wikt:\u7c89\u7d72|\u7c89\u7d72]]}}, literally \"noodle thread\") and ''d\u014dngf\u011bn'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:\u51ac|\u51ac]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]]}}, literally \"winter noodle\"). They are also marketed under the name ''saifun'', the [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] pronunciation of the Mandarin ''x\u00ecf\u011bn'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:\u7d30|\u7d30]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]]}}; literally \"slender noodle\"), though the name ''f\u00e1ns\u012b'' (\u7c89\u7d72) is the term most often used in Cantonese.\n\nIn China, cellophane noodles are a popular ingredient used in [[stir frying|stir fries]], soups, and particularly [[hot pot]]s. They can also be used as an ingredient in fillings for a variety of Chinese ''[[jiaozi]]'' (dumplings) and ''[[Bing (Chinese flat bread)|bing]]'' ([[flatbreads]]), especially in [[vegetarian]] versions of these dishes. Thicker cellophane noodles are also commonly used to imitate the appearance and texture of [[Shark fin soup|shark's fin]] in vegetarian soups. Thicker varieties, most popular in China's [[Northeast China|northeast]], are used in stir fries as well as cold salad-like dishes. A popular soup using the ingredient is fried tofu with thin noodles ({{zh|first=c|c=[[wikt:\u6cb9|\u6cb9]][[wikt:\u8c46|\u8c46]][[wikt:\u8150|\u8150]][[wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]][[wikt:\u6e6f|\u6e6f]]}}; [[Pinyin]]: ''y\u00f3u d\u00f2u fu-xi\u00e0n f\u011bn t\u0101ng''). A popular [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuan]] dish called ''[[ants climbing a tree]]'' consists of stewed cellophane noodles with a spicy ground pork meat sauce.\n\n==== Tibet ====\nIn [[Tibetan cuisine]], glass noodles are called ''phing'' or ''fing'' and are used in soup, pork curry or with mushrooms.\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], glass noodles are called ''falooda'' (see [[falooda]], the dessert dish), and are served on top of ''[[kulfi]]'' (a traditional ice cream). They are usually made from arrowroot starch using a traditional technique. The noodles are flavorless so they provide a nice contrast with the sweet ''kulfi''. ''Kulfi'' and ''falooda'' can be bought from numerous food stalls throughout Pakistan and northern parts of India.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn [[Indonesian cuisine]], they are called ''soun'' or ''suun''.\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn [[Japanese cuisine]], they are called ''harusame'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|[[wikt:\u6625\u96e8|\u6625\u96e8]]}}), literally \"spring rain\". Unlike Chinese glass noodles, they are usually made from potato starch. They are commonly used to make salads, or as an ingredient in [[hot pot]] dishes. They are also often used to make Japanese adaptations of Chinese and Korean dishes. [[Shirataki noodles|''Shirataki'' noodles]] are translucent, traditional Japanese noodles made from the [[konjac]] yam and sometimes [[tofu]].\n\n=== Korea ===\n[[File:Polish Korean Cuisine and Culture Exchanges Gradmother\u2019s Recipes 05.jpg|thumb|''[[Japchae]]'' from Korea]]\nIn [[Korean cuisine]], glass noodles are usually made from [[sweet potato]] starch and are called ''dangmyeon'' ([[Hangul]]: {{lang|ko-Hang|[[wikt:\ub2f9\uba74|\ub2f9\uba74]]}}; [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko-Hant|[[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]][[wikt:\u9eb5|\u9eb5]]}}; literally \"[[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] noodles\"; also spelled ''dang myun'', ''dangmyun'', ''tang myun'', or ''tangmyun'').  They are commonly stir-fried in sesame oil with beef and vegetables, and flavoured with soy and sugar, in a popular dish called ''[[japchae]]'' (hangul: \uc7a1\ucc44). They are usually thick, and are a brownish-gray color when in their uncooked form.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn [[Malaysia]] and [[Taiwan]] they are known as ''tanghoon'' ([[wikt:\u51ac|\u51ac]][[wikt:\u7c89|\u7c89]]). They are sometimes confused with ''bihun'' ([[wikt:\u7c73\u7c89|\u7c73\u7c89]]) which are [[rice vermicelli]]. Sometimes also known as suhun or suhoon.\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[File:Sotanghonjf1681.JPG|thumb|Pancit Sotanghon (Lin-Mers, [[Baliuag, Bulacan]]).]]\nIn [[Filipino cuisine]], the noodles are called a similar name: ''sotanghon'' because of the popular dish of the same name made from them using chicken and [[Cloud ear fungus|wood ears]]. They are also confused with rice vermicelli, which is called ''bihon'' in the Philippines.\n\n=== Samoa ===\nGlass noodles were introduced to [[Samoa]] by [[Cantonese]] agricultural workers in the early 1900s where they became known as \"''lialia''\", a Samoan word meaning \"to twirl\", after the method of twirling the noodles around chopsticks when eating. A popular dish called ''sapasui'' (transliteration of the [[Cantonese]] [[chop suey]]) is common fare at social gatherings.

{"title_page": "Maharashtrian cuisine", "text_new": "{{Indian cuisine}}\n\n'''Maharashtrian''' or '''Marathi''' '''cuisine''' is the [[cuisine]] of the [[Marathi people]] from the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]]. It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other [[Indian cuisine]]<nowiki/>s. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.\n\nMaharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. [[Wheat]], [[rice]], ''[[jowar]]'', ''[[bajri]]'', [[vegetable]]s, [[lentil]]s and [[fruit]] are dietary [[Staple food|staples]]. [[Peanut]]s and [[cashew]]s are often served with vegetables. [[Meat]] was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.\n\nThe urban population in metropolitan cities such as [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]] and others has been influenced by cuisine from other parts of India and abroad. For example, the [[Udupi]] dishes ''[[idli]]'' and ''[[dosa]],'' as well as Chinese and Western dishes, are quite popular in home cooking, and in restaurants.\n\nDistinctly Maharashtrian dishes include ''ukdiche [[modak]]'', aluchi patal bhaji and [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n{{TOCLimit|3}}\n\n== Regular meals and staple dishes ==\n[[File:Maharashtra Districts.png|thumb|300px|Regions and districts of Maharashtra]]\n{{See also|Thali}}\n\nSince they occupy a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions have produced a diverse cuisine. The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices and ingredients.The majority of Maharashtrians are not averse to eating meat, fish and eggs, however, the staple diet for most people is mostly [[lacto-vegetarian]]. Many communities such as the brahmins, or the [[varkari]] sect members only follow the lacto-vegetarian diet.\n\nThe traditional staple food on Desh (the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] plateau) is usually ''[[bhakri]]'', spiced cooked vegetables, ''[[dal]]'' and rice. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer ''[[roti]]'' or ''[[chapati]]'', which is a plain bread made with [[wheat]] flour.\n\nIn the coastal [[Konkan]] region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet [[coconut]] and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine.<ref group=note>Some of the indigenous Marathi communities of North Konkan and Mumbai are [[Agri caste|Aagri]], [[Koli people|Koli]], [[Pathare Prabhu]], SKPs ([[Panchkalshi]]) and ([[Chaukalshi]]), [[CKP]]s and [[East Indians|East Indian Catholic]]</ref> In South Konkan, near [[Malvan]], another independent cuisine developed called [[Malvani cuisine]], which is predominantly non-vegetarian. ''[[Kombdi vade]]'', fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.\n\nIn the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy ''[[savji]]''s, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.\n\nMaharashtrian lacto-vegetarian dishes are based on five main classes of ingredients that include grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=K.S.|title=Maharashtra|date=2004|publisher=Popular Prakashan|location=Mumbai|isbn=81-7991-100-4|page=XLIX|edition=first|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OmBjoAFMfjoC}}|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Grains ===\nStaple dishes in the cuisine are based on a variety of [[flat bread|flatbreads]] and [[rice]].

It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other [[Indian cuisine]]<nowiki/>s. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.\n\nMaharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. [[Wheat]], [[rice]], ''[[jowar]]'', ''[[bajri]]'', [[vegetable]]s, [[lentil]]s and [[fruit]] are dietary [[Staple food|staples]]. [[Peanut]]s and [[cashew]]s are often served with vegetables. [[Meat]] was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.\n\nThe urban population in metropolitan cities such as [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]] and others has been influenced by cuisine from other parts of India and abroad. For example, the [[Udupi]] dishes ''[[idli]]'' and ''[[dosa]],'' as well as Chinese and Western dishes, are quite popular in home cooking, and in restaurants.\n\nDistinctly Maharashtrian dishes include ''ukdiche [[modak]]'', aluchi patal bhaji and [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n{{TOCLimit|3}}\n\n== Regular meals and staple dishes ==\n[[File:Maharashtra Districts.png|thumb|300px|Regions and districts of Maharashtra]]\n{{See also|Thali}}\n\nSince they occupy a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions have produced a diverse cuisine. The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices and ingredients.The majority of Maharashtrians are not averse to eating meat, fish and eggs, however, the staple diet for most people is mostly [[lacto-vegetarian]]. Many communities such as the brahmins, or the [[varkari]] sect members only follow the lacto-vegetarian diet.\n\nThe traditional staple food on Desh (the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] plateau) is usually ''[[bhakri]]'', spiced cooked vegetables, ''[[dal]]'' and rice. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer ''[[roti]]'' or ''[[chapati]]'', which is a plain bread made with [[wheat]] flour.\n\nIn the coastal [[Konkan]] region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet [[coconut]] and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine.<ref group=note>Some of the indigenous Marathi communities of North Konkan and Mumbai are [[Agri caste|Aagri]], [[Koli people|Koli]], [[Pathare Prabhu]], SKPs ([[Panchkalshi]]) and ([[Chaukalshi]]), [[CKP]]s and [[East Indians|East Indian Catholic]]</ref> In South Konkan, near [[Malvan]], another independent cuisine developed called [[Malvani cuisine]], which is predominantly non-vegetarian. ''[[Kombdi vade]]'', fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.\n\nIn the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy ''[[savji]]''s, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.\n\nMaharashtrian lacto-vegetarian dishes are based on five main classes of ingredients that include grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=K.S.|title=Maharashtra|date=2004|publisher=Popular Prakashan|location=Mumbai|isbn=81-7991-100-4|page=XLIX|edition=first|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OmBjoAFMfjoC}}|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Grains ===\nStaple dishes in the cuisine are based on a variety of [[flat bread|flatbreads]] and [[rice]].
