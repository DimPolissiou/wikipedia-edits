His cousin, Kirill Fedorovich Nesturkh, then a young physicist, invited him to attend the defense of the dissertation of [[Abram Ioffe|Abram Fedorovich Ioffe]]. Physics lecturer Vladimir Konstantinovich Lebedinskiy had explained to Theremin the dispute over Ioffe's work on the [[electron]]. On 9 May 1913 Theremin and his cousin attended Ioffe's dissertation defense. Ioffe's subject was on the elementary photoelectric effect, the magnetic field of cathode rays and related investigations. In 1917 Theremin wrote that Ioffe talked of electrons, the photoelectric effect and magnetic fields as parts of an objective reality that surrounds us every day, unlike others that talked more of somewhat abstract formulae and symbols. Theremin wrote that he found this explanation revelatory and that it fit a scientific \u2013 not abstract \u2013 view of the world, different [[Order of magnitude|scales of magnitude]], and matter.<ref name=\"ima19\">{{cite web |title=Termens Kindheit |url=http://www.ima.or.at/theremin/?page_id=19&cat=1 |work=Erinnerungen an A.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Joffe |language=German |accessdate=2009-04-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511013506/http://www.ima.or.at/theremin/?page_id=19&cat=1 |archivedate=2009-05-11 }}</ref> From then on Theremin endeavoured to study the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], in the same way he had studied the macrocosm with his hand-built telescope.<ref name=\"ima55\"/> Later, Kyrill introduced Theremin to Ioffe as a young experimenter and physicist, and future student of the university.\n\nTheremin recalled that while still in his last year of school, he had built a million-volt [[Tesla coil]] and noticed a strong glow associated with his attempts to ionise the air. He then wished to further investigate the effects using university resources. A chance meeting with Abram Fedorovich Ioffe led to a recommendation to see Karl Karlovich Baumgart, who was in charge of the physics laboratory equipment. Karl then reserved a room and equipment for Theremin's experiments. Abram Fedorovich suggested Theremin also look at methods of creating gas fluorescence under different conditions and of examining the resulting [[Fluorescence spectroscopy|light's spectra]]. However, during these investigations Theremin was called up for [[World War I]] military service.<ref name=\"ima54\">{{cite web |author=L. S.

Theremin and others evacuated the station, sending equipment east on rail cars. Theremin then detonated explosives to destroy the 120-meter-high antennae mast before traveling to Petrograd to set up an international listening station.

He developed performance locations that could automatically react to dancers' movements with varied patterns of sound and light.\n\nThe Soviet consulate had apparently demanded he divorce Katia. Afterwards, while working with the [[American Negro Ballet Company]], the inventor married a young [[African-American]] [[prima ballerina]] [[Lavinia Williams]].<ref name=\"mattis1989\"/> Their marriage caused shock and disapproval in his social circles, but the ostracized couple remained together.<ref>[[#G|Glinsky p.&nbsp;177]].</ref>\n\n==Return to the Soviet Union==\nTheremin abruptly returned to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1938. At the time, the reasons for his return were unclear; some claimed that he was simply homesick, while others believed that he had been kidnapped by Soviet officials. Beryl Campbell, one of Theremin's dancers, said his wife Lavinia \"called to say that he had been kidnapped from his studio\" and that \"some Russians had come in\" and that she felt that he was going to be spirited out of the country.<ref name=\"t\">''[[Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey]]'', written, directed and produced by Steven M.

Galeyev, ''LMJ'' '''6'''.</ref> Shortly after he returned he was imprisoned in the [[Butyrka prison]] and later sent to work in the [[Kolyma]] gold mines. Although rumors of his execution were widely circulated and published, Theremin was, in fact, put to work in a ''[[sharashka]]'' (a secret laboratory in the [[Gulag]] camp system), together with [[Andrei Tupolev]], [[Sergei Korolev]], and other well-known scientists and engineers.<ref name=\"mattis1989\"/> The Soviet Union [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] him in 1956.\n\n==Espionage==\n[[File:Bugged-great-seal-open.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thing (listening device)|\"The Thing\"]]]]\nDuring his work at the ''sharashka'', where he was put in charge of other workers, Theremin created the Buran eavesdropping system.

In 1947, Theremin was awarded the [[USSR State Prize|Stalin prize]] for inventing this advance in Soviet espionage technology.\n\nTheremin invented another listening device called [[Thing (listening device)|The Thing]]. Disguised in a replica of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] carved in wood, in 1945 Soviet school children presented the concealed bug to U.S. [[Ambassador]] as a \"gesture of friendship\" to the USSR's [[Allies of World War II|World War II ally]].

His cousin, Kirill Fedorovich Nesturkh, then a young physicist, invited him to attend the defense of the dissertation of [[Abram Ioffe|Abram Fedorovich Ioffe]]. Physics lecturer Vladimir Konstantinovich Lebedinskiy had explained to Theremin the dispute over Ioffe's work on the [[electron]]. On 9 May 1913 Theremin and his cousin attended Ioffe's dissertation defense. Ioffe's subject was on the elementary photoelectric effect, the magnetic field of cathode rays and related investigations. In 1917 Theremin wrote that Ioffe talked of electrons, the photoelectric effect and magnetic fields as parts of an objective reality that surrounds us every day, unlike others that talked more of somewhat abstract formulae and symbols. Theremin wrote that he found this explanation revelatory and that it fit a scientific \u2013 not abstract \u2013 view of the world, different [[Order of magnitude|scales of magnitude]], and matter.<ref name=\"ima19\">{{cite web |title=Termens Kindheit |url=http://www.ima.or.at/theremin/?page_id=19&cat=1 |work=Erinnerungen an A.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Joffe |language=German |accessdate=2009-04-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511013506/http://www.ima.or.at/theremin/?page_id=19&cat=1 |archivedate=2009-05-11 }}</ref> From then on Theremin endeavoured to study the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], in the same way he had studied the macrocosm with his hand-built telescope.<ref name=\"ima55\"/> Later, Kyrill introduced Theremin to Ioffe as a young experimenter and physicist, and future student of the university.\n\nTheremin recalled that while still in his last year of school, he had built a million-volt [[Tesla coil]] and noticed a strong glow associated with his attempts to ionise the air. He then wished to further investigate the effects using university resources. A chance meeting with Abram Fedorovich Ioffe led to a recommendation to see Karl Karlovich Baumgart, who was in charge of the physics laboratory equipment. Karl then reserved a room and equipment for Theremin's experiments. Abram Fedorovich suggested Theremin also look at methods of creating gas fluorescence under different conditions and of examining the resulting [[Fluorescence spectroscopy|light's spectra]]. However, during these investigations Theremin was called up for [[World War I]] military service.<ref name=\"ima54\">{{cite web |author=L. S.

Theremin and others evacuated the station, sending equipment east on rail cars. Theremin then detonated explosives to destroy the 120-meter-high antennae mast before traveling to Petrograd to set up an international listening station.

{"title_page": "Torilis japonica", "text_new": "{{Speciesbox\n|image = Torilis japonica.jpeg\n|image_caption =\n|genus = Torilis\n|species = japonica\n|authority = ([[Houtt.]]) [[DC.]]\n}}\n\n'''''Torilis japonica''''', the '''erect hedgeparsley''',<ref name=NRCS/> '''upright hedge-parsley'''<ref name=BSBI07/> or '''Japanese hedge parsley''', is a plant species in the genus ''[[Torilis]]''. Japanese hedge parsley is considered both an [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[Biennial plant|biennial]] plant in the carrot family depending on the biogeographical location.<ref name = WDNR/> This means Japanese hedge parsley can complete its life cycle in either one or two growing seasons depending on habitat. Japanese hedge parsley is typically found in areas with disturbed soils, pastures, margins, open woodland, near waste sites, or right-of-way habitats.<ref name = Baskin/> It can withstand a variety of habitats, thriving in partial and full shaded areas, but also withstanding habitats with full sunlight penetration.<ref name = Panke/> It is considered an aggressive invasive species in North America; invading a wide range of habitats due to its environmental tolerance and tendency to outcompete native vegetation.<ref name = Panke/> This species is considered a threat in several areas that causes problems relating to overall environmental health and stability.<ref name = WDNR/> Aside from its environmental implications, ''T. japonica'' has potential to fight several cancers through a terpene it produces called Torilin, extracted from its fruits.<ref name = DiTommaso/>\n\n==Description==\nJapanese hedge parsley typically grows between 2\u20134 feet tall during its second year of growth.<ref name = WDNR/> The leaves of Japanese hedge parsley are fern-like, alternate, divided pinnately, and have very slim stems that support each leaf.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The plant doesn't flower until its second growth year in June\u2013August <ref name = Baskin/> and the flowers are white with five petals in multiple broad domed umbels.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The flowers are bisexual in the epicenter and a stamen is located at the margins of the umbels.<ref name = DiTommaso/> There are five stamens that alternate with the petals of the flowers and the ovary is located below.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Japanese hedge parsley can be described as unspecialized and self-fertile, and very attractive to pollinators.<ref name = DiTommaso/>\n\nEach plant produces easily distributable bristle-textured, rosy or white/green fruits that eventually turn brown when mature.<ref name = Renz/> The fruits are [[schizocarp]]s and then [[mericarp]]s when split into two.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The schizocarpic fruits are dry, remain closed until maturity, and have two pollen-containing chambers.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Each mericarp of the fruit is five-ribbed, making its dispersal highly effective and competitive towards native vegetation.<ref name=\"Panke\" />\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Torilis japonica blatt.jpeg|Leaf\nFile:Torilis japonica frucht.jpeg|Fruit\nFile:Torilis japonica.jpg|Illustration\n</gallery>\n\n==Distribution==\nDespite ''japonica'' meaning \u201cof Japan\u201d, the native range of Japanese hedge parsley spans from Western Europe to central Asia, northern Japan, and Mediterranean parts of northern Africa.<ref name = DiTommaso/>  In Europe, ''T. japonica'' is a summer annual/biennial. In its United States invasive range, it is considered a summer biennial. In Japan, it is considered a winter annual.<ref name = Baskin/>\n\n==As an invasive species==\nThe major threat from Japanese hedge parsley is its ability to grow vigorously and disperse rapidly.<ref name = WDNR/> Japanese hedge parsley was first introduced to North America in 1917 and has been considered invasive since its introduction.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Reasons for its introduction are unknown, but it is assumed it was for medicinal purposes because it is not considered ornamental.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The plant\u2019s current distribution as an invasive species is in southern parts of Canada and in the Midwestern, Eastern, Southern parts of the US, and Oregon.<ref name = WDNR/>\n\nIn Wisconsin, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) found that this plant tends to establish itself along roadsides, edge habitats, or open areas and then spread to grasslands, prairies, savannahs, and forests.<ref name = Renz/> A 1979 study revealed that Japanese hedge parsley seeds showed the most promising degree of survival in harsh and disturbed soils, which revealed its overall resilience and threatening ability to invade.<ref name=Roberts/> Also, the plant can produce seeds that do not germinate until the following autumn of the next year, allowing seeds to build up in the seed bank and increase elimination difficulty.<ref name = Baskin/> This strategy gives Japanese hedge parsley an advantage in areas where native vegetation fails to grow or becomes disturbed.<ref name = Baskin/> Mowing of the initially-established habitats encourage population density growth when brown fruits are present, which could be the reason for its initial ability to spread over a short period of time.\n\nThis species has been commonly misidentified with other species within the genus ''Torilis'' (''T. arvensis''), which has inhibited knowledge of its range and overall seriousness as a threat to biodiversity.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Researchers have not determined why this plant is invasive in North America while exhibiting not invasive tendencies as an agricultural weed in Europe.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The species is clearly highly adaptive to its biogeographic location, utilizing certain strategies more than others depending on the environment in which it is found. Studies have shown that seed dormancy and germination differ greatly across the US and across the globe. This limiting the scientific understanding on management strategies.<ref name=Roberts/> To date, there are no documented studies on Japanese hedge parsley\u2019s effect on native vegetation communities in relation to the possible response to climate change <ref name = DiTommaso/> or eutrophication.\n\n===Control strategies===\nThe Wisconsin DNR has listed several non-chemical ways of removing the species. They list pulling, cutting, or mowing the stems as being effective, but only 50-70% effect the following season after treatment. When the brown fruits are present on the plants, it is important to avoid mowing to limit seed spread.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> If the brown fruits are present when pulling and cutting, fruits should be disposed of properly to avoid dispersal.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Prescribed burns are another non-chemical control method that the Wisconsin DNR suggests when treating Japanese hedge parsley. After applying this control method, the following season shows a 50% effectiveness in terms of permanent removal.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Thus, burning may only be effective in conjunction with other control techniques and / or fire adapted habitats such as prairies.<ref name=\"Panke\" />\n\nThe Wisconsin DNR also recommends several chemical management options for treating Japanese hedge parsley. [[Glyphosate]], a common herbicide that is applied to the leaves of plants to regulate growth.<ref name = Henderson/> As a means of chemical control, glyphosate should be applied to Japanese hedge parsley vegetation during its first year of growth in the fall or spring.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Although, this was found to be less than 50% effective the season after treatment.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Chemical treatment with [[Metsulfuron-methyl|Metasulfuron]]  can be applied to rosettes in the spring or fall and was found to be 70-90% effective the season following the treatment.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Lastly, the DNR mentions [[Triclopyr]], a common herbicide used on woody and herbaceous weeds,<ref name = Henderson/> as a means of chemical treatment to rosettes in the spring or fall, but may result in contamination of groundwater if not used properly and is only 50-70% effective the season after the control methods.<ref name=\"Panke\" />\n\nIn terms of Japanese hedge parsley\u2019s seed resilience and germination, it was found that when exposed to lower temperatures the seeds become dormant, which can also be reversed by exposure to higher temperatures.<ref name=Roberts/> This suggests that Japanese hedge parsley can become more aggressive in higher temperatures, eluding to possible effects of climate change. A study exploring the impacts of clipping time on Japanese hedge parsley and seed production recommend clipping the plant in the reproductive phase but before fruit ripening.<ref name = Renz/>\n\nIn Wisconsin, Japanese hedge parsley is prohibited/restricted under the state's Invasive Rule- NR 40.<ref name = WDNR/> This identifies the species as established in the state and posing a huge threat to human and environmental health and transporting, possessing, or introducing without a permit is regulated.<ref name = WDNR/> Overall, very little policy has been made in response to the biological invasion of this species.\n\n==Medicinal use==\nJapanese hedge parsley has been known for its medicinal properties in Chinese traditional medicine.<ref name = DiTommaso/> It has been used for treating hemorrhoids, spasm, uterine tumors, fever, and dysentery.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Recently, medical studies have shown that Japanese Hedgeparsley may have a potential for combating cancer.<ref name = DiTommaso/> A substance known as torilin can be extracted from the plant and has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of [[5 alpha-reductase]], the enzyme that converts [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone|DHT]].<ref name=Park/> Torilin is a compound from the fruits of the plant and has been shown to inhibit the growth of blood vessels in tumor development from benign to malignant and thus has a toxic effect on tumors.<ref name = DiTommaso/> It also has been found to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to androgen, which is being studied further in the treatment of prostate cancer and alopecia.<ref name = DiTommaso/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name = Baskin>{{cite journal|last1=Baskin|first1=Jerry M.|last2=Baskin|first2=Carol C.|title=Ecophysiology of Seed Dormancy and Germination in Torilis Japonica in Relation to Its Life Cycle Strategy|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|date=1975|volume=102|issue=2|pages=67\u201372|jstor=2484415|ref=4|doi=10.2307/2484415}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web |title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |archive-date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2014-10-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = DiTommaso>DiTommaso, A., et al. \u201cNorth-East, North-Central, Mid-Atlantic United States and Southern Canada: Japanese Hedgeparsley (Torilis japonica)- A New Invasive Species in the United States.\u201d Invasive Plant Science and Management, Vol. 7, No. 4, 2014, pp. 553-560.

Japanese hedge parsley is typically found in areas with disturbed soils, pastures, margins, open woodland, near waste sites, or right-of-way habitats.<ref name = Baskin/> It can withstand a variety of habitats, thriving in partial and full shaded areas, but also withstanding habitats with full sunlight penetration.<ref name = Panke/> It is considered an aggressive invasive species in North America; invading a wide range of habitats due to its environmental tolerance and tendency to outcompete native vegetation.<ref name = Panke/> This species is considered a threat in several areas that causes problems relating to overall environmental health and stability.<ref name = WDNR/> Aside from its environmental implications, ''T. japonica'' has potential to fight several cancers through a terpene it produces called Torilin, extracted from its fruits.<ref name = DiTommaso/>\n\n==Description==\nJapanese hedge parsley typically grows between 2\u20134 feet tall during its second year of growth. <ref name = WDNR/> The leaves of Japanese hedge parsley are fern-like, alternate, divided pinnately, and have very slim stems that support each leaf.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The plant doesn't flower until its second growth year in June\u2013August <ref name = Baskin/> and the flowers are white with five petals in multiple broad domed umbels.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The flowers are bisexual in the epicenter and a stamen is located at the margins of the umbels.<ref name = DiTommaso/> There are five stamens that alternate with the petals of the flowers and the ovary is located below.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Japanese hedge parsley can be described as unspecialized and self-fertile, and very attractive to pollinators.<ref name = DiTommaso/>\n\nEach plant produces easily distributable bristle-textured, rosy or white/green fruits that eventually turn brown when mature.<ref name = Renz/> The fruits are [[schizocarp]]s and then [[mericarp]]s when split into two.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The schizocarpic fruits are dry, remain closed until maturity, and have two pollen-containing chambers.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Each mericarp of the fruit is five-ribbed, making its dispersal highly effective and competitive towards native vegetation.<ref name=\"Panke\" />\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Torilis japonica blatt.jpeg|Leaf\nFile:Torilis japonica frucht.jpeg|Fruit\nFile:Torilis japonica.jpg|Illustration\n</gallery>\n\n==Distribution==\nDespite ''japonica'' meaning \u201cof Japan\u201d, the native range of Japanese hedge parsley spans from Western Europe to central Asia, northern Japan, and Mediterranean parts of northern Africa.<ref name = DiTommaso/>  In Europe, ''T. japonica'' is a summer annual/biennial. In its United States invasive range, it is considered a summer biennial. In Japan, it is considered a winter annual.<ref name = Baskin/>\n\n==As an invasive species==\nThe major threat from Japanese hedge parsley is its ability to grow vigorously and disperse rapidly.<ref name = WDNR/> Japanese hedge parsley was first introduced to North America in 1917 and has been considered invasive since its introduction.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Reasons for its introduction are unknown, but it is assumed it was for medicinal purposes because it is not considered ornamental.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The plant\u2019s current distribution as an invasive species is in southern parts of Canada and in the Midwestern, Eastern, Southern parts of the US, and Oregon.<ref name = WDNR/>\n\nIn Wisconsin, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) found that this plant tends to establish itself along roadsides, edge habitats, or open areas and then spread to grasslands, prairies, savannahs, and forests.<ref name = Renz/> A 1979 study revealed that Japanese hedge parsley seeds showed the most promising degree of survival in harsh and disturbed soils, which revealed its overall resilience and threatening ability to invade.<ref name=Roberts/> Also, the plant can produce seeds that do not germinate until the following autumn of the next year, allowing seeds to build up in the seed bank and increase elimination difficulty.<ref name = Baskin/> This strategy gives Japanese hedge parsley an advantage in areas where native vegetation fails to grow or becomes disturbed.<ref name = Baskin/> Mowing of the initially-established habitats encourage population density growth when brown fruits are present, which could be the reason for its initial ability to spread over a short period of time.\n\nThis species has been commonly misidentified with other species within the genus ''Torilis'' (''T. arvensis''), which has inhibited knowledge of its range and overall seriousness as a threat to biodiversity.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Researchers have not determined why this plant is invasive in North America while exhibiting not invasive tendencies as an agricultural weed in Europe.<ref name = DiTommaso/> The species is clearly highly adaptive to its biogeographic location, utilizing certain strategies more than others depending on the environment in which it is found. Studies have shown that seed dormancy and germination differ greatly across the US and across the globe. This limiting the scientific understanding on management strategies.<ref name=Roberts/> To date, there are no documented studies on Japanese hedge parsley\u2019s effect on native vegetation communities in relation to the possible response to climate change <ref name = DiTommaso/> or eutrophication.\n\n===Control strategies===\nThe Wisconsin DNR has listed several non-chemical ways of removing the species. They list pulling, cutting, or mowing the stems as being effective, but only 50-70% effect the following season after treatment. When the brown fruits are present on the plants, it is important to avoid mowing to limit seed spread.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> If the brown fruits are present when pulling and cutting, fruits should be disposed of properly to avoid dispersal.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Prescribed burns are another non-chemical control method that the Wisconsin DNR suggests when treating Japanese hedge parsley. After applying this control method, the following season shows a 50% effectiveness in terms of permanent removal.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Thus, burning may only be effective in conjunction with other control techniques and / or fire adapted habitats such as prairies.<ref name=\"Panke\" />\n\nThe Wisconsin DNR also recommends several chemical management options for treating Japanese hedge parsley. [[Glyphosate]], a common herbicide that is applied to the leaves of plants to regulate growth.<ref name = Henderson/> As a means of chemical control, glyphosate should be applied to Japanese hedge parsley vegetation during its first year of growth in the fall or spring.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Although, this was found to be less than 50% effective the season after treatment.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Chemical treatment with [[Metsulfuron-methyl|Metasulfuron]]  can be applied to rosettes in the spring or fall and was found to be 70-90% effective the season following the treatment.<ref name=\"Panke\" /> Lastly, the DNR mentions [[Triclopyr]], a common herbicide used on woody and herbaceous weeds,<ref name = Henderson/> as a means of chemical treatment to rosettes in the spring or fall, but may result in contamination of groundwater if not used properly and is only 50-70% effective the season after the control methods.<ref name=\"Panke\" />\n\nIn terms of Japanese hedge parsley\u2019s seed resilience and germination, it was found that when exposed to lower temperatures the seeds become dormant, which can also be reversed by exposure to higher temperatures.<ref name=Roberts/> This suggests that Japanese hedge parsley can become more aggressive in higher temperatures, eluding to possible effects of climate change. A study exploring the impacts of clipping time on Japanese hedge parsley and seed production recommend clipping the plant in the reproductive phase but before fruit ripening.<ref name = Renz/>\n\nIn Wisconsin, Japanese hedge parsley is prohibited/restricted under the state's Invasive Rule- NR 40.<ref name = WDNR/> This identifies the species as established in the state and posing a huge threat to human and environmental health and transporting, possessing, or introducing without a permit is regulated.<ref name = WDNR/> Overall, very little policy has been made in response to the biological invasion of this species.\n\n==Medicinal use==\nJapanese hedge parsley has been known for its medicinal properties in Chinese traditional medicine.<ref name = DiTommaso/> It has been used for treating hemorrhoids, spasm, uterine tumors, fever, and dysentery.<ref name = DiTommaso/> Recently, medical studies have shown that Japanese Hedgeparsley may have a potential for combating cancer.<ref name = DiTommaso/> A substance known as torilin can be extracted from the plant and has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of [[5 alpha-reductase]], the enzyme that converts [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone|DHT]].<ref name=Park/> Torilin is a compound from the fruits of the plant and has been shown to inhibit the growth of blood vessels in tumor development from benign to malignant and thus has a toxic effect on tumors.<ref name = DiTommaso/> It also has been found to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to androgen, which is being studied further in the treatment of prostate cancer and alopecia.<ref name = DiTommaso/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name = Baskin>{{cite journal|last1=Baskin|first1=Jerry M.|last2=Baskin|first2=Carol C.|title=Ecophysiology of Seed Dormancy and Germination in Torilis Japonica in Relation to Its Life Cycle Strategy|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|date=1975|volume=102|issue=2|pages=67\u201372|jstor=2484415|ref=4|doi=10.2307/2484415}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web |title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |archive-date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2014-10-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name = DiTommaso>DiTommaso, A., et al. \u201cNorth-East, North-Central, Mid-Atlantic United States and Southern Canada: Japanese Hedgeparsley (Torilis japonica)- A New Invasive Species in the United States.\u201d Invasive Plant Science and Management, Vol. 7, No. 4, 2014, pp. 553-560.

It is formed by 5 genes: two hGH and three hPL with a similarity between 91% and 95%:\n\n* hGH-N: expressed in the [[pituitary gland]] somatotroph. It is the only one from this multigene family expressed in the [[Pituitary gland|hypophysis]]\n* hGH-V: expressed in low levels in the placenta. It codifies for a GH variety.\n* hPL-1: pseudogene also found in the placenta that contains a mutation which avoids its removal.\n* hPL-3 and hPL-4: found in the placenta. They codify for a lactogenic hormone also found in the [[placenta]].\n\nThe similarity of this five genes is shown in their function, as it has been exposed previously, but also in their structure. Each of them is formed by 5 [[exons]] and 4 [[introns]]. Their length is also very similar. Moreover, the three hPL genes, which are all found in the placenta, contain an enhancer sequence (DNA sequence that increases the transcription levels in gene family).<ref> Moreno,R.C. (Autumn 1997) Biologia molecular del complejo multig\u00e9nico hGH-hPL: potencial transcripcional de sus genes en un sistema de transcripci\u00f3n in vitro.

This space is filled with a serie of intergenic sequences repeated along the complex. The function of this sequences hasn't been clearly defined yet.\n\n== Function ==\nIt has been demonstrated that hGH-hPL multigene interacts with different hormones during pregnancy and produces different proteic products which are secreted in the maternal and fetal circulations. This interaction starts in the 6th week of pregnancy and it has an important influence on the fetus growth.\nIn the pregnant woman it increases its [[insulin-like growth factor]] (IGF) sintesys which regulates the fetus metabolism, stimulating the production of [[glucose]] and amino acids. \n\n=== Proteic products ===\nEvery gene in this multigene family produces an specific proteic product which has a great importance in the regulation of pregnancy, concretely in the correct embryo growth. \n\nIn the hGH-hPL complex, formed by 5 genes, there's only one gene which is not expressed in the placenta: the hGH-N gene, expressed in the hypophysis. This gene produces an [[isoform]] of 22 kiloDaltons and another one of 20 kiloDaltons. Both of them end up in the bloodstream with the other hormones coming from the pituitary gland. \n\nThe rest of the genes produce a set of peptides found in the placenta. On the one hand, the hGH-V gene produces two isoforms in different proportions: one of 22 kDa and the other one of 26 kDa. On the other hand, the hPL-3 and hPL-4 genes interact together secreting chorionic somatomammotropin, also called [[placental lactogen]]. The proportion of each gene in this interaction depends on every individual and is different for every pregnancy, going from a 1:1 to a 1:6 proportion of hPL-3 and hPL-4.   \n\nFinally, the hPL-1 pseudogene doesn't have a proteic product. Firstly, it was thought that this gene was inactive and wasn't transcribed. However, some posterior studies showed a small presence of the hPL-1 gene in the placenta. The absence of a proteic product produced by this gene hasn't been explained yet though.  \n\n=== Regulation of the genes ===\n* The union region of the [[PIT 1|Pit-1 factor]] is responsible of the hGH-N and hPL genes expression. However, there's a region where some proteins act as inhibitors of the merger between Pit-1 and hPLs genes blocking the expression of placental genes in the hypophysis.\n* The AP-2, NFj and USF factors boost Pit1 action by making a merge with the gene promoter in the opening transcription site.\n* Spl factor is very important for the regulation of both hPL and hGH-V genes as the deletion of its union site decreases the expression in some placental cells.\n\n== Absence of the multigenic complex ==\nIn pregnancies with complete lack of HPL and hGH-V in the placenta, the embryo suffers from a retarded growth; however, this is the only trascendental consequence and the embryo results on a healthy normal baby. The analysis in this cases show that HPL, hPL-4, hPL-3 and hGH-V genes were eliminated while hPL-1 remained intact.<ref>Rygaard, K.A.; Esquivel, E.D.; Beck, L.B.; Barrera-Salda\u00f1a, H.A.

In this way some rulers of this community inhabited their settlements which later got popular by the same name. In the same the King Sadhani established Samba  and his descendants later got to be known as Samyal(Sambyal) community. Likewise King Jasdev established Jasrota whose descendants  later got to be known as Jasrotiya community.\n[[File:Ffd4faKeJ3STdt112Wa1SQbX.jpg|alt=Source: Sanjyoti Mata Rai Temple Archives|thumb|Actual Genealogy written over the wall of the Mata Rai(Kuldevi of Lalotra's Clan) Temple Hall.]]\nThe king Laldev of Jasrotiya clan who was the ninth descendant of the king Darbal , established the name of Lion community , now abandoned is located near Gaghbaal temple Tehsil Heera Nagar, District Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir. The remains of this community can still be found over there. The descendants of the King Laldev got to be known as Lalotra Community . This Community lived on both of the banks of Bayi River in the princely state Jammu and Kashmir and according to current India map it is situated in Tehsil Shakargarh District Gurudaspur. The King Laldev who was the ancestor of Lalotra Rajput clan has three sons named 1)Nain Singh, 2)Jasaath Singh and 3)Harsaath Singh. All the three prince later established Naunaath, Jasaath and Harsaath on their names. Presently Lalotra Rajput clan's further descendants of all three of the prince also known as Naunaathiye, Jasaathiye, Harsaathiye names. \n\nAbove Genealogy data was collected by Jaimal Singh S/o Thakur Raseela Ram Jaildaar and Jageerdaar Mauja Khanna Tehsil Shakargarh District Grudaspur  in September 1916. To completely find the pedigree of their roots, they have collected data from each and every villager so that rectification of their roots can be easily sorted.\n\n== Annual Meet ==\n[[File:MDSBB8frTT811DadQe8b2NCL.jpg|alt=Source: Sanjoyti Mata Rai temple Archives|left|thumb|List of Initial Representatives of Lalotra's Clan from different Cities and States.]]\n[[File:DV4E31y1F3BErd21KbgL2g55.jpg|thumb|221x221px|Gathering of People in Kuldevi Mata Rai Temple on Annual Meetup(One day after Maha Shivratri)]]\nMembers of the Lalotra tribe get Blessings from their Kuldevi (Mata Rai) meet at Kuldevi temple on the day after Maha Shivratri annually.
