Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

When typing, Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at-a-glance, widget-like format, similar to that provided in the Siri interface. Search can display current weather, sports scores, news, and more. The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window, in the Safari web browser through the search bar, and to the left on the home screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000039/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe intelligence also extends into apps.

Most notably, [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new [[News (Apple)|Apple News]] app aggregates articles from different sources; and [[Apple Maps]] received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include [[proactivity]], where [[Siri]] and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the [[iPad]]. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' [[circadian rhythm]]s. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the [[iPhone 6S]]. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\n\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\n\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\n\n== History ==\n{{further|iOS version history#iOS 9}}\n\n=== Introduction and initial release

When typing, Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at-a-glance, widget-like format, similar to that provided in the Siri interface. Search can display current weather, sports scores, news, and more. The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window, in the Safari web browser through the search bar, and to the left on the home screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000039/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h5 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe intelligence also extends into apps.

For seed data, they partnered with Incite's Liam Dempsey Sr. who was more interested in the financial aspects of the system. Serac found the system identified high-risk individuals like Jean that could disrupt future events, and secured them in reeducation centers, justifying this to Dempsey to prevent threats to Dempsey's life. Serac is forced to kill Dempsey himself some time later; staging his death in a plane crash.\n\nIn the present, Dolores and Caleb escort Liam to safety as Serac's forces hunt them. Liam sees who Caleb really is, and in an attempt to escape, injects Caleb with \"genre\", a hallucinogenic drug making Caleb experience the world through several film genres. Dolores convinces Liam to give her his private key to aid in their escape. They meet up with Ash and Giggles to help with protecting Liam.\n\nMeanwhile, Martin has taken Bernard to Incite where Rehoboam is housed. Martin uses Liam's key to access the records on Serac to send them to Dolores. He then sends out Rehoboam's data on each individual in the world to each individual. Chaos quickly spreads across the globe as people break from the cycles that Rehoboam has set for them. Ashley appears, helping rescue Bernard from Martin, but Martin knows he is no longer necessary to Dolores' plan, and tells them to pursue Serac's reeducation facilities. When Martin is questioned by Serac's security, he detonates a bomb and kills them as well as Serac's assistant, Martel.\n\nDolores and Caleb continue on to a local airport, with Liam, Ash and Giggles in tow. Dolores tells Caleb that with Martin dead, they no longer need Liam, and Caleb struggles with what to do. Angered by the data held by Rehoboam, Ash fatally shoots Liam, and she and Giggles leave. Liam mumbles about Caleb's past as he dies, and Caleb experiences a number of confusing visions related to his military days. As the plane is readied, Dolores reviews Serac's data \u2013 the creation of Rehoboam \u2013 allowing Serac to contact and taunt her, but she tells him she has all she needs before cutting communications.

Brand invited \"reviews\" (written in the form of a letter to a friend) of the best of these items from experts in specific fields.

The ''Catalog''{{'}}s publication coincided with the great wave of social and cultural experimentation, convention-breaking, and \"[[do it yourself]]\" attitude associated with the \"[[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]\".\n\nThe influence of these ''Whole Earth Catalog''s on the rural [[back-to-the-land movement]] of the 1970s, and the communities movement within many cities, was widespread throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia.

Brand never better revealed his opinions and reason for hope than when he ran, in ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' #4, a transcription of technology historian [[Lewis Mumford]]'s talk \"The Next Transformation of Man\", in which he stated that \"man has still within him sufficient resources to alter the direction of modern civilization, for we then need no longer regard man as the passive victim of his own irreversible technological development.\"\n\nThe content of ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' often included [[futurism]] or risqu\u00e9 topics. Besides giving space to unknown writers with something valuable to say, Brand presented articles by many respected authors and thinkers, including [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Howard T. Odum]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], [[Karl Hess]], [[Orville Schell]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Ursula K.&nbsp;Le Guin]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Amory Lovins]], [[Hazel Henderson]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Lynn Margulis]], [[Eric Drexler]], [[Gerard K. O'Neill]], [[Peter Calthorpe]], [[Sim Van der Ryn]], [[Paul Hawken]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], and [[Donella Meadows]].  During ensuing years, Brand authored and edited a number of books on topics as diverse as computer-based media, the life history of buildings, and ideas about [[Space colonization|space colonies]].\n\nHe founded the ''[[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Review]],'' a supplement to the ''[[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Catalog]],'' in 1984.

Brand invited \"reviews\" (written in the form of a letter to a friend) of the best of these items from experts in specific fields. The information also described where these things could be located or purchased. The ''Catalog''{{'}}s publication coincided with the great wave of social and cultural experimentation, convention-breaking, and \"[[do it yourself]]\" attitude associated with the \"[[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]\".\n\nThe influence of these ''Whole Earth Catalog''s on the rural [[back-to-the-land movement]] of the 1970s, and the communities movement within many cities, was widespread throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia.

Brand never better revealed his opinions and reason for hope than when he ran, in ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' #4, a transcription of technology historian [[Lewis Mumford]]'s talk \"The Next Transformation of Man\", in which he stated that \"man has still within him sufficient resources to alter the direction of modern civilization, for we then need no longer regard man as the passive victim of his own irreversible technological development.\"\n\nThe content of ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' often included [[futurism]] or risqu\u00e9 topics. Besides giving space to unknown writers with something valuable to say, Brand presented articles by many respected authors and thinkers, including [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Howard T. Odum]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], [[Karl Hess]], [[Orville Schell]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Ursula K.&nbsp;Le Guin]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Amory Lovins]], [[Hazel Henderson]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Lynn Margulis]], [[Eric Drexler]], [[Gerard K. O'Neill]], [[Peter Calthorpe]], [[Sim Van der Ryn]], [[Paul Hawken]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], and [[Donella Meadows]].  During ensuing years, Brand authored and edited a number of books on topics as diverse as computer-based media, the life history of buildings, and ideas about [[Space colonization|space colonies]].\n\nHe founded the ''[[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Review]],'' a supplement to the ''[[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Catalog]],'' in 1984.

Organizations may use telecommuting to reduce costs (telecommuting employees do not require an office or [[cubicle]], a space which needs to be rented or purchased, and incurs additional costs such as lighting, climate control, etc.). Some organizations adopt telecommuting to improve workers' quality of life, as teleworking typically reduces commuting time and time stuck in [[traffic jam]]s. Along with this, teleworking may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with their personal life and family roles (e.g., caring for children or elderly parents). Some organizations adopt teleworking for environmental reasons, as telework can reduce [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[air pollution]], with less cars on the roads.\n\n==Terminology==\nAlthough the concepts of \"telecommuting\" and \"telework\" are closely related, there is a difference between the two. All types of technology-assisted work conducted outside a centrally located work space (including work undertaken in the home, outside calls, etc.) are regarded as telework. Telecommuters often maintain a traditional office and usually work from an alternative work site from 1 to 3 days a week.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = J.

In the UK between 2007 and 2012, the number of employees who usually work from home increased by 13% - an increase of almost half a million people, taking the total to over 4 million employees out of a UK workforce of 30 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/homeworking-helping-businesses-cut-costs-and-reduce-their-carbon-footprint |title=Homeworking: helping businesses cut costs and reduce their carbon footprint |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=July 18, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\nThe roots of telecommuting are found in early 1970s technology that linked satellite offices to downtown mainframes through dumb terminals using telephone lines as a network bridge. The ongoing and exponential decreases in cost along with the increases in performance and usability of personal computers, forged the way for moving the office to the home. By the early 1980s, branch offices and home workers were able to connect to organizational mainframes using personal computers and terminal emulation. Telework is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, [[videotelephony|videoconferencing]], virtual call centre, Voice over IP (VOIP), and by the decreasing cost of good quality laptop computers. It can be efficient and useful for companies since it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal phone networks.\n\nThe adoption of local area networks promoted the sharing of resources, and client\u2013server model client\u2013server computing allowed for even greater decentralization. Today, telecommuters can carry laptops which they can use both at the office, at home, and nearly anywhere else. The rise of cloud computing technology and Wi-Fi availability have enabled access to remote servers via a combination of portable hardware and software.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watad|first=Mahmoud M.|author2=Gregory T.

Telework provides flexibility in scheduling and freedom because being outside the office gives the worker more choices. Teleworkers do not have to stick to office routines and can shift work to different times of day.<ref name=\"Sardes\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-005X.2012.00284.x|title=Impact of telework on exhaustion and job engagement: A job demands and job resources model|year=2012|last1=Sardeshmukh|first1=Shruti R.|last2=Sharma|first2=Dheeraj|last3=Golden|first3=Timothy D.|journal=New Technology, Work and Employment|volume=27|issue=3|pages=193\u2013207}}</ref> Telework allows employees the freedom to choose where they work, when they work and even what they wear to work to allow their best work.<ref name=\"Gaj\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1524|pmid=18020794|title=The good, the bad, and the unknown about telecommuting: Meta-analysis of psychological mediators and individual consequences|year=2007|last1=Gajendran|first1=Ravi S.|last2=Harrison|first2=David A.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=92|issue=6|pages=1524\u20131541}}</ref> Teleworkers may experience more responsibility to the extent that they feel in control and accountable for their work.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(76)90016-7|title=Motivation through the design of work: Test of a theory|year=1976|last1=Hackman|first1=J.Richard|last2=Oldham|first2=Greg R.|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|volume=16|issue=2|pages=250\u2013279}}</ref>\nThe autonomy of telework allows for lower work-family conflict.<ref name=\"Rau\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2002.tb00105.x|title=Role Conflict and Flexible Work Arrangements: The Effects on Applicant Attraction|year=2002|last1=Rau|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Hyland|first2=Mary Anne M.|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=55|pages=111\u2013136}}</ref> Teleworking provides the freedom to arrange work to avoid family conflicts.

Feedback refers to the degree that an individual receives direct and clear information about his or her performance related to work activities.<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> Feedback is particularly important so that the employees continuously learn about how they are performing.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Electronic communication provides fewer cues for teleworkers and thus, they may have more difficulties interpreting and gaining information, and subsequently, receiving feedback.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> When a worker is not in the office, there is limited information and greater ambiguity, such as in assignments and expectations.<ref name=\"Golden11\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0018726711418387|title=Does it matter where your manager works?

The clarity, speed of response, richness of the communication, frequency, and quality of the feedback are often reduced when managers telework.<ref name=\"Golden11\"/>\n\n===Skill variety, task identity, and task significance===\nThree of the five job attributes: skill variety, task identity, and task significance, influence how much employees think their jobs are meaningful.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Skill variety is the degree that a job requires a variety of activities and skills to complete the task. An increase in skill variety is thought to increase the challenge of the job. Increasing the challenge of the job increases the individual's experienced meaningfulness, how much the individual cares about work, and finds it worthwhile.<ref name =\"Oldham 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Telework may not directly affect skill variety and task meaningfulness for the individual compared to when he or she worked in an office; however, skill variety and meaningfulness of individual tasks can increase when working in a group. If the work done at home is focused on the individual rather than the team, there may be fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills.<ref name=\"Shamir\">{{cite journal|doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4278957|title=Work-At-Home and the Quality of Working Life|year=1985|last1=Shamir|first1=Boas|last2=Salomon|first2=Ilan|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=10|issue=3|pages=455\u2013464}}</ref>\n\nTask identity is the degree that the individual sees work from beginning to end or completes an identifiable or whole piece of work rather than only a small piece. Task significance is the degree that the individual feels his or her work has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people within the organization or outside the organization.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/><ref name=\"Shamir\"/> Telework may not change the job characteristics of skill variety, task identity, and task significance compared to working in an office; however, the presence of these characteristics will influence teleworkers\u2019 work outcomes and attitudes.\n\n===Individual difference===\nIndividuals may differ in their reactions to the job characteristics in telecommuting. According to job characteristics theory, the personal need for accomplishment and development (growth need strength)<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> influences how much an individual will react to the job dimensions of telecommuting. For instance, those individuals high in growth need strength will have a more positive reaction to increased autonomy and a more negative reaction to decreased feedback in telecommuting than those individuals low in growth need strength.\n\n==Other theories==\nTelecommuting is a new work situation with a flexible structure that makes it different from traditional work environments.<ref name=\"Torraco\" >{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/hrdq.1125|title=Work design theory: A review and critique with implications for human resource development|year=2005|last1=Torraco|first1=Richard J.|journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly|volume=16|pages=85\u2013109}}</ref> Various job design theories, in addition to job characteristics theory, can help explain the differences between telecommuting and traditional job settings.\n\n===Motivator-hygiene theory===\n[[Motivator-hygiene theory]]<ref name=\"Herzberg\">Herzberg, F., Mausner, B., & Snyderman, B.B., (1959).

A working-from-home-related experiment conducted using 242 employees of a large Chinese [[travel agency]] by professors at [[Stanford]] and [[Beijing University]] found that employees randomly assigned to work at home for 9 months increased their output by 13.5% versus the office-based control group. This improvement in output arose from working 9% more hours from saved commuting time and from 3.5% improved efficiency from quieter working conditions. The study also found that home-workers reported significantly higher job-satisfaction scores and their quit rates fell by almost 50%. However, home workers' promotion rates dropped by half due to apparent performance declines, indicating a potential career cost of home-working.<ref>Bloom, Nicholas, Liang, James, Roberts, John and Ying, Jenny [http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.pdf \"Does working from home work?

Fewer, if any, traces of non-productive work activities (research, self-training, dealing with technical problems or equipment failures) and time lost on unsuccessful attempts (early drafts, fruitless endeavors, abortive innovations) are visible to employers. Piece rate, commissions, or other performance-based compensation also become more likely for telecommuters. Furthermore, major chunks of per-employee expenses are absorbed by the telecommuter himself - from simple coffee, water, electricity, and telecommunications services, to huge capital expenses like office equipment or software licenses. Thus, hours spent on the job tend to be underestimated and expenses under-reported, creating overly optimistic figures of productivity gains and savings, some or all of those in fact coming out of the telecommuter's time and pocket.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20141210926\n   |title=Richie v.

Telework is a shift in the way business is accomplished which can make a difference overtime. As an example, a recent Australian study revealed that telework enabled by the National Broadband Network is expected to add $8.3 billion to Gross Domestic Product by 2020, creating the equivalent of an additional 25,000 full-time jobs. Around 10,000 of these jobs will be in regional Australia. When it comes to environment, it has been estimated that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 percent of the time, it would save 120 million litres of fuel and 320,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. That rate of telework would also deliver a productivity benefit of between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |title=NBN - Telework (defunct) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309010053/http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |archivedate=2013-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Turnover intention===\n[[Turnover intention]], or the desire to leave the organization, is lower for teleworkers.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Those teleworkers who experienced greater professional isolation actually had lower turnover intent.<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> One study found that by increasing feedback and task identity through clear communication of goals, objectives, and expectations, turnover intent decreased in teleworkers and quality of work output increased.<ref name=\"Ilozor\"/>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages meta-analysis===\nA meta-analysis of 46 studies of telecommuting involving 12,833 employees conducted by Ravi Gajendran and David A. Harrison in the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', published by the American Psychological Association (APA), found that telecommuting has largely positive consequences for employees and employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/11/telecommuting.aspx|title=APA Press Release \"Telecommuting has Mostly Positive Consequences for Employees and Employers, Say Researchers\"\n|author=APA  |publisher=American Psychological Association  |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gaj\" /> In their meta-analytic study, Gajendran and Harrison found that telecommuting had modest but beneficial effects on employees' job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, stress levels, manager-rated job performance, and (lower) work-family conflict. Telecommuting also reduces turnover intent, or the intention to quit one's job. Increased job satisfaction, decreased turnover intent and role stress related to telecommuting partly because of a decrease in work-family conflict. Additionally, the increase in autonomy from teleworking in turn increases job satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a number of scholars and managers had previously expressed fears that employee careers might suffer and workplace relationships might be damaged because of telecommuting, the meta-analysis found that there are no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships and career outcomes.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Telecommuting actually was found to positively affect employee-supervisor relations and the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intent was in part due to supervisor relationship quality.  Only high-intensity telecommuting (where employees work from home for more than 2.5 days a week) harmed employee relationships with co-workers, even though it did reduce work-family conflict.\n\n==Potential drawbacks and concerns==\nSkill variety has the strongest relationship with internal [[work motivation]].<ref name=\"Fried\"/> Jobs that allow workers to use a variety of skills increase workers\u2019 internal work motivation. If teleworkers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills,<ref name=\"Shamir\"/> they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation.<ref name=\"Maruy\" /> It can be argued that without a work climate or manager nearby, the ability to motivate oneself is even more important when telecommuting than when working in an office. Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that telecommuting involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction,<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Reasons Why Working From Home Can be Unproductive|url=http://www.corporatesuites.com/3-reasons-working-home-can-unproductive/|publisher=Corporate Suites|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> though this can be mitigated by using short-term [[coworking]] rental facilities.\n\nFace-to-face interactions increase interpersonal contact, connectedness, and trust<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> Therefore, 54% of teleworkers thought they lost out on social interaction and 52.5% felt they lost out on professional interaction in a 2012 study.<ref name=\"Maruy\"/> Teleworking can hurt working relationships between the teleworker and their coworkers, especially if their coworkers do not telework.

This pressure to produce output, as well as a lack of social support from limited coworker relationships and feelings of isolation, leads to lower job engagement in teleworkers.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> Additionally, higher-quality relationships with teammates decreased job satisfaction of teleworkers, potentially because of frustrations with exchanging interactions via technology.<ref name=\"golden006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Golden | first1 = T.

However, with the use of [[desktop virtualization]], specifically remote desktop virtualization, any legacy application or operating system can be accessed from a mobile device, as this device is primary used as a display unit while the processing is performed on the company's internal server.\n\n===U.S. federal government===\nSince 2000, US federal law (''Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act'') requires each Executive agency to establish a telecommuting policy allowing eligible employees to participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible, so long as the employee's performance is not diminished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telework.gov/guidance-legislation/telework-legislation/legislation/|title=Telework legislation|publisher=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|accessdate=2019-03-17}}</ref> Notably, telework is not an employee right, i.e., Federal law mandates that agencies must establish telework programs, but does not give individual employees a legal right to telework.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telework.gov/guidance-legislation/telework-guidance/telework-guide/guide-to-telework-in-the-federal-government.pdf|title=Guide to Telework in the Federal Government|date=April 2011|accessdate=2019-03-17}}, p 6.</ref>\n\nIf all Federal employees who are eligible to telework full-time were to do so, the Federal Government could realize $13.9 billion savings in commuting costs annually and eliminate {{convert|21.5|e9lb|MT LT}} of pollutants from the environment each year.<ref name=twe_research_2008>{{citation |author=Telework Exchange |publisher=Telework Exchange |year=2008 |url=http://www.teleworkexchange.com/our-research/research-detail/726 |title=Telework Eligibility Profile: Feds Fit the Bill |lay-url=http://www.teleworkexchange.com/uploads/1000/95-Telework_Eligibility_Profile_Feds_Fit_the_Bill_Press_Release_FINAL_021908.pdf |laysource=Telework Exchange press release |laydate=February 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917201757/http://www.teleworkexchange.com/our-research/research-detail/726 |archivedate=September 17, 2011 }}  ''Note: access to report requires free</ref> Events in 2007 have pushed telework to the forefront as a critical measurement for the [[U.S. federal government]]. Telework relates to continuity of operations (COOP) and national pandemic preparedness planning, reducing dependence on foreign oil and the burden of rising gas prices, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), and a focus on recruitment and retention. During a keynote address at the September 12, 2007 Telework Exchange Town Hall Meeting, [[Lurita Doan]], at that time the Administrator for the [[General Services Administration]], announced an aggressive commitment goal to increase agency telework participation. Her challenge would enable 50 percent of eligible agency employees to telework one or more days per week by 2010. {{as of|2007}}, 10 percent of eligible GSA employees telework, compared to 4.2 percent for the overall Federal workforce. Her goals were to increase participation to 20 percent by the end of 2008, 40 percent by the end of 2009, and finally 50 percent by 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?pageTypeId=8199&channelId=-18821&P=&contentId=23524&contentType=GSA_BASIC|title=Administrator Doan Issues GSA Telework Challenge|author=Lurita Doan|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2012-05-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115535/http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?pageTypeId=8199&channelId=-18821&P=&contentId=23524&contentType=GSA_BASIC|archivedate=2009-08-25}}</ref>\n\nA 2007 study of [[National Science Foundation]] employees indicated that approximately one-third participated in telework regularly, characterized staff satisfaction with the program, and noted savings in employee time and greenhouse-gas emissions as a result of telework.<ref name=nsf_2007>{{citation\n |author=National Science Foundation |publisher=National Science Foundation |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=111252&org=olpa&from=news |title=\"Telework\" Benefits Employers, Employees and the Environment |date=March 11, 2008 |format=press release }}</ref><ref name=twe_research_2007>{{citation |author=Telework Exchange |publisher=Telework Exchange |title=Telework Under the Microscope - A Report on the National Science Foundation's Telework Program |url=http://www.teleworkexchange.com/our-research/research-detail/725 |laydate=March 11, 2008 |lay-url=http://www.teleworkexchange.com/uploads/1000/335-Telework_Exchange_NSF_Study_Press_Release_FINAL__03_11_08.pdf |laysource=Telework Exchange press release |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416165544/http://www.teleworkexchange.com/our-research/research-detail/725 |archivedate=April 16, 2012 }}  ''Note: access to report requires free registration on website.''</ref> Rep.

The bill requires each executive agency to establish a policy under which employees may be authorized to telework to the maximum extent possible without diminishing employee performance or agency operations.

Reports finding that all 87 agencies participating in the Data Cell had established telework policies and 73 percent of the policies met the Telework Act Requirements. More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees. More than 144,000 federal employees had written teleworking agreements with their agencies. 27 percent of teleworkers worked remotely three or more days per week.<ref name=\"mnn.com\">{{cite web |title=Federal Teleworking Report Released |url=http://www.mnn.com/money/green-workplace/blogs/federal-teleworking-report-released}}</ref> In addition to the findings, the reports examine teleworking at the Department of Defense. According to the report, there are more than 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for teleworking. Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.<ref name=\"mnn.com\"/>\n\n===Centers===\nTelework centers are offices that are generally set up close to a majority of people who might otherwise drive or take [[public transit]]. They usually feature the full complement of office equipment and a high-speed Internet connection for maximum [[productivity]]. Some feature support staff, including receptionists or administrators. For example, a number of telework centers have been set up around the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]]: 7 in Maryland, 8 in Virginia, 3 in Washington, D.C. and 1 in West Virginia. Telework centers allow people to reduce their commute yet still work in a traditional office setting. Some telework centers are set up by individual companies while others are established by independent organizations for use by many organizations. Telework centers are attractive to people who do not have the space or inclination to work from home. They offer employers the ability to maintain a more formal structure for their workforce.\n\nThese work arrangements are more likely to become more popular with current trends towards greater customization of services and virtual organizing. Distributed work offers great potential for firms to reduce costs, enhance competitive advantage and agility, access a greater variety of scarce talents, and improve employee flexibility, effectiveness and productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.38.12.1687|title=An Emerging Distributed Work Arrangement: An Investigation of Computer-Based Supplemental Work at Home|year=1992|last1=Venkatesh|first1=Alladi|last2=Vitalari|first2=Nicholas P.|journal=Management Science|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1687\u20131706}}</ref><ref>Korte, W.

While increasing in importance, distributed work has not yet gained widespread acceptance in Asia.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/tem.2004.830859|title=Effects of Environmental Uncertainty on Organizational Intention to Adopt Distributed Work Arrangements|year=2004|last1=Sia|first1=Choon-Ling|last2=Teo|first2=Hock-Hai|last3=Tan|first3=B.C.Y.|last4=Wei|first4=Kwok-Kee|journal=IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management|volume=51|issue=3|pages=253\u2013267}}</ref>\n\n===Remote office centers===\n[[Remote office center]]s (ROCs) are distributed centers for leasing offices to individuals from multiple companies.  A remote office center provides professional grade network access, phone system, security system, mail stop and optional services for additional costs.  ROCs are generally located in areas near to where people live throughout population centers, so that workers do not have to commute more than a couple of miles.  The telecommuter works in a real office but accesses the company network across the internet using a VPN just as in traditional telecommuting.\n\nThis type of arrangement does not share fully in the benefits of home-based telecommuting, but can address the needs of employees who are unable or unwilling to work from home.\n\n===Information Security for Teleworkers===\n\"To hackers who make a living stealing information from unsecured computers and network connections, the teleworker could be an open the door to the organization\u2019s most sensitive data. Security and privacy have become increasingly rare commodities these days thanks to the ability of hackers to stay one step ahead of just about every security measure that technicians can create.  Security breaches are a significant enough threat in a standard office environment; however, when an organization has employees working from home or on the go, these risks become even greater.\n\nIt is vital for organizations to convey to teleworkers that data protection and information security are important to an organization, and employees\u2019 actions make a difference in achieving the overall goal of protection of sensitive data. Despite increased awareness and training on security issues, many employees do not take the necessary precautions for deterring security risks.\n\nReal security begins with security policy. The Information Security professional must ensure that the security policy covers telecommuting/teleworking and who may telework, services available to teleworkers, information restrictions, identification/authentication/authorization, equipment and software specifications, integrity and confidentiality, maintenance guidelines, and robust user education.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Improving Information Security for Teleworkers |first=Tim |last=Godlove |url=https://www.ufairfax.edu/news/Improving-Information-Security-for-Teleworkers-20170113-0022 |publisher=University of Fairfax }}</ref>\n\n===Other countries===\nAccording to an article from the ''New York Times'', telecommuting now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency.  The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked to be back in the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers\u2019 flexibility.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Marilynn K.|title=It's Unclearly Defined, but Telecommuting Is Fast on the Rise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAmerica has an increasing trend of using teleworking  due to its strong economics and multimedia services.

An article from money.163.com states that the number of telecommuters in the Asia pacific region exceeds region like America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific region has about 37% telecommuters while the others have about 23-4%.{{Dubious |reason=What does 23-4% mean?

One of the ethical issues behind telecommuting is who should have the chance to telecommute? One may have more chance to work at home because he/she has young children. The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.\n\n===Effects of 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic===\nAnalysts have suggested that the ongoing [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] could be a \"tipping point\" for telecommuting.<ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/coronavirus-tipping-point-finally-telecommuting/</ref> In [[Seattle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google]] have mandated employees work from home.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166686/coronavirus-amazon-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter-seattle-staff-remote-work</ref><ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/seattle-morning-traffic-disappears-amazon-microsoft-others-enforce-remote-work-policies/</ref> Others have suggested that an increase in telecommuting as a result of the outbreak could result in an expanded [[right to Internet access]] in the United States.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-03-06/coronavirus-telecommute-work-from-home</ref>\n\n==Related terms and concepts==\n\n===Coworking===\n{{main|Coworking}}\nCoworking is a social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share a common working area as well as the synergy that can happen from working with people in the same space. Coworking facilities can range from shared space in formal offices to social areas such as a coffee shop. Entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs often cowork in shared office and workshop facilities provided by [[business incubator]]s and [[business accelerator]] organizations. In entrepreneurship, coworking allows creative start-up founders, researchers and knowledge workers to [[business network|meet and share ideas]], collaborate, share new research, and find potential partners.\n\n===Distributed work===\nDistributed work entails the conduct of organizational tasks in places that extend beyond the confines of traditional [[office]]s or workspaces. It can refer to organizational arrangements that permit or require workers to perform work more effectively at any appropriate location&mdash;such as their homes or [[customer|customers']] sites&mdash;through the application of information and communication technology. An example is [[financial planner]]s who meet clients during the client's lunchtime at the client's workplace; even though this is an out-of-the-office, meeting, the [[Internet]] enables the planner to present financial planning tools and presentations on their mobile computers. Another example is a [[publishing]] executives who recommends books and places orders for the latest book offerings to libraries and university professors from the executive's home using e-mail or an online system. If this type of distributed work replaces the worker's commute, it would be considered telecommuting. If not, it would be telework (see [[#Definition|\u00a71. Definition]]).\n\n===Hoteling===\nSome companies, particularly those where employees spend a great deal of time on the road and at remote locations, offer a [[hotdesking]] or [[hoteling]] arrangement where employees can reserve the use of a temporary traditional office, [[cubicle]] or [[meeting room]] at the company headquarters, a [[remote office center]], or other shared office facility.\n\n== {{anchor|Homeworker}}Homeworker ==\n'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].\n\nHomeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes. Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for. Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Media richness theory]]\n* [[Work\u2013family conflict]]\n* [[Canadian Telework Association]] (CTA)\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]: the online versions of office suites mentioned there are useful for telecommuters)\n* [[Comparison of FTP client software]]: for file upload to a server\n* [[Comparison of file hosting services]]: for file upload to a server and sharing\n* [[Comparison of cross-platform instant messaging clients]]: for communication and p2p file sharing\n* [[Comparison of web conferencing software]]: for communication with groups\n* [[Corporate wiki]]\n* [[Coworking]]\n* [[Delivery service]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}\n* [[Distance learning]]\n* [[Flextime]]\n* [[Home Work Convention, 1996]]\n* [[Hot desking]]\n* [[Hoteling]]\n* [[Job characteristic theory]]\n* [[Labour market flexibility]]\n* [[Outsourcing]]\n* [[Putting-out system]]\n* [[Small office/home office]]\n* [[Study (room)]]\n* [[Telecentre]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Virtual assistant (occupation)|Virtual assistant]]\n* [[Virtual team]]\n* [[Virtual volunteering]]\n* [[Work at home scheme]]\n* [[Work-life balance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[John O'Duinn|O'Duinn, J.]], (2018) Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart, {{ISBN|978-1732254909}}\n* Thomas L.

Organizations may use telecommuting to reduce costs (telecommuting employees do not require an office or [[cubicle]], a space which needs to be rented or purchased, and incurs additional costs such as lighting, climate control, etc.). Some organizations adopt telecommuting to improve workers' quality of life, as teleworking typically reduces commuting time and time stuck in [[traffic jam]]s. Along with this, teleworking may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with their personal life and family roles (e.g., caring for children or elderly parents). Some organizations adopt teleworking for environmental reasons, as telework can reduce [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[air pollution]], with less cars on the roads.\n\n==Terminology==\nAlthough the concepts of \"telecommuting\" and \"telework\" are closely related, there is a difference between the two. All types of technology-assisted work conducted outside a centrally located work space (including work undertaken in the home, outside calls, etc.) are regarded as telework. Telecommuters often maintain a traditional office and usually work from an alternative work site from 1 to 3 days a week.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = J.

The ongoing and exponential decreases in cost along with the increases in performance and usability of personal computers, forged the way for moving the office to the home. By the early 1980s, branch offices and home workers were able to connect to organizational mainframes using personal computers and terminal emulation. Telework is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, [[videotelephony|videoconferencing]], virtual call centre, Voice over IP (VOIP), and by the decreasing cost of good quality laptop computers. It can be efficient and useful for companies since it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal phone networks.\n\nThe adoption of local area networks promoted the sharing of resources, and client\u2013server model client\u2013server computing allowed for even greater decentralization. Today, telecommuters can carry laptops which they can use both at the office, at home, and nearly anywhere else.

A working-from-home-related experiment conducted using 242 employees of a large Chinese [[travel agency]] by professors at [[Stanford]] and [[Beijing University]] found that employees randomly assigned to work at home for 9 months increased their output by 13.5% versus the office-based control group. This improvement in output arose from working 9% more hours from saved commuting time and from 3.5% improved efficiency from quieter working conditions. The study also found that home-workers reported significantly higher job-satisfaction scores and their quit rates fell by almost 50%. However, home workers' promotion rates dropped by half due to apparent performance declines, indicating a potential career cost of home-working.<ref>Bloom, Nicholas, Liang, James, Roberts, John and Ying, Jenny [http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.pdf \"Does working from home work?

Fewer, if any, traces of non-productive work activities (research, self-training, dealing with technical problems or equipment failures) and time lost on unsuccessful attempts (early drafts, fruitless endeavors, abortive innovations) are visible to employers. Piece rate, commissions, or other performance-based compensation also become more likely for telecommuters. Furthermore, major chunks of per-employee expenses are absorbed by the telecommuter himself - from simple coffee, water, electricity, and telecommunications services, to huge capital expenses like office equipment or software licenses. Thus, hours spent on the job tend to be underestimated and expenses under-reported, creating overly optimistic figures of productivity gains and savings, some or all of those in fact coming out of the telecommuter's time and pocket.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20141210926\n   |title=Richie v.

Telework is a shift in the way business is accomplished which can make a difference overtime. As an example, a recent Australian study revealed that telework enabled by the National Broadband Network is expected to add $8.3 billion to Gross Domestic Product by 2020, creating the equivalent of an additional 25,000 full-time jobs. Around 10,000 of these jobs will be in regional Australia. When it comes to environment, it has been estimated that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 percent of the time, it would save 120 million litres of fuel and 320,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. That rate of telework would also deliver a productivity benefit of between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |title=NBN - Telework (defunct) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309010053/http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |archivedate=2013-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Turnover intention===\n[[Turnover intention]], or the desire to leave the organization, is lower for teleworkers.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Those teleworkers who experienced greater professional isolation actually had lower turnover intent.<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> One study found that by increasing feedback and task identity through clear communication of goals, objectives, and expectations, turnover intent decreased in teleworkers and quality of work output increased.<ref name=\"Ilozor\"/>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages meta-analysis===\nA meta-analysis of 46 studies of telecommuting involving 12,833 employees conducted by Ravi Gajendran and David A. Harrison in the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', published by the American Psychological Association (APA), found that telecommuting has largely positive consequences for employees and employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/11/telecommuting.aspx|title=APA Press Release \"Telecommuting has Mostly Positive Consequences for Employees and Employers, Say Researchers\"\n|author=APA  |publisher=American Psychological Association  |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gaj\" /> In their meta-analytic study, Gajendran and Harrison found that telecommuting had modest but beneficial effects on employees' job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, stress levels, manager-rated job performance, and (lower) work-family conflict. Telecommuting also reduces turnover intent, or the intention to quit one's job. Increased job satisfaction, decreased turnover intent and role stress related to telecommuting partly because of a decrease in work-family conflict. Additionally, the increase in autonomy from teleworking in turn increases job satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a number of scholars and managers had previously expressed fears that employee careers might suffer and workplace relationships might be damaged because of telecommuting, the meta-analysis found that there are no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships and career outcomes.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Telecommuting actually was found to positively affect employee-supervisor relations and the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intent was in part due to supervisor relationship quality.  Only high-intensity telecommuting (where employees work from home for more than 2.5 days a week) harmed employee relationships with co-workers, even though it did reduce work-family conflict.\n\n==Potential drawbacks and concerns==\nSkill variety has the strongest relationship with internal [[work motivation]].<ref name=\"Fried\"/> Jobs that allow workers to use a variety of skills increase workers\u2019 internal work motivation. If teleworkers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills,<ref name=\"Shamir\"/> they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation.<ref name=\"Maruy\" /> It can be argued that without a work climate or manager nearby, the ability to motivate oneself is even more important when telecommuting than when working in an office. Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that telecommuting involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction,<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Reasons Why Working From Home Can be Unproductive|url=http://www.corporatesuites.com/3-reasons-working-home-can-unproductive/|publisher=Corporate Suites|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> though this can be mitigated by using short-term [[coworking]] rental facilities.\n\nFace-to-face interactions increase interpersonal contact, connectedness, and trust<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> Therefore, 54% of teleworkers thought they lost out on social interaction and 52.5% felt they lost out on professional interaction in a 2012 study.<ref name=\"Maruy\"/> Teleworking can hurt working relationships between the teleworker and their coworkers, especially if their coworkers do not telework.

More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees.

Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.<ref name=\"mnn.com\"/>\n\n===Centers===\nTelework centers are offices that are generally set up close to a majority of people who might otherwise drive or take [[public transit]]. They usually feature the full complement of office equipment and a high-speed Internet connection for maximum [[productivity]]. Some feature support staff, including receptionists or administrators. For example, a number of telework centers have been set up around the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]]: 7 in Maryland, 8 in Virginia, 3 in Washington, D.C. and 1 in West Virginia. Telework centers allow people to reduce their commute yet still work in a traditional office setting. Some telework centers are set up by individual companies while others are established by independent organizations for use by many organizations. Telework centers are attractive to people who do not have the space or inclination to work from home. They offer employers the ability to maintain a more formal structure for their workforce.\n\nThese work arrangements are more likely to become more popular with current trends towards greater customization of services and virtual organizing. Distributed work offers great potential for firms to reduce costs, enhance competitive advantage and agility, access a greater variety of scarce talents, and improve employee flexibility, effectiveness and productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.38.12.1687|title=An Emerging Distributed Work Arrangement: An Investigation of Computer-Based Supplemental Work at Home|year=1992|last1=Venkatesh|first1=Alladi|last2=Vitalari|first2=Nicholas P.|journal=Management Science|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1687\u20131706}}</ref><ref>Korte, W.

A remote office center provides professional grade network access, phone system, security system, mail stop and optional services for additional costs.  ROCs are generally located in areas near to where people live throughout population centers, so that workers do not have to commute more than a couple of miles.  The telecommuter works in a real office but accesses the company network across the internet using a VPN just as in traditional telecommuting.\n\nThis type of arrangement does not share fully in the benefits of home-based telecommuting, but can address the needs of employees who are unable or unwilling to work from home.\n\n===Information Security for Teleworkers===\n\"To hackers who make a living stealing information from unsecured computers and network connections, the teleworker could be an open the door to the organization\u2019s most sensitive data. Security and privacy have become increasingly rare commodities these days thanks to the ability of hackers to stay one step ahead of just about every security measure that technicians can create.  Security breaches are a significant enough threat in a standard office environment; however, when an organization has employees working from home or on the go, these risks become even greater.\n\nIt is vital for organizations to convey to teleworkers that data protection and information security are important to an organization, and employees\u2019 actions make a difference in achieving the overall goal of protection of sensitive data. Despite increased awareness and training on security issues, many employees do not take the necessary precautions for deterring security risks.\n\nReal security begins with security policy. The Information Security professional must ensure that the security policy covers telecommuting/teleworking and who may telework, services available to teleworkers, information restrictions, identification/authentication/authorization, equipment and software specifications, integrity and confidentiality, maintenance guidelines, and robust user education.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Improving Information Security for Teleworkers |first=Tim |last=Godlove |url=https://www.ufairfax.edu/news/Improving-Information-Security-for-Teleworkers-20170113-0022 |publisher=University of Fairfax }}</ref>\n\n===Other countries===\nAccording to an article from the ''New York Times'', telecommuting now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency.  The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked to be back in the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers\u2019 flexibility.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Marilynn K.|title=It's Unclearly Defined, but Telecommuting Is Fast on the Rise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAmerica has an increasing trend of using teleworking  due to its strong economics and multimedia services.

The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.\n\n===Effects of 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic===\nAnalysts have suggested that the ongoing [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] could be a \"tipping point\" for telecommuting.<ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/coronavirus-tipping-point-finally-telecommuting/</ref> In [[Seattle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google]] have mandated employees work from home.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166686/coronavirus-amazon-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter-seattle-staff-remote-work</ref><ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/seattle-morning-traffic-disappears-amazon-microsoft-others-enforce-remote-work-policies/</ref> Others have suggested that an increase in telecommuting as a result of the outbreak could result in an expanded [[right to Internet access]] in the United States.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-03-06/coronavirus-telecommute-work-from-home</ref>\n\n==Related terms and concepts==\n\n===Coworking===\n{{main|Coworking}}\nCoworking is a social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share a common working area as well as the synergy that can happen from working with people in the same space. Coworking facilities can range from shared space in formal offices to social areas such as a coffee shop. Entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs often cowork in shared office and workshop facilities provided by [[business incubator]]s and [[business accelerator]] organizations. In entrepreneurship, coworking allows creative start-up founders, researchers and knowledge workers to [[business network|meet and share ideas]], collaborate, share new research, and find potential partners.\n\n===Distributed work===\nDistributed work entails the conduct of organizational tasks in places that extend beyond the confines of traditional [[office]]s or workspaces. It can refer to organizational arrangements that permit or require workers to perform work more effectively at any appropriate location&mdash;such as their homes or [[customer|customers']] sites&mdash;through the application of information and communication technology. An example is [[financial planner]]s who meet clients during the client's lunchtime at the client's workplace; even though this is an out-of-the-office, meeting, the [[Internet]] enables the planner to present financial planning tools and presentations on their mobile computers. Another example is a [[publishing]] executives who recommends books and places orders for the latest book offerings to libraries and university professors from the executive's home using e-mail or an online system. If this type of distributed work replaces the worker's commute, it would be considered telecommuting. If not, it would be telework (see [[#Definition|\u00a71. Definition]]).\n\n===Hoteling===\nSome companies, particularly those where employees spend a great deal of time on the road and at remote locations, offer a [[hotdesking]] or [[hoteling]] arrangement where employees can reserve the use of a temporary traditional office, [[cubicle]] or [[meeting room]] at the company headquarters, a [[remote office center]], or other shared office facility.\n\n== {{anchor|Homeworker}}Homeworker ==\n'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].\n\nHomeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes. Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for. Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Media richness theory]]\n* [[Work\u2013family conflict]]\n* [[Canadian Telework Association]] (CTA)\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]: the online versions of office suites mentioned there are useful for telecommuters)\n* [[Comparison of FTP client software]]: for file upload to a server\n* [[Comparison of file hosting services]]: for file upload to a server and sharing\n* [[Comparison of cross-platform instant messaging clients]]: for communication and p2p file sharing\n* [[Comparison of web conferencing software]]: for communication with groups\n* [[Corporate wiki]]\n* [[Coworking]]\n* [[Delivery service]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}\n* [[Distance learning]]\n* [[Flextime]]\n* [[Home Work Convention, 1996]]\n* [[Hot desking]]\n* [[Hoteling]]\n* [[Job characteristic theory]]\n* [[Labour market flexibility]]\n* [[Outsourcing]]\n* [[Putting-out system]]\n* [[Small office/home office]]\n* [[Study (room)]]\n* [[Telecentre]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Virtual assistant (occupation)|Virtual assistant]]\n* [[Virtual team]]\n* [[Virtual volunteering]]\n* [[Work at home scheme]]\n* [[Work-life balance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[John O'Duinn|O'Duinn, J.]], (2018) Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart, {{ISBN|978-1732254909}}\n* Thomas L.
