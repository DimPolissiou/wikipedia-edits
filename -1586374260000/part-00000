An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments. Those employed by non-profit (or not-for profit in Canada) organizations are in charge of organizing fund-raising events and enlisting financial supporters. Additionally, arts administrators are expected to conduct grant research, apply for grants and disburse acquired funding so that programming can continue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Arts_Administrator_Job_Description_Duties_and_Career_Outlook.html|title=Arts Administrator: Job Description, Duties and Career Outlook|last=|first=|date=|website=study.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn arts administrator employed by a small organization can be responsible for [[marketing|marketing events]], event booking, and managing project budges. An arts administrator employed by a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), administrative staff, [[public relations]], marketing, writing proposals and reports.\n\nA senior-level arts administrator may advise the [[board of directors]] or other senior managers on strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal [[public policy]] as it relates to [[human resources]], [[health insurance]], [[labor laws]] and volunteer risk management.<ref name=\"prospects.ac.uk\" />\n\nArts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gates|first=Leslie|date=2010|title=Professional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25746078?seq=1|journal=Studies in Arts Education|volume=V.52 no.1|pages=6-17|access-date=2018-09-16|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy in Arts Administration==\nLike any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 84.</ref> External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 87.</ref>  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 93.</ref> Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times. Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues. As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.\n\nThe history of Advocacy for the arts in Canada is largely represented by the Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des Artistes Canadiens (CARFAC). It is a [[non-profit corporation]] that serves as the national voice of Canada's professional visual artists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfac.ca/about/|title=About CARFAC|last=|first=|date=|website=CARFAC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The organization's active involvement in advocacy, [[lobbying]], research and public education on behalf of artists in Canada has defined CARFAC as an integral representative body for artists across Canada.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1975 CARFAC was successful in lobbying for exhibition fees for artists.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfac.ca/about/carfac-history/|title=CARFAC History|last=|first=|date=|website=CARFAC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> As a result the Canada Council made the payment of fees to living Canadian artists a requirement for eligibility for Program Assistance Grants to Public Art Galleries.<ref name=\":2\" /> CARFAC\u2019s advocacy for artists resulted in the creation of the federal Copyright Act amendment in 1988.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Act recognizes artists as the primary producers of culture, and gives artists legal entitlement to exhibition and other fees.<ref name=\":2\" /> Arts Administrators throughout Canada actively refer to CARFAC's artist fee requirements when hiring professional artists.\n\n== Government Funding and Granting Bodies  ==\nEach country has their own models and agencies to fund the arts. In Canada the arts are funded by the Canadian government through the Department of Canadian Heritage. Each province has a ministry that funds arts and culture. Depending on the governmental party in power, the amount of funds available for the arts and culture vary. In Ontario, the Ministry that funds the arts is the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-heritage-sport-tourism-culture-industries|title=Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Cultural Industries|last=|first=|date=|website=Ontario.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> \n\nIn Canada there are federal, provincial and municipal granting bodies that fund the arts. These granting bodies are arms-length funding agencies, meaning they work separately from the government. Canada Council for the Arts, a federal granting body, was created in 1957 and it fulfilled the requirements of the Massey Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-council-for-the-arts|title=Canada Council for the Art|last=|first=|date=2011-09-05|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Canada Council for the Arts funds artists, collectives and arts organizations from all provinces and territories in Canada.

The State/Regional Arts Agencies are funded through the NEA since they are required to apportion funds to any state that has an art agency. Local Arts Agencies function as councils or commissions, or as city departments, and are funded by various sources: the NEA; state arts agencies, municipal budgets, and private donations.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/how-the-us-funds-the-arts.pdf|title=How the United States Funds the Arts|last=|first=|date=|website=National Endowment of the Arts|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe arts in the United Kingdom is funded through the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport which is a department of the United Kingdom government.

From 1990 to 1999, 35 percent of the United States currently active, larger foundations (with assets over $1 million) were established, and 23 percent were established between 2000 and 2009.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to larger entities, small private or family foundations also give significant amounts to the arts.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some institutions foster more mainstream projects, while others specialize in supporting the avant-garde. Small foundations can be well-suited at identifying and addressing unmet community needs, and they can assist in identifying additional funding sources for undercapitalized projects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Corporate giving, like foundation giving, has been influenced by public policy decisions. Corporations have received tax breaks for supporting the arts since 1936.<ref name=\":0\" /> Corporations give more to the arts when they receive tax benefits for doing so.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Planned Giving ==\nPlanned giving also known as legacy giving is a form of philanthropy that is a common practice in the arts sector. Planned giving is when a donor leaves an endowment, assets or a portion of their last will and testament to an organization at the end of their lifetime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagp-acpdp.org/en/about-gift-planning|title=About Gift Planning|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Association of Gift Planners|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Strategic charitable gift planning is a donor-centred process of planning current and future charitable gifts in a way that meets the donor\u2019s philanthropic goals and balances personal, family and tax considerations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagp-acpdp.org/en/about-gift-planning|title=About Gift Planning|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Association of Gift Planners|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Legacy giving is considered the highest charitable gift an organization can receive and often takes many years to establish this kind of relationship with a donor. \n\n==Academic programs==\nArts administration programs are available at a number of universities and colleges in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.<!-- No others? -->   In the United States, these programs began in the 1970s at several schools after meetings with the National Endowment for the Arts on how the next generations of arts leaders would be educated.  Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.\n\nArts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University}}</ref>  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.\n\nAt some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|title=Arts Management Degree Programs & Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|title=Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|website=www.depaul.edu|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref>, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program, [[University of Southern California]]'s Master of Science in Arts Leadership program).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|title=Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|website=theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/|title=Arts Leadership {{!}} USC Thornton School of Music|website=music.usc.edu|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>  \n\nUniversities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while its undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.\n\nThough curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent \"in the field,\" applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual & performing arts centers.\n\nMost programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency.

For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.<ref>[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.\n\nOther programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.\n\nSome programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs. Another example is the University of Southern California's [https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/ Master of Science in Arts Leadership] which is housed within the [[USC Thornton School of Music]], and accepts thought leaders in any artistic discipline including music, theatre, dance, film, and fine art.\n\nSeveral universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management.

An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments. Those employed by non-profit (or not-for profit in Canada) organizations are in charge of organizing fund-raising events and enlisting financial supporters. Additionally, arts administrators are expected to conduct grant research, apply for grants and disburse acquired funding so that programming can continue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Arts_Administrator_Job_Description_Duties_and_Career_Outlook.html|title=Arts Administrator: Job Description, Duties and Career Outlook|last=|first=|date=|website=study.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn arts administrator employed by a small organization can be responsible for [[marketing|marketing events]], event booking, and managing project budges. An arts administrator employed by a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), administrative staff, [[public relations]], marketing, writing proposals and reports.\n\nA senior-level arts administrator may advise the [[board of directors]] or other senior managers on strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal [[public policy]] as it relates to [[human resources]], [[health insurance]], [[labor laws]] and volunteer risk management.<ref name=\"prospects.ac.uk\" />\n\nArts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gates|first=Leslie|date=2010|title=Professional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25746078?seq=1|journal=Studies in Arts Education|volume=V.52 no.1|pages=6-17|access-date=2018-09-16|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy in Arts Administration==\nLike any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 84.</ref> External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 87.</ref>  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 93.</ref> Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times. Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues. As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.\n\nThe history of Advocacy for the arts in Canada is largely represented by the Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des Artistes Canadiens (CARFAC). It is a [[non-profit corporation]] that serves as the national voice of Canada's professional visual artists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfac.ca/about/|title=About CARFAC|last=|first=|date=|website=CARFAC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The organization's active involvement in advocacy, [[lobbying]], research and public education on behalf of artists in Canada has defined CARFAC as an integral representative body for artists across Canada.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1975 CARFAC was successful in lobbying for exhibition fees for artists.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfac.ca/about/carfac-history/|title=CARFAC History|last=|first=|date=|website=CARFAC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> As a result the Canada Council made the payment of fees to living Canadian artists a requirement for eligibility for Program Assistance Grants to Public Art Galleries.<ref name=\":2\" /> CARFAC\u2019s advocacy for artists resulted in the creation of the federal Copyright Act amendment in 1988.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Act recognizes artists as the primary producers of culture, and gives artists legal entitlement to exhibition and other fees.<ref name=\":2\" /> Arts Administrators throughout Canada actively refer to CARFAC's artist fee requirements when hiring professional artists.\n\n== Government Funding, Granting Bodies and US Foundations ==\nEach country has their own models and agencies to fund the arts. In Canada the arts are funded by the Canadian government through the Department of Canadian Heritage. Each province has a ministry that funds arts and culture. Depending on the governmental party in power, the amount of funds available for the arts and culture vary. In Ontario, the Ministry that funds the arts is the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-heritage-sport-tourism-culture-industries|title=Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Cultural Industries|last=|first=|date=|website=Ontario.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> \n\nIn Canada there are federal, provincial and municipal granting bodies that fund the arts. These granting bodies are arms-length funding agencies, meaning they work separately from the government. Canada Council for the Arts, a federal granting body, was created in 1957 and it fulfilled the requirements of the Massey Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-council-for-the-arts|title=Canada Council for the Art|last=|first=|date=2011-09-05|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Canada Council for the Arts funds artists, collectives and arts organizations from all provinces and territories in Canada.

The State/Regional Arts Agencies are funded through the NEA since they are required to apportion funds to any state that has an art agency.

From 1990 to 1999, 35 percent of the United States currently active, larger foundations (with assets over $1 million) were established, and 23 percent were established between 2000 and 2009.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to larger entities, small private or family foundations also give significant amounts to the arts.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some institutions foster more mainstream projects, while others specialize in supporting the avant-garde. Small foundations can be well-suited at identifying and addressing unmet community needs, and they can assist in identifying additional funding sources for undercapitalized projects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Corporate giving, like foundation giving, has been influenced by public policy decisions. Corporations have received tax breaks for supporting the arts since 1936.<ref name=\":0\" /> Corporations give more to the arts when they receive tax benefits for doing so.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Planned Giving ==\nPlanned giving also known as legacy giving is a form of philanthropy that is a common practice in the arts sector. Planned giving is when a donor leaves an endowment, assets or a portion of their last will and testament to an organization at the end of their lifetime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagp-acpdp.org/en/about-gift-planning|title=About Gift Planning|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Association of Gift Planners|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Strategic charitable gift planning is a donor-centred process of planning current and future charitable gifts in a way that meets the donor\u2019s philanthropic goals and balances personal, family and tax considerations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagp-acpdp.org/en/about-gift-planning|title=About Gift Planning|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Association of Gift Planners|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Legacy giving is considered the highest charitable gift an organization can receive and often takes many years to establish this kind of relationship with a donor. \n\n==Academic programs==\nArts administration programs are available at a number of universities and colleges in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.<!-- No others? -->   In the United States, these programs began in the 1970s at several schools after meetings with the National Endowment for the Arts on how the next generations of arts leaders would be educated.  Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.\n\nArts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University}}</ref>  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.\n\nAt some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|title=Arts Management Degree Programs & Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|title=Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|website=www.depaul.edu|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref>, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program, [[University of Southern California]]'s Master of Science in Arts Leadership program).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|title=Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|website=theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/|title=Arts Leadership {{!}} USC Thornton School of Music|website=music.usc.edu|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>  \n\nUniversities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while its undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.\n\nThough curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent \"in the field,\" applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations.

For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.<ref>[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.\n\nOther programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.\n\nSome programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs. Another example is the University of Southern California's [https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/ Master of Science in Arts Leadership] which is housed within the [[USC Thornton School of Music]], and accepts thought leaders in any artistic discipline including music, theatre, dance, film, and fine art.\n\nSeveral universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management.

extradition bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system

/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim that it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters demanded an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel had exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed shop openings.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries issued travel warnings to their citizens concerning Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] was criticised for its performance during the protests.

Criminals took advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain illegal acts such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency than the same period the year before.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who opposed the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future drove youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June 2019, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed shop openings.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

People who opposed the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.
