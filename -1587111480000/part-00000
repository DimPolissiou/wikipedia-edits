\n\n==2019 Libyan National Conference==\n{{main|Libyan National Conference}}\nA meeting, called the [[Libyan National Conference]], was planned in [[Ghadames]] for organising [[2019 Libyan general election|elections]] and a peace process in [[Libya]].<ref name=\"WashPost_NatConf\" /> The conference was prepared over 18 months during 2018 and 2019 and was planned to take place 14\u201316 April 2019.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_Salame_20190409\" /> It was postponed in early April 2019 as a result of the military actions of the [[2019 Western Libya offensive]].<ref name=\"NatConf_postponed\" />\n\n==Salam\u00e9 three-point peace plan==\nOn 29 July 2019, [[Ghassan Salam\u00e9]], head of the [[United Nations Support Mission in Libya]] (UNSMIL), proposed a three-point peace plan to the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC), which would \"require consensus in [the UNSC] and amongst the Member States who exert influence on the ground\" and require Libyans \"to listen to their better angels\" rather than  \"[fight] the wars of others and in so doing [destroy] their country.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_July19_peaceplan\" /> Salam\u00e9's plan includes:\n\n# a [[ceasefire|truce]] between the [[Government of National Accord]] (GNA) and [[Libyan National Army]] (LNA) and their associated militias on [[Eid al-Adha]], along with [[confidence-building measures]] such as prisoner exchanges, releasing [[arbitrary detention|arbitrarily detained]] prisoners and exchanging the remains of victims of the conflict;<ref name=\"UNSMIL_July19_peaceplan\" />\n# an international meeting of countries implicated in the conflict, to stop the fighting, implement the legally existing [[arms embargo]] of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] (2011), and promote the following of international [[human rights]] law;<ref name=\"UNSMIL_July19_peaceplan\" />\n# a Libyan meeting similar to the originally planned [[Libyan National Conference]];<ref name=\"UNSMIL_July19_peaceplan\" /> which should include three tracks:<ref name=\"UNSMIL_economic_track\" />\n#* an economic track,<ref name=\"UNSMIL_economic_track\" /> which started on 6 January 2020 among 19 diverse Libyan economic experts meeting in [[Tunis]],<ref name=\"UNSMIL_economic_track\" /> and continued with a 9\u201310 February Cairo meeting which defined the [[terms of reference]] to create a [[Libyan Expert Economic Commission]];<ref name=\"UNSMIL_ecotrack_roundtwo\" />\n#* a military track,<ref name=\"UNSMIL_economic_track\" /> which the ''5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission'' started during 3\u20138 February 2020 in Geneva,<ref name=\"UNSMIL_miltrack_roundone\" /> and continued 18\u201323 February in Geneva leading to a draft ceasefire agreement;<ref name=\"UNSMIL_2nd_round_mil_summary\"/> and\n#* a political track<ref name=\"UNSMIL_economic_track\" /> for negotiation by 13 [[House of Representatives (Libya)|HoR]] members from the Tobruk and Tripoli based groups, 13 [[High Council of State (Libya)|HCS]] members and 14 independents,<ref name=\"LibHerald_Tobruk_wants_13\" /> which started with 20 out of the 40 participants on 26 February in Geneva.<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" />\n\n==Ceasefires==\nThe first point of the [[#Salam\u00e9 three-point peace plan|Salam\u00e9 three-point peace plan]] is a ceasefire.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_July19_peaceplan\" />\n\n===Eid al-Adha truce===\nA [[ceasefire|truce]] took place on Eid al-Adha in mid-August 2019. Salam\u00e9 described it as a \"substantial reduction in violence along the main fronts in southern Tripoli and elsewhere\" with \"some violations\" and that \"broadly speaking, the truce held for the duration of the Eid festivities.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_Salame_190904\" /> Salam\u00e9 stated to the UNSC that UNSMIL was working on encouraging confidence-building measures and a longer term ceasefire.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_Salame_190904\" />\n\n===12 January 2020 ceasefire===\nIn early January 2020, Turkish and Russian leaders proposed a Libyan ceasefire starting on 12 January. Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] contacted [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) and Egpytian leaders to pressure Haftar into accepting a ceasefire from the side of the LNA.<ref name=\"LibObs_Putin_EgUAE\" /> An LNA spokesperson stated on 12 January that the LNA would implement the ceasefire. ''[[The Libya Observer]]'' interpreted the LNA's decision to be a result of Russian pressure.<ref name=\"LibObs_Haftar_ceasefire\" /> Both sides claimed to have implemented the ceasefire, and that the other side had violated it.<ref name=\"DW_first3hours_shaky_ceasefire\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Turkish Defence Minister [[Hulusi Akar]] stated that although Haftar had not signed a ceasefire deal in Moscow that Serraj had signed, it was \"too early\" to judge if the ceasefire had failed.<ref name=\"ThomReut_ceasefireOK_TR\" /> ''[[Libya Herald]]'' reported a \"relative calm\" with \"some ceasefire violations\" each day since 12 January.<ref name=\"LibHerald_relative_calm\" /> On 16 January, German representatives stated that Haftar was committed to the ceasefire.<ref name=\"ThomReut_ceasefireOK_DE\" />\n\nOn 30 January, UNSMIL had documented 110 violations of the 12 January ceasefire.<ref name=\"LibObs_UNSC_violations_ceasefire\" />\n\n==Berlin conference==\nThe second point of the [[#Salam\u00e9 three-point peace plan|Salam\u00e9 three-point peace plan]] is to stop the arms flow into Libya, with an international conference to pressure countries implicated in the conflict to stop fuelling it.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_July19_peaceplan\" />\n\n===Preparations===\nOn 4 September 2019, Salam\u00e9 stated to the UNSC that he had visited several countries in the region with the aim of organising an international conference that would fulfil the second element of his peace plan. He stressed that a central theme of the meeting would be respect for the [[arms embargo]], a commitment to non-interference in Libya, and a commitment to supporting Libyans' view of the conflict and Libyans' preferences for a political solution to the conflict. Salam\u00e9 argued that \"the idea that war should be given a chance and that a military solution is at all possible is quite simply a chimera.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_Salame_190904\" /> In mid-September, a preparation meeting was held in [[Berlin]] between representatives of [[Germany]], the [[United States]] (US), [[France]], [[United Kingdom]] (UK), [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Egypt]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE),<ref name=\"LibObs_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> [[Turkey]],<ref name=\"AlMonitor_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> the [[Arab League]], the [[European Union]] (EU),<ref name=\"LibObs_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> and the [[African Union]] (AU).<ref name=\"AlMonitor_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> According to Michel Cousins (co-founder of [[Libya Herald]]), as of early October, the plan was that no Libyans would participate in the conference, and participation of Qatar, Algeria and Tunisia remained unclear. On 8 October, Salam\u00e9 stated that all countries concerned had to be invited \"without any exclusion\".<ref name=\"AWeekly_postponed\" />\n  \nThe third Senior Official Meeting in preparation for the Berlin meeting took place on 21 October.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_18Nov_biscuit_factory\" /> On 27 October, during a visit by the German Foreign Minister [[Heiko Maas]] to [[Zuwara]] to discuss preparations for the Berlin conference, Salam\u00e9 stated, \"The Berlin conference efforts are very serious and are backed by very significant stakeholders. There must be a committee that would be tasked with following up on the implementation of all understandings and this is something all previous conferences have lacked.\" The Libyan Foreign Minister, [[Mohamed Taha Siala]], said that there should be a ceasefire and a retreat of LNA forces before negotiations. Maas stated that the peace process should be conducted without foreign intervention.<ref name=\"LibObs_Berlin_preparations\" /> The fourth Senior Official Meeting was planned for 20 November.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_18Nov_biscuit_factory\" /> Concrete aims of the Berlin meeting included a formal communiqu\u00e9 of intended actions (prepared as a ''draft communiqu\u00e9'' during the Senior Official Meetings), an operational annex, and the creation of a committee to work with UNSMIL in implementing the aims of the communiqu\u00e9 and in \"[playing] a fundamental role in terms of ensuring respect for a ceasefire and better implementation of the arms embargo.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_18Nov_biscuit_factory\" />\n\nAt a fifth preparation meeting on 10 December 2019, two documents were \"to a very large extent ready\" to be proposed for signature by the political leaders expected to participate in the Berlin conference.<ref name=\"LibHerald_pol_track\" />\n\n===Final preparation phase===\nIn early January 2020, Italian, Turkish, Russian and German political leaders expressed support for the Berlin conference, and for [[Algeria]]'s participation in the conference in its role as a neighbouring country.<ref name=\"LibObs_Italy_TR_RU\" /><ref name=\"LibObs_GNA_Algeria\" /><ref name=\"LibObs_PutinMerkel\" /> German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] confirmed 19 January 2020 as the date for the Berlin conference, to include representatives of the US, Russia, UK, France, the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the UAE, Turkey, the [[Republic of Congo]], Italy, Egypt, Algeria, and of the UN, the EU, the AU and the Arab League.<ref name=\"Bloomberg_200119_Berlin_confirmed\" /> GNA head Serraj and LNA head Haftar were invited to the Berlin conference.<ref name=\"LibHerald_relative_calm\" />\n\n===Conference and Conclusions===\n[[File:Demonstration against Haftar in Berlin 2020-01-19 13.jpg|thumb|Anti-Haftar protest at the Berlin conference]]\nThe Berlin conference was held on 19 January 2020 as planned. Serraj and Haftar were both present in Berlin, but didn't participate directly in the main talks, as they refused to be in the same room as one another. They were kept informed of the discussions.<ref name=\"LibHerald_Berlinconf_analysis\" /> An anti-Haftar protest of 150 people was held in Berlin near the conference venue with posters including \"Haftar kills Libyan children\".<ref name=\"RBB_150antiHaftar_protests\" />\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo Attends the Libya Summit (49409010017).jpg|thumb|left|The Libya Summit in Berlin, Germany on 19 January 2020]]\n\nA six-page ''Conclusions'' document with 55 points covering the peace process was issued to represent the results of the conference.<ref name=\"LibHerald_Berlinconf_fulltext\" /> Point 5 of the document described the \"sole objective\" of the conference, termed the ''Berlin Process'', as \"assisting the United Nations in unifying the International Community in their support for a peaceful solution to the Libyan crisis\" and committing the countries and international bodies present at the conference to support the 3-point Salam\u00e9 peace plan. The document includes subsections on the components of the peace process:<ref name=\"LibHerald_Berlinconf_fulltext\" />\n\n* the \"ceasefire\";\n* the \"arms embargo\";\n* an intra-Libyan \"return to the political process\" including the Skhirat agreement as a \"viable framework\";\n* \"security sector reform\" for creating unified security, police and military forces under a single civilian authority \"building upon the Cairo talks\";\n* \"economic and financial reform\";\n* \"respect for international humanitarian law and human rights\";\n* \"follow-up\", including the creation of a military \"5+5\" committee and an \"International Follow-up Committee\" (IFC).\n\nPoint 51 of the ''Conclusions'' stated that Sarraj on behalf of the GNA and Haftar on behalf of the LNA had already nominated their respective representatives on the military 5+5 committee.<ref name=\"LibHerald_Berlinconf_fulltext\" />\n\nPoints 54, 55 and 56 defined the International Follow-up Committee to \"[consist] of all countries and International Organisations that participated in [the] Berlin Conference on Libya in order to maintain coordination ... under the aegis of the United Nations\". The IFC is required to meet monthly to track progress in the implementation of the ''Conclusions'', and to have four technical working groups to meet twice a month to \"address obstacles to implementation\" and to share information and coordinate.<ref name=\"LibHerald_Berlinconf_fulltext\" />\n\n===Arms embargo===\nOn 25 January, UNSMIL reported violations of the arms embargo, stating that during the previous ten days, \"numerous cargo and other flights [had] been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armoured vehicles, advisers and fighters.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_20200125_10days_violations\" />\n\n==Intra-Libyan preparations==\nThe third point of the [[#Salam\u00e9 three-point peace plan|Salam\u00e9 three-point peace plan]] is intra-Libyan negotiations without external interference<ref name=\"UNSMIL_July19_peaceplan\" /> along economic, military and political tracks in parallel.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_economic_track\" />\n\nIn support of internal Libyan conflict resolution infrastructure, UNSMIL held three mediation workshops for 97 Libyan men and 23 Libyan women, with the aim of creating a national network of mediators including \"tribal leaders, elders, representatives of civil society, youth and women activists, academics and businesspeople, who enjoy credibility and respect amongst their various constituencies.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_18Nov_biscuit_factory\" /> On 11 January, [[Stephanie Williams (diplomat)|Stephanie Williams]], deputy head of UNSMIL for political affairs, discussed with [[Khalid al-Mishri]], head of the [[High Council of State (Libya)|High Council of State]] (HCS), inviting the HCS to a late-January meeting between the HCS and the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] (HoR) in Geneva for the purposes of \"resuming dialogue\".<ref name=\"LibObs_HCS_HoR_lateJan_invite\" />\n\n===Economic track===\n====6 January====\nOn 6 January 2020, Ghassan Salam\u00e9 coordinated a meeting in [[Tunis]] among nineteen Libyan economic experts intended to represent the main Libyan financial and economic institutions and sectors and a wide range of political interests and geographical regions. Salam\u00e9 stated UNSMIL's aim of starting all three of the economic, military and political \"Libyan-led\" tracks of negotiations in January 2020.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_economic_track\" /> He stated that the 6 January meeting constituted the start of the economic track.<ref name=\"LibObs_3tracks_started\" />\n\n====9\u201310 February====\nThe economic/financial track was scheduled to continue in Cairo on 9 February.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_5p5_topics\" /> According to ''[[The Libya Observer]]'', groups called the ''Tripolitanian Society'' and the ''National Assembly for Seventeenth February Revolutionaries'' objected to hosting any intra-Libyan talks in Cairo because of Egypt's role in supporting the LNA.<ref name=\"LibObs_TripSoc_objects\" /><ref name=\"LibObs_17Feb_objects_econtrack\" /> The issue of \"fair distribution or redistribution of the State revenues\" in relation to the Libyan oil industry and the concerns of tribal chiefs who in late January blocked several Libyan oil terminals was set as a high priority issue for the 9 February meeting.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_miltrack_20200206\" />\n\nAt the 9\u201310 February Cairo meeting, the participants agreed on the [[terms of reference]] defining a [[Libyan Expert Economic Commission]] and its operations. The Commission aims to have three working groups for \"revenue management and distribution\", transparency, decentralisation, the Libyan banking crisis, and reconstruction and development. The following meeting of the economic/financial track was proposed for early March.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_ecotrack_roundtwo\" />\n\n===Military track===\nOn 7 January 2020, Salam\u00e9 expressed hope that negotiations on the military and security track would start within the following fortnight. These would cover a ceasefire, the arms embargo, [[disarmament, demobilization and reintegration]] (DDR), and \"terrorism and counterterrorism\".<ref name=\"LibHerald_pol_track\" />\n\nAt the 19 January Berlin conference, a military \"5+5 committee\" proposed by UNSMIL, with 5 members appointed each by Sarraj and Haftar, was defined in point 51 of the [[#Conference and Conclusions|''Conclusions'']] of the conference.<ref name=\"LibHerald_Berlinconf_fulltext\" /> The 10 members were named at the conference and were expected to start meeting the following week.<ref name=\"LibObs_Berlin_55committee\" /> Salam\u00e9 considers the 5+5 committee to be part of the military track. On 20 January, he described the main task of the committee as \"[working] on sending away foreign fighters from Libya as soon as possible\".<ref name=\"LibObs_3tracks_started\" />\n\n====JMC membership====\n{{As of|2020|02|25}}, the head of GNA's five members of the ''5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission'' (JMC) is [[Ahmed Abu Shahma]].<ref name=\"LibObs_5p5_GNA_head\" /> Ali Hamed al-Lamaoui, a political representative of a brigade of the [[Toubou people]] from the south of Libya, stated that {{as of|2020|02|22|lc=yes}}, the JMC excluded \"the Libyan majority from constructing solutions\", with four of the five GNA representatives being from [[Zintan]], [[Misrata]], [[Tripoli]] and [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]]. Al-Lamaoui was sceptical of the representativity of the GNA five and of the chances of the JMC coming to agreement.<ref name=\"ElWatan_Toubous_anti_Haftar\" />\n\n====3\u20138 February====\nThe 5+5 committee, formally named the ''5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission'', started meeting in Geneva on 3 February in talks facilitated by Salam\u00e9.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_military_track_20200203\" /> The committee consists of 5 senior military officers chosen by the GNA and 5 senior military officers chosen by Haftar. Topics of negotiation on 4 February included practical details of ceasefire monitoring, including the types of monitors, the roles of Libyan authorities and the UN and what \"kind of action should be taken in terms of heavy weaponry\". The priority was that the monitoring decisions should be taken by Libyans. An EU proposal to provide ceasefire monitors was scheduled to be considered later during the week.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_5p5_topics\" /> On 6 February, the tentative monitoring plan, accepted by both sides, was for the 5+5 committee to \"be involved\" in the ceasefire monitoring \"under the auspices of UNSMIL\"; ceasefire details remained under discussion. The two sides did not meet face-to-face.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_miltrack_20200206\" />\n\nThe result of the early February meeting from the two sides was consensus on several principles, including the defence of Libyan territory, Libyan independence from international interference, opposition to \"UN-identified terrorist groups (al-Qaeda, ISIS, Ansar al-Sharia)\", and support for an existing UNSMIL committee's role in exchanges of prisoners and the returns of mortal remains. The two sides agreed to continue negotiating to reach a \"comprehensive ceasefire agreement\". UNSMIL proposed 18 February for the following round ot talks.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_miltrack_roundone\" />\n\n====18\u201323 February====\nThe ''5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission'' started its second round of negotiations in Geneva on 18 February. Salam\u00e9 described the type of questions to be discussed to include, \"What kind of monitoring do you need? Who is going to do it on the ground? Are they going to be unarmed? What will happen to the other weapons? What will happen to non-regular fighters? What will happen to areas that are overbuilt, I mean very urbanized in the city of Tripoli, I mean who is going to be in charge of the police ...\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_Salame_miltrack2\" /> The GNA declared that it withdrew from the talks after the port of Tripoli was shelled by the LNA. The talks continued on 20 February<ref name=\"ThomReut_miltrack_continues\" /> and concluded on 23 February. The JMC participants agreed on a draft ceasefire declaration for civilians to return to their places of residence and defining a joint ceasefire monitoring mechanism to be managed by UNSMIL and the JMC, to be proposed to the GNA and LNA leaders. A third meeting was scheduled for March to finalise the [[terms of reference]] of sub-committees responible for implementing the agreement.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_2nd_round_mil_summary\" />\n\n===Political track===\nOn 7 January 2020, Salam\u00e9 stated his expectation that the political dialogue track would start by late January, possibly at the [[Palace of Nations]] in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"LibHerald_pol_track\" /> At the 19 January Berlin conference, the GNA and LNA agreed to participate in a Geneva meeting on the political track \"soon\".<ref name=\"NYT_Berlin_call_ceasefire\" />\n\nOn 20 January, Salam\u00e9 stated that the late-January meeting would include thirteen representatives of the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] (HoR) and thirteen of the [[High Council of State (Libya)|High Council of State]] (HCS); and \"independent persons\" including women and minority representatives. The political track negotiations would be open to \"all issues\", including the [[2017 draft Libyan constitution]], electoral laws and dates and \"maybe\" an agreement on holding elections in a nationally unified way.<ref name=\"LibObs_3tracks_started\" /> On 30 January, Salam\u00e9 stated that the GNA representatives agreed to participate in dialogue, and that there were \"deep divisions\" in the HoR \"hindering\" the HoR's choice of reprensentatives.<ref name=\"LibObs_UNSC_violations_ceasefire\" /> On 4 February, Salam\u00e9 stated that he expected the political track dialogue to start mid-February.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_5p5_topics\" /> On 4\u20135 February, the HCS and the Tripoli component of the HoR conditioned their representatives' participation in the Geneva political track meeting to \"the success of the military track\", to the strengthening of the ceasefire and to the return of the LNA to its positions prior 4 April 2019.<ref name=\"LibObs_HCS_youfirstnotme\" /><ref name=\"LibObs_TripHoR_youfirstnotme\" /> On 6 February, Salam\u00e9 stated that the political track was expected to be launched on 26 February in Geneva with 40 participants.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_miltrack_20200206\" />\n\nThe political track membership was later clarified to be defined as 13 HoR representatives, 13 HCS representatives and 14 \"independent\" persons selected by UNSMIL.<ref name=\"LibHerald_Tobruk_wants_13\" /> Independent participants included former Education Minister [[Othman Abdul Jalil]], [[Ministry of Interior (Libya)|Interior Minister]] [[Fathi Bashagha]], former head of the HCS [[Abdulrahman Sewehli]]<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> and [[Abdullah Othman (Libyan politician)|Abdullah Othman]].<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> ''[[Libya Herald]]'' described Othman as a \"former regime figure\" suspected of involvement with the [[Muslim Brotherhood#Libya]].<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" />\n\nThe HCS and the Tripoli-based branch of the HoR stated on 24 February that they would boycott the political track negotiations until the military track made significant progress.<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> The Tobruk-based branch of the HoR wished all of the 13 HoR representatives to be those from the Tobruk branch and objected to UNSMIL's acceptance of 5 HoR representatives selected by the Tripoli-based HoR group. The Tobruk group stated that it would boycott the political track meeting unless all of its 13 selected people were accepted as participants<ref name=\"LibHerald_Tobruk_wants_13\" /> and described the UNSMIL's refusal to accept the full 13 as \"intervention\" in decision-making.<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" />\n\n====26 February\u2013====\nThe political track was launched on 26 February in Geneva among 20 Libyan participants from the HoR, from both the Tobruk-based and Tripoli-based parts of the HoR, and from the independent persons' group.<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> The first day of the talks started with negotiations on the structure and agenda of the talks and with the creation of a drafting committee.

He stressed that a central theme of the meeting would be respect for the [[arms embargo]], a commitment to non-interference in Libya, and a commitment to supporting Libyans' view of the conflict and Libyans' preferences for a political solution to the conflict. Salam\u00e9 argued that \"the idea that war should be given a chance and that a military solution is at all possible is quite simply a chimera.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_Salame_190904\" /> In mid-September, a preparation meeting was held in [[Berlin]] between representatives of [[Germany]], the [[United States]] (US), [[France]], [[United Kingdom]] (UK), [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Egypt]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE),<ref name=\"LibObs_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> [[Turkey]],<ref name=\"AlMonitor_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> the [[Arab League]], the [[European Union]] (EU),<ref name=\"LibObs_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> and the [[African Union]] (AU).<ref name=\"AlMonitor_Berlin_preBerlin\" /> According to Michel Cousins (co-founder of [[Libya Herald]]), as of early October, the plan was that no Libyans would participate in the conference, and participation of Qatar, Algeria and Tunisia remained unclear.

There must be a committee that would be tasked with following up on the implementation of all understandings and this is something all previous conferences have lacked.\" The Libyan Foreign Minister, [[Mohamed Taha Siala]], said that there should be a ceasefire and a retreat of LNA forces before negotiations. Maas stated that the peace process should be conducted without foreign intervention.<ref name=\"LibObs_Berlin_preparations\" /> The fourth Senior Official Meeting was planned for 20 November.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_18Nov_biscuit_factory\" /> Concrete aims of the Berlin meeting included a formal communiqu\u00e9 of intended actions (prepared as a ''draft communiqu\u00e9'' during the Senior Official Meetings), an operational annex, and the creation of a committee to work with UNSMIL in implementing the aims of the communiqu\u00e9 and in \"[playing] a fundamental role in terms of ensuring respect for a ceasefire and better implementation of the arms embargo.\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_18Nov_biscuit_factory\" />\n\nAt a fifth preparation meeting on 10 December 2019, two documents were \"to a very large extent ready\" to be proposed for signature by the political leaders expected to participate in the Berlin conference.<ref name=\"LibHerald_pol_track\" />\n\n===Final preparation phase===\nIn early January 2020, Italian, Turkish, Russian and German political leaders expressed support for the Berlin conference, and for [[Algeria]]'s participation in the conference in its role as a neighbouring country.<ref name=\"LibObs_Italy_TR_RU\" /><ref name=\"LibObs_GNA_Algeria\" /><ref name=\"LibObs_PutinMerkel\" /> German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] confirmed 19 January 2020 as the date for the Berlin conference, to include representatives of the US, Russia, UK, France, the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the UAE, Turkey, the [[Republic of Congo]], Italy, Egypt, Algeria, and of the UN, the EU, the AU and the Arab League.<ref name=\"Bloomberg_200119_Berlin_confirmed\" /> GNA head Serraj and LNA head Haftar were invited to the Berlin conference.<ref name=\"LibHerald_relative_calm\" />\n\n===Conference and Conclusions===\n[[File:Demonstration against Haftar in Berlin 2020-01-19 13.jpg|thumb|Anti-Haftar protest at the Berlin conference]]\nThe Berlin conference was held on 19 January 2020 as planned.

Al-Lamaoui was sceptical of the representativity of the GNA five and of the chances of the JMC coming to agreement.<ref name=\"ElWatan_Toubous_anti_Haftar\" />\n\n====3\u20138 February====\nThe 5+5 committee, formally named the ''5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission'', started meeting in Geneva on 3 February in talks facilitated by Salam\u00e9.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_military_track_20200203\" /> The committee consists of 5 senior military officers chosen by the GNA and 5 senior military officers chosen by Haftar. Topics of negotiation on 4 February included practical details of ceasefire monitoring, including the types of monitors, the roles of Libyan authorities and the UN and what \"kind of action should be taken in terms of heavy weaponry\". The priority was that the monitoring decisions should be taken by Libyans. An EU proposal to provide ceasefire monitors was scheduled to be considered later during the week.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_5p5_topics\" /> On 6 February, the tentative monitoring plan, accepted by both sides, was for the 5+5 committee to \"be involved\" in the ceasefire monitoring \"under the auspices of UNSMIL\"; ceasefire details remained under discussion. The two sides did not meet face-to-face.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_miltrack_20200206\" />\n\nThe result of the early February meeting from the two sides was consensus on several principles, including the defence of Libyan territory, Libyan independence from international interference, opposition to \"UN-identified terrorist groups (al-Qaeda, ISIS, Ansar al-Sharia)\", and support for an existing UNSMIL committee's role in exchanges of prisoners and the returns of mortal remains.

What will happen to the other weapons? What will happen to non-regular fighters? What will happen to areas that are overbuilt, I mean very urbanized in the city of Tripoli, I mean who is going to be in charge of the police ...\"<ref name=\"UNSMIL_Salame_miltrack2\" /> The GNA declared that it withdrew from the talks after the port of Tripoli was shelled by the LNA. The talks continued on 20 February<ref name=\"ThomReut_miltrack_continues\" /> and concluded on 23 February. The JMC participants agreed on a draft ceasefire declaration for civilians to return to their places of residence and defining a joint ceasefire monitoring mechanism to be managed by UNSMIL and the JMC, to be proposed to the GNA and LNA leaders. A third meeting was scheduled for March to finalise the [[terms of reference]] of sub-committees responible for implementing the agreement.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_2nd_round_mil_summary\" />\n\n===Political track===\nOn 7 January 2020, Salam\u00e9 stated his expectation that the political dialogue track would start by late January, possibly at the [[Palace of Nations]] in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"LibHerald_pol_track\" /> At the 19 January Berlin conference, the GNA and LNA agreed to participate in a Geneva meeting on the political track \"soon\".<ref name=\"NYT_Berlin_call_ceasefire\" />\n\nOn 20 January, Salam\u00e9 stated that the late-January meeting would include thirteen representatives of the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] (HoR) and thirteen of the [[High Council of State (Libya)|High Council of State]] (HCS); and \"independent persons\" including women and minority representatives. The political track negotiations would be open to \"all issues\", including the [[2017 draft Libyan constitution]], electoral laws and dates and \"maybe\" an agreement on holding elections in a nationally unified way.<ref name=\"LibObs_3tracks_started\" /> On 30 January, Salam\u00e9 stated that the GNA representatives agreed to participate in dialogue, and that there were \"deep divisions\" in the HoR \"hindering\" the HoR's choice of reprensentatives.<ref name=\"LibObs_UNSC_violations_ceasefire\" /> On 4 February, Salam\u00e9 stated that he expected the political track dialogue to start mid-February.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_5p5_topics\" /> On 4\u20135 February, the HCS and the Tripoli component of the HoR conditioned their representatives' participation in the Geneva political track meeting to \"the success of the military track\", to the strengthening of the ceasefire and to the return of the LNA to its positions prior 4 April 2019.<ref name=\"LibObs_HCS_youfirstnotme\" /><ref name=\"LibObs_TripHoR_youfirstnotme\" /> On 6 February, Salam\u00e9 stated that the political track was expected to be launched on 26 February in Geneva with 40 participants.<ref name=\"UNSMIL_miltrack_20200206\" />\n\nThe political track membership was later clarified to be defined as 13 HoR representatives, 13 HCS representatives and 14 \"independent\" persons selected by UNSMIL.<ref name=\"LibHerald_Tobruk_wants_13\" /> Independent participants included former Education Minister [[Othman Abdul Jalil]], [[Ministry of Interior (Libya)|Interior Minister]] [[Fathi Bashagha]], former head of the HCS [[Abdulrahman Sewehli]]<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> and [[Abdullah Othman (Libyan politician)|Abdullah Othman]].<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> ''[[Libya Herald]]'' described Othman as a \"former regime figure\" suspected of involvement with the [[Muslim Brotherhood#Libya]].<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" />\n\nThe HCS and the Tripoli-based branch of the HoR stated on 24 February that they would boycott the political track negotiations until the military track made significant progress.<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> The Tobruk-based branch of the HoR wished all of the 13 HoR representatives to be those from the Tobruk branch and objected to UNSMIL's acceptance of 5 HoR representatives selected by the Tripoli-based HoR group. The Tobruk group stated that it would boycott the political track meeting unless all of its 13 selected people were accepted as participants<ref name=\"LibHerald_Tobruk_wants_13\" /> and described the UNSMIL's refusal to accept the full 13 as \"intervention\" in decision-making.<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" />\n\n====26 February\u2013====\nThe political track was launched on 26 February in Geneva among 20 Libyan participants from the HoR, from both the Tobruk-based and Tripoli-based parts of the HoR, and from the independent persons' group.<ref name=\"LibObs_pol_track_boycott\" /> The first day of the talks started with negotiations on the structure and agenda of the talks and with the creation of a drafting committee.
