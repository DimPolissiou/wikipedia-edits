{"title_page": "British Poetry Revival", "text_new": "{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}\n\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIf the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.\n\nThese poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> \n\nThese poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nA number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).\n\n==London==\n\nThanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of ''The English Intelligencer'', a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by [[Peter Riley]]. Contributors and recipients included Peter Armstrong, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, John Hall, John James, Tim Longville, Barry MacSweeney, J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Temple, Chris Torrance and Nick Wayte' <ref> Neil Pattison, Reitha Pattison, Luke Roberts (eds), ''Certain Prose of 'The English Intelligencer''' (Cambridge: Mountain Press, 2012)</ref>   \n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).\n\nThe anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.\n\nInto the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n*[[Black Mountain poets]]\n*[[Language poetry]]\n*[[movement (literature)|The Movement]]\n*[[Situationist International|Situationism]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20011110105655/http://www.netkonect.net/~athelstan/links.html List of related links]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130021251/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/english.html The English Intelligencer Archive]\n*[http://www.mordentower.org/ The Morden Tower]\n*[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-irish-poets.html Archives of the British and Irish poetry discussion list]\n*[http://www.jeff-nuttall.co.uk The Life and Works of Jeff Nuttall]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080225010840/http://www.fucine.com/network/fucinemute/core/print.php?url=archivio%2Ffm87%2Fhugill.htm&id=1374 Piers Hugill on British Poetry since 1977]\n\n{{Schools of poetry}}\n\n[[Category:Literary movements]]\n[[Category:British poetry]]\n[[Category:British literary movements]]\n[[Category:British Poetry Revival| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{ref improve|date=February 2014}}\n\"'''The British Poetry Revival'''\" is the general name given to a loose [[poetry]] [[Literary movement|movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The revival was a [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired reaction to [[The Movement (literature)|the Movement's]] more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Andrew Crozier]], [[Lee Harwood]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]] - and a younger generation: Paul Buck, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], Ulli Freer, [[Ken Edwards]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[Cris Cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]].<ref> Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), ''New British poetries: The scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). </ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIf the Movement poets looked to [[Thomas Hardy]] as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Charles Olson]]and British figures such as [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up.\n\nThese poets included [[Roy Fisher]], [[Gael Turnbull]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Jeff Nuttall]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Michael Horovitz]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Jim Burns (poet)|Jim Burns]], [[Elaine Feinstein]], [[Lee Harwood]], and [[Christopher Logue]]. Many of these poets joined [[Allen Ginsberg]] and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall [[International Poetry Incarnation]] on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British [[happening]]. Earlier British happenings included [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]]'s event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; [[Gustav Metzger]]'s 1964 auto-destructive art; [[Adrian Henri]]'s 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's Cavern Club; and [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s events in Better Books. They had their roots in [[Dada]] events at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)]] at the start of the century.<ref> Jeff Nuttall, ''Bomb Culture'' </ref> \n\nThese poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of [[William Carlos Williams]]' ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' to his native [[Birmingham]] in his long poem ''City''. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow [[Scottish literature|Scots]] Morgan and Finlay both worked with [[found poetry|found]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[visual poetry]]. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the [[Beat generation]] writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the [[Black Mountain poets]] while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nA number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's ''New Departures'', Stuart Montgomery's [[Fulcrum Press]], [[Tim Longville]]'s ''[[Grosseteste Review]]'', Galloping Dog Press and its ''[[Poetry Information]]'' magazine, Pig Press, [[Andrew Crozier]] and [[Peter Riley]]'s ''[[The English Intelligencer]]'', Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]]. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published ''avant-garde'' American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's ''[[Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain]]'' (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in ''the new british poetry'' (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, ''The Poetry of Saying'' (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, ''Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017).\n\n==London==\n\nThanks in no small part to Cobbing's [[Writers Forum]] and its associated writers' workshop, [[London]] was a hub for many young poets, including [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Paula Claire]], [[Allen Fisher]], [[Iain Sinclair]], Gilbert Adair, [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]], [[Ulli Freer]], Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, [[Elaine Randell]], [[Robert Sheppard]], [[Adrian Clarke (poet)|Adrian Clarke]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,<ref> Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), ''CLASP: late modernist poetry in London'' (Shearsman, 2016)</ref> and in Ken Edwards's memoir, ''Wild Metrics''.<ref> Ken Edwards, ''Wild Metrics'' (Grand Iota, 2019).</ref>\n\nGriffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and his years as a [[Hells Angel]]. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for [[William Blake]] and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's ''Suicide Bridge'' and ''Lud Heat'' and Fisher's ''Place'' sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British [[list of women poets|women poets]] to combine [[feminist]] concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), ''Bill Griffiths'' (Salt, 2007).\n\nGriffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle.\n\nEric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the [[Beat generation]] writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, [[Sean Bonney]], Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, [[Ken Edwards]], Bill Griffiths, [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Jeff Hilson]], Will Rowe, and [[Lawrence Upton]].\n\n==Northumbria and Northern England==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nBy the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published ''[[Briggflatts]]'', which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.<ref>Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', ''Basil Bunting: Man and Poet'' (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1.</ref>   A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, [[Connie Pickard|Connie]] and [[Tom Pickard]] started a reading series and bookshop in the [[Morden Tower Book Room]].<ref>Geraldine Monk (ed.), ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). </ref> The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, [[Robert Creeley]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and [[Gregory Corso]] all read there. They were soon joined by [[Richard Caddel]], brought up in [[Kent]] but an honorary Northumbrian, [[Barry MacSweeney]] and [[Colin Simms]]. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, [[Tony Baker (poet)|Tony Baker]], and [[Tom Pickard]] in Geraldine Monk (ed.) ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nThrough Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the [[Objectivist poets]]. Specifically, [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]] were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on [[George Oppen]].<ref>John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \"Songs of Experience\"' in John Freeman (ed.) ''Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25</ref> Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text.\n\nAt [[Easter]], 1967 MacSweeney organised the [[Sparty Lea]] Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[John Temple (poet)|John Temple]], [[Pete Armstrong]], [[Tim Longville]], Peter Riley, [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]], [[J. H. Prynne]] and [[Nick Waite]], stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.<ref>Luke Roberts, ''Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6.</ref> This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work.\n\nAlthough published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, [[Geraldine Monk]] is very much a poet of the North of England. Like [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including [[Jim Burns]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Glenda George]], and [[John Seed]], ''CUSP'', mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.<ref> Geraldine Monk, ''CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition'' (Shearsman, 2012).</ref>\n\n==Cambridge==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nThe Cambridge poets were a group centred around [[J. H. Prynne]] and included [[Andrew Crozier]], [[John James (poet)|John James]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Veronica Forrest-Thomson]], [[Peter Riley]], Tim Longville and [[John Riley (poet)|John Riley]]. Prynne was influenced by [[Charles Olson]] and Crozier was partly responsible for [[Carl Rakosi]]'s return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The ''Grosseteste Review'', which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of ''The English Intelligencer'', a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by [[Peter Riley]]. Contributors and recipents included Peter Armstrong, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, John Hall, John James, Tim Longville, Barry MacSweeney, J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Temple, Chris Torrance and Nick Wayte' <ref> Neil Pattison, Reitha Pattison, Luke Roberts (eds), ''Certain Prose of 'The English Intelligencer''' (Cambridge: Mountain Press, 2012)</ref>   \n\nThe Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] or at [[Anglia Polytechnic University|Anglia Polytechnic]]. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets.\n\n==Wales and Scotland==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\nIn the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, ''second aeon''.  He began Oriel Books in [[Cardiff]] in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh]] poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were [[John Freeman (poet)|John Freeman]] and [[Chris Torrance]]. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both [[George Oppen]] and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited ''Not Comforts / but Visions'', essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, [[Jeremy Hooker]], Freeman, Hampson and others.<ref>John Freeman (ed.), ''Not Comforts  / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen'' (Interim Press, 1985).</ref> Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing ''Magic Door'' sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012).\n\nIn Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]] emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the [[Third Eye Centre]] in Glasgow (later renamed the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]]). Magazines such as ''Scottish International'', \"Chapman\", and Duncan Glen's magazine ''Akros'' maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts.\n\nIn the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean.\n\n==\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\"==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Towards Design In Poetry.jpg|thumb|Eric Mottram's ''Towards design in poetry'' (writers forum, 1977)]] -->\n\nIn 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund [[Poetry Society]] and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine ''Poetry Review''. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them.\n\nNuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the [[Association of Little Presses]] (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in ''Poetry Review'', Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \"a treacherous assault on British poetry\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, ''the new british poetry''. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.<ref>For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007).</ref>\n\n==The 1980s and after==\n\nA number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in ''Poetry Review'' under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]], [[Ulli Freer]], [[cris cheek]], [[Lawrence Upton]], [[Robert Gavin Hampson]], [[Robert Sheppard]], and [[Ken Edwards]] were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Paul Buck]], [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], [[D. S. Marriott]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]] and [[Denise Riley]]. Edwards ran ''Reality Studios'', a magazine that grew out of [[Alembic (UK poetry magazine)]], the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets]] to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based [[Wendy Mulford]], which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based [[Angel Exhaust]] magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, [[Robert Sheppard]] and [[Andrew_Duncan_(poet)|Andrew Duncan]]. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's ''Figs'' magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets.\n\nIn 1988 an anthology called ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology ''A Various Art'', which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), ''The New British poetries: the scope of the possible'' (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 [[W. N. Herbert]] and [[Richard Price]] co-edited the anthology of Scottish [[Informationist poetry]] ''Contraflow on the SuperHighway'' (Gairfish and Southfields Press).\n\nThe anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets [[David Gascoyne]], selected by Jeremy Reed; [[W. S. Graham]], selected by Tony Lopez; [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], selected by [[Drew Milne]]; [[J.F. Hendry]], selected by Andrew Crozier and [[Nicholas Moore]], selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continues to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of ''Talisman'' (1996).<ref>''Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics'' 16 (1996): 110-173.</ref> With [[Peter Quartermain]] Caddel also edited ''[[Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970]]'' (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century.\n\nInto the 1990s and beyond poets such as [[Johan de Wit (poet)]], [[Sean Bonney]], [[Jeff Hilson]], and [[Piers Hugill]] have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led [[Writers Forum]] workshop.  An interesting sub-development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of [[Martin Gubbins (poet)|Martin Gubbins]], [[Andreas Aandwandter]], and [[Martin Bakero]], to name but few. Those associated with the [[Barque Press]] (most obviously [[Andrea Brady]] and [[Keston Sutherland]]), and more recently [[Bad Press]] (in particular, [[Marianne Morris]] and [[Jow Lindsay]]), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. [[Perdika Press]] in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of [[Bill Berkson]]. From Scotland, [[Peter Manson]], who had co-edited the magazine ''Object Permanence'' in the mid-1990s, [[Drew Milne]], editor of ''Parataxis'', [[David Kinloch]] and [[Richard Price]] (previously editors of ''Verse'' and ''Southfields'') also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of [[cris cheek]], [[Bridgid Mcleer]], and [[Alaric Sumner]], under the direction of [[Caroline Bergvall]] and [[John Hall (British Poetry Revival)|John Hall]] through the [[Performance Writing]] programme at [[Dartington College of Arts]] including [[Kirsten Lavers]], [[Andy Smith (poet)|Andy Smith]], and Chris Paul; from the involvement of [[Redell Olsen]] in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, [[Sophie Robinson]], John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through [[Keith Jebb]] at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including [[Alyson Torns]] and [[Allison Boast]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1960s}}\n*[[Black Mountain poets]]\n*[[Language poetry]]\n*[[movement (literature)|The Movement]]\n*[[Situationist International|Situationism]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20011110105655/http://www.netkonect.net/~athelstan/links.html List of related links]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130021251/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/english.html The English Intelligencer Archive]\n*[http://www.mordentower.org/ The Morden Tower]\n*[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/british-irish-poets.html Archives of the British and Irish poetry discussion list]\n*[http://www.jeff-nuttall.co.uk The Life and Works of Jeff Nuttall]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080225010840/http://www.fucine.com/network/fucinemute/core/print.php?url=archivio%2Ffm87%2Fhugill.htm&id=1374 Piers Hugill on British Poetry since 1977]\n\n{{Schools of poetry}}\n\n[[Category:Literary movements]]\n[[Category:British poetry]]\n[[Category:British literary movements]]\n[[Category:British Poetry Revival| ]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Poetry_Revival"}

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures. She replied she also did not care for such matters, whereupon he revealed that he was her future husband.{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=111}} Both versions relate that the two agreed to marry and to live celibately, to the chagrin of Pippali's parents.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=111}}\n\nPippali is depicted in the P\u0101li version as very wealthy, using much perfume and possessing much land and chariots.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} Later, in the P\u0101li version, Pippali and Bhadra saw animals eating each other on the fertile fields as they were plowed by their workers.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general.

However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa appears very prominent, whereas \u0100nanda is humbled and given far less credit.

These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Findly |1992 |pages=253}}. For Bareau, see {{harvtxt |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}}}} e.g. the P\u0101li and [[Mahisasaka|Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] textual traditions portray a Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa that is more critical of \u0100nanda than that the [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition depicts him,{{sfn |Findly |1992 |page=254}}{{sfn |Tsukamoto |1963 |p=821}} reflecting a preference for discipline on the part of the former traditions, and a preference for discourse for the latter.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |page=254}} Analyzing six [[recension]]s of different textual traditions of the ''[[Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta]]'' extensively, Bareau distinguished two layers in the text, an older and a newer one, the former, fifth century BCE, belonging to the compilers that emphasized discourse, the latter, mostly fourth and third century BCE, to the ones that emphasized discipline; the former emphasizing the figure of \u0100nanda, the latter Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Bareau |1979 |page=70}} Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Migot]] (1892\u20131967) argued, too, that the oldest texts (fifth century BCE) mostly glorify \u0100nanda as being the most [[bahu\u015bruta|well-learned]] ({{lang-sa|bahu\u015bruta|italic=yes}}, {{lang-pi|bahussutta|italic=yes}}); a second series of newer texts (fourth century-early third century BCE) glorify Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as being eminent in [[\u015b\u012bla|discipline]] ({{lang-sa|\u015b\u012bla|italic=yes}}, {{lang-pi|s\u012bla|italic=yes}}); and the newest texts (mid third century BCE) glorify \u015a\u0101riputra as being the [[pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101|wisest]] ({{lang-sa|praj\u00f1\u0101|italic=yes}}, {{lang-pi|pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101|italic=yes}}). Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family.

Harvey states that the story originated among the \"Chan literati\".}} Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \"outside the teaching\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.{{sfn |Welter |2000 |p=97}}\n\nThe Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism.<ref name=\"Herschock\" /> Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=fozu}} Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch \u0100nanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs.<!--339--> Some Chan masters, such as [[D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and eventually Maitreya.<!--340-->{{sfn |Faure |1995 |pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nAs Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation.{{sfn |Faure |1995 |p=361, note 119}} Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.{{sfn |Do-Ryun |1964 |p=41}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Values ===\n[[File:Mahakasyapa, Kizil, Cave above the Largest Cave, c. 422-529 AD, wall painting - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01724.JPG|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa depicted with hair and beard.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers.

In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]], which is another collection than the ''Sa\u1e43yutta''.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

It consists of at least 60 properties centred on Nuper's and Lyng's Farm, in particular the neighbourhood and linear development of '''Tysea Hill'''. On the Tysea Hill ridge is Stapleford Abbotts Golf Course, which is across an almost straight north-south divide in the [[Borough of Brentwood]].<ref name=os/> Six other farms adjoin the main road here, using a hilly [[terrain]]. Curtismill Green itself is in the parish, along with a few cottages, including the grade II listed Honeysuckle Cottage.<ref>Honeysuckle Cottage \u2014 Grade II listing{{NHLE|num=1165956|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> However, most of the hamlet is in [[Navestock]].\n\n==Transport==\nBuses are limited in the area, served by the single Route 375.

The piece consists of nine geometric [[rhomboid]] units, bolted and welded together and painted blue.\n\nTony Smith's career encompassed architecture, painting, and sculpture. The [[General Services Administration]] commissioned the 21-foot-high steel construction that is painted blue in 1974 for its Art in Public Places program. Smith said that he was willing to forgo the standard honorarium for the sculpture. \"I felt very honored to do something in the national capital...As far as I was concerned, I would be perfectly willing to supply it at cost\u2026.it\u2019s right near the Capitol, and it\u2019s a very nice place to be.\"<ref name=Thalacker>{{cite book|title=The Place of Art in the World of Architecture|year=1980|publisher=Chelsea House Publications|isbn=0877540985|page=184|editor=Donald W.

In the south, a road border crossing leads to the neighbouring Austrian municipality of [[Drasenhofen]]. The highway is part of the [[European route E461]] and is to be extended as the [[R52 expressway (Czech Republic)|R52 expressway]].\n\nMikulov is situated between the Pavlovsk\u00e9 vrchy hilly area and the edge of the [[Mikulov Highlands]], stretching up to the [[Thaya]] river and the three [[Nov\u00e9 Ml\u00fdny reservoirs]]. The [[P\u00e1lava Protected Landscape Area]] begins in Mikulov, and so does the [[Moravian Karst]].\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] was established, the settlement of ''Nikulsburch'' was first mentioned in a 1249 deed, issued by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] margrave [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] who granted it, including a castle, and the surrounding area to the [[Duchy of Austria|Austrian]] noble Henry I of [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]]. In 1262 the possession was confirmed by Ottokar, [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Bohemian king]] since 1253. After King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] had defeated Ottokar at the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]], he then vested Henry II of Liechtenstein with [[market rights]] ''in villa Nicolspurch''. [[German Bohemians|German]] citizens were called in and lived there until their [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expulsion]] in 1945 according to the [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\n===Bohemian Crown===\nIn 1526, the [[Anabaptists|Anabaptist]] leader [[Balthasar Hubmaier]] came from [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] to Nikolsburg, where he was captured and arrested by the forces of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] king [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in the following year. The town remained in the Liechtenstein family until 1560, and in 1572 Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] granted the fief to his ambassador to the Spanish court Adam von [[Dietrichstein]]. From 1575 until the 20th century, Nikolsburg remained the proprietary possession of the Dietrichstein noble family and its [[Mensdorff-Pouilly]] successors.\n\nIn 1621, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Cardinal [[Franz von Dietrichstein]] signed the [[Peace of Nikolsburg|Treaty of Nikolsburg]] with the Transylvanian prince [[Gabriel Bethlen]] at [[Mikulov Castle]]. Four years later, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and his [[Aulic titulature|aulic]] council met at the castle, where General [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] received his commission and was elevated to a [[Duchy of Friedland|Duke of Friedland]]. Franz von Dietrichstein also established the first [[Piarists|Piarist]] college north of the Alps in Nikolsburg.\n\nAfter a fire damaged the original Nikolsburg Castle in 1719, the Dietrichstein family reconstructed the ch\u00e2teau to its present appearance. After the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Count [[Alajos K\u00e1rolyi]] began work on a peace treaty in Nikolsburg that led to the [[Treaty of Prague (1866)|Treaty of Prague]] in 1866.\n\n===Jewish Mikulov===\n:{{See also|Familianten}}\n[[File:V09p305001 Nikolsburg.jpg|260px|thumb|Jewish quarter (1900s)]]\n\nThe beginning of the Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg dates as far as 1421, when Jews were expelled from [[Vienna]] and the neighboring province of [[Lower Austria]] by the duke of Austria, [[Albert II of Germany]]. The refugees settled in the town situated close to the Austrian border, some {{convert|85|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Austria]]n capital, under the protection of the princes of Liechtenstein, and additional settlers were brought after the expulsions of the Jews from the Moravian royal boroughs by the king [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] after 1454.<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\">Nezhodov\u00e1, So\u0148a.

The famous rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (1525 &ndash; 1609), who is said to have created the [[golem]] of [[Prague]], officiated here for twenty years as the second regional rabbi between 1553 and 1573.<ref>[http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/travel/in-the-czech-republic-moravia-and-its-castles.html?pagewanted=all Moravia and its castles]</ref> Cardinal [[Franz von Dietrichstein]], son of Adam von Dietrichstein, was a special protector of the Jews, whose taxes were necessary to finance the Thirty Years' War.<ref name=\"Jewish Encycl\">Jewish Encyclopedia, ''\"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=N&artid=292 Jewish Nikolsburg]\"'', Retrieved 2011-01-30</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, the congregation in Nikolsburg totalled over 600 families, being the largest Jewish settlement in [[Moravia]]. The census of 1754 decreed by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] ascertained that there were some 620 families established in Nikolsburg, i.e. the Jewish population of about 3,000 comprised half of the town's inhabitants.<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\"/> Only a small number of Jews could make their living in the town as artisans; the rest had to become merchants. The congregation suffered severely during the [[Silesian wars]] (1740&ndash;1742, 1744&ndash;1745 and 1756&ndash;1763), when they had to furnish the monarchy with their share in the supertaxes exacted by the government of Maria Theresa from the Jews of Moravia.<ref name=\"Jewish Encycl\"/>\n\nQuite a number of Nikolsburg Jews continued to earn their livelihood in Vienna, where they were permitted to stay for some time on special passports. The freedom of residence, which was conceded to the Jews in Austria in 1848, reduced the number of resident Jews in Nikolsburg to less than one-third of the population which it contained at the time of its highest development. In 1904, there were 749 Jewish residents in the city, out of a total population of 8,192.<ref name=\"Jewish Encycl\"/> In 1938, prior to the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the city population totaled about 8,000 mostly German-speaking inhabitants. Out of these, 472 were Jewish at this time.<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\"/> The Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg ceased to exist during World War II, as only 110 managed to emigrate in time, and 327 of Mikulov's Jews did not survive the [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]].<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\"/> On April 15th, 1945 21 Hungarian Jewish prisoners working in a clay pit were massacred.<ref>http://www.mikulov.cz/tourism/monuments-and-sights/monuments-of-jewish-community/jewish-cemetery/more-information/</ref>\n\nFollowing World War II, the town's German population was brutally expelled in 1945-46 by the Czechoslovak government.

In the south, a road border crossing leads to the neighbouring Austrian municipality of [[Drasenhofen]]. The highway is part of the [[European route E461]] and is to be extended as the [[R52 expressway (Czech Republic)|R52 expressway]].\n\nMikulov is situated between the Pavlovsk\u00e9 vrchy hilly area and the edge of the [[Mikulov Highlands]], stretching up to the [[Thaya]] river and the three [[Nov\u00e9 Ml\u00fdny reservoirs]]. The [[P\u00e1lava Protected Landscape Area]] begins in Mikulov, and so does the [[Moravian Karst]].\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] was established, the settlement of ''Nikulsburch'' was first mentioned in a 1249 deed, issued by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] margrave [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] who granted it, including a castle, and the surrounding area to the [[Duchy of Austria|Austrian]] noble Henry I of [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]]. In 1262 the possession was confirmed by Ottokar, [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Bohemian king]] since 1253. After King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] had defeated Ottokar at the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]], he then vested Henry II of Liechtenstein with [[market rights]] ''in villa Nicolspurch''. [[German Bohemians|German]] citizens were called in and lived there until their [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expulsion]] in 1945 according to the [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\n===Bohemian Crown===\nIn 1526, the [[Anabaptists|Anabaptist]] leader [[Balthasar Hubmaier]] came from [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] to Nikolsburg, where he was captured and arrested by the forces of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] king [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in the following year. The town remained in the Liechtenstein family until 1560, and in 1572 Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] granted the fief to his ambassador to the Spanish court Adam von [[Dietrichstein]]. From 1575 until the 20th century, Nikolsburg remained the proprietary possession of the Dietrichstein noble family and its [[Mensdorff-Pouilly]] successors.\n\nIn 1621, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Cardinal [[Franz von Dietrichstein]] signed the [[Peace of Nikolsburg|Treaty of Nikolsburg]] with the Transylvanian prince [[Gabriel Bethlen]] at [[Mikulov Castle]]. Four years later, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and his [[Aulic titulature|aulic]] council met at the castle, where General [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] received his commission and was elevated to a [[Duchy of Friedland|Duke of Friedland]]. Franz von Dietrichstein also established the first [[Piarists|Piarist]] college north of the Alps in Nikolsburg.\n\nAfter a fire damaged the original Nikolsburg Castle in 1719, the Dietrichstein family reconstructed the ch\u00e2teau to its present appearance. After the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Count [[Alajos K\u00e1rolyi]] began work on a peace treaty in Nikolsburg that led to the [[Treaty of Prague (1866)|Treaty of Prague]] in 1866.\n\n===Jewish Mikulov===\n:{{See also|Familianten}}\n[[File:V09p305001 Nikolsburg.jpg|260px|thumb|Jewish quarter (1900s)]]\n\nThe beginning of the Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg dates as far as 1421, when Jews were expelled from [[Vienna]] and the neighboring province of [[Lower Austria]] by the duke of Austria, [[Albert II of Germany]]. The refugees settled in the town situated close to the Austrian border, some {{convert|85|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Austria]]n capital, under the protection of the princes of Liechtenstein, and additional settlers were brought after the expulsions of the Jews from the Moravian royal boroughs by the king [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] after 1454.<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\">Nezhodov\u00e1, So\u0148a.

The famous rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (1525 &ndash; 1609), who is said to have created the [[golem]] of [[Prague]], officiated here for twenty years as the second regional rabbi between 1553 and 1573.<ref>[http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/travel/in-the-czech-republic-moravia-and-its-castles.html?pagewanted=all Moravia and its castles]</ref> Cardinal [[Franz von Dietrichstein]], son of Adam von Dietrichstein, was a special protector of the Jews, whose taxes were necessary to finance the Thirty Years' War.<ref name=\"Jewish Encycl\">Jewish Encyclopedia, ''\"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=N&artid=292 Jewish Nikolsburg]\"'', Retrieved 2011-01-30</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, the congregation in Nikolsburg totalled over 600 families, being the largest Jewish settlement in [[Moravia]]. The census of 1754 decreed by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] ascertained that there were some 620 families established in Nikolsburg, i.e. the Jewish population of about 3,000 comprised half of the town's inhabitants.<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\"/> Only a small number of Jews could make their living in the town as artisans; the rest had to become merchants. The congregation suffered severely during the [[Silesian wars]] (1740&ndash;1742, 1744&ndash;1745 and 1756&ndash;1763), when they had to furnish the monarchy with their share in the supertaxes exacted by the government of Maria Theresa from the Jews of Moravia.<ref name=\"Jewish Encycl\"/>\n\nQuite a number of Nikolsburg Jews continued to earn their livelihood in Vienna, where they were permitted to stay for some time on special passports. The freedom of residence, which was conceded to the Jews in Austria in 1848, reduced the number of resident Jews in Nikolsburg to less than one-third of the population which it contained at the time of its highest development. In 1904, there were 749 Jewish residents in the city, out of a total population of 8,192.<ref name=\"Jewish Encycl\"/> In 1938, prior to the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the city population totaled about 8,000 mostly German-speaking inhabitants. Out of these, 472 were Jewish at this time.<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\"/> The Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg ceased to exist during World War II, as only 110 managed to emigrate in time, and 327 of Mikulov's Jews did not survive the [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]].<ref name=\"Nezhodov\u00e1423\"/>\n\nFollowing World War II, the town's German population was brutally expelled in 1945-46 by the Czechoslovak government. In 1948, Mikulov's population was around 5,200.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Mikulov 4826.jpg|260px|thumb|St. Sebastian Chapel on the Holy Hill (''Svat\u00fd Kope\u010dek'')]]\n[[File:Mikulov-Nicolsburg city seal.jpg|thumb|260px|upright|Mikulov (Nicolsburg) official seal, 1810]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" <hiddentext>generated with [[:de:Wikipedia:Helferlein/VBA-Macro for EXCEL tableconversion]] V1.7<\\hiddentext>\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"64\" height=\"14\"|Census year\n|width=\"60\" rowspan=\"2\"|Population\n|width=\"260\" colspan=\"3\"|Ethnicity of inhabitants\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"14\"|year\n|German\n|Czechs\n|other\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1793\n|7440\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1836\n|8421\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1869\n|7173\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1880\n|7642\n|7447\n|144\n|61\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1890\n|8210\n|8057\n|79\n|74\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1900\n|8092\n|7843\n|170\n|79\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1910\n|8043\n|7787\n|189\n|67\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1921\n|7699\n|6359\n|626\n|485\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"13\"|1930\n|7790\n|6409\n|898\n|483\n|- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|height=\"14\"|1939\n|7886\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}<ref>Historick\u00fd m\u00edstopis Moravy a Slezska v letech 1848\u20131960, sv.9. 1984</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nMikulov is a centre of [[Czech wine|Czech wine-making]] due to its favorable geographic location and climate, as well as its unique history.

It was recorded live at Detroit's [[Grande Ballroom]] over two nights, [[Devil's Night]] and [[Halloween]], 1968. \n\nThe LP peaked at No. 30 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, with the [[Kick Out the Jams (song)|title track]] peaking at No. 82 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].

Vocalist [[Rob Tyner]] shouted, \"And right now... right now... right now it's time to... kick out the jams, motherfuckers!\" before the opening riffs. [[Elektra Records]] executives were offended by the line and had preferred to edit it out of the album (replacing the offending words with \"brothers and sisters\"), while the band and manager [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] adamantly opposed this.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe original release had \"kick out the jams, Motherfuckers!\" printed on the inside album cover, but was soon pulled from stores. Two versions were then released, both with censored album covers, with the uncensored audio version sold behind record counters.\n\nMaking matters worse, [[Hudson's]] department stores refused to carry the album. Tensions between the band and the Hudson's chain escalated to the point that the department stores refused to carry any album from the Elektra label after MC5 took out a full-page ad that, according to [[Danny Fields]], \"was just a picture of Rob Tyner, and all it said was 'Fuck Hudson's.' And it had the Elektra logo\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=McNeil |first1=Legs |authorlink=Legs McNeil |last2=McCain |first2=Gillian |title=Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1996 |page=62}}</ref> To end the conflict and to avoid further financial loss, Elektra dropped MC5 from their record label.\n\nLater the same year, [[Jefferson Airplane]] recorded the song \"We Can Be Together\" for their ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'' album, a song containing the word \"motherfucker\". Unlike Elektra, RCA Records released the album wholly uncensored.\n\n==Title meaning==\n\n\"Kick out the jams\" has also been taken to be a slogan of the 1960s ethos of revolution and liberation, an incitement to \"kick out\" restrictions in various forms.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} To quote MC5 guitarist [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] from his interview with Caroline Boucher in ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc & Music Echo]]'' magazine on August 8, 1970:\n\n<blockquote>People said \"oh wow, 'kick out the jams' means break down restrictions\" etc., and it made good copy, but when we wrote it we didn't have that in mind. We first used the phrase when we were the house band at a ballroom in Detroit, and we played there every week with another band from the area. [...] We got in the habit, being the sort of punks we are, of screaming at them to get off the stage, to kick out the jams, meaning stop jamming. We were saying it all the time and it became a sort of esoteric phrase. Now, I think people can get what they like out of it; that's one of the good things about rock and roll.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Caroline |last=Boucher |date=August 8, 1970 |title=MC5 Problem |journal=[[Disc (magazine)|Disc & Music Echo]] |url=http://makemyday.free.fr/discandme.htm |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKramer also claimed during a 1999 interview that was excerpted for ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'' magazine that the phrase was specifically aimed toward British 1960s bands playing at the Grande who MC5 felt were not putting enough energy into their performances.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The title has also (jokingly) been reinterpreted as an establishment message masquerading as a revolutionary anthem.

[[Allmusic]] called it \"one of the most powerfully energetic live albums ever made\" in their retrospective review.<ref name=Allmusic/> ''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewer Adam Williams wrote, \"For my money, 'Kick Out the Jams' is one of the greatest records ever pressed. It is a magnificent time portal into the past, a fleeting glimpse of a band that actually had the balls to walk it like they talked it\" and that \"no live recording has captured the primal elements of rock more than the MC5's inaugural effort.\"<ref name=PopMatters/>. Bangs himself would change his mind about the album, writing in a footnote in his [[The Troggs|Troggs]] essay \u201cJames Taylor Marked for Death\u201d: \u201cIncidentally, I\u2019m not trying to run down the Five, or write them off as some Troggs trifle. When I reviewed their first album in ''Rolling Stone'', I finished by mentioning \u201cThe Troggs, who appeared with a similar sex-and-violence thing a couple of years back, and promptly sank into oblivion, where I imagine they are laughing at the MC5,\u201d and that of course is as snottily unkind to the Troggs as to the Five. But then, it was the first review I ever had published, and even if more death threats came in after that review than any other save Jann Wenner's ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' massacre (and most of them from sweet home Detroit), I can see why people privileged enough to be part of the apocalyptic birth of the Five would be enraged. And to compound the irony, ''Kick Out the Jams'' has been my favorite album or at least one of the two or three most played for about three months now.\u201d<ref>[[Lester Bangs|Bangs, Lester]] (2001).

Vocalist [[Rob Tyner]] shouted, \"And right now... right now... right now it's time to... kick out the jams, motherfuckers!\" before the opening riffs. [[Elektra Records]] executives were offended by the line and had preferred to edit it out of the album (replacing the offending words with \"brothers and sisters\"), while the band and manager [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] adamantly opposed this.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe original release had \"kick out the jams, Motherfuckers!\" printed on the inside album cover, but was soon pulled from stores. Two versions were then released, both with censored album covers, with the uncensored audio version sold behind record counters.\n\nMaking matters worse, [[Hudson's]] department stores refused to carry the album. Tensions between the band and the Hudson's chain escalated to the point that the department stores refused to carry any album from the Elektra label after MC5 took out a full-page ad that, according to [[Danny Fields]], \"was just a picture of Rob Tyner, and all it said was 'Fuck Hudson's.' And it had the Elektra logo\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=McNeil |first1=Legs |authorlink=Legs McNeil |last2=McCain |first2=Gillian |title=Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1996 |page=62}}</ref> To end the conflict and to avoid further financial loss, Elektra dropped MC5 from their record label.\n\nLater the same year, [[Jefferson Airplane]] recorded the song \"We Can Be Together\" for their ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'' album, a song containing the word \"motherfucker\". Unlike Elektra, RCA Records released the album wholly uncensored.\n\n==Title meaning==\n\n\"Kick out the jams\" has also been taken to be a slogan of the 1960s ethos of revolution and liberation, an incitement to \"kick out\" restrictions in various forms.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} To quote MC5 guitarist [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] from his interview with Caroline Boucher in ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc & Music Echo]]'' magazine on August 8, 1970:\n\n<blockquote>People said \"oh wow, 'kick out the jams' means break down restrictions\" etc., and it made good copy, but when we wrote it we didn't have that in mind. We first used the phrase when we were the house band at a ballroom in Detroit, and we played there every week with another band from the area. [...] We got in the habit, being the sort of punks we are, of screaming at them to get off the stage, to kick out the jams, meaning stop jamming. We were saying it all the time and it became a sort of esoteric phrase. Now, I think people can get what they like out of it; that's one of the good things about rock and roll.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Caroline |last=Boucher |date=August 8, 1970 |title=MC5 Problem |journal=[[Disc (magazine)|Disc & Music Echo]] |url=http://makemyday.free.fr/discandme.htm |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKramer also claimed during a 1999 interview that was excerpted for ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'' magazine that the phrase was specifically aimed toward British 1960s bands playing at the Grande who MC5 felt were not putting enough energy into their performances.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The title has also (jokingly) been reinterpreted as an establishment message masquerading as a revolutionary anthem. [[David Bowie]] sings in the song \"[[Cygnet Committee]]\": \"[We] stoned the poor on slogans such as/Wish You Could Hear/Love Is All We Need/Kick Out the Jams/Kick Out Your Mother\".\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1score = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/kick-out-the-jams-mw0000263578 |title=Kick Out the Jams |author=Deming, Mark |work=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev2score = (unfavorable)<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite journal |title=MC5 |date=April 5, 1969 |author=[[Lester Bangs|Bangs, Lester]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/kick-out-the-jams-19690405 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=San Francisco |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |accessdate=February 26, 2015}}</ref>\n| rev3 = [[PopMatters]]\n| rev3score = (very favorable)<ref name=PopMatters>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/mc5-kickoutthejams |title=MC5: Kick out the Jams |author=Williams, Adam |date=September 4, 2003 |work=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev4 = Treble\n| rev4score = (favorable)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treblezine.com/reviews/296.html |title=MC5 |author=Drozdowski, Wilson |date=September 23, 2004 |work=Treble |accessdate=February 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120164400/http://www.treblezine.com/reviews/296.html |archivedate=November 20, 2008}}</ref>\n}}\n\nUpon its release, critic [[Lester Bangs]], writing his inaugural review for ''Rolling Stone'', called ''Kick Out the Jams'' a \"ridiculous, overbearing, pretentious album\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\"/> In contrast to this view, modern opinion of the album generally holds it in very high regard, noting its influence on rock music that has followed. [[Allmusic]] called it \"one of the most powerfully energetic live albums ever made\" in their retrospective review.<ref name=Allmusic/> ''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewer Adam Williams wrote, \"For my money, 'Kick Out the Jams' is one of the greatest records ever pressed. It is a magnificent time portal into the past, a fleeting glimpse of a band that actually had the balls to walk it like they talked it\" and that \"no live recording has captured the primal elements of rock more than the MC5's inaugural effort.\"<ref name=PopMatters/>. Bangs himself would change his mind about the album, writing in a footnote in his [[The Troggs|Troggs]] essay \u201cJames Taylor Marked for Death\u201d: \u201cIncidentally, I\u2019m not trying to run down the Five, or write them off as some Troggs trifle. When I reviewed their first album in ''Rolling Stone'', I finished by mentioning \u201cThe Troggs, who appeared with a similar sex-and-violence thing a couple of years back, and promptly sank into oblivion, where I imagine they are laughing at the MC5,\u201d and that of course is as snottily unkind to the Troggs as to the Five. But then, it was the first review I ever had published, and even if more death threats came in after that review than any other save Jann Wenner's ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' massacre (and most of them from sweet home Detroit), I can see why people privileged enough to be part of the apocalyptic birth of the Five would be enraged. And to compound the irony, ''Kick Out the Jams'' has been my favorite album or at least one of the two or three most played for about three months now.\u201d<ref>[[Lester Bangs|Bangs, Lester]] (2001).
