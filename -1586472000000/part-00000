The [[Poisson spot]] is not easily observed in every-day situations, so it was only natural for Poisson to interpret it as an absurd result and that it should disprove Fresnel's theory. However, the head of the committee, [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago]], and who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France, decided to perform the experiment in more detail.

It was produced by [[Edward R. Pressman]] and [[Caldecot Chubb]]. The screenplay was by [[Michael Almereyda]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2017, the United States has fragmented into [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] wastelands and limited civilized areas. One of the effects of the economic crisis is a decline in manufacturing, and heavy emphasis on [[recycling]] aging 20th-century mechanical equipment. Society has become increasingly bureaucratic and hypersexualized, with the declining number of human sexual encounters requiring contracts drawn up by lawyers prior to sexual activity. At the same time, robotic technology has made tremendous developments, and female [[Android (robot)|androids]] (more properly, [[Gynoid]]s) are used as substitutes for wives.\n\nBusiness executive Sam Treadwell ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) owns a Cherry 2000 model Gynoid as his wife. After she short-circuits during sex on a wet kitchen floor, Sam is told by a repairman that she is damaged beyond repair, though her memory disk - which is incredibly rare and valuable, and contains her entire personality - can be used in a new body if one can be found. A Gynoid dealer tells Sam that the Cherry 2000 model is no longer produced, and that the only remaining ones are in a defunct factory in \"Zone 7\", a particularly dangerous, lawless area. With Cherry's memory disk stored in a device that plays back Cherry's voice, Treadwell hires Edith \"E\" Johnson ([[Melanie Griffith]]), a tough tracker, to guide him to the factory. They set off in Edith's heavily modified [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|1965]] [[Ford Mustang]]. \n\nAs they enter Zone 7, they encounter Lester, a wasteland overlord with deranged subordinates. Edith and Sam enter an underground reservoir occupied by Six-Fingered Jake, an elderly tracker who was Edith's mentor. When Lester's men attack, the three attempt to escape, but Sam is knocked unconscious and taken to a 1950s-styled motel/village run by Lester. He is greeted by his ex-girlfriend, Elaine, who now calls herself Ginger and works for Lester. Ginger tells Sam that he was the only one spared by Lester's men. Lester decides to induct Sam into the group, and Sam goes along. When he witnesses the group sadistically murdering a tracker, he decides to escape. As he escapes Lester's group, Sam runs into Edith and Jake. Jake stays behind to create some distractions, and gives Cherry's memory disk to Edith, though he had earlier led Sam to believe the chip had been lost.\n\nEdith, realizing Sam is a veteran of earlier wars, begins to see him in a new light and have feelings for him. Sam realizes he is attracted to Edith, but is reminded of Cherry when the voice recording is accidentally activated, and feels guilty. After fighting off Lester's goons, they continue on to the factory. Edith goes to a brothel/gas station owned by Snappy, a friend of Jake's, where a dilapidated [[Aeronca Champion]] light airplane is stored. Edith repairs the plane using parts from the Mustang. Snappy betrays them to Lester and Jake is killed, but Edith and Sam escape in the plane.\n\nSam suggests that they turn around, but Edith is determined to complete the job so Jake's death will not be meaningless. As they land, Zone 7 is revealed to be actually the abandoned ruins of [[Las Vegas]]. The Gynoid \"factory\" is actually a casino called \"Pharaoh's Casino\". Sam finds a functional Cherry 2000, and activates her with the memory disk. She remembers him, but does not understand the danger they are in, being a robot programmed only for home life and sex.\n\nWhen Lester's gang finds them, Edith and Sam manage to evade and kill many of his henchmen. Escaping to the plane, Sam, Edith, and Cherry find that their combined weight prevents takeoff. Edith jumps out, despite Sam rejecting the idea. Sam turns the plane around to help the now-trapped Edith, who is in a shootout with Lester's henchmen. Sam sends Cherry to get him a Pepsi, and Edith and he escape in the plane. Lester tries to [[lasso]] the plane, but ends up accidentally hanging himself from a statue. After Elaine and Sam escape, Ginger meets Cherry, and  Ginger is implied as also being a robot.\n\nEdith and Sam kiss as they fly away into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Melanie Griffith]] as Edith (\"E\") Johnson\n*[[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]] as Sam Treadwell\n*[[Tim Thomerson]] as Lester\n*[[Pamela Gidley]] as Cherry 2000\n*[[Harry Carey Jr.]] as Snappy Tom\n*[[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Six-Fingered Jake\n*[[Brion James]] as Stacy\n*[[Marshall Bell]] as Bill\n*[[Laurence Fishburne ]] as Glu Glu Lawyer\n*[[Michael C.

It was produced by [[Edward R. Pressman]] and [[Caldecot Chubb]]. The screenplay was by [[Michael Almereyda]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2017, the United States has fragmented into [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] wastelands and limited civilized areas. One of the effects of the economic crisis is a decline in manufacturing, and heavy emphasis on [[recycling]] aging 20th-century mechanical equipment. Society has become increasingly bureaucratic and hypersexualized, with the declining number of human sexual encounters requiring contracts drawn up by lawyers prior to sexual activity. At the same time, robotic technology has made tremendous developments, and female [[Android (robot)|androids]] (more properly, [[Gynoid]]s) are used as substitutes for wives.\n\nBusiness executive Sam Treadwell ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) owns a Cherry 2000 model Gynoid as his wife. After she short-circuits during sex on a wet kitchen floor, Sam is told by a repairman that she is damaged beyond repair, though her memory disk - which is incredibly rare and valuable, and contains her entire personality - can be used in a new body if one can be found. A Gynoid dealer tells Sam that the Cherry 2000 model is no longer produced, and that the only remaining ones are in a defunct factory in \"Zone 7\", a particularly dangerous, lawless area. With Cherry's memory disk stored in a device that plays back Cherry's voice, Treadwell hires Edith \"E\" Johnson ([[Melanie Griffith]]), a tough tracker, to guide him to the factory. They set off in Edith's heavily modified [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|1965]] [[Ford Mustang]]. \n\nAs they enter Zone 7, they encounter Lester, a wasteland overlord with deranged subordinates. Edith and Sam enter an underground reservoir occupied by Six-Fingered Jake, an elderly tracker who was Edith's mentor. When Lester's men attack, the three attempt to escape, but Sam is knocked unconscious and taken to a 1950s-styled motel/village run by Lester. He is greeted by his ex-girlfriend, Elaine, who now calls herself Ginger and works for Lester. Ginger tells Sam that he was the only one spared by Lester's men. Lester decides to induct Sam into the group, and Sam goes along. When he witnesses the group sadistically murdering a tracker, he decides to escape. As he escapes Lester's group, Sam runs into Edith and Jake. Jake stays behind to create some distractions, and gives Cherry's memory disk to Edith, though he had earlier led Sam to believe the chip had been lost.\n\nEdith, realizing Sam is a veteran of earlier wars, begins to see him in a new light and have feelings for him. Sam realizes he is attracted to Edith, but is reminded of Cherry when the voice recording is accidentally activated, and feels guilty. After fighting off Lester's goons, they continue on to the factory. Edith goes to a brothel/gas station owned by Snappy, a friend of Jake's, where a dilapidated [[Aeronca Champion]] light airplane is stored. Edith repairs the plane using parts from the Mustang. Snappy betrays them to Lester and Jake is killed, but Edith and Sam escape in the plane.\n\nSam suggests that they turn around, but Edith is determined to complete the job so Jake's death will not be meaningless.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

The original television series aired from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox.]] The program spanned [[List of The X-Files episodes|nine seasons, with 202 episodes]]. A short [[The X-Files (season 10)|tenth season]] consisting of six episodes premiered on January 24, 2016, and concluded on February 22, 2016. Following the ratings success of this [[revival (television)|revival]], Fox announced in April 2017 that ''The X-Files'' would be returning for an [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh season]] of ten episodes. The season premiered on January 3, 2018, concluding on March 21, 2018. In addition to the television series, two [[feature film]]s have been released: The 1998 film ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', which took place as part of the TV series continuity, and the stand-alone film ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released in 2008, six years after the original television run had ended.\n\nThe series revolves around [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who investigate [[X-files unit|X-Files]]: marginalized, unsolved cases involving [[paranormal]] phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries, offer alternate rational theories to his work, and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a few select people. The agents also discover an agenda of the government to keep the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] a secret. They develop a close relationship which begins as a [[platonic love|platonic]] friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series-spanning [[story arc]], \"[[monster of the week]]\" episodes form roughly two-thirds of all episodes.\n\n''The X-Files'' was inspired by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', and especially ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]''. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse [[gender stereotypes]] by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), also became a main character. The first five seasons of ''The X-Files'' were filmed and produced in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film ''The X-Files: I Want to Believe'' as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons of the series.\n\n''The X-Files'' was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a [[popular culture|pop culture]] touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[spirituality]]. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple [[List of accolades received by The X-Files|awards and nominations]], and by its conclusion the show was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a [[The X-Files (franchise)|franchise]] which includes ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' and ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' spin-offs, two theatrical films and accompanying [[The X-Files merchandise|merchandise]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\n\n=== General ===\n''The X-Files'' follows the careers and personal lives of [[Special agent|FBI Special Agents]] [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Mulder is a talented [[Offender profiling|profiler]] and strong believer in the [[supernatural]]. He is also adamant about the existence of intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] and its presence on Earth. This set of beliefs earns him the nickname \"Spooky Mulder\" and an assignment to a little-known department that deals with unsolved cases, known as the [[X-files unit|X-Files]]. His belief in the paranormal springs from the claimed [[alien abduction|abduction]] of his sister Samantha Mulder by extraterrestrials when Mulder was 12. Her abduction drives Mulder throughout most of the series. Because of this, as well as more nebulous desires for vindication and the revelation of truths kept hidden by human authorities, Mulder struggles to maintain [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in his investigations.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}101}}\n\nAgent Scully is a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Mulder in this regard. As a [[Physician|medical doctor]] and natural skeptic, Scully approaches cases with complete detachment even when Mulder, despite his considerable training, loses his objectivity.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}156}} She is partnered with Mulder initially so that she can debunk Mulder's nonconforming theories, often supplying logical, scientific explanations for the cases' apparently unexplainable phenomena. Although she is frequently able to offer scientific alternatives to Mulder's deductions, she is rarely able to refute them completely. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her own ability to approach the cases scientifically.{{sfn|Hurwitz|Knowles|2008|p=137}} After Mulder's abduction at the hands of aliens in the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] finale \"[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]\", Scully becomes a \"reluctant believer\" who manages to explain the paranormal with science.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Terry |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119302 |title=Interview with Chris Carter |work=Fresh Air from WHYY |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=March 1, 2001 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nVarious episodes also deal with the relationship between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically.<ref name=botched/> Mulder and Scully are joined by [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) late in the series, after Mulder is abducted.

The Syndicate\u2014having made a deal to be spared by the aliens\u2014have been working to develop an alien-human hybrid that will be able to withstand the effects of the black oil. The group has also been secretly working on a vaccine to overcome the black oil; this vaccine is revealed in the latter parts of [[The X-Files (season 5)|season five]], as well as the [[The X-Files (film)|1998 film]]. Counter to the alien colonization effort, another faction of aliens, the faceless rebels, are working to stop alien colonization.

The original television series aired from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox.]] The program spanned [[List of The X-Files episodes|nine seasons, with 202 episodes]]. A short [[The X-Files (season 10)|tenth season]] consisting of six episodes premiered on January 24, 2016, and concluded on February 22, 2016. Following the ratings success of this [[revival (television)|revival]], Fox announced in April 2017 that ''The X-Files'' would be returning for an [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh season]] of ten episodes. The season premiered on January 3, 2018, concluding on March 21, 2018. In addition to the television series, two [[feature film]]s have been released: The 1998 film ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', which took place as part of the TV series continuity, and the stand-alone film ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released in 2008, six years after the original television run had ended.\n\nThe series revolves around [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who investigate [[X-files unit|X-Files]]: marginalized, unsolved cases involving [[paranormal]] phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries, offer alternate rational theories to his work, and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a few select people. The agents also discover an agenda of the government to keep the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] a secret. They develop a close relationship which begins as a [[platonic love|platonic]] friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series-spanning [[story arc]], \"[[monster of the week]]\" episodes form roughly two-thirds of all episodes.\n\n''The X-Files'' was inspired by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', and especially ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]''. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse [[gender stereotypes]] by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), also became a main character. The first five seasons of ''The X-Files'' were filmed and produced in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film ''The X-Files: I Want to Believe'' as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons of the series.\n\n''The X-Files'' was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a [[popular culture|pop culture]] touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[spirituality]]. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple [[List of accolades received by The X-Files|awards and nominations]], and by its conclusion the show was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a [[The X-Files (franchise)|franchise]] which includes ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' and ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' spin-offs, two theatrical films and accompanying [[The X-Files merchandise|merchandise]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\n\n=== General ===\n''The X-Files'' follows the careers and personal lives of [[Special agent|FBI Special Agents]] [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Mulder is a talented [[Offender profiling|profiler]] and strong believer in the [[supernatural]]. He is also adamant about the existence of intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] and its presence on Earth. This set of beliefs earns him the nickname \"Spooky Mulder\" and an assignment to a little-known department that deals with unsolved cases, known as the [[X-files unit|X-Files]]. His belief in the paranormal springs from the claimed [[alien abduction|abduction]] of his sister Samantha Mulder by extraterrestrials when Mulder was 12. Her abduction drives Mulder throughout most of the series. Because of this, as well as more nebulous desires for vindication and the revelation of truths kept hidden by human authorities, Mulder struggles to maintain [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in his investigations.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}101}}\n\nAgent Scully is a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Mulder in this regard. As a [[Physician|medical doctor]] and natural skeptic, Scully approaches cases with complete detachment even when Mulder, despite his considerable training, loses his objectivity.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}156}} She is partnered with Mulder initially so that she can debunk Mulder's nonconforming theories, often supplying logical, scientific explanations for the cases' apparently unexplainable phenomena. Although she is frequently able to offer scientific alternatives to Mulder's deductions, she is rarely able to refute them completely. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her own ability to approach the cases scientifically.{{sfn|Hurwitz|Knowles|2008|p=137}} After Mulder's abduction at the hands of aliens in the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] finale \"[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]\", Scully becomes a \"reluctant believer\" who manages to explain the paranormal with science.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Terry |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119302 |title=Interview with Chris Carter |work=Fresh Air from WHYY |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=March 1, 2001 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nVarious episodes also deal with the relationship between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically.<ref name=botched/> Mulder and Scully are joined by [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) late in the series, after Mulder is abducted.
