Schick received his [[habilitation]] in 2000 from the University of M\u00fcnster and is since 2001 a professor for pure mathematics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].\n\nHis research deals with topological invariants, ''e.g.'' <math>L^2</math>-invarianten and those invariants which result from the [[K-theory]] of [[operator algebra]]s.

Maslow was already a 33-year-old father and had two children when the United States entered World War II in 1941. He was thus ineligible for the military. However, the horrors of war inspired a vision of peace in him leading to his groundbreaking psychological studies of self-actualizing. The studies began under the supervision of two mentors, [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Max Wertheimer]], whom he admired both professionally and personally. They accomplished a lot in both realms. Being such \"wonderful human beings\" as well, they inspired Maslow to take notes about them and their behavior. This would be the basis of his lifelong research and thinking about [[mental health]] and [[human potential]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Abraham Maslow: a biographer's reflections |author=Edward Hoffman |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=439\u2013443 |doi=10.1177/0022167808320534}}</ref> He extended the subject, borrowing ideas from other psychologists and adding new ones, such as the concepts of a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]], [[Metamotivation|metaneeds]], [[metamotivation]], [[Self-actualization|self-actualizing]] persons, and [[peak experiences]]. Maslow was a professor at [[Brandeis University]] from 1951 to 1969. He became a resident fellow of the Laughlin Institute in California.

Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. [[Humanistic psychology]] gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals' achieving them. The most famous of these was [[client-centered therapy]] developed by [[Carl Rogers]].\n\nThe basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple:\n\n# Someone's present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future.\n# To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative.\n# Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person.\n# The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\">{{cite web|title=Humanistic Psychology |url=http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |accessdate=21 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824115841/http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |archivedate=24 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHumanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud's theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow's Hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined ''positive psychology'', is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\"/> [[Humanistic psychologist]]s believe that every person has a strong desire to realize their full potential, to reach a level of \"[[self-actualization]]\". The main point of that new movement, that reached its peak in 1960s, was to emphasize the positive potential of human beings.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L. \"Psychology\"</ref> Maslow positioned his work as a vital complement to that of Freud:\n{{quote|It is as if Freud supplied us the sick half of psychology and we must now fill it out with the healthy half.<ref>Toward a psychology of being, 1968</ref>}}\nHowever, Maslow was highly critical of Freud, since humanistic psychologists did not recognize spirituality as a navigation for our behaviours.<ref>The Personal Meaning of Social Values in the Work of Abraham Maslow\nby John H. Morgan\nInterpersona : An International Journal on Personal Relationships, ISSN 1981-6472, 06/2012, Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 75 - 93</ref>\n\nTo prove that humans are not blindly reacting to situations, but trying to accomplish something greater, Maslow studied mentally healthy individuals instead of people with serious psychological issues. He focused on self-actualizing people. Self-actualizing people indicate a ''coherent personality syndrome'' and represent optimal psychological health and functioning.<ref>Michael Daniels, [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02684455 \"The Development of the Concept of Selfactualization in the writings of Abraham Maslow\"], \"University of Toronto Libraries\" {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThis informed his theory that a person enjoys \"[[peak experience]]s\", high points in life when the individual is in harmony with himself and his surroundings. In Maslow's view, self-actualized people can have many peak experiences throughout a day while others have those experiences less frequently.<ref>[[#Berger|Berger (1983)]], p. 43.</ref> He believed that psychedelic drugs like [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[Psilocybin]] can produce peak experiences in the right people under the right circumstances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Peak and plateau experiences===\nBeyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as [[Peak experiences]], which are profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient and yet a part of the world, more aware of truth, justice, harmony, goodness, and so on. Self-actualizing people are more likely to have peak experiences. In other words, these \"peak experiences\" or states of flow are the reflections of the realization of one's human potential and represent the height of personality development.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|page=487}}</ref>\n\nIn later writings Maslow moved to a more inclusive model that allowed for, in addition to intense peak experiences, longer-lasting periods of serene Being-cognition that he termed [[Peak experience#Plateau experience|''plateau experiences'']].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krippner | first1 = Stanley | year = 1972 | title = The plateau experience: A.

The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher as an illustrative device. This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs, both physical and psychological, as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow's needs theory and may give the impression that the Hierarchy of Needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression. Yet, starting with the first publication of his theory in 1943, Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid\u2014with many needs being present in a person simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Maslow | first1 = A.

These two steps are important to the physical survival of the person. Once individuals have basic nutrition, shelter and safety, they attempt to accomplish more.\n* The third level of need is \"Love and Belonging\", which are psychological needs; when individuals have taken care of themselves physically, they are ready to share themselves with others, such as with family and friends.\n* The fourth level is achieved when individuals feel comfortable with what they have accomplished. This is the \"Esteem\" level, the need to be competent and recognized, such as through status and level of success.\n* Then there is the \"Cognitive\" level, where individuals intellectually stimulate themselves and explore.\n* After that is the \"Aesthetic\" level, which is the need for harmony, order and beauty.<ref>Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007). Psychology: The Science of Behaviour \u2013 4th Canadian ed. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada.</ref>\n* At the top of the pyramid, \"Need for Self-actualization\" occurs when individuals reach a state of harmony and understanding because they are engaged in achieving their full potential.<ref>The Developing Person through the Life Span, (1983) pg. 44</ref> Once a person has reached the self-actualization state they focus on themselves and try to build their own image. They may look at this in terms of feelings such as self-confidence or by accomplishing a set goal.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nThe first four levels are known as ''Deficit needs'' or ''D-needs''. This means that if you do not have enough of one of those four needs, you will have the feeling that you need to get it. But when you do get them, then you feel content. These needs alone are not motivating.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nMaslow wrote that there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the basic needs to be satisfied. For example, freedom of speech, freedom to express oneself, and freedom to seek new information<ref>A Theory of Human Motivation</ref> are a few of the prerequisites. Any blockages of these freedoms could prevent the satisfaction of the basic needs.\n\nMaslow's Hierarchy is used in higher education for advising students and student retention<ref>Brookman, David M. \"Maslow's Hierarchy and Student Retention\".

All were \"reality centered,\" able to differentiate what was fraudulent from what was genuine. They were also \"problem centered,\" meaning that they treated life's difficulties as problems that demanded solutions. These individuals also were comfortable being alone and had healthy personal relationships. They had only a few close friends and family rather than a large number of shallow relationships.<ref name=\"ship\">{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/maslow.html|title=ABRAHAM MASLOW|author=C.

These self-actualized individuals were very independent and private when it came to their environment and culture, especially their very own individual development on \"potentialities and inner resources\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richard L.

R. (19992000). Memory. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 461). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.</ref> Consequently, Maslow argued, the way in which essential needs are fulfilled is just as important as the needs themselves. Together, these define the human experience. To the extent a person finds cooperative social fulfillment, he establishes meaningful relationships with other people and the larger world. In other words, he  establishes meaningful connections to an external reality\u2014an essential component of self-actualization. In contrast, to the extent that vital needs find selfish and competitive fulfillment, a person acquires hostile emotions and limited external relationships\u2014his awareness remains internal and limited.\n\n===Metamotivation===\nMaslow used the term [[metamotivation]] to describe self-actualized people who are driven by innate forces beyond their basic needs, so that they may explore and reach their full human potential.<ref>[[#Goble|Goble (1970)]]</ref>\n\n===Methodology===\nMaslow based his study on the writings of other psychologists, [[Albert Einstein]] and people he knew who [he felt] clearly met the standard of self-actualization.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S. A|year=2007|title= Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html|publisher=Simplypsychology.org|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nMaslow used Einstein's writings and accomplishments to exemplify the characteristics of the self-actualized person. But [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Max Wertheimer]] were also Maslow's models of self-actualization.  In this case, from a scientific perspective there are numerous problems with this particular approach.  First, it could be argued that biographical analysis as a method is extremely subjective as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher.  Personal opinion is always prone to bias, which reduces the validity of any data obtained.  Therefore, Maslow's operational definition of Self-actualization must not be blindly accepted as scientific fact.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S.

Maslow had concluded that humanistic psychology was incapable of explaining all aspects of human experience. He identified various mystical, ecstatic, or spiritual states known as \"[[peak experiences]]\" as experiences beyond self-actualization. Maslow called these experiences \"a fourth force in psychology\", which he named transpersonal psychology. Transpersonal psychology was concerned with the \"empirical, scientific study of, and responsible implementation of the finding relevant to, becoming, mystical, ecstatic, and spiritual states\" (Olson & Hergenhahn, 2011).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMaslow published in 1962 a collection of papers on this theme, which developed into his 1968 book ''Toward a Psychology of Being''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=Matthew H.

In this book Maslow proposed a model of \u2018characterologically relative\u2019 science, which he characterized as an ardent opposition to the \u2018\u2018historically, philosophically, sociologically and psychologically na\u0131ve\u2019\u2019 positivistic reluctance to see science \u2018\u2018relative to time, place, and local culture\u2019\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Science: A Reconnaissance|last=Maslow|first=Abraham|publisher=Gateway Editions|year=1969|isbn=|location=South Bend, Indiana|pages=1|via=}}</ref> As Maslow acknowledged, the book was greatly inspired by Thomas Kuhn's ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1962), and it offers a psychological reading of Kuhn's famous distinction between \"normal\" and \"revolutionary\" science in the context of his own distinction between \"safety\" and \"growth\" science, put forward as part of a larger program for the psychology of science, outlined already in his 1954 ''magnum opus'' ''Motivation and Personality''. Not only that Maslow offered a psychological reading of Kuhn's categories of \"normal\" and \"revolutionary\" science as an aftermath of Kuhn's ''Structure'', but he also offered a strikingly similar dichotomous structure of science 16 years before the first edition of ''Structure'', in his nowadays little known 1946 paper \"Means-Centering Versus Problem-Centering in Science\" published in the journal ''Philosophy of Science''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ko\u017enjak|first=Boris|date=2017|title=Kuhn Meets Maslow: The Psychology Behind Scientific Revolutions|journal=Journal for General Philosophy of Science|volume=48|issue=2|pages=257\u2013287|doi=10.1007/s10838-016-9352-x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=Abraham|date=1946|title=Problem-centering vs. means-centering in science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=326\u2013331 |doi=10.1086/286907|jstor=185213}}</ref>\n\n===Maslow's hammer===\nAbraham Maslow is also known for [[Maslow's hammer]], popularly phrased as \"[[wikt:if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail|if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail]]\"  from his book ''The Psychology of Science'', published in 1966.<ref name=maslow66>\n{{cite book\n | title = The Psychology of Science\n | author = Abraham H.

In particular, while they found&mdash;clearly in accordance with Maslow&mdash;that people tend to achieve basic and safety needs before other needs, as well as that other \"higher needs\" tend to be fulfilled in a certain order, the order in which they are fulfilled apparently does not strongly influence their subjective well-being (SWB). As put by the authors of the study, humans thus\n\n{{Quote|text=can derive 'happiness' from simultaneously working on a number of needs regardless of the fulfillment of other needs.

Maslow's thesis was published as two articles in 1934.\n\n===Academic career===\nHe continued his research at [[Columbia University]] on similar themes. There he found another mentor in [[Alfred Adler]], one of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s early colleagues. From 1937 to 1951, Maslow was on the faculty of [[Brooklyn College]]. His family life and his experiences influenced his psychological ideas. After [[World War II]], Maslow began to question the way psychologists had come to their conclusions, and although he did not completely disagree, he had his own ideas on how to understand the human mind.<ref>[[#Berger|Berger (1983)]], p. 42.</ref> He called his new discipline [[humanistic psychology]]. Maslow was already a 33-year-old father and had two children when the United States entered World War II in 1941. He was thus ineligible for the military. However, the horrors of war inspired a vision of peace in him leading to his groundbreaking psychological studies of self-actualizing. The studies began under the supervision of two mentors, [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Max Wertheimer]], whom he admired both professionally and personally. They accomplished a lot in both realms. Being such \"wonderful human beings\" as well, they inspired Maslow to take notes about them and their behavior. This would be the basis of his lifelong research and thinking about [[mental health]] and [[human potential]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Abraham Maslow: a biographer's reflections |author=Edward Hoffman |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=439\u2013443 |doi=10.1177/0022167808320534}}</ref> He extended the subject, borrowing ideas from other psychologists and adding new ones, such as the concepts of a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]], [[Metamotivation|metaneeds]], [[metamotivation]], [[Self-actualization|self-actualizing]] persons, and [[peak experiences]]. Maslow was a professor at [[Brandeis University]] from 1951 to 1969. He became a resident fellow of the Laughlin Institute in California. In 1967, Maslow had a serious heart attack and knew his time was limited. He considered himself to be a psychological pioneer. He gave future psychologists a push by bringing to light different paths to ponder.<ref>Thoreau, H. (1962). Thoreau: Walden and other writings. New York: Bantam Books. (Original work published 1854)</ref> He built the framework that later allowed other psychologists to conduct more comprehensive studies. Maslow believed that leadership should be non-intervening. Consistent with this approach, he rejected a nomination in 1963 to be the president of the Association for [[Humanistic Psychology]] because he felt that the organization should develop an intellectual movement without a leader.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miles Vich |year=2008 |title=Maslow's leadership legacy |journal=[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=444\u2013445 |doi=10.1177/0022167808320540}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhile jogging, Maslow suffered a severe [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died on June 8, 1970, at the age of 62 in [[Menlo Park, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/maslow.htm|title=Psychology History|work=muskingum.edu|accessdate=2015-12-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220204237/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/maslow.htm|archivedate=2015-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Dr. Abraham Maslow, Founder Of Humanistic Psychology, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/10/archives/dr-abraham-maslow-founder-of-humanistic-psychology-dies.html |quote=Dr. Abraham Maslow, professor of psychology at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., and founder of what has come to be known as humanistic psychology, died of a heart attack.

Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. [[Humanistic psychology]] gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals' achieving them. The most famous of these was [[client-centered therapy]] developed by [[Carl Rogers]].\n\nThe basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple:\n\n# Someone's present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future.\n# To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative.\n# Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person.\n# The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\">{{cite web|title=Humanistic Psychology |url=http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |accessdate=21 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824115841/http://www.abraham-maslow.com/m_motivation/Humanistic_Psychology.asp |archivedate=24 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHumanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud's theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow's Hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined ''positive psychology'', is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders.<ref name=\"Humanistic Psychology\"/> [[Humanistic psychologist]]s believe that every person has a strong desire to realize their full potential, to reach a level of \"[[self-actualization]]\". The main point of that new movement, that reached its peak in 1960s, was to emphasize the positive potential of human beings.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L. \"Psychology\"</ref> Maslow positioned his work as a vital complement to that of Freud:\n{{quote|It is as if Freud supplied us the sick half of psychology and we must now fill it out with the healthy half.<ref>Toward a psychology of being, 1968</ref>}}\nHowever, Maslow was highly critical of Freud, since humanistic psychologists did not recognize spirituality as a navigation for our behaviours.<ref>The Personal Meaning of Social Values in the Work of Abraham Maslow\nby John H. Morgan\nInterpersona : An International Journal on Personal Relationships, ISSN 1981-6472, 06/2012, Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 75 - 93</ref>\n\nTo prove that humans are not blindly reacting to situations, but trying to accomplish something greater, Maslow studied mentally healthy individuals instead of people with serious psychological issues. He focused on self-actualizing people. Self-actualizing people indicate a ''coherent personality syndrome'' and represent optimal psychological health and functioning.<ref>Michael Daniels, [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02684455 \"The Development of the Concept of Selfactualization in the writings of Abraham Maslow\"], \"University of Toronto Libraries\" {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThis informed his theory that a person enjoys \"[[peak experience]]s\", high points in life when the individual is in harmony with himself and his surroundings. In Maslow's view, self-actualized people can have many peak experiences throughout a day while others have those experiences less frequently.<ref>[[#Berger|Berger (1983)]], p. 43.</ref> He believed that psychedelic drugs like [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[Psilocybin]] can produce peak experiences in the right people under the right circumstances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Peak and plateau experiences===\nBeyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as [[Peak experiences]], which are profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient and yet a part of the world, more aware of truth, justice, harmony, goodness, and so on. Self-actualizing people are more likely to have peak experiences. In other words, these \"peak experiences\" or states of flow are the reflections of the realization of one's human potential and represent the height of personality development.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|page=487}}</ref>\n\nIn later writings Maslow moved to a more inclusive model that allowed for, in addition to intense peak experiences, longer-lasting periods of serene Being-cognition that he termed [[Peak experience#Plateau experience|''plateau experiences'']].<ref>Krippner, Stanley (1972). \n[https://www.academia.edu/27103672 The plateau experience: A.

None of his published works included a visual representation of the hierarchy. The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher as an illustrative device. This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs, both physical and psychological, as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow's needs theory and may give the impression that the Hierarchy of Needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression. Yet, starting with the first publication of his theory in 1943, Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid\u2014with many needs being present in a person simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Maslow | first1 = A.

Late in life, Maslow came to conclude that self-actualization was not an automatic outcome of satisfying the other human needs <ref>Frick, W. B. (1989). Interview with Dr. Abraham Maslow.

These two steps are important to the physical survival of the person. Once individuals have basic nutrition, shelter and safety, they attempt to accomplish more.\n* The third level of need is \"Love and Belonging\", which are psychological needs; when individuals have taken care of themselves physically, they are ready to share themselves with others, such as with family and friends.\n* The fourth level is achieved when individuals feel comfortable with what they have accomplished. This is the \"Esteem\" level, the need to be competent and recognized, such as through status and level of success.\n* Then there is the \"Cognitive\" level, where individuals intellectually stimulate themselves and explore.\n* After that is the \"Aesthetic\" level, which is the need for harmony, order and beauty.<ref>Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007). Psychology: The Science of Behaviour \u2013 4th Canadian ed. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada.</ref>\n* At the top of the pyramid, \"Need for Self-actualization\" occurs when individuals reach a state of harmony and understanding because they are engaged in achieving their full potential.<ref>The Developing Person through the Life Span, (1983) pg. 44</ref> Once a person has reached the self-actualization state they focus on themselves and try to build their own image. They may look at this in terms of feelings such as self-confidence or by accomplishing a set goal.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nThe first four levels are known as ''Deficit needs'' or ''D-needs''. This means that if you do not have enough of one of those four needs, you will have the feeling that you need to get it. But when you do get them, then you feel content. These needs alone are not motivating.<ref name=\"Boeree\"/>\n\nMaslow wrote that there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the basic needs to be satisfied.

These self-actualized individuals were very independent and private when it came to their environment and culture, especially their very own individual development on \"potentialities and inner resources\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richard L.

R. (19992000). Memory. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 461). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.</ref> Consequently, Maslow argued, the way in which essential needs are fulfilled is just as important as the needs themselves. Together, these define the human experience. To the extent a person finds cooperative social fulfillment, he establishes meaningful relationships with other people and the larger world. In other words, he  establishes meaningful connections to an external reality\u2014an essential component of self-actualization. In contrast, to the extent that vital needs find selfish and competitive fulfillment, a person acquires hostile emotions and limited external relationships\u2014his awareness remains internal and limited.\n\n===Metamotivation===\nMaslow used the term [[metamotivation]] to describe self-actualized people who are driven by innate forces beyond their basic needs, so that they may explore and reach their full human potential.<ref>[[#Goble|Goble (1970)]]</ref>\n\n===Methodology===\nMaslow based his study on the writings of other psychologists, [[Albert Einstein]] and people he knew who [he felt] clearly met the standard of self-actualization.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S.

But [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Max Wertheimer]] were also Maslow's models of self-actualization.  In this case, from a scientific perspective there are numerous problems with this particular approach.  First, it could be argued that biographical analysis as a method is extremely subjective as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher.  Personal opinion is always prone to bias, which reduces the validity of any data obtained.  Therefore, Maslow's operational definition of Self-actualization must not be blindly accepted as scientific fact.<ref>{{cite web|author=McLeod, S.

Maslow had concluded that humanistic psychology was incapable of explaining all aspects of human experience. He identified various mystical, ecstatic, or spiritual states known as \"[[peak experiences]]\" as experiences beyond self-actualization. Maslow called these experiences \"a fourth force in psychology\", which he named transpersonal psychology. Transpersonal psychology was concerned with the \"empirical, scientific study of, and responsible implementation of the finding relevant to, becoming, mystical, ecstatic, and spiritual states\" (Olson & Hergenhahn, 2011).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMaslow published in 1962 a collection of papers on this theme, which developed into his 1968 book ''Toward a Psychology of Being''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=Matthew H.

Not only that Maslow offered a psychological reading of Kuhn's categories of \"normal\" and \"revolutionary\" science as an aftermath of Kuhn's ''Structure'', but he also offered a strikingly similar dichotomous structure of science 16 years before the first edition of ''Structure'', in his nowadays little known 1946 paper \"Means-Centering Versus Problem-Centering in Science\" published in the journal ''Philosophy of Science''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ko\u017enjak|first=Boris|date=2017|title=Kuhn Meets Maslow: The Psychology Behind Scientific Revolutions|journal=Journal for General Philosophy of Science|volume=48|issue=2|pages=257\u2013287|doi=10.1007/s10838-016-9352-x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=Abraham|date=1946|title=Problem-centering vs. means-centering in science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=326\u2013331 |doi=10.1086/286907|jstor=185213}}</ref>\n\n===Maslow's hammer===\nAbraham Maslow is also known for [[Maslow's hammer]], popularly phrased as \"[[wikt:if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail|if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail]]\"  from his book ''The Psychology of Science'', published in 1966.<ref name=maslow66>\n{{cite book\n | title = The Psychology of Science\n | author = Abraham H.

In particular, while they found&mdash;clearly in accordance with Maslow&mdash;that people tend to achieve basic and safety needs before other needs, as well as that other \"higher needs\" tend to be fulfilled in a certain order, the order in which they are fulfilled apparently does not strongly influence their subjective well-being (SWB).

Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed [[suicide]] in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Harris and Klebold were [[senior (education)|senior]]s at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The ''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' has called them \"cultural icons\" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].\n\nHarris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. Harris finally settled in [[Littleton, Colorado]] in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties.\n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive.\n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Eric's parents were both born in Colorado but while his father Wayne Harris was working in the Air Force as a transport pilot, Wayne held 11 different positions at six different bases in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Plattsburgh, New York]] was the last place the family moved to before Wayne's forced retirement from the military in 1993 due to cutbacks. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]].

Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake 'suicide', sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723095423/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Dylan Klebold===\n'''Dylan Bennet Klebold''' was born on September 11, 1981 in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] to Thomas and [[Sue Klebold|Susan Klebold]].<ref name=\"Suspects\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055023/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children.

Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status.\n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

Harris created a set of levels for the game ''Doom'', which later became known as the 'Harris levels'. The levels are downloadable over the internet through [[Doom WAD|''Doom'' WADs]]. Harris had a web presence under the [[User (computing)|handle]] \"REB\" (short for Rebel, a nod to the nickname of Columbine High's sports teams) and other online aliases, including \"Rebldomakr\", \"Rebdoomer\", and \"Rebdomine\". Klebold went by the names \"VoDKa\" and \"VoDkA\", seemingly inspired by the [[Vodka|alcoholic drink]]. Harris had various websites that hosted ''Doom'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' files, as well as team information for those he gamed with online.

Harris was required to attend [[anger management]] classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. The boys' [[probation officer]] discharged them from the program a few months ahead of schedule for good behavior. Of Harris, it was remarked that he was \"a very bright individual who is likely to succeed in life\", while Klebold was said to be intelligent, but \"needs to understand that hard work is part of fulfilling a dream.\"\n\nA couple of months later on April 30, Harris handed over the first version of a letter of apology he wrote to the owner of the van, which he completed the next month.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolshooters.info/eric-harris-diversion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014005724/http://www.schoolshooters.info/eric-harris-diversion.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> In the letter, Harris expressed regret about his actions; however, in one of his journal entries dated April 12, he wrote: \"Isnt america supposed to be the land of the free? how come, If im free, I cant deprive some fucking dumbshit from his possessions If he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van in plain sight in the middle of fucking nowhere on a fri-fucking-day night?

The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs. The two boys purchased six more propane tanks on the morning of the attack.\n\nMore complex bombs, such as the one that detonated on the corner of South Wadsworth Boulevard and Ken Caryl Avenue, had [[time bomb|timers]]. The two largest bombs built were found in the school cafeteria and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only partially detonating.

Early reports described the members as also wearing German slogans and swastikas on their clothes.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> Additional media reports described the Trench Coat Mafia as a cult with ties to the Neo-Nazi movement which fueled a media stigma and bias against the Trench Coat Mafia. The Trench Coat Mafia was a group of friends who hung out together, wore black trench coats, and prided themselves on being different from the 'jocks' who had been bullying the members and who also coined the name Trench Coat Mafia.<ref name=\"No easy answers\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1 | title=No easy answers: The truth behind death at Columbine | publisher=Lantern Books | author1=Brown, Brooks | author2=Merritt, Rob | year=2002 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1/page/n67 68]\u201370 | isbn=1590560310 | access-date=September 23, 2016 }}</ref> The trench coat inadvertently became the members' uniform after a mother of one of the members bought it as an inexpensive present.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\nInvestigation revealed that Harris and Klebold were only friends with one member of the group, Kristin Thiebault, and that most of the primary members of the Trench Coat Mafia had left the school by the time that Harris and Klebold committed the massacre.

According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.<ref name = \"slate\"/>\n\nAccording to psychologist Peter Langman, Klebold displayed signs of [[schizotypal personality disorder]] \u2013 he struck many people as odd, was very shy, appeared to have had disturbed thought processes and constantly misused language in unusual ways as evidenced by his journal, considered notable due to Klebold's peers that often described him as very intelligent. He appeared to have been delusional, viewed himself as \"god-like\" and wrote about he was \"made a human without the possibility of BEING human.\" He was also convinced that others hated him and felt like he was being conspired against, even though according to many reports, Klebold was loved by his family and plenty of friends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Langman | first = Peter | title = Rampage School Shooters: A Typology | orig-year = 2010 | year = 2016 | edition =  | chapter =  | chapter-url =  | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url = https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190712111604/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-date = July 12, 2019 | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =  | access-date = July 12, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Reaction of Sue Klebold===\n{{see also|A Mother's Reckoning}}\n\n[[Sue Klebold]], mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Dylan's involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Eric into doing it, among other things.

Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed [[suicide]] in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Harris and Klebold were [[senior (education)|senior]]s at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The ''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' has called them \"cultural icons\" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].\n\nHarris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. Harris finally settled in [[Littleton, Colorado]] in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties. \n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive. \n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]].

Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake 'suicide', sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723095423/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Dylan Klebold===\n'''Dylan Bennet Klebold''' was born on September 11, 1981 in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] to Thomas and [[Sue Klebold|Susan Klebold]].<ref name=\"Suspects\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055023/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children.

He was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris' parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status. \n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

It was estimated that if any of the bombs placed in the cafeteria had detonated properly, the blast could have caused extensive structural damage to the school and would have resulted in hundreds of casualties.<ref>{{cite web |title=At 'perfect' school, student sat next to bomb |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_1076860,00.html |date=April 12, 2002 |work=Rocky Mountain News |first=Lynn |last=Bartels |access-date=August 24, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420145325/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_15_1076860%2C00.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{Main|Columbine High School massacre}}\n\n===Day of the massacre===\n[[File:Columbine Shooting Security Camera.jpg|thumbnail|Harris (left) and Klebold (right) on a surveillance camera on the day of the shooting]]\nOn April 20, 1999, just weeks before Harris and Klebold were both due to graduate,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/24/us/terror-in-littleton-the-seniors-in-horrific-circumstance-sense-of-lost-pomp.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208020853/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/24/us/terror-in-littleton-the-seniors-in-horrific-circumstance-sense-of-lost-pomp.html |archive-date=December 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Brooks Brown, who was smoking a cigarette outside during lunch break, saw Harris arrive at school.

Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at Blackjack Pizza. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be \"god-like\". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word \"WRATH\" printed in red.<ref name=USAToday/> It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He furthermore wrote that what fun is life without death. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place.

Harris and Klebold reportedly discussed their motives for the attacks in these videos and gave instructions in bomb making.

Early reports described the members as also wearing German slogans and swastikas on their clothes.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> Additional media reports described the Trench Coat Mafia as a cult with ties to the Neo-Nazi movement which fueled a media stigma and bias against the Trench Coat Mafia. The Trench Coat Mafia was a group of friends who hung out together, wore black trench coats, and prided themselves on being different from the 'jocks' who had been bullying the members and who also coined the name Trench Coat Mafia.<ref name=\"No easy answers\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1 | title=No easy answers: The truth behind death at Columbine | publisher=Lantern Books | author1=Brown, Brooks | author2=Merritt, Rob | year=2002 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1/page/n67 68]\u201370 | isbn=1590560310 | access-date=September 23, 2016 }}</ref> The trench coat inadvertently became the members' uniform after a mother of one of the members bought it as an inexpensive present.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\nInvestigation revealed that Harris and Klebold were only friends with one member of the group, Kristin Thiebault, and that most of the primary members of the Trench Coat Mafia had left the school by the time that Harris and Klebold committed the massacre.

According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.<ref name = \"slate\"/>\n\nAccording to psychologist Peter Langman, Klebold displayed signs of [[schizotypal personality disorder]] \u2013 he struck many people as odd, was very shy, appeared to have had disturbed thought processes and constantly misused language in unusual ways as evidenced by his journal, considered notable due to Klebold's peers that often described him as very intelligent. He appeared to have been delusional, viewed himself as \"god-like\" and wrote about he was \"made a human without the possibility of BEING human.\" He was also convinced that others hated him and felt like he was being conspired against, even though according to many reports, Klebold was loved by his family and plenty of friends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Langman | first = Peter | title = Rampage School Shooters: A Typology | orig-year = 2010 | year = 2016 | edition =  | chapter =  | chapter-url =  | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url = https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190712111604/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-date = July 12, 2019 | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =  | access-date = July 12, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Reaction of Sue Klebold===\n{{see also|A Mother's Reckoning}}\n\n[[Sue Klebold]], mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Dylan's involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Eric into doing it, among other things.

On 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of the [[Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was loved by the youngsters of Bury whom he often obliged with sweets from the candy-shop.<ref>William Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London, 1830), Volume I, 1287\u20131291.</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n*Christian Deelman, 'The original cast of The School for Scandal', ''The Review of English Studies'' 1962 XIII(51), pp.&nbsp;257\u2013266.\n*''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' 1911.\n*{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Smith, William (1730?-1819)|volume=53|last=Knight|first=John Joseph|authorlink=}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, William Gentleman}}\n[[Category:English male stage actors]]\n[[Category:1730 births]]\n[[Category:1819 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century English male actors]]\n[[Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge]]\n", "name_user": "Eebahgum", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCovent Garden 1753\u20131774:ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_%27Gentleman%27_Smith"}
