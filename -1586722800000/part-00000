The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints.<ref>Joseph Phillips (2003). ''PMP Project Management Professional Study Guide''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2003. {{ISBN|0-07-223062-2}} p.354.</ref> This information is usually described in project documentation, created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints are [[Scope (project management)|scope]], time, [[quality (business)|quality]] and [[budget]].<ref name=\"PMI 10\" /> The secondary\u2014and more ambitious\u2014challenge is to [[operations research|optimize]] the [[Resource allocation|allocation]] of necessary inputs and apply them to meet pre-defined objectives.\n\nThe objective of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the client's objectives. In many cases the objective of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief to feasibly address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established they should influence all decisions made by other people involved in the project&nbsp;\u2013 for example project managers, designers, contractors and sub-contractors. Ill-defined or too tightly prescribed project management objectives are detrimental to decision making.\n\nA [[project]] is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or staffing) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.<ref>''The Definitive Guide to Project Management''.

His work is the forerunner to modern project management tools including [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) and [[resource allocation]].\n\nThe 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era where core engineering fields come together to work as one. Project management became recognized as a distinct discipline arising from the management discipline with engineering model.<ref name=\"ClGa06\">[[David I. Cleland]], Roland Gareis (2006). ''Global Project Management Handbook''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006. {{ISBN|0-07-146045-4}}. p.1-4 states: \"''It was in the 1950s when project management was formally recognized as a distinct contribution arising from the management discipline.''\"</ref> In the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad-hoc basis, using mostly [[Gantt chart]]s and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical [[Schedule (project management)|project-scheduling]] models were developed. The \"[[Critical Path Method|critical path method]]\" (CPM) was developed as a joint venture between [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] and [[Remington Rand|Remington Rand Corporation]] for managing plant maintenance projects. The \"[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|program evaluation and review technique]]\" (PERT), was developed by the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in conjunction with the [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] as part of the [[Polaris missile]] submarine program.<ref>[[Donald G. Malcolm|Malcolm, D. G.]], Roseboom, J. H., Clark, C. E., & [[Willard Fazar|Fazar, W.]] (1959). \"[http://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF/PM-History_PERT-Original_Paper.pdf Application of a technique for research and development program evaluation].\" ''Operations research,'' 7(5), 646-669.\n</ref>\n\nPERT and CPM are very similar in their approach but still present some differences. CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and [[PERT]] are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.\n[[File:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|240px|[[PERT|PERT network chart]] for a seven-month project with five milestones]]\n\nAt the same time, as project-scheduling models were being developed, technology for project cost [[Estimation (project management)|estimating]], cost management and engineering economics was evolving, with pioneering work by Hans Lang and others. In 1956, the American Association of Cost Engineers (now [[AACE International]]; the Association for the Advancement of [[Cost Engineering]]) was formed by early practitioners of project management and the associated specialties of planning and scheduling, cost estimating, and cost/schedule control (project control). AACE continued its pioneering work and in 2006 released the first integrated process for portfolio, program and project management ([[Total Cost Management|total cost management]] framework).\n\nIn 1969, the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) was formed in the USA.<ref>F. L. Harrison, Dennis Lock (2004). ''Advanced project management: a structured approach''. Gower Publishing, Ltd., 2004. {{ISBN|0-566-07822-8}}. p.34.</ref> PMI publishes ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]'' (PMBOK Guide), which describes project management practices that are common to \"most projects, most of the time.\" PMI also offers a range of certifications.\n\n==Project management types==\nProject management methods can be applied to any project. It is often tailored to a specific type of projects based on project size, nature and industry.  For example, the construction industry, which focuses on the delivery of things like buildings, roads, and bridges, has developed its own specialized form of project management that it refers to as ''construction project management'' and in which project managers can become trained and certified.<ref name=\"Contruction_Project_Management\">{{cite web|url=http://cmaanet.org/certified-construction-manager|title=Certified Construction Manager|publisher=CMAA|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref>  The information technology industry has also evolved to develop its own form of project management that is referred to as ''IT project management'' and which specializes in the delivery of technical assets and services that are required to pass through various lifecycle phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. ''Biotechnology project management'' focuses on the intricacies of biotechnology research and development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/biotechnology-project-management.html|title=Certificate in Biotechnology Project Management|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> ''Localization project management'' includes many standard project management practices even though many consider this type of management to be a very different discipline. It focuses on three important goals: time, quality and budget. Successful projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and according to previously agreed quality standards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Practical Guide to Localization|last=Esselink|first=Bert|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2000|isbn=978-9-027-21956-5|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|pages=428}}</ref>\n\nFor each type of project management, project managers develop and utilize repeatable templates that are specific to the industry they're dealing with.  This allows project plans to become very thorough and highly repeatable, with the specific intent to increase quality, lower delivery costs, and lower time to deliver project results.\n\n==Approaches of project management==\nA 2017 study suggested that the success of any project depends on how well four key aspects are aligned with the contextual dynamics affecting the project, these are referred to as the ''four P's'':<ref>Mesly, Olivier. (2017). ''Project feasibility \u2013 Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New\tYork, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press. 546 pages. {{ISBN|9 781498 757911}}.</ref>\n\n* ''Plan'': The planning and forecasting activities. \n* ''Process:'' The overall approach to all activities and project governance.\n* ''People:'' Including dynamics of how they collaborate and communicate.\n* ''Power:'' Lines of authority,  decision-makers, organograms, policies for implementation and the like.\n\nThere are a number of approaches to organizing and completing project activities, including: phased, lean, iterative, and incremental. There are also several extensions to project planning, for example based on outcomes (product-based) or activities (process-based).\n\nRegardless of the [[methodology]] employed, careful consideration must be given to the overall project objectives, timeline, and cost, as well as the roles and responsibilities of all participants and [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].<ref>Cf. The Bridger (blog), [http://www.thebridger.co.uk/project-management-pmp-prince-2-or-an-iterative-or-agile-variant/ \"Project management: PMP, Prince 2, or an Iterative or Agile variant\"]</ref>\n===Benefits realization management===\n{{Main|Benefits realisation management}}\nBenefits realization management (BRM) enhances normal project management techniques through a focus on outcomes (benefits) of a project rather than products or outputs, and then measuring the degree to which that is happening to keep a project on track.  This can help to reduce the risk of a completed project being a failure by delivering agreed upon requirements/outputs but failing to deliver the '''''benefits''''' of those requirements.\n\nIn addition, BRM practices aim to ensure the alignment between project outcomes and business strategies. The effectiveness of these practices is supported by recent research evidencing BRM practices influencing project success from a strategic perspective across different countries and industries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Serra|first1=C. E. M.|last2=Kunc|first2=M.|year=2014|title=Benefits Realisation Management and its influence on project success and on the execution of business strategies|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/60436/|journal=International Journal of Project Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=53\u201366|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.03.011}}</ref>\n\nAn example of delivering a project to requirements might be agreeing to deliver a computer system that will process staff data and manage payroll, holiday and staff personnel records. Under BRM the agreement might be to achieve a specified reduction in staff hours required to process and maintain staff data.\n\n===Critical chain project management===\n{{Main|Critical chain project management}}\nCritical chain project management (CCPM) is an application of the [[theory of constraints]] (TOC) to planning and managing projects, and is designed to deal with the uncertainties inherent in managing projects, while taking into consideration limited availability of [[Resource (project management)|resources]] (physical, human skills, as well as management & support capacity) needed to execute projects.\n\nThe goal is to increase the flow of projects in an organization ([[throughput]]). Applying the first three of the [[Theory of Constraints#The five focusing steps|five focusing steps]] of TOC, the system constraint for all projects, as well as the resources, are identified. To exploit the constraint, tasks on the critical chain are given priority over all other activities. Finally, projects are planned and managed to ensure that the resources are ready when the critical chain tasks must start, subordinating all other resources to the critical chain.\n\n=== Earned value management ===\n{{Main|Earned value management}}\n\n[[File:EarnedValueChartNormalized.jpg|thumb|Earned Value chart shows Planned Value, Earned Value, Actual Cost, and their variances in percent. The approach is used in project management simulation [[SimulTrain]].]]\n\nEarned value management (EVM) extends project management with techniques to improve project monitoring. It illustrates project progress towards completion in terms of work and value (cost). [[Earned Schedule]] is an extension to the theory and practice of EVM.

For example, when working on a [[brick-and-mortar]] design and construction, projects will typically progress through stages like pre-planning, conceptual design, schematic design, design development, construction drawings (or contract documents), and construction administration.\n\nWhile the phased approach works well for small, well-defined projects, it often results in challenge or failure on larger projects, or those that are more complex or have more ambiguities, issues and risk.<ref name=\"Stellman05\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/|title=Applied Software Project Management|last=Stellman|first=Andrew|last2=Greene|first2=Jennifer|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2005|isbn=978-0-596-00948-9|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209011617/http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/|archivedate=2015-02-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Process-based management===\n{{Main |Process-based management}}\nThe incorporation of process-based management has been driven by the use of maturity models such as the [[OPM3]] and the [[CMMI]] (capability maturity model integration; see [[:Image:Capability Maturity Model.jpg|this example]] of a predecessor) and [[ISO/IEC 15504]] (SPICE \u2013 software process improvement and capability estimation). Unlike SEI's CMM, the OPM3 maturity model describes how to make project management processes capable of performing successfully, consistently, and predictably to enact the strategies of an organization.\n\n=== Project production management ===\n{{Main |Project production management}}\nProject production management is the application of operations management to the delivery of capital projects. The Project production management framework is based on a project as a production system view, in which a project transforms inputs (raw materials, information, labor, plant & machinery) into outputs (goods and services).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern construction management|last=McCaffer|first=Ronald|last2=Harris|first2=Frank|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=978-1118510186|location=|page=5|oclc=834624541}}</ref>\n\n===Product-based planning===\n{{Main|Product-based planning}}\nProduct-based planning is a structured approach to project management, based on identifying all of the products (project [[deliverable]]s) that contribute to achieving the project objectives.

Regardless of the methodology or terminology used, the same basic project management processes or stages of development will be used. Major process groups generally include:<ref name=\"PMI 10\">[[Project Management Institute|PMI]] (2010). ''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' p.27-35</ref>\n* Initiation\n* Planning \n* Production or execution\n* Monitoring and controlling\n* Closing\n\nIn project environments with a significant exploratory element (e.g., [[research and development]]), these stages may be supplemented with decision points (go/no go decisions) at which the project's continuation is debated and decided. An example is the [[Phase\u2013gate model]].\n\n===Initiating===\n[[File:Initiating Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Initiating process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\nThe initiating processes determine the nature and scope of the project.<ref>Peter Nathan, Gerald Everett Jones (2003). ''PMP certification for dummies''. p.63.</ref> If this stage is not performed well, it is unlikely that the project will be successful in meeting the business\u2019 needs. The key project controls needed here are an understanding of the business environment and making sure that all necessary controls are incorporated into the project. Any deficiencies should be reported and a recommendation should be made to fix them.\n\nThe initiating stage should include a plan that encompasses the following areas. These areas can be recorded in a series of documents called Project Initiation documents.\nProject Initiation documents are a series of planned documents used to create order for the duration of the project. \nThese tend to include: \n\t\n[[File:RACIQ Chart - Responsibility Assignment Matrix.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|RACI(Q) chart. At least one ''Responsible'' and exactly one ''Accountable'' person are designated for each project and planning activity in project management simulation [[SimulTrain]].]]\n\n* project proposal (idea behind project, overall goal, duration) \n* [[Scope (project management)|project scope]] (project direction and track)\n* [[product breakdown structure]] (PBS) (a hierarchy of deliverables / outcomes and components thereof) \n* [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) (a hierarchy of the work to be done, down to daily tasks) \n* [[responsibility assignment matrix]] (RACI) (roles and responsibilities aligned to deliverables / outcomes) \n* tentative [[Project plan|project schedule]] (milestones, important dates, deadlines)\n* analysis of business needs and [[requirement]]s against measurable goals\n* review of the current [[business operations|operations]]\n* [[financial analysis]] of the costs and benefits, including a [[budget]]\n* [[stakeholder analysis]], including users and support personnel for the project\n* [[project charter]] including costs, tasks, deliverables, and schedules\n* [[SWOT analysis]]: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the business\n\n===Planning===\nAfter the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail (see [[:File:Planning Process Group Activities.jpg|example of a flow-chart]]).<ref name=\"VA03\"/> The main purpose is to plan time, cost and resources adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution. As with the Initiation process group, a failure to adequately plan greatly reduces the project's chances of successfully accomplishing its goals.\n\n[[Project planning]] generally consists of<ref>{{cite book  | author = Harold Kerzner | year = 2003 | title = Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling | url = https://archive.org/details/projectmanagemen0000kerz_h0w8 | url-access = registration | edition = 8th | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 0-471-22577-0| author-link = Harold Kerzner }}</ref>\n* determining the project management methodology to follow (e.g. whether the plan will be defined [[Waterfall model|wholly up front]], [[Iterative and incremental development|iteratively]], or in [[Rolling-wave planning|rolling waves]]);\n* developing the [[scope statement]];\n* selecting the planning team;\n* identifying deliverables and creating the product and work breakdown structures;\n* identifying the activities needed to complete those deliverables and networking the activities in their logical sequence;\n* estimating the resource requirements for the activities;\n* estimating time and cost for activities;\n* developing the schedule;\n* developing the budget;\n* risk planning;\n* developing quality assurance measures;\n* gaining formal approval to begin work.\n\nAdditional processes, such as planning for communications and for scope management, identifying roles and responsibilities, determining what to purchase for the project and holding a kick-off meeting are also generally advisable.\n\nFor [[new product development]] projects, conceptual design of the operation of the final product may be performed concurrent with the project planning activities, and may help to inform the planning team when identifying deliverables and planning activities.\n\n===Executing===\n[[File:Executing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Executing process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\n'''While executing we must know what are the planned terms that need to be executed'''.\nThe execution/implementation phase ensures that the project management plan's deliverables are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper allocation, co-ordination and management of human resources and any other resources such as material and budgets. The output of this phase is the project deliverables.\n\n===Project Documentation===\n\nDocumenting everything within a project is key to being successful. To maintain budget, scope, effectiveness and pace a project must have physical documents pertaining to each specific task. With correct documentation, it is easy to see whether or not a project's requirement has been met. To go along with that, documentation provides information regarding what has already been completed for that project. Documentation throughout a project provides a paper trail for anyone who needs to go back and reference the work in the past. \nIn most cases, documentation is the most successful way to monitor and control the specific phases of a project.  With the correct documentation, a project's success can be tracked and observed as the project goes on. If performed correctly documentation can be the backbone to a project's success.\n\n===Monitoring and controlling===\n[[File:Monitoring and Controlling Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Monitoring and controlling process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]Monitoring and controlling consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner and corrective action can be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project. The key benefit is that project performance is observed and measured regularly to identify variances from the project management plan.\n\nMonitoring and controlling includes:<ref name=\"JPL00\">James P. Lewis (2000). ''The project manager's desk reference: : a comprehensive guide to project planning, scheduling, evaluation, and systems.'' p.185</ref>\n* Measuring the ongoing project activities ('where we are');\n* Monitoring the project variables (cost, effort, scope, etc.) against the project management plan and the project performance baseline (''where we should be'');\n* Identifying corrective actions to address issues and risks properly (''How can we get on track again'');\n* Influencing the factors that could circumvent integrated change control so only approved changes are implemented.\n\nIn multi-phase projects, the monitoring and control process also provides feedback between project phases, to implement corrective or preventive actions to bring the project into compliance with the project management plan.\n\nProject maintenance is an ongoing process, and it includes:<ref name=\"PMI 10\"/>\n* Continuing support of end-users\n* Correction of errors\n* Updates to the product over time\n[[File:Project Management (project control).png|thumb|240px|Monitoring and controlling cycle]]\nIn this stage, [[auditor]]s should pay attention to how effectively and quickly user problems are resolved.\n\nOver the course of any construction project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can be the result of necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents \u2013 usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, \"as built.\" The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid of an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industry's maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.\n\nWhen changes are introduced to the project, the viability of the project has to be re-assessed. It is important not to lose sight of the initial goals and targets of the projects. When the changes accumulate, the forecasted result may not justify the original proposed investment in the project. Successful project management identifies these components, and tracks and monitors progress so as to stay within time and budget frames already outlined at the commencement of the project.\n\n===Closing===\n[[File:Closing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|270px|Closing process group processes.<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\nClosing includes the formal acceptance of the project and the ending thereof.  Administrative activities include the archiving of the files and documenting lessons learned.\n\nThis phase consists of:<ref name=\"PMI 10\"/>\n* '''Contract closure''': Complete and settle each contract (including the resolution of any open items) and close each contract applicable to the project or project phase.\n* '''Project close''': Finalize all activities across all of the process groups to formally close the project or a project phase\n\nAlso included in this phase is the Post Implementation Review. This is a vital phase of the project for the project team to learn from experiences and apply to future projects. Normally a Post Implementation Review consists of looking at things that went well and analyzing things that went badly on the project to come up with lessons learned.\n\n===Project controlling and project control systems===\nProject controlling (also known as [[Cost engineering|Cost Engineering]])\nshould be established as an independent function in project management. It implements verification and controlling function during the processing of a project to reinforce the defined performance and formal goals.<ref>J\u00f6rg Becker, Martin Kugeler, Michael Rosemann (2003). Process management: a guide for the design of business processes. {{ISBN|978-3-540-43499-3}}. p.27.</ref> The tasks of project controlling are also: \n* the creation of infrastructure for the supply of the right information and its update\n* the establishment of a way to communicate disparities of project parameters\n* the development of project information technology based on an intranet or the determination of a project key performance indicator system (KPI)\n* divergence analyses and generation of proposals for potential project regulations<ref>Bernhard Schlagheck (2000). Objektorientierte Referenzmodelle f\u00fcr das Prozess- und Projektcontrolling. Grundlagen \u2013 Konstruktionen \u2013 Anwendungsm\u00f6glichkeiten. {{ISBN|978-3-8244-7162-1}}. p.131.</ref>\n* the establishment of methods to accomplish an appropriate project structure, project workflow organization, project control and governance\n* creation of transparency among the project parameters<ref>Josef E. Riedl (1990). Projekt \u2013 Controlling in Forschung und Entwicklung. {{ISBN|978-3-540-51963-8}}. p.99.</ref>\n\nFulfillment and implementation of these tasks can be achieved by applying specific methods and instruments of project controlling. The following methods of project controlling can be applied: \n \n* investment analysis\n* cost\u2013benefit analysis\n* value benefit analysis\n* expert surveys\n* simulation calculations\n* risk-profile analysis\n* surcharge calculations\n* [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]] trend analysis\n* cost trend analysis\n* target/actual-comparison<ref>Steinle, Bruch, Lawa (1995). Projektmanagement. FAZ Verlagsbereich Wirtschaftsb\u00fccher. p.136\u2013143</ref>\n\nProject control is that element of a project that keeps it on track, on-time and within budget.<ref name=\"JPL00\"/>  Project control begins early in the project with planning and ends late in the project with post-implementation review, having a thorough involvement of each step in the process.  Projects may be audited or reviewed while the project is in progress. Formal audits are generally risk or compliance-based and management will direct the objectives of the audit. An examination may include a comparison of approved project management processes with how the project is actually being managed.<ref>Cynthia Snyder, Frank Parth (2006). ''Introduction to IT Project Management.'' p.393-397</ref> Each project should be assessed for the appropriate level of control needed: too much control is too time-consuming, too little control is very risky.  If project control is not implemented correctly, the cost to the business should be clarified in terms of errors and fixes.\n\nControl systems are needed for cost, [[risk]], quality, communication, time, change, procurement, and human resources.  In addition, auditors should consider how important the projects are to the [[financial statement]]s, how reliant the stakeholders are on controls, and how many controls exist.  Auditors should review the development process and procedures for how they are implemented.  The process of development and the quality of the final product may also be assessed if needed or requested.  A business may want the auditing firm to be involved throughout the process to catch problems earlier on so that they can be fixed more easily.  An auditor can serve as a controls consultant as part of the development team or as an independent auditor as part of an audit.\n\nBusinesses sometimes use formal systems development processes.  These help assure systems are developed successfully.  A formal process is more effective in creating strong controls, and auditors should review this process to confirm that it is well designed and is followed in practice.  A good formal systems development plan outlines:\n* A [[strategy]] to align development with the organization's broader objectives\n* Standards for new systems\n* Project management policies for timing and [[budgeting]]\n* Procedures describing the process\n* Evaluation of quality of change\n\n==Characteristics of projects==\nThere are five important characteristics of a project. (i) It should always have a specific start and end dates. (ii) They are performed and completed by a group of people. (iii) The output is delivery on unique product or service. (iv) They are temporary in nature. (v) It is progressively elaborated. example: Designing a new car, writing a book.\n\n=== Project Complexity ===\nComplexity and its nature plays an important role in the area of project management. Despite having number of debates on this subject matter, studies suggest lack of definition and reasonable understanding of complexity in relation to management of complex projects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdou|first=Saed M|last2=Yong|first2=Kuan|last3=Othman|first3=Mohammed|date=2016|title=Project Complexity Influence on Project management performance \u2013 The Malaysian perspective|journal=MATEC Web of Conferences|language=en|volume=66|pages=00065|doi=10.1051/matecconf/20166600065|issn=2261-236X|url=http://www.matec-conferences.org/10.1051/matecconf/20166600065/pdf}}</ref> As it is considered that project complexity and project performance are closely related, it is important to define and measure complexity of the project for project management to be effective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ludovic\u2010Alexandre Vidal, Franck Marle|first=Vidal|date=2008|title=Understanding project complexity: implications on project management|journal=Kybernetes|volume= 37| issue =  8|pages=1094\u20131110|doi=10.1108/03684920810884928|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01215364/file/Vidal%20and%20Marle%20-%202008%20-%20Kybernetes%20-%20Understanding%20project%20complexity.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy applying the discovery in measuring work complexity described in [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] and Stratified Systems Theory, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr Elliott Jaques]] classifies projects and project work (stages, tasks) into basic 7 levels of project complexity based on such criteria as time-span of discretion and complexity of a project's output:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The management of projects|last=G.|first=Morris, Peter W.|date=1994|publisher=T.

Project managers are in charge of the people in a project. People are the key to any successful project. Without the correct people in the right place and at the right time a project cannot be successful. Project managers can have the responsibility of the planning, execution, controlling, and closing of any project typically relating to the [[construction industry]], engineering, architecture, [[computing]], and telecommunications. Many other fields of production engineering, design engineering, and heavy industrial have project managers.\n\nA project manager needs to understand the order of execution of a project to schedule the project correctly as well as the time necessary to accomplish each individual task within the project. A project manager is the person accountable for accomplishing the stated project objectives. Project Managers tend to have multiple years\u2019 experience in their field. A project manager is required to know the project in and out while supervising the workers along with the project. Typically in most construction, engineering, architecture and industrial projects, a project manager has another manager working alongside of them who is typically responsible for the execution of task on a daily basis. This position in some cases is known as a superintendent.  A superintendent and project manager work hand in hand in completing daily project task. Key project management responsibilities include creating clear and attainable project objectives, building the project requirements, and managing the [[Project management triangle|triple constraint]] (now including more constraints and calling it competing constraints) for projects, which is cost, time, and scope for the first three but about three additional ones in current project management. A typical project is composed of a team of workers who work under the project manager to complete the assignment. A project manager normally reports directly to someone of higher stature on the completion and success of the project.\n\nA project manager is often a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the firm they are representing. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the contracting party, and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized. If the project is following an iterative or agile methodology, the project manager may have the title of a Scrum Master.\n\n== Project management success criteria ==\nThere is a tendency to confuse the project success with project management success. They are two different things. Project management success criteria is different from project success criteria. The project management is said to be successful if the given project is completed within the agreed upon time, met the agreed upon scope and within the agreed upon budget. Meanwhile, a project is said to be successful, when it succeeds in achieving the expected business case.\n\n==Risk management==\n{{Main |Project risk management}}\n\n[[File: SimulTrain12RiskRegister.JPG|thumb| An example of the Risk Register that includes 4 steps: Identify, Analyze, Plan Response, Monitor and Control.<ref>[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management What Is Risk Management?]</ref>]]\n\nThe United States Department of Defense states; \"Cost, Schedule, Performance, and Risk\" are the four elements through which Department of Defense acquisition professionals make trade-offs and track program status.<ref>{{cite web|title=DoDD 5000.01|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500001p.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=20 November 2007}}</ref> There are also [[Project management#International standards|international standards]].  Risk management applies proactive identification (see [[Risk management tools|tools]]) of future problems and understanding of their consequences allowing [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] decisions about projects.\n\n===Work breakdown structure===\n{{Main |Work breakdown structure}}\nThe [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) is a [[tree structure]] that shows a subdivision of the activities required to achieve an objective&nbsp;\u2013 for example a program, project, and contract. The WBS may be hardware-, product-, service-, or [[Business process|process]]-oriented (see an example in a [[:Image:NASA NF 533 reporting structure.jpg|NASA reporting structure (2001)]]).<ref name=\"NASA01\">[http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_9501_002D_&page_name=Chp2&format=PDF NASA NPR 9501.2D]. May 23, 2001.</ref>\n\nA WBS can be developed by starting with the end objective and successively subdividing it into manageable components in terms of size, [[Duration (project management)|duration]], and responsibility (e.g., systems, subsystems, components, tasks, sub-tasks, and work packages), which include all steps necessary to achieve the objective.<ref name=\"Stellman05\"/>\n\nThe work breakdown structure provides a common framework for the natural development of the overall planning and control of a contract and is the basis for dividing work into definable increments from which the statement of work can be developed and technical, schedule, cost, and labor hour reporting can be established.<ref name=\"NASA01\"/>\nThe work breakdown structure can be displayed in two forms, as a table with subdivision of tasks or as an organisational chart whose lowest nodes are referred to as \"work packages\".\n\nIt is an essential element in assessing the quality of a plan, and an initial element used during the planning of the project. For example, a WBS is used when the project is scheduled, so that the use of work packages can be recorded and tracked.\n\n==International standards==\nThere are several project management standards, including:\n\n* The ISO standards [[ISO 9000]], a family of standards for quality management systems, and the [[ISO 10006]]:2003, for Quality management systems and guidelines for quality management in projects.\n*[[ISO 21500]]:2012 \u2013 ''Guidance on project management''.

The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints.<ref>Joseph Phillips (2003). ''PMP Project Management Professional Study Guide''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2003. {{ISBN|0-07-223062-2}} p.354.</ref> This information is usually described in project documentation, created at the beginning of the development process.

In many cases the objective of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief to feasibly address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established they should influence all decisions made by other people involved in the project&nbsp;\u2013 for example project managers, designers, contractors and sub-contractors. Ill-defined or too tightly prescribed project management objectives are detrimental to decision making.\n\nA [[project]] is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or staffing) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.<ref>''The Definitive Guide to Project Management''.

Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-36977-0}}. p. 96-101.</ref> Both Gantt and Fayol were students of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s theories of [[scientific management]]. His work is the forerunner to modern project management tools including [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) and [[resource allocation]].\n\nThe 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era where core engineering fields come together to work as one. Project management became recognized as a distinct discipline arising from the management discipline with engineering model.<ref name=\"ClGa06\">[[David I. Cleland]], Roland Gareis (2006). ''Global Project Management Handbook''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006. {{ISBN|0-07-146045-4}}. p.1-4 states: \"''It was in the 1950s when project management was formally recognized as a distinct contribution arising from the management discipline.''\"</ref> In the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad-hoc basis, using mostly [[Gantt chart]]s and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical [[Schedule (project management)|project-scheduling]] models were developed. The \"[[Critical Path Method|critical path method]]\" (CPM) was developed as a joint venture between [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] and [[Remington Rand|Remington Rand Corporation]] for managing plant maintenance projects. The \"[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|program evaluation and review technique]]\" (PERT), was developed by the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in conjunction with the [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] as part of the [[Polaris missile]] submarine program.<ref>[[Donald G. Malcolm|Malcolm, D. G.]], Roseboom, J. H., Clark, C. E., & [[Willard Fazar|Fazar, W.]] (1959). \"[http://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF/PM-History_PERT-Original_Paper.pdf Application of a technique for research and development program evaluation].\" ''Operations research,'' 7(5), 646-669.\n</ref>\n\nPERT and CPM are very similar in their approach but still present some differences. CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and [[PERT]] are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.\n[[File:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|240px|[[PERT|PERT network chart]] for a seven-month project with five milestones]]\n\nAt the same time, as project-scheduling models were being developed, technology for project cost [[Estimation (project management)|estimating]], cost management and engineering economics was evolving, with pioneering work by Hans Lang and others. In 1956, the American Association of Cost Engineers (now [[AACE International]]; the Association for the Advancement of [[Cost Engineering]]) was formed by early practitioners of project management and the associated specialties of planning and scheduling, cost estimating, and cost/schedule control (project control). AACE continued its pioneering work and in 2006 released the first integrated process for portfolio, program and project management ([[Total Cost Management|total cost management]] framework).\n\nIn 1969, the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) was formed in the USA.<ref>F. L. Harrison, Dennis Lock (2004). ''Advanced project management: a structured approach''. Gower Publishing, Ltd., 2004. {{ISBN|0-566-07822-8}}. p.34.</ref> PMI publishes ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]'' (PMBOK Guide), which describes project management practices that are common to \"most projects, most of the time.\" PMI also offers a range of certifications.\n\n==Project management types==\nProject management methods can be applied to any project. It is often tailored to a specific type of projects based on project size, nature and industry.  For example, the construction industry, which focuses on the delivery of things like buildings, roads, and bridges, has developed its own specialized form of project management that it refers to as ''construction project management'' and in which project managers can become trained and certified.<ref name=\"Contruction_Project_Management\">{{cite web|url=http://cmaanet.org/certified-construction-manager|title=Certified Construction Manager|publisher=CMAA|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref>  The information technology industry has also evolved to develop its own form of project management that is referred to as ''IT project management'' and which specializes in the delivery of technical assets and services that are required to pass through various lifecycle phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. ''Biotechnology project management'' focuses on the intricacies of biotechnology research and development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/biotechnology-project-management.html|title=Certificate in Biotechnology Project Management|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> ''Localization project management'' includes many standard project management practices even though many consider this type of management to be a very different discipline. It focuses on three important goals: time, quality and budget. Successful projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and according to previously agreed quality standards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Practical Guide to Localization|last=Esselink|first=Bert|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2000|isbn=978-9-027-21956-5|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|pages=428}}</ref>\n\nFor each type of project management, project managers develop and utilize repeatable templates that are specific to the industry they're dealing with.  This allows project plans to become very thorough and highly repeatable, with the specific intent to increase quality, lower delivery costs, and lower time to deliver project results.\n\n==Approaches of project management==\nA 2017 study suggested that the success of any project depends on how well four key aspects are aligned with the contextual dynamics affecting the project, these are referred to as the ''four P's'':<ref>Mesly, Olivier. (2017). ''Project feasibility \u2013 Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New\tYork, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press. 546 pages. {{ISBN|9 781498 757911}}.</ref>\n\n* ''Plan'': The planning and forecasting activities. \n* ''Process:'' The overall approach to all activities and project governance.\n* ''People:'' Including dynamics of how they collaborate and communicate.\n* ''Power:'' Lines of authority,  decision-makers, organograms, policies for implementation and the like.\n\nThere are a number of approaches to organizing and completing project activities, including: phased, lean, iterative, and incremental. There are also several extensions to project planning, for example based on outcomes (product-based) or activities (process-based).\n\nRegardless of the [[methodology]] employed, careful consideration must be given to the overall project objectives, timeline, and cost, as well as the roles and responsibilities of all participants and [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].<ref>Cf. The Bridger (blog), [http://www.thebridger.co.uk/project-management-pmp-prince-2-or-an-iterative-or-agile-variant/ \"Project management: PMP, Prince 2, or an Iterative or Agile variant\"]</ref>\n===Benefits realization management===\n{{Main|Benefits realisation management}}\nBenefits realization management (BRM) enhances normal project management techniques through a focus on outcomes (benefits) of a project rather than products or outputs, and then measuring the degree to which that is happening to keep a project on track.  This can help to reduce the risk of a completed project being a failure by delivering agreed upon requirements/outputs but failing to deliver the '''''benefits''''' of those requirements.\n\nIn addition, BRM practices aim to ensure the alignment between project outcomes and business strategies. The effectiveness of these practices is supported by recent research evidencing BRM practices influencing project success from a strategic perspective across different countries and industries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Serra|first1=C. E. M.|last2=Kunc|first2=M.|year=2014|title=Benefits Realisation Management and its influence on project success and on the execution of business strategies|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/60436/|journal=International Journal of Project Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=53\u201366|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.03.011}}</ref>\n\nAn example of delivering a project to requirements might be agreeing to deliver a computer system that will process staff data and manage payroll, holiday and staff personnel records. Under BRM the agreement might be to achieve a specified reduction in staff hours required to process and maintain staff data.\n\n===Critical chain project management===\n{{Main|Critical chain project management}}\nCritical chain project management (CCPM) is an application of the [[theory of constraints]] (TOC) to planning and managing projects, and is designed to deal with the uncertainties inherent in managing projects, while taking into consideration limited availability of [[Resource (project management)|resources]] (physical, human skills, as well as management & support capacity) needed to execute projects.\n\nThe goal is to increase the flow of projects in an organization ([[throughput]]). Applying the first three of the [[Theory of Constraints#The five focusing steps|five focusing steps]] of TOC, the system constraint for all projects, as well as the resources, are identified. To exploit the constraint, tasks on the critical chain are given priority over all other activities. Finally, projects are planned and managed to ensure that the resources are ready when the critical chain tasks must start, subordinating all other resources to the critical chain.\n\n=== Earned value management ===\n{{Main|Earned value management}}\n\n[[File:EarnedValueChartNormalized.jpg|thumb|Earned Value chart shows Planned Value, Earned Value, Actual Cost, and their variances in percent. The approach is used in project management simulation [[SimulTrain]].]]\n\nEarned value management (EVM) extends project management with techniques to improve project monitoring. It illustrates project progress towards completion in terms of work and value (cost). [[Earned Schedule]] is an extension to the theory and practice of EVM. This theory was introduced in 2019.\n<ref>{{cite journal|date=5\u20137 March 2019|title=Forecasting at completion: Introduction of new method and comparing it with the method of Earned Schedule|url=http://ieomsociety.org/ieom2019/papers/628.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Iterative and incremental project management===\n{{See also|Iterative and incremental development}}In critical studies of project management, it has been noted that phased approaches are not well suited for projects which are large-scale and multi-company,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.projecttimes.com/articles/managing-complex-projects-that-are-too-large-too-long-and-too-costly.html|title=Managing Complex Projects that are Too Large, Too Long and Too Costly|last=Hass|first=Kathleen B.

For example, when working on a [[brick-and-mortar]] design and construction, projects will typically progress through stages like pre-planning, conceptual design, schematic design, design development, construction drawings (or contract documents), and construction administration.\n\nWhile the phased approach works well for small, well-defined projects, it often results in challenge or failure on larger projects, or those that are more complex or have more ambiguities, issues and risk.<ref name=\"Stellman05\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/|title=Applied Software Project Management|last=Stellman|first=Andrew|last2=Greene|first2=Jennifer|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2005|isbn=978-0-596-00948-9|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209011617/http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/|archivedate=2015-02-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Process-based management===\n{{Main |Process-based management}}\nThe incorporation of process-based management has been driven by the use of maturity models such as the [[OPM3]] and the [[CMMI]] (capability maturity model integration; see [[:Image:Capability Maturity Model.jpg|this example]] of a predecessor) and [[ISO/IEC 15504]] (SPICE \u2013 software process improvement and capability estimation). Unlike SEI's CMM, the OPM3 maturity model describes how to make project management processes capable of performing successfully, consistently, and predictably to enact the strategies of an organization.\n\n=== Project production management ===\n{{Main |Project production management}}\nProject production management is the application of operations management to the delivery of capital projects. The Project production management framework is based on a project as a production system view, in which a project transforms inputs (raw materials, information, labor, plant & machinery) into outputs (goods and services).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern construction management|last=McCaffer|first=Ronald|last2=Harris|first2=Frank|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=978-1118510186|location=|page=5|oclc=834624541}}</ref>\n\n===Product-based planning===\n{{Main|Product-based planning}}\nProduct-based planning is a structured approach to project management, based on identifying all of the products (project [[deliverable]]s) that contribute to achieving the project objectives.

Regardless of the methodology or terminology used, the same basic project management processes or stages of development will be used. Major process groups generally include:<ref name=\"PMI 10\">[[Project Management Institute|PMI]] (2010). ''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' p.27-35</ref>\n* Initiation\n* Planning \n* Production or execution\n* Monitoring and controlling\n* Closing\n\nIn project environments with a significant exploratory element (e.g., [[research and development]]), these stages may be supplemented with decision points (go/no go decisions) at which the project's continuation is debated and decided. An example is the [[Phase\u2013gate model]].\n\n===Initiating===\n[[File:Initiating Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Initiating process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\nThe initiating processes determine the nature and scope of the project.<ref>Peter Nathan, Gerald Everett Jones (2003). ''PMP certification for dummies''. p.63.</ref> If this stage is not performed well, it is unlikely that the project will be successful in meeting the business\u2019 needs. The key project controls needed here are an understanding of the business environment and making sure that all necessary controls are incorporated into the project. Any deficiencies should be reported and a recommendation should be made to fix them.\n\nThe initiating stage should include a plan that encompasses the following areas. These areas can be recorded in a series of documents called Project Initiation documents.\nProject Initiation documents are a series of planned documents used to create order for the duration of the project. \nThese tend to include: \n\t\n[[File:RACIQ Chart - Responsibility Assignment Matrix.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|RACI(Q) chart. At least one ''Responsible'' and exactly one ''Accountable'' person are designated for each project and planning activity in project management simulation [[SimulTrain]].]]\n\n* project proposal (idea behind project, overall goal, duration) \n* [[Scope (project management)|project scope]] (project direction and track)\n* [[product breakdown structure]] (PBS) (a hierarchy of deliverables / outcomes and components thereof) \n* [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) (a hierarchy of the work to be done, down to daily tasks) \n* [[responsibility assignment matrix]] (RACI) (roles and responsibilities aligned to deliverables / outcomes) \n* tentative [[Project plan|project schedule]] (milestones, important dates, deadlines)\n* analysis of business needs and [[requirement]]s against measurable goals\n* review of the current [[business operations|operations]]\n* [[financial analysis]] of the costs and benefits, including a [[budget]]\n* [[stakeholder analysis]], including users and support personnel for the project\n* [[project charter]] including costs, tasks, deliverables, and schedules\n* [[SWOT analysis]]: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the business\n\n===Planning===\nAfter the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail (see [[:File:Planning Process Group Activities.jpg|example of a flow-chart]]).<ref name=\"VA03\"/> The main purpose is to plan time, cost and resources adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution. As with the Initiation process group, a failure to adequately plan greatly reduces the project's chances of successfully accomplishing its goals.\n\n[[Project planning]] generally consists of<ref>{{cite book  | author = Harold Kerzner | year = 2003 | title = Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling | url = https://archive.org/details/projectmanagemen0000kerz_h0w8 | url-access = registration | edition = 8th | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 0-471-22577-0| author-link = Harold Kerzner }}</ref>\n* determining the project management methodology to follow (e.g. whether the plan will be defined [[Waterfall model|wholly up front]], [[Iterative and incremental development|iteratively]], or in [[Rolling-wave planning|rolling waves]]);\n* developing the [[scope statement]];\n* selecting the planning team;\n* identifying deliverables and creating the product and work breakdown structures;\n* identifying the activities needed to complete those deliverables and networking the activities in their logical sequence;\n* estimating the resource requirements for the activities;\n* estimating time and cost for activities;\n* developing the schedule;\n* developing the budget;\n* risk planning;\n* developing quality assurance measures;\n* gaining formal approval to begin work.\n\nAdditional processes, such as planning for communications and for scope management, identifying roles and responsibilities, determining what to purchase for the project and holding a kick-off meeting are also generally advisable.\n\nFor [[new product development]] projects, conceptual design of the operation of the final product may be performed concurrent with the project planning activities, and may help to inform the planning team when identifying deliverables and planning activities.\n\n===Executing===\n[[File:Executing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Executing process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\n'''While executing we must know what are the planned terms that need to be executed'''.\nThe execution/implementation phase ensures that the project management plan's deliverables are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper allocation, co-ordination and management of human resources and any other resources such as material and budgets. The output of this phase is the project deliverables.\n\n===Project Documentation===\n\nDocumenting everything within a project is key to being successful. To maintain budget, scope, effectiveness and pace a project must have physical documents pertaining to each specific task. With correct documentation, it is easy to see whether or not a project's requirement has been met. To go along with that, documentation provides information regarding what has already been completed for that project. Documentation throughout a project provides a paper trail for anyone who needs to go back and reference the work in the past. \nIn most cases, documentation is the most successful way to monitor and control the specific phases of a project.  With the correct documentation, a project's success can be tracked and observed as the project goes on. If performed correctly documentation can be the backbone to a project's success.\n\n===Monitoring and controlling===\n[[File:Monitoring and Controlling Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Monitoring and controlling process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]Monitoring and controlling consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner and corrective action can be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project. The key benefit is that project performance is observed and measured regularly to identify variances from the project management plan.\n\nMonitoring and controlling includes:<ref name=\"JPL00\">James P. Lewis (2000). ''The project manager's desk reference: : a comprehensive guide to project planning, scheduling, evaluation, and systems.'' p.185</ref>\n* Measuring the ongoing project activities ('where we are');\n* Monitoring the project variables (cost, effort, scope, etc.) against the project management plan and the project performance baseline (''where we should be'');\n* Identifying corrective actions to address issues and risks properly (''How can we get on track again'');\n* Influencing the factors that could circumvent integrated change control so only approved changes are implemented.\n\nIn multi-phase projects, the monitoring and control process also provides feedback between project phases, to implement corrective or preventive actions to bring the project into compliance with the project management plan.\n\nProject maintenance is an ongoing process, and it includes:<ref name=\"PMI 10\"/>\n* Continuing support of end-users\n* Correction of errors\n* Updates to the product over time\n[[File:Project Management (project control).png|thumb|240px|Monitoring and controlling cycle]]\nIn this stage, [[auditor]]s should pay attention to how effectively and quickly user problems are resolved.\n\nOver the course of any construction project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can be the result of necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents \u2013 usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, \"as built.\" The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid of an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industry's maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.\n\nWhen changes are introduced to the project, the viability of the project has to be re-assessed. It is important not to lose sight of the initial goals and targets of the projects. When the changes accumulate, the forecasted result may not justify the original proposed investment in the project. Successful project management identifies these components, and tracks and monitors progress so as to stay within time and budget frames already outlined at the commencement of the project.\n\n===Closing===\n[[File:Closing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|270px|Closing process group processes.<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\nClosing includes the formal acceptance of the project and the ending thereof.  Administrative activities include the archiving of the files and documenting lessons learned.\n\nThis phase consists of:<ref name=\"PMI 10\"/>\n* '''Contract closure''': Complete and settle each contract (including the resolution of any open items) and close each contract applicable to the project or project phase.\n* '''Project close''': Finalize all activities across all of the process groups to formally close the project or a project phase\n\nAlso included in this phase is the Post Implementation Review. This is a vital phase of the project for the project team to learn from experiences and apply to future projects. Normally a Post Implementation Review consists of looking at things that went well and analyzing things that went badly on the project to come up with lessons learned.\n\n===Project controlling and project control systems===\nProject controlling (also known as [[Cost engineering|Cost Engineering]])\nshould be established as an independent function in project management. It implements verification and controlling function during the processing of a project to reinforce the defined performance and formal goals.<ref>J\u00f6rg Becker, Martin Kugeler, Michael Rosemann (2003). Process management: a guide for the design of business processes. {{ISBN|978-3-540-43499-3}}. p.27.</ref> The tasks of project controlling are also: \n* the creation of infrastructure for the supply of the right information and its update\n* the establishment of a way to communicate disparities of project parameters\n* the development of project information technology based on an intranet or the determination of a project key performance indicator system (KPI)\n* divergence analyses and generation of proposals for potential project regulations<ref>Bernhard Schlagheck (2000). Objektorientierte Referenzmodelle f\u00fcr das Prozess- und Projektcontrolling.

Riedl (1990). Projekt \u2013 Controlling in Forschung und Entwicklung. {{ISBN|978-3-540-51963-8}}. p.99.</ref>\n\nFulfillment and implementation of these tasks can be achieved by applying specific methods and instruments of project controlling. The following methods of project controlling can be applied: \n \n* investment analysis\n* cost\u2013benefit analysis\n* value benefit analysis\n* expert surveys\n* simulation calculations\n* risk-profile analysis\n* surcharge calculations\n* [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]] trend analysis\n* cost trend analysis\n* target/actual-comparison<ref>Steinle, Bruch, Lawa (1995). Projektmanagement. FAZ Verlagsbereich Wirtschaftsb\u00fccher. p.136\u2013143</ref>\n\nProject control is that element of a project that keeps it on track, on-time and within budget.<ref name=\"JPL00\"/>  Project control begins early in the project with planning and ends late in the project with post-implementation review, having a thorough involvement of each step in the process.  Projects may be audited or reviewed while the project is in progress. Formal audits are generally risk or compliance-based and management will direct the objectives of the audit. An examination may include a comparison of approved project management processes with how the project is actually being managed.<ref>Cynthia Snyder, Frank Parth (2006). ''Introduction to IT Project Management.'' p.393-397</ref> Each project should be assessed for the appropriate level of control needed: too much control is too time-consuming, too little control is very risky.  If project control is not implemented correctly, the cost to the business should be clarified in terms of errors and fixes.\n\nControl systems are needed for cost, [[risk]], quality, communication, time, change, procurement, and human resources.  In addition, auditors should consider how important the projects are to the [[financial statement]]s, how reliant the stakeholders are on controls, and how many controls exist.  Auditors should review the development process and procedures for how they are implemented.  The process of development and the quality of the final product may also be assessed if needed or requested.  A business may want the auditing firm to be involved throughout the process to catch problems earlier on so that they can be fixed more easily.  An auditor can serve as a controls consultant as part of the development team or as an independent auditor as part of an audit.\n\nBusinesses sometimes use formal systems development processes.  These help assure systems are developed successfully.  A formal process is more effective in creating strong controls, and auditors should review this process to confirm that it is well designed and is followed in practice.  A good formal systems development plan outlines:\n* A [[strategy]] to align development with the organization's broader objectives\n* Standards for new systems\n* Project management policies for timing and [[budgeting]]\n* Procedures describing the process\n* Evaluation of quality of change\n\n==Characteristics of projects==\nThere are five important characteristics of a project. (i) It should always have a specific start and end dates. (ii) They are performed and completed by a group of people. (iii) The output is delivery on unique product or service. (iv) They are temporary in nature. (v) It is progressively elaborated. example: Designing a new car, writing a book.\n\n=== Project Complexity ===\nComplexity and its nature plays an important role in the area of project management. Despite having number of debates on this subject matter, studies suggest lack of definition and reasonable understanding of complexity in relation to management of complex projects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdou|first=Saed M|last2=Yong|first2=Kuan|last3=Othman|first3=Mohammed|date=2016|title=Project Complexity Influence on Project management performance \u2013 The Malaysian perspective|journal=MATEC Web of Conferences|language=en|volume=66|pages=00065|doi=10.1051/matecconf/20166600065|issn=2261-236X|url=http://www.matec-conferences.org/10.1051/matecconf/20166600065/pdf}}</ref> As it is considered that project complexity and project performance are closely related, it is important to define and measure complexity of the project for project management to be effective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ludovic\u2010Alexandre Vidal, Franck Marle|first=Vidal|date=2008|title=Understanding project complexity: implications on project management|journal=Kybernetes|volume= 37| issue =  8|pages=1094\u20131110|doi=10.1108/03684920810884928|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01215364/file/Vidal%20and%20Marle%20-%202008%20-%20Kybernetes%20-%20Understanding%20project%20complexity.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy applying the discovery in measuring work complexity described in [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] and Stratified Systems Theory, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr Elliott Jaques]] classifies projects and project work (stages, tasks) into basic 7 levels of project complexity based on such criteria as time-span of discretion and complexity of a project's output:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The management of projects|last=G.|first=Morris, Peter W.|date=1994|publisher=T.

Project managers are in charge of the people in a project. People are the key to any successful project. Without the correct people in the right place and at the right time a project cannot be successful. Project managers can have the responsibility of the planning, execution, controlling, and closing of any project typically relating to the [[construction industry]], engineering, architecture, [[computing]], and telecommunications. Many other fields of production engineering, design engineering, and heavy industrial have project managers.\n\nA project manager needs to understand the order of execution of a project to schedule the project correctly as well as the time necessary to accomplish each individual task within the project. A project manager is the person accountable for accomplishing the stated project objectives. Project Managers tend to have multiple years\u2019 experience in their field. A project manager is required to know the project in and out while supervising the workers along with the project. Typically in most construction, engineering, architecture and industrial projects, a project manager has another manager working alongside of them who is typically responsible for the execution of task on a daily basis. This position in some cases is known as a superintendent.  A superintendent and project manager work hand in hand in completing daily project task. Key project management responsibilities include creating clear and attainable project objectives, building the project requirements, and managing the [[Project management triangle|triple constraint]] (now including more constraints and calling it competing constraints) for projects, which is cost, time, and scope for the first three but about three additional ones in current project management. A typical project is composed of a team of workers who work under the project manager to complete the assignment. A project manager normally reports directly to someone of higher stature on the completion and success of the project.\n\nA project manager is often a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the firm they are representing. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the contracting party, and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized.\n\n== Project management success criteria ==\nThere is a tendency to confuse the project success with project management success. They are two different things. Project management success criteria is different from project success criteria. The project management is said to be successful if the given project is completed within the agreed upon time, met the agreed upon scope and within the agreed upon budget. Meanwhile, a project is said to be successful, when it succeeds in achieving the expected business case.\n\n==Risk management==\n{{Main |Project risk management}}\n\n[[File: SimulTrain12RiskRegister.JPG|thumb| An example of the Risk Register that includes 4 steps: Identify, Analyze, Plan Response, Monitor and Control.<ref>[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management What Is Risk Management?]</ref>]]\n\nThe United States Department of Defense states; \"Cost, Schedule, Performance, and Risk\" are the four elements through which Department of Defense acquisition professionals make trade-offs and track program status.<ref>{{cite web|title=DoDD 5000.01|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500001p.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=20 November 2007}}</ref> There are also [[Project management#International standards|international standards]].  Risk management applies proactive identification (see [[Risk management tools|tools]]) of future problems and understanding of their consequences allowing [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] decisions about projects.\n\n===Work breakdown structure===\n{{Main |Work breakdown structure}}\nThe [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) is a [[tree structure]] that shows a subdivision of the activities required to achieve an objective&nbsp;\u2013 for example a program, project, and contract. The WBS may be hardware-, product-, service-, or [[Business process|process]]-oriented (see an example in a [[:Image:NASA NF 533 reporting structure.jpg|NASA reporting structure (2001)]]).<ref name=\"NASA01\">[http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_9501_002D_&page_name=Chp2&format=PDF NASA NPR 9501.2D]. May 23, 2001.</ref>\n\nA WBS can be developed by starting with the end objective and successively subdividing it into manageable components in terms of size, [[Duration (project management)|duration]], and responsibility (e.g., systems, subsystems, components, tasks, sub-tasks, and work packages), which include all steps necessary to achieve the objective.<ref name=\"Stellman05\"/>\n\nThe work breakdown structure provides a common framework for the natural development of the overall planning and control of a contract and is the basis for dividing work into definable increments from which the statement of work can be developed and technical, schedule, cost, and labor hour reporting can be established.<ref name=\"NASA01\"/>\nThe work breakdown structure can be displayed in two forms, as a table with subdivision of tasks or as an organisational chart whose lowest nodes are referred to as \"work packages\".\n\nIt is an essential element in assessing the quality of a plan, and an initial element used during the planning of the project. For example, a WBS is used when the project is scheduled, so that the use of work packages can be recorded and tracked.\n\n==International standards==\nThere are several project management standards, including:\n\n* The ISO standards [[ISO 9000]], a family of standards for quality management systems, and the [[ISO 10006]]:2003, for Quality management systems and guidelines for quality management in projects.\n*[[ISO 21500]]:2012 \u2013 ''Guidance on project management''.

Created in 1942 by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[Marc Swayze]], the team was created as an extension of Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] franchise, and included Marvel's sister [[Mary Marvel]], their friend [[Captain Marvel Jr.]], and, at various times, a number of other characters as well.\n\nBecause [[Marvel Comics]] trademarked their own [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] comic book during the interim between the demise of the Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel comics in 1953 and DC's revival in 1972, DC Comics is today unable to promote and market their Captain Marvel/Marvel Family properties under those names. Since 1972, DC has instead used the trademark ''Shazam!'' for their comic book titles with the Marvel Family characters, and the name under which they market and promote the characters. When referring to the Marvel Family on comic book covers or various merchandise, they are by this legal necessity called the \"Shazam Family\".\n\nIn 2012, DC officially changed Captain Marvel's name to ''Shazam'', making ''Shazam Family'' the name of the superhero's associates. In current continuity, the Shazam Family comprises the superpowered alter egos of Billy Batson (teenaged alter-ego of Shazam/Captain Marvel) and his foster siblings: Mary Bromfield (formerly Mary Marvel), Freddy Freeman (formerly Captain Marvel Jr.), Darla Dudley, Pedro Pe\u00f1a, and Eugene Choi.\n\nThe Shazam Family make their cinematic debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film [[Shazam! (film)|''Shazam!'']], released in 2019 by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Warner Bros.]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Marvel Family was established in 1942 after the introductions of Captain Marvel's partners, the [[Lieutenant Marvels]] (''Whiz Comics'' #21, September 1941), [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] (''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #25, December 1941) and [[Mary Marvel]] (''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18, December 1942). With Junior and Mary's additions to his adventures, Captain Marvel became the first superhero to have a team of sidekicks who share his powers, abilities, and appearance; a concept later adapted for heroes such as [[Superman]] and [[Aquaman]], among others.\n\nThe members of the Marvel Family appeared both separately and together in many of Fawcett's comic book series, including ''Whiz Comics'', ''Wow Comics'', ''Master Comics'', ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', ''Captain Marvel Jr.'', ''Mary Marvel'', and ''The Marvel Family''. By the late 1940s, Marvel Family comics were among the most popular in the industry, and the Marvel Family had expanded to include both non-superpowered characters ([[Uncle Marvel]] and Freckles Marvel) and even [[funny animal]]s ([[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]]). By 1953, all of these books had ceased publication, due to Superman publisher [[DC Comics]]' [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|lawsuit against Fawcett]].\n\nIn 1972, DC licensed the rights to the Marvel Family characters, and began publishing them in a comic series titled ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]''. Fawcett sold DC the rights to the characters in 1980, by which time ''Shazam!'' had been cancelled, and the Marvels had been relegated the back-up feature of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', and, later, ''[[Adventure Comics]]''. DC [[retcon]]ned Captain Marvel in 1986 with their ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries, establishing him as a solo hero without a team. Writer/artist [[Jerry Ordway]] resurrected the Marvel Family in 1995 with his ''[[Power of Shazam!]]'' series, establishing the team as being made up solely of Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. Following several attempts at relaunching the ''Shazam!'' franchise during the mid-2000s, the Marvel Family was temporarily dissolved by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and Jerry Ordway in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (third series) #25, with only Captain Marvel Jr., now known as ''Shazam'', retaining his powers, but from another source. In the interim, Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel continued to appear in ''[[Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!]]'', an all-ages comic book series published under DC's youth-oriented [[Johnny DC]] line which ran from 2008 to 2010. Captain Marvel Jr. joined the pair towards the end of the run of ''Magic of Shazam!'', following a brief period serving as the sidekick of the Marvels' enemy under the name ''[[Black Adam]] Jr.''\n\nThe Shazam Family was reintroduced during DC Comics' continuity-altering ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries in 2011, as six kids who all spoke \"Shazam!\" in unison to become one superhero, Captain Thunder. In the later company-wide \"[[New 52]]\" reboot that followed ''Flashpoint'', the Captain Marvel character was renamed \"Shazam\" and starred in a backup segment of the ''Justice League'' series (second volume) from 2012 to 2013. These backups, by writer Geoff Johns and artist [[Gary Frank]], introduced Billy Batson/Shazam and his new Shazam Family, consisting of Billy and his five foster siblings, with whom he shares his powers.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Marvel/Shazam Family members==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 250\n | image1 = Shazam Family 2013 Gary Frank.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Black Adam]] confronts the newly created Shazam Family (l to r: Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, Pedro Pe\u00f1a, [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]), as seen in ''[[Justice League]]'' (vol. 2) #21 (August 2013).

Outside of the Marvel Family, Captain Marvel served briefly as a member of both the [[Justice League International]] and the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nAfter the 2011 [[New 52]] reboot of the ''Shazam!'' characters by Geoff Johns & Gary Frank, Billy Batson is a troubled foster child who has inherited the name, powers, and seat on the council of magic of the wizard Shazam. Becoming a hero inspired the initially brash and standoffish Billy to evolve into a noble hero and leader who embraces his new foster family. As ''Shazam'', Billy has powers and a red-uniformed appearance similar to the traditional version of Captain Marvel with the added ability to wield magic via the \"living lightning\" that powers him.\n\n====Mary Bromfield (Mary Marvel/Lady Shazam)====\n{{seealso|Mary Marvel}}\nIn traditional ''Shazam!'' stories, Mary is Billy's once-lost twin sister Mary Batson (adopted as Mary Bromfield), who found she could say the magic word \"Shazam!\" and become a Marvel as well. The Golden Age Mary Marvel remained a teenager in superhero form, while the modern version is transformed into an adult like her brother. The Golden Age Mary Marvel had a different set of patrons from Captain Marvel who contributed to her powers. They were [[Selene]] (grace), [[Hippolyte]] (strength), [[Ariadne]] (skill), [[Zephyrus]] (swiftness), [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] (beauty) and [[Minerva]] (wisdom).\n\nDuring the 2007 and 2008 limited series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' and ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Mary Marvel lost her powers and gained the powers of Marvel Family foe [[Black Adam]]. She temporarily became a villain working for [[Darkseid]] and possessed by the [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|New God]] [[Desaad]].\n\nIn current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Mary Bromfield is Billy Batson's foster sister, having run away from an abusive home at a young age and being placed in the V\u00e1zquez home. The oldest of the Shazam kids, Mary acts as the \"den mother\" and conscience of the group. She shares Billy's secret, and by saying \"Shazam!\" she can gain a superpowered form similar to the traditional Mary Marvel in a red uniform.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\">''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #1 (February 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics</ref>\n\n====Freddy Freeman (Captain Marvel Jr./Shazam Jr.)====\n{{seealso|Captain Marvel Jr.}}\nIn both the Golden Age and 1990s versions of the Marvel Family, Billy's friend and classmate, Freddy Freeman, was attacked and left disabled by the supervillain [[Captain Nazi]], and was given the power to become a Marvel to save his life. Whenever he spoke Captain Marvel's name, Freddy becomes a teenage version of Captain Marvel. This created the odd problem that he could not identify himself without changing back to his regular form.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, the Freddy character went by the alias ''CM3'' (short for \"Captain Marvel Three\", \"CM1\" being Billy and \"CM2\" being Mary) so that he could identify himself without transforming. He was a member of the [[Teen Titans]] during the late 1990s and later, the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] in the early 2000s. The 2006\u20132008 ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Trials of Shazam!]]'' mini-series featured Freddy gaining the powers of Captain Marvel as ''Shazam'', while Billy took over for the dead wizard Shazam as ''Marvel''.\n\nIn current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Freddy Freeman (now a blond teenager instead of the traditional black-haired youth, though still physically disabled) is Billy Batson's foster brother, a smart-mouthed pickpocket and trickster whose parents are in prison. He shares Billy's secret and by saying \"Shazam!\" can gain a form similar to an adult version of the traditional Captain Marvel, Jr., in a blue uniform.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" />\n\n====Eugene Choi====\nEugene Choi is Billy Batson's foster brother, an intelligent, bookish teenager about his age of Asian descent with a love of technology and video games. Eugene's bookishness is offset by a competitive and impulsive nature that causes trouble for him and the others at times.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #4 (May 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics</ref> Introduced in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries, Eugene can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam!\" and become an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a silver/gray uniform.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" /> In addition to the standard Shazam power-set, Eugene has the additional power of [[technopathy]], which allows him to talk to and control machines and technology.\n\n====Pedro Pe\u00f1a====\nPedro Pe\u00f1a is Billy Batson's foster brother, an overweight teenager of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent who is around Billy's age. Introduced in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries, Pedro can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam!\" and becoming an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a green uniform.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" /> Pedro's adult form, resembling a tall, bearded [[powerlifter]], is a stark contrast to his personal insecurity and shyness.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #5 (June 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics</ref> While the comics have yet to make any such distinction, the 2019 live-action feature film ''[[Shazam!

Despite her hardships growing up, Darla is very openly affectionate and loving towards her foster family and virtually anyone she meets. Introduced in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries (as a teenager the same age as the other kids), Darla can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam!\"<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" /> She wears a purple uniform, and her speed abilities are amplified, making her faster than the others. She is also unable to keep secrets, which proved rather difficult to overcome.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" />\n\n====C.C. Batson====\nClarence Charles \"C.C.\" Batson (named after Captain Marvel co-creator [[C.C. Beck|Charles Clarence \"C.C.\" Beck]]) is the biological father of Billy Batson. Billy's biological parents had been alluded to in a handful of ''Shazam!'' stories published prior to 1990 under different names. The 1994 graphic novel ''The Power of Shazam!'' by [[Jerry Ordway]] introduces C.C. and his wife, Billy's mother Marilyn, and how their deaths in that [[Post-Crisis]] continuity at the hands of Theo Adam (alter-ego of Black Adam) led to Billy gaining his powers. Much emphasis is made of Captain Marvel/Shazam's almost-identical appearance to the deceased C.C. Batson.<ref>Ordway, Jerry (1994). ''The Power of Shazam!'' New York: DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn current ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' continuity, C.C. Batson is still alive, resembling an older Captain Marvel/Shazam with greying hair. As a younger man, C.C. had abandoned Marilyn and Billy when Billy was a toddler. After spending a decade in prison, C.C. returns to Philadelphia to find Billy at the Vazquezes' foster home. C.C. is attacked by Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Sins, leading Billy to share his powers with his father to save his life,<ref>''Shazam!''

Batson wears a yellow/gold costume with red trim (an inverse of the colors of Billy's costume).<ref name=\"CCGetsPowersShazV3No9\" /> It is revealed that C.C. Batson had been possessed by [[#Mister_Mind_and_the_Monster_Society_of_Evil|Mister Mind]] the entire time, who intends to uses the Shazam powers in a plot to unite the Magiclands under his rule, with the help of the Monster Society of Evil.<ref name=\"Shazam #11\">''Shazam!''

Burbank, CA: DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Past members===\n* '''The [[Lieutenant Marvels]]''': three other boys named \"Billy Batson\" (nicknamed \"Tall Billy\", \"Fat Billy\" and \"Hill Billy\" \u2014 the latter because he was from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] \u2014 to differentiate themselves from \"Real Billy\", Captain Marvel) who learned that, because they also were named Billy Batson, they could draw on the power of Shazam. They vowed only to use their power if asked by Captain Marvel, and only if all three were to say the magic word, \"SHAZAM!\" in unison. They did not appear in Marvel Family stories between ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985 and ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' in 2011, except for a scene in ''The Trials of Shazam!'' #2 where they briefly appeared, only to lose their powers. Following DC's 2011 [[New 52]] reboot, the Lieutenant Marvels appear as non-superpowered allies of the Marvel Family in the 2015 one-shot comic ''[[The Multiversity#Thunderworld Adventures: Captain Marvel and the Day That Never Was|The Multiversity: Thunderworld]]'', where they, Mister Tawny, and Uncle Marvel help defeat the Monster Society of Evil while Captain Marvel is fighting Doctor Sivana for control of the Rock of Eternity.\n* '''[[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]]''': a spin-off character generally confined to his own series, the pink [[funny animal]] [[rabbit]] version of Captain Marvel periodically assisted the human Marvels in their adventures.\n\n===Other members===\nThese members of the Marvel Family appear in stories set in the future.\n\n* '''Thunder''': The star of ''The Power of Shazam!'' 1996 Annual, Thunder is the super-powered alter-ego of a young girl from the planet Binderaan, circa 9,000 A.D., named CeCe Beck (or Beck for short). An aged Captain Marvel serves as the girl's mentor the same way Shazam served as his mentor. Whenever Beck speaks the magic words \"Captain Marvel\", she is transformed into Thunder, an adult super-heroine. After being lost in the timestream, Thunder briefly teamed up with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th century. The names \"CeCe Beck\" and \"Binderaan\" are tributes to Marvel Family creators C.C. Beck and Otto Binder.\n* '''Tanist''': A teenaged male Marvel who appeared in ''The Power of Shazam!'' #1,000,000 (November 1998, part of the [[DC One Million]] event). After his mother is killed, Tanist, a disabled resident of Mercury in the 853rd century, meets the aged Captain Marvel in the Rock of Eternity. Marvel grants the boy superpowers to save his life as he had done for Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Black Marvel Family members===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sobek]] -->\n{{Infobox comics organization <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=Blackmarvelfamily.PNG\n|imagesize=200\n|caption=[[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], [[Black Adam]], and [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], from ''[[Countdown (comics)|Countdown]]'' #41 (July 18, 2007).

Adam eventually grew to abuse his power, and became a tyrant. Shazam returned to punish Adam with either exile into deep space (in the original Fawcett Comics) or death (in the modern DC Comics). He returns to Earth (or life) after Shazam appoints Captain Marvel his new successor, and was soon established as Captain Marvel's most powerful foe in physical abilities. In later DC continuity, Black Adam joined the [[Justice Society of America]], claiming to have reformed, later turning on the Justice Society by using some of its younger associates to help him overthrow the government of his home country [[Khandaq]].\n\nAdam was one of the main characters in DC's ''52'' weekly maxi-series, which followed his attempts to establish himself as a hero, which led him to create a \"Marvel Family\" of his own, which included his superpowered wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]] and his own \"Captain Marvel Jr.\", [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]].\n\nIn the current \"New 52\" continuity, Black Adam was a former Khandaqi slave in ancient times who was granted the power of Shazam along with his young nephew, whom he kills for not sharing his taste for vengeance against their enemies. Adam kills the members of Earth's Council of Wizards save for the wizard Shazam, who imprisoned him and hid magic until Adam was freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times.\n\n====Isis====\n{{seealso|Isis (DC Comics)}}\nThe superheroine Isis was originally created for live-action television to star in [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' TV show, a sister series for Filmation's adaptation of ''[[Shazam! (television)|Shazam!]]''. Isis teamed up with Captain Marvel on occasion in both television and comics, and briefly starred in a licensed DC comic book in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 2006, DC Comics created a new, unrelated Isis and introduced her into the DC Universe. This Isis is the alter-ego of Adrianna Tomaz, originally a slave from Egypt offered to Black Adam by the terrorist group [[Intergang]] as a token to curry his favor. Although Adam dealt harshly with the slavers and kills one of them, Adrianna becomes Adam's love interest and made him a more merciful figure, and was granted a special amulet that allowed her to become the avatar of the Egyptian goddess. Adam married Isis, but her death at the hands of the Four Horsemen of [[Apokolips]] drove him to [[World War III (DC Comics)|a fit of mass murder]]. At the end of the ''Black Adam: The Dark Age'' mini-series in 2007, Isis was resurrected by [[Felix Faust]]. However, the ordeal of her death, and many months spent as a brainwashed slave, routinely [[rape|abused]] by Faust, left her much colder and ruthless than before, making her even less merciful than her husband. In current \"New 52\" continuity, Adrianna Tomaz is a peaceful freedom fighter who helps her brother Amon resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam.<ref name=\"JLA 23.4\">''Justice League of America #23.4: Black Adam'' (2013)</ref>\n\n====Osiris====\n{{seealso|Osiris (DC Comics)}}\nThe teenaged Osiris is Amon Tomaz, Adrianna's long-lost brother who was kidnapped, enslaved, and crippled by [[Intergang]]. Adam shared his powers with Amon, allowing him to transform into the superpowered Osiris by saying the name \"Black Adam\". Osiris was murdered by his trusted companion, Sobek the talking crocodile, revealed to be Famine, one of the Four Horsemen. During the 2009-2010 crossover event ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Osiris was resurrected alongside other heroes, and was later resurrected as a White Lantern, for the purpose of releasing Isis, for which he joins the new [[Teen Titans (comics)|Titans]]. In current \"New 52\" continuity, Amon Tomaz is a rebellious freedom fighter who helps resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam.<ref name=\"JLA 23.4\" />\n\n====Sobek====\n{{seealso|Sobek (comics)}}\nSobek is an intelligent humanoid crocodile, created and abandoned by the Sivana Family, who befriends the Black Marvel family during the ''52'' maxi-series after escaping from his cage at the Sivana compound. Despite his monstrous appearance, the character is portrayed as timid, meek, and good-natured, making him the Black Marvel Family's analogue to [[Tawky Tawny]]. Sobek reveals a more horrifying side in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 43, when he convinced a distraught Osiris to change into his mortal form, then suddenly killed and devoured him. Sobek was revealed in Week 44 to be the Fourth Horseman, Famine. He appeared to have been killed by Black Adam both in self-defense and revenge, but reappears in the ''52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen'' mini-series.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Marvel Family allies==\n[[Image: Whiz-comics-issue-59.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The cover of ''Whiz Comics'' #59 (Oct. 1944), featuring most of the Golden Age Marvel Family and supporting cast.

Beck and Pete Costanza.]]\n\n===Introduced during the Golden Age (1939-1953)===\n* '''[[Shazam (wizard)|The Wizard Shazam]]''' - Although he is killed as prophesied after giving Billy the power to become Captain Marvel, Shazam's spirit remains as the vigilant caretaker of the Rock of Eternity. His power level varies in different stories from high-level magician to godlike. In the 1990s-2000s continuity, Shazam does not die after granting Billy his powers, and was a much more active character than he was during the Golden Age Marvel Family adventures. In current continuity, Shazam - known to most as only \"The Wizard,\" whose true name is Mamaragan - was one of the first humans on Earth to wield magic in ancient times, and becomes the head chair of the Council of Eternity. After the betrayal of Black Adam, Shazam's compatriots on the Council are murdered, and as the remaining member, he imprisons Adam and hides magic from the world. When Adam is freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times, Shazam drafts Billy Batson as his successor.\n* '''Mr. Sterling Morris''' - The president of Amalgamated Broadcasting, owners of Station WHIZ, the radio (and later TV) station for which Billy Batson works. He debuts in the very first Captain Marvel story in ''Whiz Comics'' #2.\n* '''Beautia and Magnificus Sivana''' - Dr. Sivana's beautiful adult daughter Beautia shared her father's passion for world domination until meeting, and falling for, Captain Marvel. She has an unrequited crush on the shy Captain, not realizing that he is actually only a young boy. Beautia first appeared in ''Whiz Comics'' #3b in 1940.<ref>Because of a numbering error at Fawcett Publications, there are two issues of ''Whiz Comics'' assigned the number 3.</ref> Most Golden Age Marvel Family stories feature Beautia as Dr. Sivana's unwitting assistant, who betrays her father to assist the heroes. Her older brother, Magnificus, is also generally depicted as a Marvel Family ally, although in his only Golden Age appearance (''Whiz Comics'' #15, 1941), Magnificus was super-strong and fought Captain Marvel hand-to-hand at his father's request.\n* '''\"Muscles\" McGinnis''' - The antagonist of a story included in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #3 (1941), the toughest gangster of the city possessing enormous strength. \"Muscles\" McGinnis promises to go straight after being defeated by Captain Marvel when he tries to take over Station WHIZ, as he feels the side opposing crime is much stronger. The character was reintroduced as a recurring character in the ''Power of Shazam!'' series of the 1990s, in which \"Muscles\" had indeed reformed to become an [[undercover]] cop and a frequent ally of Captain Marvel.\n*'''[[Steamboat (comics)|Steamboat]]''' - In the 1940s Fawcett stories, Steamboat is Billy Batson's African-American valet. Depicted as cowardly and subservient, Steamboat accompanied Billy and Captain Marvel on many of their adventures following his first appearance in ''America's Greatest Comics'' #3 in 1941. Drawn in a racially stereotyped manner and speaking with a stereotypical [[Negro dialect]], Steamboat was retired from the Captain Marvel stories after the Youth Builders, a diverse group of New York City and Philadelphia area students, protested the use of the character in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-467/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #467 |date=2014-04-18 |website=CBR |language=en-US |access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n* '''Cissie Sommerly''' - Billy Batson's girlfriend and Sterling Morris' niece. She first appears in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #12 (1942).\n* '''[[Uncle Marvel|Uncle Marvel (Uncle Dudley)]]''' - During the Golden Age, an old man named Dudley claimed that he was not only a relative of the Marvels but also a Marvel himself, although neither was true. Regardless, the Marvels took a liking to him and decided to humor his pretense, and \"Uncle\" Dudley became Uncle Marvel, the Marvel Family's manager. He would make his \"transformation\" along with one or more of the others, but not by magic; rather, by quickly removing his break-away garments (under the cover of lightning that the real Marvel(s) called down) to reveal his homemade Marvel costume underneath. He explained his lack of superpowers by claiming he suffered from \"[[Low back pain|shazambago]]\". Dudley first appeared in ''Wow Comics'' #18 in 1943. In the 1990s ''The Power of Shazam!'' comics, Dudley H. Dudley is simply a [[janitor]] at Billy's school who finds himself involved in the Marvel Family's adventures, although in one story (''The Power of Shazam!'' #11, 1996) he was temporarily given superpowers by Shazam's ally [[Ibis the Invincible]] to help round up the escaped [[Seven Deadly Sins#Film, television, comic books and video games|Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].<ref>''Power of Shazam!'' #11 (1996)</ref>\n* '''Freckles Marvel (Mary Dudley)''' - Uncle Dudley's adopted niece, who was an irregular companion of Mary Marvel's in her Golden Age solo adventures. First appearing in ''Wow Comics'' #35 (1945), Freckles Marvel had no superpowers of her own, but wore her own Mary Marvel costume to help her super-powered friend fight crime.\n* '''[[Tawky Tawny|Mister Tawky Tawny]]''' - A humanoid sapient [[tiger]] who wishes to live among the humans in civilization instead of in the wild or the [[zoo]]. As such, he is typically dressed in a tweed business suit and usually carries himself in a formal, dignified manner. Tawny first appeared in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #79 (1947), and became Captain Marvel's sidekick and best friend. Other variants of Tawny at DC have included a version magically animated from a stuffed tiger doll (''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', 1995-99), a benevolent shapeshifter who prefers to become a tiger when appropriate (''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]'', 2007), and a tiger at the local zoo who is briefly given enhanced strength and size by Shazam (''Shazam!'' backup feature in ''Justice League'', 2013). The Tawky Tawny of the current-continuity ''Shazam!'' comics series hails from the Wildlands, one of the Seven Magiclands connected to the Rock of Eternity, where he strives to live among the other humanoid animals of that realm despite the discrimination and segregation pitted against tigers.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #4 (June 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Introduced in the Bronze Age (1970-1985)===\n* '''[[Kid Eternity]]''' - A Golden Age hero co-created by frequent Captain Marvel writer [[Otto Binder]] for [[Quality Comics]], first appearing in ''Hit Comics'' #25 in 1945. Kid Eternity is the alter-ego of Christopher \"Kit\" Freeman, a boy who is killed with his grandfather by Nazi, and, upon learning he was not meant to die, is granted the power to summon any historical or mythological figure by speaking the magic word \"Eternity!\" In the 1970s, Kid Eternity, acquired from Quality by DC, was integrated into the ''Shazam!'' franchise set on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-S]], with his first appearance in a new DC story being ''Shazam!'' #28 (Feb. 1977). Kid Eternity often joined forces with the Marvels in early-1980s ''Shazam!'' adventures from ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' and ''[[Adventure Comics]]''. In ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #279-280 (May\u2013June 1982), Kid Eternity and Captain Marvel, Jr. learn they are long-lost brothers (a retcon made given the characters' identical surnames and similar origin stories).\n\n===Introduced after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' (1986-2011)===\n* '''Miss Wormwood''' - In the 1990s ''The Power of Shazam!'' comics, Billy's schoolteacher (and later principal), presented as the typical \"mean teacher\" stereotype. She is named after Calvin's schoolteacher in [[Bill Watterson]]'s [[comic strip]] ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]''.\n* '''Nick and Nora Bromfield''' - In the 1990s ''The Power of Shazam!'' comics, Mary Batson's adoptive parents, who adopted her through illegal means after their maid, Sarah Primm, brought the child to them (Primm saved Mary from her kidnapper, Primm's brother Theo Adam). Nora Bromfield was a cousin of Billy and Mary's mother, but chose not to tell Mary about her real family. The Bromfields would eventually gain the rights to legally adopt both Mary and Billy, giving the children a traditional family structure again. The couple was named after [[Nick and Nora Charles]] of the ''[[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]]'' film series.\n\n===Introduced after ''Flashpoint'' (2011-present)===\n* {{anchor|Victor and Rosa Vasquez}}'''Victor and Rosa Vasquez''' - The foster parents of the six kids in the Shazam Family; a working-class couple who had grown up as foster children themselves. The Vasquezes debuted in Geoff Johns & Gary Frank's 2012-13 reboot of ''Shazam!''\n\n==Marvel Family enemies==\n===Key villains===\nBesides the Black Marvel Family, the following are among the most prominent members of the Marvel Family's [[rogues gallery]], in order of first appearance in the comics.\n\n====Doctor Sivana====\n{{see also|Doctor Sivana}}\nDr. Thaddeus Bodog Sivana, Sr. - \"The World's Wickedest Scientist\" - debuted in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 alongside Billy Batson and Captain Marvel, quickly becoming his main archenemy and most frequently recurring villain. A mad scientist who fights the Marvel Family using his genius intellect and inventions, the Golden Age Sivana had been a humanitarian scientist who bitterly fled 20th-century Europe after his inventions were ridiculed by the scientific society. Living on Venus with his four children, he became a mad scientist, bent on taking over the universe.<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #15 (May 1941). New York: Fawcett Publications.</ref>\n\nOther versions of Sivana in later DC Comics have positioned him as Billy Batson's wicked step-uncle (''[[Shazam!: The New Beginning]]''), a wealthy, wicked businessman driven to ruin by his entanglements with Black Adam (''[[The Power of Shazam!]]''), and the wicked [[Attorney General of the United States]] (''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]''). The current-continuity Doctor Sivana, following the 2011 reboot, is a rich scientist determined to prove the existence of magic, which leads him to free both Black Adam and Mister Mind. Sivana acquires the ability to both see magic and project magic lightning from his right eye.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #8 (December 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the early and mid-1940s, Dr. Sivana was often assisted, under duress, by his good-natured adult daughter Beautia (and, briefly, Sivana's oldest child, his son Magnificus). From the mid-1940s onward, his youngest children - teenaged twins Thaddeus, Jr. aka '''Sivana, Jr''', and '''Georgia Sivana''', both dead ringers for their father - became his henchmen as the '''Sivana Family'''. Georgia Sivana became a prominent villain for Mary Marvel, as did Sivana, Jr. for Captain Marvel, Jr.\n\n====The Seven Deadly Sins====\n{{main|Seven Deadly Enemies of Man}}\nOriginally known as the \"Seven Deadly Enemies of Man\" and first appearing in the ''Whiz Comics'' #2 origin story in 1940, the sins are seven powerful demons held prisoner by the Wizard Shazam in his lair. The demons, whose forms vary by era and artist, sometimes escape and cause havoc through murder and using their powers to influence sin in humans.\n\nBased upon the [[seven deadly sins]] as enumerated in Christian legend, the original \"Seven Deadly Enemies of Man\" were slightly censored for suitable reading for children: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness, and Injustice. Each demon could influence their namesake sin in human victims. Beginning with DC's ''JSA'' series in the mid-2000s, the proper Christian names/versions of the sins were used: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Sloth, Gluttony, and Lust.\n\n====Captain Nazi====\n{{see also|Captain Nazi}}\nIntroduced in a three-part crossover between ''Master Comics'' and ''Whiz Comics'' in 1941 during World War II, Captain Nazi - real name Albrecht Krieger - is a genetically-altered Nazi who is Adolf Hitler's champion. Wearing a green costume with a swastika insignia, Captain Nazi has super-strength, near-invulnerability, and can use a special chemical gas to fly.\n\nCreated to wreck havoc on America, Captain Nazi murders an elderly man and cripples a teenage boy during his fight with Captain Marvel in ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (December 1941). The boy, Freddy Freeman, is granted powers by Captain Marvel to save his life, becoming Captain Marvel, Jr. and declaring Captain Nazi his mortal enemy.\n\n====Ibac====\n{{see also|Ibac}}\nA frail thug named \"Stinky\" Printwhistle who was empowered by [[Lucifer]] himself after Lucifer saved Printwhistle from a fall caused by Captain Marvel. Printwistle is imbued with the powers of four of the most evil men to walk the face of the earth ([[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]], [[Cesare Borgia|Borgia]], [[Attila the Hun]] and [[Caligula]]). When he says the name \"IBAC\", he is engulfed in green fire and [[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]] and becomes a large, muscular brute with super-strength.<ref>''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #8 (August 1942). New York: Fawcett Publications.</ref> Saying his name again transforms him back into Printwhistle (therefore, like Captain Marvel, Jr., Ibac also cannot say his own name).\n\nIbac first appeared in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #8 in 1942 and became a recurring Marvel Family villain through the characters' run in Fawcett and DC Comics. The 2011 rebooted version of Ibac is the descendant of a long line of evil despots, the first of whom - Ibac the Terrible - was known in ancient times as \"the man who invented evil.\"<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 3) #19 (June 2013). Burbank, CA: DC Comics.</ref>\n\n====Sabbac====\n{{See also|Sabbac}}\nSimilar to Ibac, Timothy Karnes is granted the powers of six demons when he says the magic word \"Sabbac\". As opposed to fire, Sabbac transforms via black lightning cast up (rather than down) from Hades. First appearing in ''Captain Marvel Jr.'' #4 (February 1943), Sabbac's pantheon -  - grant him powers similar to the Marvel Family, with the added power of pyrokenesis. A second Ibac, Ishamel Gregor, was introduced in the mid-2000s in the ''Outsiders'' comic book. While Karnes' Sabbac became a more muscular version of himself in a green cloak with demon fangs, Gregor's Sabbac is a large, muscular, horned demon with red skin and hair.\n\nIn the 2011 ''Shazam!'' reboot, the Seven Deadly Sins have the power to possess a wicked human and transform him into a fifty-foot tall demon resembling the Ishamel Gregor version of Sabbac.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 3) #21 (August 2013).

They are also the estranged children of the Wizard Shazam, from his younger days as the ancient Canaanite superhero Vlarem The Champion.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #10 (December 1995).

(2019) home media release | medium=Documentary | location=Burbank | publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref>, are a group of [[superhero]]es who originally appeared in books published by [[Fawcett Comics]] and were later acquired by [[DC Comics]]. Created in 1942 by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[Marc Swayze]], the team was created as an extension of Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] franchise, and included Marvel's sister [[Mary Marvel]], their friend [[Captain Marvel Jr.]], and, at various times, a number of other characters as well.\n\nBecause [[Marvel Comics]] trademarked their own [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] comic book during the interim between the demise of the Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel comics in 1953 and DC's revival in 1972, DC Comics is today unable to promote and market their Captain Marvel/Marvel Family properties under those names. Since 1972, DC has instead used the trademark ''Shazam!'' for their comic book titles with the Marvel Family characters, and the name under which they market and promote the characters. When referring to the Marvel Family on comic book covers or various merchandise, they are by this legal necessity called the \"Shazam Family\".\n\nIn 2012, DC officially changed Captain Marvel's name to ''Shazam'', making ''Shazam Family'' the name of the superhero's associates. In current continuity, the Shazam Family comprises the superpowered alter egos of Billy Batson (teenaged alter-ego of Shazam/Captain Marvel) and his foster siblings: Mary Bromfield (formerly Mary Marvel), Freddy Freeman (formerly Captain Marvel Jr.), Darla Dudley, Pedro Pe\u00f1a, and Eugene Choi.\n\nThe Shazam Family make their cinematic debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film [[Shazam! (film)|''Shazam!'']], released in 2019 by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Warner Bros.]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Marvel Family was established in 1942 after the introductions of Captain Marvel's partners, the [[Lieutenant Marvels]] (''Whiz Comics'' #21, September 1941), [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] (''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #25, December 1941) and [[Mary Marvel]] (''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18, December 1942). With Junior and Mary's additions to his adventures, Captain Marvel became the first superhero to have a team of sidekicks who share his powers, abilities, and appearance; a concept later adapted for heroes such as [[Superman]] and [[Aquaman]], among others.\n\nThe members of the Marvel Family appeared both separately and together in many of Fawcett's comic book series, including ''Whiz Comics'', ''Wow Comics'', ''Master Comics'', ''Captain Marvel Adventures'', ''Captain Marvel Jr.'', ''Mary Marvel'', and ''The Marvel Family''. By the late 1940s, Marvel Family comics were among the most popular in the industry, and the Marvel Family had expanded to include both non-superpowered characters ([[Uncle Marvel]] and Freckles Marvel) and even [[funny animal]]s ([[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]]). By 1953, all of these books had ceased publication, due to Superman publisher [[DC Comics]]' [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|lawsuit against Fawcett]].\n\nIn 1972, DC licensed the rights to the Marvel Family characters, and began publishing them in a comic series titled ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]''. Fawcett sold DC the rights to the characters in 1980, by which time ''Shazam!'' had been cancelled, and the Marvels had been relegated the back-up feature of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', and, later, ''[[Adventure Comics]]''. DC [[retcon]]ned Captain Marvel in 1986 with their ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' miniseries, establishing him as a solo hero without a team. Writer/artist [[Jerry Ordway]] resurrected the Marvel Family in 1995 with his ''[[Power of Shazam!]]'' series, establishing the team as being made up solely of Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. Following several attempts at relaunching the ''Shazam!'' franchise during the mid-2000s, the Marvel Family was temporarily dissolved by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and Jerry Ordway in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (third series) #25, with only Captain Marvel Jr., now known as ''Shazam'', retaining his powers, but from another source. In the interim, Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel continued to appear in ''[[Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!]]'', an all-ages comic book series published under DC's youth-oriented [[Johnny DC]] line which ran from 2008 to 2010. Captain Marvel Jr. joined the pair towards the end of the run of ''Magic of Shazam!'', following a brief period serving as the sidekick of the Marvels' enemy under the name ''[[Black Adam]] Jr.''\n\nThe Shazam Family was reintroduced during DC Comics' continuity-altering ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries in 2011, as six kids who all spoke \"Shazam!\" in unison to become one superhero, Captain Thunder. In the later company-wide \"[[New 52]]\" reboot that followed ''Flashpoint'', the Captain Marvel character was renamed \"Shazam\" and starred in a backup segment of the ''Justice League'' series (second volume) from 2012 to 2013. These backups, by writer Geoff Johns and artist [[Gary Frank]], introduced Billy Batson/Shazam and his new Shazam Family, consisting of Billy and his five foster siblings, with whom he shares his powers.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Marvel/Shazam Family members==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 250\n | image1 = Shazam Family 2013 Gary Frank.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Black Adam]] confronts the newly created Shazam Family (l to r: Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, Pedro Pe\u00f1a, [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]), as seen in ''[[Justice League]]'' (vol. 2) #21 (August 2013).

Beck and Pete Costanza.\n\n}}\n\n===Primary members===\n====Billy Batson (Captain Marvel/Shazam)====\n{{seealso|Captain Marvel (DC Comics)}}\nThe \"World's Mightiest Mortal\", Captain Marvel is the superpowered alter-ego of Billy Batson, an orphaned boy who speaks the name of the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] to become an adult superhero. Billy has the powers of [[King Solomon|Solomon]] (wisdom), [[Hercules]] (strength), [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (stamina), [[Zeus]] (power), [[Achilles]] (courage), and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (speed); and served as the wizard Shazam's champion and herald. \n\nIn the Golden Age and Bronze Age comics, Billy chose to share his powers with his sister Mary and his friend Freddy Freeman, creating the Marvel Family. Outside of the Marvel Family, Captain Marvel served briefly as a member of both the [[Justice League International]] and the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nAfter the 2011 [[New 52]] reboot of the ''Shazam!'' characters by Geoff Johns & Gary Frank, Billy Batson is a troubled foster child who has inherited the name, powers, and seat on the council of magic of the wizard Shazam. Becoming a hero inspired the initially brash and standoffish Billy to evolve into a noble hero and leader who embraces his new foster family. As ''Shazam'', Billy has powers and a red-uniformed appearance similar to the traditional version of Captain Marvel with the added ability to wield magic via the \"living lightning\" that powers him.\n\n====Mary Bromfield (Mary Marvel/Lady Shazam)====\n{{seealso|Mary Marvel}}\nIn traditional ''Shazam!'' stories, Mary is Billy's once-lost twin sister Mary Batson (adopted as Mary Bromfield), who found she could say the magic word \"Shazam!\" and become a Marvel as well. The Golden Age Mary Marvel remained a teenager in superhero form, while the modern version is transformed into an adult like her brother. The Golden Age Mary Marvel had a different set of patrons from Captain Marvel who contributed to her powers. They were [[Selene]] (grace), [[Hippolyte]] (strength), [[Ariadne]] (skill), [[Zephyrus]] (swiftness), [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] (beauty) and [[Minerva]] (wisdom).\n\nDuring the 2007 and 2008 limited series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' and ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Mary Marvel lost her powers and gained the powers of Marvel Family foe [[Black Adam]]. She temporarily became a villain working for [[Darkseid]] and possessed by the [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|New God]] [[Desaad]].\n\nIn current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Mary Bromfield is Billy Batson's foster sister, having run away from an abusive home at a young age and being placed in the V\u00e1zquez home. The oldest of the Shazam kids, Mary acts as the \"den mother\" and conscience of the group.

Burbank, CA: DC Comics</ref>\n\n====Freddy Freeman (Captain Marvel Jr./Shazam Jr.)====\n{{seealso|Captain Marvel Jr.}}\nIn both the Golden Age and 1990s versions of the Marvel Family, Billy's friend and classmate, Freddy Freeman, was attacked and left disabled by the supervillain [[Captain Nazi]], and was given the power to become a Marvel to save his life. Whenever he spoke Captain Marvel's name, Freddy becomes a teenage version of Captain Marvel. This created the odd problem that he could not identify himself without changing back to his regular form.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, the Freddy character went by the alias ''CM3'' (short for \"Captain Marvel Three\", \"CM1\" being Billy and \"CM2\" being Mary) so that he could identify himself without transforming. He was a member of the [[Teen Titans]] during the late 1990s and later, the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] in the early 2000s. The 2006\u20132008 ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Trials of Shazam!]]'' mini-series featured Freddy gaining the powers of Captain Marvel as ''Shazam'', while Billy took over for the dead wizard Shazam as ''Marvel''.\n\nIn current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Freddy Freeman (now a blond teenager instead of the traditional black-haired youth, though still physically disabled) is Billy Batson's foster brother, a smart-mouthed pickpocket and trickster whose parents are in prison. He shares Billy's secret and by saying \"Shazam!\" can gain a form similar to an adult version of the traditional Captain Marvel, Jr., in a blue uniform.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" />\n\n====Eugene Choi====\nEugene Choi is Billy Batson's foster brother, an intelligent, bookish teenager about his age of Asian descent with a love of technology and video games. Eugene's bookishness is offset by a competitive and impulsive nature that causes trouble for him and the others at times.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #4 (May 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics</ref> Introduced in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries, Eugene can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam!\" and become an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a silver/gray uniform.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" /> In addition to the standard Shazam power-set, Eugene has the additional power of [[technopathy]], which allows him to talk to and control machines and technology.\n\n====Pedro Pe\u00f1a====\nPedro Pe\u00f1a is Billy Batson's foster brother, an overweight teenager of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent who is around Billy's age. Introduced in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries, Pedro can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam!\" and becoming an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a green uniform.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" /> Pedro's adult form, resembling a tall, bearded [[powerlifter]], is a stark contrast to his personal insecurity and shyness.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #5 (June 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics</ref> While the comics have yet to make any such distinction, the 2019 live-action feature film ''[[Shazam!

Despite her hardships growing up, Darla is very openly affectionate and loving towards her foster family and virtually anyone she meets. Introduced in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries (as a teenager the same age as the other kids), Darla can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam!\"<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" /> She wears a purple uniform, and her speed abilities are amplified, making her faster than the others. She is also unable to keep secrets, which proved rather difficult to overcome.<ref name=\"ShazamVol3No1\" />\n\n====C.C. Batson====\nClarence Charles \"C.C.\" Batson (named after Captain Marvel co-creator [[C.C. Beck|Charles Clarence \"C.C.\" Beck]]) is the biological father of Billy Batson. Billy's biological parents had been alluded to in a handful of ''Shazam!'' stories published prior to 1990 under different names. The 1994 graphic novel ''The Power of Shazam!'' by [[Jerry Ordway]] introduces C.C. and his wife, Billy's mother Marilyn, and how their deaths in that [[Post-Crisis]] continuity at the hands of Theo Adam (alter-ego of Black Adam) led to Billy gaining his powers. Much emphasis is made of Captain Marvel/Shazam's almost-identical appearance to the deceased C.C. Batson.<ref>Ordway, Jerry (1994). ''The Power of Shazam!'' New York: DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn current ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' continuity, C.C. Batson is still alive, resembling an older Captain Marvel/Shazam with greying hair. As a younger man, C.C. had abandoned Marilyn and Billy when Billy was a toddler. After spending a decade in prison, C.C. returns to Philadelphia to find Billy at the Vazquezes' foster home. C.C. is attacked by Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Sins, leading Billy to share his powers with his father to save his life,<ref>''Shazam!''

They vowed only to use their power if asked by Captain Marvel, and only if all three were to say the magic word, \"SHAZAM!\" in unison. They did not appear in Marvel Family stories between ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985 and ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' in 2011, except for a scene in ''The Trials of Shazam!'' #2 where they briefly appeared, only to lose their powers. Following DC's 2011 [[New 52]] reboot, the Lieutenant Marvels appear as non-superpowered allies of the Marvel Family in the 2015 one-shot comic ''[[The Multiversity#Thunderworld Adventures: Captain Marvel and the Day That Never Was|The Multiversity: Thunderworld]]'', where they, Mister Tawny, and Uncle Marvel help defeat the Monster Society of Evil while Captain Marvel is fighting Doctor Sivana for control of the Rock of Eternity.\n* '''[[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]]''': a spin-off character generally confined to his own series, the pink [[funny animal]] [[rabbit]] version of Captain Marvel periodically assisted the human Marvels in their adventures.\n\n===Other members===\nThese members of the Marvel Family appear in stories set in the future.\n\n* '''Thunder''': The star of ''The Power of Shazam!'' 1996 Annual, Thunder is the super-powered alter-ego of a young girl from the planet Binderaan, circa 9,000 A.D., named CeCe Beck (or Beck for short). An aged Captain Marvel serves as the girl's mentor the same way Shazam served as his mentor. Whenever Beck speaks the magic words \"Captain Marvel\", she is transformed into Thunder, an adult super-heroine. After being lost in the timestream, Thunder briefly teamed up with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th century. The names \"CeCe Beck\" and \"Binderaan\" are tributes to Marvel Family creators C.C. Beck and Otto Binder.\n* '''Tanist''': A teenaged male Marvel who appeared in ''The Power of Shazam!'' #1,000,000 (November 1998, part of the [[DC One Million]] event). After his mother is killed, Tanist, a disabled resident of Mercury in the 853rd century, meets the aged Captain Marvel in the Rock of Eternity.

Adam eventually grew to abuse his power, and became a tyrant. Shazam returned to punish Adam with either exile into deep space (in the original Fawcett Comics) or death (in the modern DC Comics). He returns to Earth (or life) after Shazam appoints Captain Marvel his new successor, and was soon established as Captain Marvel's most powerful foe in physical abilities. In later DC continuity, Black Adam joined the [[Justice Society of America]], claiming to have reformed, later turning on the Justice Society by using some of its younger associates to help him overthrow the government of his home country [[Khandaq]].\n\nAdam was one of the main characters in DC's ''52'' weekly maxi-series, which followed his attempts to establish himself as a hero, which led him to create a \"Marvel Family\" of his own, which included his superpowered wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]] and his own \"Captain Marvel Jr.\", [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]].\n\nIn the current \"New 52\" continuity, Black Adam was a former Khandaqi slave in ancient times who was granted the power of Shazam along with his young nephew, whom he kills for not sharing his taste for vengeance against their enemies. Adam kills the members of Earth's Council of Wizards save for the wizard Shazam, who imprisoned him and hid magic until Adam was freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times.\n\n====Isis====\n{{seealso|Isis (DC Comics)}}\nThe superheroine Isis was originally created for live-action television to star in [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' TV show, a sister series for Filmation's adaptation of ''[[Shazam! (television)|Shazam!]]''. Isis teamed up with Captain Marvel on occasion in both television and comics, and briefly starred in a licensed DC comic book in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 2006, DC Comics created a new, unrelated Isis and introduced her into the DC Universe. This Isis is the alter-ego of Adrianna Tomaz, originally a slave from Egypt offered to Black Adam by the terrorist group [[Intergang]] as a token to curry his favor. Although Adam dealt harshly with the slavers and kills one of them, Adrianna becomes Adam's love interest and made him a more merciful figure, and was granted a special amulet that allowed her to become the avatar of the Egyptian goddess. Adam married Isis, but her death at the hands of the Four Horsemen of [[Apokolips]] drove him to [[World War III (DC Comics)|a fit of mass murder]]. At the end of the ''Black Adam: The Dark Age'' mini-series in 2007, Isis was resurrected by [[Felix Faust]]. However, the ordeal of her death, and many months spent as a brainwashed slave, routinely [[rape|abused]] by Faust, left her much colder and ruthless than before, making her even less merciful than her husband. In current \"New 52\" continuity, Adrianna Tomaz is a peaceful freedom fighter who helps her brother Amon resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam.<ref name=\"JLA 23.4\">''Justice League of America #23.4: Black Adam'' (2013)</ref>\n\n====Osiris====\n{{seealso|Osiris (DC Comics)}}\nThe teenaged Osiris is Amon Tomaz, Adrianna's long-lost brother who was kidnapped, enslaved, and crippled by [[Intergang]]. Adam shared his powers with Amon, allowing him to transform into the superpowered Osiris by saying the name \"Black Adam\". Osiris was murdered by his trusted companion, Sobek the talking crocodile, revealed to be Famine, one of the Four Horsemen. During the 2009-2010 crossover event ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Osiris was resurrected alongside other heroes, and was later resurrected as a White Lantern, for the purpose of releasing Isis, for which he joins the new [[Teen Titans (comics)|Titans]]. In current \"New 52\" continuity, Amon Tomaz is a rebellious freedom fighter who helps resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam.<ref name=\"JLA 23.4\" />\n\n====Sobek====\n{{seealso|Sobek (comics)}}\nSobek is an intelligent humanoid crocodile, created and abandoned by the Sivana Family, who befriends the Black Marvel family during the ''52'' maxi-series after escaping from his cage at the Sivana compound. Despite his monstrous appearance, the character is portrayed as timid, meek, and good-natured, making him the Black Marvel Family's analogue to [[Tawky Tawny]]. Sobek reveals a more horrifying side in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 43, when he convinced a distraught Osiris to change into his mortal form, then suddenly killed and devoured him. Sobek was revealed in Week 44 to be the Fourth Horseman, Famine. He appeared to have been killed by Black Adam both in self-defense and revenge, but reappears in the ''52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen'' mini-series.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Marvel Family allies==\n[[Image: Whiz-comics-issue-59.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The cover of ''Whiz Comics'' #59 (Oct. 1944), featuring most of the Golden Age Marvel Family and supporting cast.

Beck and Pete Costanza.]]\n\n===Introduced during the Golden Age (1939-1953)===\n* '''[[Shazam (wizard)|The Wizard Shazam]]''' - Although he is killed as prophesied after giving Billy the power to become Captain Marvel, Shazam's spirit remains as the vigilant caretaker of the Rock of Eternity. His power level varies in different stories from high-level magician to godlike. In the 1990s-2000s continuity, Shazam does not die after granting Billy his powers, and was a much more active character than he was during the Golden Age Marvel Family adventures. In current continuity, Shazam - known to most as only \"The Wizard,\" whose true name is Mamaragan - was one of the first humans on Earth to wield magic in ancient times, and becomes the head chair of the Council of Eternity. After the betrayal of Black Adam, Shazam's compatriots on the Council are murdered, and as the remaining member, he imprisons Adam and hides magic from the world. When Adam is freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times, Shazam drafts Billy Batson as his successor.\n* '''Mr. Sterling Morris''' - The president of Amalgamated Broadcasting, owners of Station WHIZ, the radio (and later TV) station for which Billy Batson works. He debuts in the very first Captain Marvel story in ''Whiz Comics'' #2.\n* '''Beautia and Magnificus Sivana''' - Dr. Sivana's beautiful adult daughter Beautia shared her father's passion for world domination until meeting, and falling for, Captain Marvel. She has an unrequited crush on the shy Captain, not realizing that he is actually only a young boy. Beautia first appeared in ''Whiz Comics'' #3b in 1940.<ref>Because of a numbering error at Fawcett Publications, there are two issues of ''Whiz Comics'' assigned the number 3.</ref> Most Golden Age Marvel Family stories feature Beautia as Dr. Sivana's unwitting assistant, who betrays her father to assist the heroes. Her older brother, Magnificus, is also generally depicted as a Marvel Family ally, although in his only Golden Age appearance (''Whiz Comics'' #15, 1941), Magnificus was super-strong and fought Captain Marvel hand-to-hand at his father's request.\n* '''\"Muscles\" McGinnis''' - The antagonist of a story included in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #3 (1941), the toughest gangster of the city possessing enormous strength. \"Muscles\" McGinnis promises to go straight after being defeated by Captain Marvel when he tries to take over Station WHIZ, as he feels the side opposing crime is much stronger. The character was reintroduced as a recurring character in the ''Power of Shazam!'' series of the 1990s, in which \"Muscles\" had indeed reformed to become an [[undercover]] cop and a frequent ally of Captain Marvel.\n*'''[[Steamboat (comics)|Steamboat]]''' - In the 1940s Fawcett stories, Steamboat is Billy Batson's African-American valet. Depicted as cowardly and subservient, Steamboat accompanied Billy and Captain Marvel on many of their adventures following his first appearance in ''America's Greatest Comics'' #3 in 1941. Drawn in a racially stereotyped manner and speaking with a stereotypical [[Negro dialect]], Steamboat was retired from the Captain Marvel stories after the Youth Builders, a diverse group of New York City and Philadelphia area students, protested the use of the character in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-467/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #467 |date=2014-04-18 |website=CBR |language=en-US |access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n* '''Cissie Sommerly''' - Billy Batson's girlfriend and Sterling Morris' niece. She first appears in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #12 (1942).\n* '''[[Uncle Marvel|Uncle Marvel (Uncle Dudley)]]''' - During the Golden Age, an old man named Dudley claimed that he was not only a relative of the Marvels but also a Marvel himself, although neither was true. Regardless, the Marvels took a liking to him and decided to humor his pretense, and \"Uncle\" Dudley became Uncle Marvel, the Marvel Family's manager. He would make his \"transformation\" along with one or more of the others, but not by magic; rather, by quickly removing his break-away garments (under the cover of lightning that the real Marvel(s) called down) to reveal his homemade Marvel costume underneath. He explained his lack of superpowers by claiming he suffered from \"[[Low back pain|shazambago]]\". Dudley first appeared in ''Wow Comics'' #18 in 1943. In the 1990s ''The Power of Shazam!'' comics, Dudley H. Dudley is simply a [[janitor]] at Billy's school who finds himself involved in the Marvel Family's adventures, although in one story (''The Power of Shazam!'' #11, 1996) he was temporarily given superpowers by Shazam's ally [[Ibis the Invincible]] to help round up the escaped [[Seven Deadly Sins#Film, television, comic books and video games|Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].<ref>''Power of Shazam!'' #11 (1996)</ref>\n* '''Freckles Marvel (Mary Dudley)''' - Uncle Dudley's adopted niece, who was an irregular companion of Mary Marvel's in her Golden Age solo adventures. First appearing in ''Wow Comics'' #35 (1945), Freckles Marvel had no superpowers of her own, but wore her own Mary Marvel costume to help her super-powered friend fight crime.\n* '''[[Tawky Tawny|Mister Tawky Tawny]]''' - A humanoid sapient [[tiger]] who wishes to live among the humans in civilization instead of in the wild or the [[zoo]]. As such, he is typically dressed in a tweed business suit and usually carries himself in a formal, dignified manner. Tawny first appeared in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #79 (1947), and became Captain Marvel's sidekick and best friend. Other variants of Tawny at DC have included a version magically animated from a stuffed tiger doll (''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', 1995-99), a benevolent shapeshifter who prefers to become a tiger when appropriate (''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]'', 2007), and a tiger at the local zoo who is briefly given enhanced strength and size by Shazam (''Shazam!'' backup feature in ''Justice League'', 2013). The Tawky Tawny of the current-continuity ''Shazam!'' comics series hails from the Wildlands, one of the Seven Magiclands connected to the Rock of Eternity, where he strives to live among the other humanoid animals of that realm despite the discrimination and segregation pitted against tigers.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #4 (June 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Introduced in the Bronze Age (1970-1985)===\n* '''[[Kid Eternity]]''' - A Golden Age hero co-created by frequent Captain Marvel writer [[Otto Binder]] for [[Quality Comics]], first appearing in ''Hit Comics'' #25 in 1945. Kid Eternity is the alter-ego of Christopher \"Kit\" Freeman, a boy who is killed with his grandfather by Nazi, and, upon learning he was not meant to die, is granted the power to summon any historical or mythological figure by speaking the magic word \"Eternity!\" In the 1970s, Kid Eternity, acquired from Quality by DC, was integrated into the ''Shazam!'' franchise set on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-S]], with his first appearance in a new DC story being ''Shazam!'' #28 (Feb. 1977). Kid Eternity often joined forces with the Marvels in early-1980s ''Shazam!'' adventures from ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' and ''[[Adventure Comics]]''. In ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #279-280 (May\u2013June 1982), Kid Eternity and Captain Marvel, Jr. learn they are long-lost brothers (a retcon made given the characters' identical surnames and similar origin stories).\n\n===Introduced after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' (1986-2011)===\n* '''Miss Wormwood''' - In the 1990s ''The Power of Shazam!'' comics, Billy's schoolteacher (and later principal), presented as the typical \"mean teacher\" stereotype. She is named after Calvin's schoolteacher in [[Bill Watterson]]'s [[comic strip]] ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]''.\n* '''Nick and Nora Bromfield''' - In the 1990s ''The Power of Shazam!'' comics, Mary Batson's adoptive parents, who adopted her through illegal means after their maid, Sarah Primm, brought the child to them (Primm saved Mary from her kidnapper, Primm's brother Theo Adam). Nora Bromfield was a cousin of Billy and Mary's mother, but chose not to tell Mary about her real family. The Bromfields would eventually gain the rights to legally adopt both Mary and Billy, giving the children a traditional family structure again. The couple was named after [[Nick and Nora Charles]] of the ''[[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]]'' film series.\n\n===Introduced after ''Flashpoint'' (2011-present)===\n* {{anchor|Victor and Rosa Vasquez}}'''Victor and Rosa Vasquez''' - The foster parents of the six kids in the Shazam Family; a working-class couple who had grown up as foster children themselves. The Vasquezes debuted in Geoff Johns & Gary Frank's 2012-13 reboot of ''Shazam!''\n\n==Marvel Family enemies==\n===Key villains===\nBesides the Black Marvel Family, the following are among the most prominent members of the Marvel Family's [[rogues gallery]], in order of first appearance in the comics.\n\n====Doctor Sivana====\n{{see also|Doctor Sivana}}\nDr. Thaddeus Bodog Sivana, Sr. - \"The World's Wickedest Scientist\" - debuted in ''Whiz Comics'' #2 alongside Billy Batson and Captain Marvel, quickly becoming his main archenemy and most frequently recurring villain. A mad scientist who fights the Marvel Family using his genius intellect and inventions, the Golden Age Sivana had been a humanitarian scientist who bitterly fled 20th-century Europe after his inventions were ridiculed by the scientific society. Living on Venus with his four children, he became a mad scientist, bent on taking over the universe.<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #15 (May 1941). New York: Fawcett Publications.</ref>\n\nOther versions of Sivana in later DC Comics have positioned him as Billy Batson's wicked step-uncle (''[[Shazam!: The New Beginning]]''), a wealthy, wicked businessman driven to ruin by his entanglements with Black Adam (''[[The Power of Shazam!]]''), and the wicked [[Attorney General of the United States]] (''[[Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil]]''). The current-continuity Doctor Sivana, following the 2011 reboot, is a rich scientist determined to prove the existence of magic, which leads him to free both Black Adam and Mister Mind. Sivana acquires the ability to both see magic and project magic lightning from his right eye.<ref>''Shazam!'' (vol. 3) #8 (December 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the early and mid-1940s, Dr. Sivana was often assisted, under duress, by his good-natured adult daughter Beautia (and, briefly, Sivana's oldest child, his son Magnificus). From the mid-1940s onward, his youngest children - teenaged twins Thaddeus, Jr. aka '''Sivana, Jr''', and '''Georgia Sivana''', both dead ringers for their father - became his henchmen as the '''Sivana Family'''. Georgia Sivana became a prominent villain for Mary Marvel, as did Sivana, Jr. for Captain Marvel, Jr.\n\n====The Seven Deadly Sins====\n{{main|Seven Deadly Enemies of Man}}\nOriginally known as the \"Seven Deadly Enemies of Man\" and first appearing in the ''Whiz Comics'' #2 origin story in 1940, the sins are seven powerful demons held prisoner by the Wizard Shazam in his lair. The demons, whose forms vary by era and artist, sometimes escape and cause havoc through murder and using their powers to influence sin in humans.\n\nBased upon the [[seven deadly sins]] as enumerated in Christian legend, the original \"Seven Deadly Enemies of Man\" were slightly censored for suitable reading for children: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness, and Injustice. Each demon could influence their namesake sin in human victims. Beginning with DC's ''JSA'' series in the mid-2000s, the proper Christian names/versions of the sins were used: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Sloth, Gluttony, and Lust.\n\n====Captain Nazi====\n{{see also|Captain Nazi}}\nIntroduced in a three-part crossover between ''Master Comics'' and ''Whiz Comics'' in 1941 during World War II, Captain Nazi - real name Albrecht Krieger - is a genetically-altered Nazi who is Adolf Hitler's champion. Wearing a green costume with a swastika insignia, Captain Nazi has super-strength, near-invulnerability, and can use a special chemical gas to fly.\n\nCreated to wreck havoc on America, Captain Nazi murders an elderly man and cripples a teenage boy during his fight with Captain Marvel in ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (December 1941). The boy, Freddy Freeman, is granted powers by Captain Marvel to save his life, becoming Captain Marvel, Jr. and declaring Captain Nazi his mortal enemy.\n\n====Ibac====\n{{see also|Ibac}}\nA frail thug named \"Stinky\" Printwhistle who was empowered by [[Lucifer]] himself after Lucifer saved Printwhistle from a fall caused by Captain Marvel. Printwistle is imbued with the powers of four of the most evil men to walk the face of the earth ([[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]], [[Cesare Borgia|Borgia]], [[Attila the Hun]] and [[Caligula]]). When he says the name \"IBAC\", he is engulfed in green fire and [[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]] and becomes a large, muscular brute with super-strength.<ref>''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #8 (August 1942). New York: Fawcett Publications.</ref> Saying his name again transforms him back into Printwhistle (therefore, like Captain Marvel, Jr., Ibac also cannot say his own name).\n\nIbac first appeared in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #8 in 1942 and became a recurring Marvel Family villain through the characters' run in Fawcett and DC Comics. The 2011 rebooted version of Ibac is the descendant of a long line of evil despots, the first of whom - Ibac the Terrible - was known in ancient times as \"the man who invented evil.\"<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 3) #19 (June 2013). Burbank, CA: DC Comics.</ref>\n\n====Sabbac====\n{{See also|Sabbac}}\nSimilar to Ibac, Timothy Karnes is granted the powers of six demons when he says the magic word \"Sabbac\". As opposed to fire, Sabbac transforms via black lightning cast up (rather than down) from Hades. First appearing in ''Captain Marvel Jr.'' #4 (February 1943), Sabbac's pantheon -  - grant him powers similar to the Marvel Family, with the added power of pyrokenesis. A second Ibac, Ishamel Gregor, was introduced in the mid-2000s in the ''Outsiders'' comic book. While Karnes' Sabbac became a more muscular version of himself in a green cloak with demon fangs, Gregor's Sabbac is a large, muscular, horned demon with red skin and hair.\n\nIn the 2011 ''Shazam!'' reboot, the Seven Deadly Sins have the power to possess a wicked human and transform him into a fifty-foot tall demon resembling the Ishamel Gregor version of Sabbac.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 3) #21 (August 2013).

Given his small stature, he wears a [[talkbox]] to communicate and is often depicted wearing eyeglasses as well. He runs the supervillain team The Monster Society of Evil, whose membership includes most of the Marvel Family's key and recurring villains, including characters such as  Doctor Sivana, King Kull, the Crocodile-Men, Captain Nazi, Mister Atom, Ibac, and Oggar.

Guybrush is voiced by actor [[Dominic Armato]] in the third, fourth and fifth games, as well as the [[enhanced remake]]s of ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'' and ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gdc.gamespot.com/story/6253367/monkey-island-2-se-takes-lechucks-revenge-on-consoles-pc-this-summer |title=Monkey Island 2 SE takes LeChuck's Revenge on consoles, PC this summer |last=Tong |first=Sophia |date=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=15 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314164444/http://gdc.gamespot.com/story/6253367/monkey-island-2-se-takes-lechucks-revenge-on-consoles-pc-this-summer |archivedate=14 March 2010 }}</ref> Though a \"mighty pirate\" by his own account, it is a running joke throughout the games for characters to garble Guybrush Threepwood's unusual name, either deliberately or accidentally.\n\n==Name==\n\nThe origin of the name \"Guybrush\" comes in part from [[Deluxe Paint]], the tool used by the artists to create the character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]. Since the character had no name at this point, the file was simply called '<tt>Guy</tt>'. When the file was saved, [[Steve Purcell]], the artist responsible for the sprite, added '<tt>brush</tt>' to the [[filename]], indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint \"brush file\" for the \"Guy\" sprite. The file name was then \"guybrush.bbm\", so the developers eventually just started referring to this unnamed 'Guy' as \"Guybrush\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/community/discussion/comment/224468/#Comment_224468 |author=Grossman, Dave |title=Guybrush Threefoot |publisher=[[Telltale Games]] |date=2009-10-11 |accessdate=2009-12-01 |authorlink=Dave Grossman (game developer) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006075023/http://www.telltalegames.com/community/discussion/comment/224468 |archivedate=2013-10-06 }}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6IYgWh-qnY&t=32m55s GameSpot, \"Storytime with Ron Gilbert - PAX Australia 2013 Keynote\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307194540/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6IYgWh-qnY&t=32m55s |date=2016-03-07 }}, ''Ron Gilbert'', 7 July 2013, accessed 22 March 2015</ref> Guybrush's surname \"Threepwood\" was decided upon in a company contest and is derived from [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s family of characters including [[Galahad Threepwood]] and [[Freddie Threepwood]] (with whom he shares similar characteristics). \"Threepwood\" is also rumoured to have been the name of [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]]'s [[Role-playing game|RPG]] character.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scummbar.com/resources/faq/ |title=Frequently asked questions about Monkey Island |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817214824/http://www.scummbar.com/resources/faq/ |archivedate=2007-08-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Incarnations==\nGuybrush's age is not defined in the game, though he may be seventeen years old in ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]''; in the second game, ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'', while obtaining fake identification (a library card) in the Phatt City library, a slip of the tongue (\"nine....errr, twenty one\") suggests that he may be nineteen.\nHe is twenty years old in ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'' as he proves to ''Dinghy Dog'' when he tries to guess Guybrush's age and Guybrush proves it with his ''SCUMM'' Actors Guild Membership Card, although, in the most recent game, Elaine states it was three years between ''Monkey Island 2'' and ''3'' (she was in a poxed rage during this statement, and that Stan mentioned it was three months). ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]'' takes place three months after ''Curse'', following Guybrush and Elaine's honeymoon, while it is stated in-game that ''[[Tales of Monkey Island]]'' takes place roughly ten years since Guybrush became a pirate, making him 27\u201328 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13180&page=3 |title=How old is Guybrush exactly? - Page 3 - Telltale Games Forums |publisher=Telltalegames.com |accessdate=2012-08-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009052420/http://www.telltalegames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13180&page=3 |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> However, Guybrush often lies about his age, for example telling the librarian that he was 21 in the aforementioned Phatt library in ''LeChuck's Revenge''.\n\nGuybrush grows a beard and moustache in the second game, but is shaven in the third and fourth games. Guybrush makes a reference that he lost his beard between the second and third game but cannot remember what happened to it; in the third game however, if one tries to use the shaving cream, Guybrush says that he shaved last week. In the second game, his hair (possibly just for humorous effect) is in two scenes shown to be a wig which flies off his head when he gets frightened by two fake incarnations of [[LeChuck]], revealing a shaven pate. In all other versions, his hair growth apparently remains natural.\n\nIn ''LeChuck's Revenge'', Guybrush meets delusionary incarnations of his parents, stating that they have abandoned him when he was younger. Details pertaining to this abandonment, however, remain undisclosed, nor is it made clear whether this is what actually happened or if Guybrush was merely having a delusion or misconception about this event.\n\nIn ''Escape from Monkey Island'' Guybrush's middle name is revealed to be [[Odysseus|Ulysses]].\n\n===Attire===\nIn ''Secret of Monkey Island'' Guybrush wears a white [[Poet shirt|blouse]]; he wears a similar blouse in all the other games as well but this one appears to have shorter sleeves (although they could simply be folded). He wears black [[breeches]], white socks and small, black shoes. In ''LeChuck's Revenge'' his attire changes radically, consisting of boots, a long, blue coat and two belts, one of which is worn across his chest. In ''Curse of Monkey Island'' Guybrush's attire is similar to his attire in the first game, but he has brown breeches instead of black and a small brown [[waistcoat]] and red cummerbund sash.\n\nIn ''Escape from Monkey Island'' Guybrush has multiple outfits, which change during the game. He starts with a red, buttoned-up jacket, boots and a large belt with a belt buckle that has his initials on it (an [[in-joke]] from ''[[Grim Fandango]]''). When venturing to Lucre and Jambalaya Island he wears a similar outfit to his appearance in the first game, except that his trousers are a light blue and his shirt has longer sleeves. When he is once more stranded on Monkey Island in the third act he wears his red jacket, but no shoes. His trousers have been ripped from knee down and his jacket seems slightly beaten up.\n\nIn ''Tales of Monkey Island'' Guybrush wears an outfit very similar to the one he wears in ''LeChuck's Revenge'', although his trousers are brown instead of black and his coat is royal blue instead of marine blue, with a yellow \"S\" pattern over it.\n\nAll of Guybrush's in-game possessions are stored in his pants, even if they are too large to fit (the giant cotton swab in \"Secret\" is one example), except in 'Tales of Monkey Island', in which there are several references to items being stored in Guybrush's jacket.\n\n==Attributes==\n\n===Personality===\n\nIn his first appearance, Guybrush appears youthful, excited and somewhat simple, mirroring the attitude of a child. Guybrush is however noted for his moments of self-assurance which often backfire on him, but is known to possess a razor sharp wit, allowing him to get out of dire situations. In ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'', Guybrush displays a noticeably nastier personality, performing morally wrong acts just to spite or to progress through the game. He has also become much more egotistical from his previous accomplishments, though still displays a sharp wit and clever thinking.\n\nBy ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'', Guybrush's personality seems to be a combination of his previous simple demeanor and nasty disposition. He is shown to be much more friendly and kind than he was in the previous installment, but is also still capable of making rude and sly comments and committing crimes that are a little less than vicious. Regardless, Guybrush is nowhere near as egotistical as he was previously and is much more contained in gloating.\n\nHe appears to have grown rather neurotic by ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]'', where he is also prone to submitting to Elaine's whim due to them now being married, including legally changing his name to Marley-Threepwood. He has however become a much more polite and caring individual, never committing any particularly nasty acts, and even goes to great lengths to help others. He has also developed a considerable amount of conscience, evident by his guilt over stealing something as simple as a coffee mug.\n\nIn the years up to ''[[Tales of Monkey Island]]'', Guybrush matures significantly. He has become more consistently self-assured of his capabilities, has a sharper wit, and is able to stand up to Elaine on a number of occasions. He has also become more compassionate, allowing him to earn the friendship of Winslow (the former Captain of the Screaming Narwhal that he had bested) and Morgan LeFlay (the pirate hunter and his fan). Every shred of his egotism is gone, Guybrush truly and deeply loves Elaine and refuses to give up on saving her and remains immensely loyal to her, while still having the courage to stand his ground and be firm with her when he needs to be. This seems to have caused Elaine to have more respect for him and belief in his skills. His skills have also improved considerably as he is able to hold his own in a sword fight against Morgan LeFlay, the most skilled bounty hunter in all the seas, and even succeeds in defeating her with his sharp wit.\n\nAside from his razor sharp wit, Guybrush also seems to be highly literate, able to read long passages of literature and pronounce extremely complex words and phrases without having to think about it or sound it out. This is surprising as Guybrush mentions several times throughout the series that he dropped out of school and most pirates lack conventional skills in areas of schooling. This may be a testament to Guybrush's more intelligent side and that while he may lack common sense and a complete educational background, he is much smarter than a majority of the characters in the series.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''The Secret of Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|The Secret of Monkey Island}}\nWhen Guybrush first appeared in ''The Secret of Monkey Island'', set in the [[Caribbean]] during a fictional time period, he was an awkward teenager whose sole ambition in life was to be a pirate. Guybrush, although portrayed as an attractive lad in closeups, is a scrawny blonde youth with minimal amounts of courage, intelligence and [[charisma]]. His primary talent is the ability to hold his breath for ten minutes and he certainly appears to be an unlikely candidate to be a [[buccaneer]]. He does exhibit plenty of persistence, however, and doggedly attempts to complete the three trials of piratehood.\n\nIn the course of exploring M\u00eal\u00e9e Island, he meets and immediately falls in love with the [[Monkey Island (series)#Setting|Tri-Island Area]]'s beautiful [[governor]], [[Elaine Marley]]. Guybrush is not the only one interested in Governor Marley, however: the ghost pirate [[LeChuck]] has long been smitten with her; Elaine, however, does not return his affection. She told him to 'drop dead', so he did. When the villain kidnaps Elaine, Guybrush is compelled to try to rescue her from LeChuck's lair on Monkey Island. She proves capable of protecting herself (as she is the former captain of LeChuck's ghost crew), easily escaping LeChuck's clutches (unbeknownst to the bumbling Threepwood). Guybrush, improbably enough, manages to destroy the ghost pirate LeChuck and becomes a fearsome pirate himself.\n\n===''Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge''===\n{{Main|Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge}}\nIn ''Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge'', almost the entire game takes the form of a flashback as Guybrush tells Elaine what happened to him. Thus, it is possible to die by falling into a pit of acid, upon which the game fades back to the storytelling screen, with Elaine asking him to tell what ''really'' happened since obviously he could not have died if he was right there telling her the story.\n\nAs ''LeChuck's Revenge'' begins, Guybrush has embarked on an epic new adventure to find the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. He soon runs into Largo LaGrande, LeChuck's former [[henchman]], on Scabb Island. Largo discovers that Guybrush has LeChuck's ghostly beard, which he has kept as a [[trophy]]; he steals the beard and uses it to reanimate the corpse of his former boss. Thanks to Guybrush, LeChuck is now a seriously angry zombie with [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] powers instead of a disgruntled ghost.\n\nThe Voodoo Lady tells Guybrush that LeChuck can only be stopped by the power of the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. To find it, he must travel to nearby Phatt Island and Booty Island in search of the four pieces of a [[treasure map]]. As he completes the map, he is captured by LeChuck; while attempting to escape, Guybrush causes an enormous explosion that hurls him to Dinky Island. Coincidentally enough, this happens to be where Big Whoop is hidden. Guybrush uses [[dynamite]] to \"dig\" for the treasure and finds himself in a maze of underground, concrete-lined tunnels.\n\nThe remaining portion of ''LeChuck's Revenge'' is [[surrealism|surrealistic]]: One chases the other in a vague abandoned underground place that includes elevators, machines, an office etc. LeChuck claims that he is Guybrush's brother, in a parody of [[Darth Vader]]'s \"I am your father\" scene with [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. After Guybrush finally defeats LeChuck with a [[voodoo doll]], he kneels and removes the pirate's \"mask\". LeChuck is revealed as Guybrush's bullying older brother \"Chuckie\". Suddenly, both Guybrush and Chuckie are children at an amusement park looking like Booty Island, with their parents; both games seem to have been daydreams by a young boy obsessed with pirates. Only a brief scene during the closing credits hints that this may be untrue: Elaine Marley idly wonders if Guybrush has fallen prey to some evil spell of LeChuck's, and we see \"Chucky\" has red eyes with an evil glow.\n\n===''The Curse of Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|The Curse of Monkey Island}}\n\nSimilar to the gap between the first two games, ''Curse of Monkey Island'' opens with Guybrush floating in the Caribbean in a [[bumper car]], writing in a diary. The player learns that the surreal subterranean place and childhood theme park where Monkey Island 2 ended were the result of LeChuck's deceptive spell. LeChuck had built a sinister theme park known as the Carnival of the Damned. The \"revelation\" that they were brothers was simply part of the evil scheme. After an undisclosed period of entrapment, Guybrush managed to escape in a long and conspicuously unrecorded adventure.\n\nWriting his memories, Guybrush suddenly finds himself in the middle of a battle between the forces of Plunder Island (led by Elaine) and LeChuck's undead crew. Guybrush stumbles into LeChuck's cargo hold and finds an enormous diamond ring, which he decides to use to propose to Elaine. Unfortunately, the ring is cursed, and immediately transforms Elaine into a statue made of solid gold. The Voodoo Lady once again provides magical help, informing Guybrush that the curse can only be broken by replacing the ring with another containing a diamond \"of equal or greater value\".\n\nThe ineffectual hero must assemble a pirate crew and sail to Blood Island and Skull Island. Eventually he manages to break the curse and restore Elaine to flesh and blood. LeChuck, who was killed in the earlier battle, resurfaces as a demon pirate and captures Guybrush LeChuck returns Guybrush to the Carnival of the Damned and once again transforms him into a child. Improbably, Guybrush manages to change himself back to normal and blow up a section of the Roller-Coaster of Death, burying LeChuck under a mountain of ice and snow. Elaine and Guybrush finally marry and sail off into the sunset together.\n\n===''Escape from Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|Escape from Monkey Island}}\nAfter a three-month-long [[honeymoon]], Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley-Threepwood return to M\u00eal\u00e9e Island. While the couple was gone, Elaine was declared dead, legally ending her lifetime appointment as governor. The governor's mansion is scheduled for demolition and a slimy politician named Charles L. Charles is poised to take over the position. With no other choice, Elaine begins a desperate campaign for re-election against Charles (who, unsurprisingly, reveals himself to be none other than LeChuck in disguise). As Guybrush wanders around M\u00eal\u00e9e, he finds that all the local businesses are being taken over by Ozzie Mandrill, an [[Australian]] developer who is winning the deeds in matches of various ''insult games'', such as [[insult swordfighting]]. He is also rather annoyed when people refer to him and Elaine as Mr. and Mrs. Marley, rather than Threepwood.\n\nGuybrush discovers that Ozzie wants to take over the entire Caribbean. Ozzie is seeking a powerful voodoo [[Amulet|talisman]] called the Ultimate Insult, which he will use to turn all pirates into clean, productive members of society. LeChuck is helping Ozzie in exchange for Elaine's hand after her will has been broken by the Ultimate Insult.\n\nOnce again, Guybrush must assemble a reluctant crew, sailing this time to Lucre Island and Jambalaya Island before ending up on Monkey Island. There he finds an enormous, [[robot]]ic monkey and uses it to return to M\u00eal\u00e9e. Ozzie has acquired the Ultimate Insult; he uses its power to enslave LeChuck, who has taken on the form of a gigantic statue of himself. Guybrush, piloting his robotic monkey, manages to hold off defeat long enough to allow Elaine to escape. The statue briefly gains a moment of free will, and crushes the scalp-mounted Ozzie as well as the Ultimate Insult. The power of the Insult causes an immense explosion that seemingly destroys LeChuck as well.\n\n===''Tales of Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|Tales of Monkey Island}}\n''Tales of Monkey Island'' opens with Guybrush catching up with LeChuck and Elaine, who was abducted by the undead pirate once again along with the Monkeys of Montevideo. While LeChuck is casting a spell on the monkeys, Guybrush attempts to kill LeChuck with a voodoo cutlass he assembled, but corrupts the voodoo spell needed to perfect the sword by using grog instead of voodoo [[root beer]]. The result is LeChuck transforming into a human and his voodoo energies being released in the form of the Pox of LeChuck. An explosion results in Guybrush being stranded on Flotsam Island, while the pox infects pirates all over the Caribbean. While on the island, Guybrush meets his old friend the Voodoo Lady, who informs him on the myths of La Esponja Grande, the only known cure of the pox, and tells him to find her former lover, Coronado De Cava, to find it.\n\nAs Guybrush continues his quest, he enlists Reginald Van Winslow as his first mate and crosses paths with the insane Marquis De Singe, who is seeking to use the pox in Guybrush's hand for his own purposes, and Morgan LeFlay, a pirate bounty hunter who idolizes Guybrush and was hired by De Singe to obtain his hand. After losing his hand and defeating Morgan, Guybrush reunites with Elaine on the Jerkbait Islands and is forced to work with a seemingly reformed LeChuck to obtain the summoning artifacts to help him find La Esponja before poxed pirates do. When Guybrush acquires all three artifacts, stops the poxed pirates, and summons the creatures that will guide him to La Esponja, Guybrush goes off to find the sponge while Elaine stays with LeChuck to help him in returning the Monkeys of Montevideo to their proper habitats.\n\nWhile Guybrush and Winslow follow the creatures, they are intercepted by Morgan again who has returned to capture Guybrush for De Singe. Before any harm is done however, all three are swallowed by a giant Manatee, which guides them to the location of the sponge. While in the manatee en route to La Esponja, Guybrush meets an unstable Coronado and collaborates with Morgan, posing as his wife, to get out of the manatee and obtain the sponge. Even though Morgan falls for Guybrush, she betrays him after he obtains La Esponja and hands him back to De Singe on Flotsam Island. Guybrush is taken away by an angry mob however, and is placed on trial for causing the \"Pox of LeChuck\", in which Guybrush is able to stall long enough for Elaine, who is deeply infected by the pox, and LeChuck to come to his aid. LeChuck ultimately saves Guybrush by blaming himself for the pox and reveals the Voodoo Lady has been manipulating the events of the whole series for her own agenda. Guybrush is released and is able to amplify the strength of La Esponja, uses it to cure the pox, and kills De Singe to save his wife from his experiments.\n\nLeChuck however reveals his hand and murders Morgan and Guybrush, revealing the pox and his human transformation to being a part of his plans to find and use La Esponja Grande to obtain infinite voodoo energy directly from the Crossroads and conquer the seas. The Monkeys of Montevideo are revealed to have been hypnotized by LeChuck and placed in strategic locations around the Gulf of Melange to open up the entrance to the Crossroads rather being brought back to their natural habitats. Guybrush arrives at the Crossroads as LeChuck takes over the seas and becomes the Demon Pirate God by using La Esponja to absorb limitless voodoo energy from the Crossroads. Guybrush is able to return to the land of the living first as a ghost and later as zombie, but learns Elaine is under LeChuck's control through the voodoo energy La Esponja is supplying him with. With Morgan's help and the Voodoo Lady's guidance, Guybrush reverses the powers of La Esponja, saves Elaine from LeChuck's control, and banishes LeChuck back to the Crossroads after a brutal showdown with the villain. He is ultimately able to return fully alive with Elaine's wedding ring, given to him earlier in the game.\n\n===Other appearances===\nGuybrush is paid homage to in the [[Naughty Dog]] video game, ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'', where a pirate with major similarities is featured as one of the twelve pirate captains that founded Libertalia.

Since the character had no name at this point, the file was simply called '<tt>Guy</tt>'. When the file was saved, [[Steve Purcell]], the artist responsible for the sprite, added '<tt>brush</tt>' to the [[filename]], indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint \"brush file\" for the \"Guy\" sprite.

G. Wodehouse]]'s family of characters including [[Galahad Threepwood]] and [[Freddie Threepwood]] (with whom he shares similar characteristics). \"Threepwood\" is also rumoured to have been the name of [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]]'s [[Role-playing game|RPG]] character.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scummbar.com/resources/faq/ |title=Frequently asked questions about Monkey Island |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817214824/http://www.scummbar.com/resources/faq/ |archivedate=2007-08-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Incarnations==\nGuybrush's age is not defined in the game, though he may be seventeen years old in ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]''; in the second game, ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'', while obtaining fake identification (a library card) in the Phatt City library, a slip of the tongue (\"nine....errr, twenty one\") suggests that he may be nineteen.\nHe is twenty years old in ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'' as he proves to ''Dinghy Dog'' when he tries to guess Guybrush's age and Guybrush proves it with his ''SCUMM'' Actors Guild Membership Card, although, in the most recent game, Elaine states it was three years between ''Monkey Island 2'' and ''3'' (she was in a poxed rage during this statement, and that Stan mentioned it was three months). ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]'' takes place three months after ''Curse'', following Guybrush and Elaine's honeymoon, while it is stated in-game that ''[[Tales of Monkey Island]]'' takes place roughly ten years since Guybrush became a pirate, making him 27\u201328 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telltalegames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13180&page=3 |title=How old is Guybrush exactly? - Page 3 - Telltale Games Forums |publisher=Telltalegames.com |accessdate=2012-08-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009052420/http://www.telltalegames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13180&page=3 |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> However, Guybrush often lies about his age, for example telling the librarian that he was 21 in the aforementioned Phatt library in ''LeChuck's Revenge''.\n\nGuybrush grows a beard and moustache in the second game, but is shaven in the third and fourth games. Guybrush makes a reference that he lost his beard between the second and third game but cannot remember what happened to it; in the third game however, if one tries to use the shaving cream, Guybrush says that he shaved last week. In the second game, his hair (possibly just for humorous effect) is in two scenes shown to be a wig which flies off his head when he gets frightened by two fake incarnations of [[LeChuck]], revealing a shaven pate. In all other versions, his hair growth apparently remains natural.\n\nIn ''LeChuck's Revenge'', Guybrush meets delusionary incarnations of his parents, stating that they have abandoned him when he was younger. Details pertaining to this abandonment, however, remain undisclosed, nor is it made clear whether this is what actually happened or if Guybrush was merely having a delusion or misconception about this event.\n\nIn ''Escape from Monkey Island'' Guybrush's middle name is revealed to be [[Odysseus|Ulysses]].\n\n===Attire===\nIn ''Secret of Monkey Island'' Guybrush wears a white [[Poet shirt|blouse]]; he wears a similar blouse in all the other games as well but this one appears to have shorter sleeves (although they could simply be folded). He wears black [[breeches]], white socks and small, black shoes. In ''LeChuck's Revenge'' his attire changes radically, consisting of boots, a long, blue coat and two belts, one of which is worn across his chest. In ''Curse of Monkey Island'' Guybrush's attire is similar to his attire in the first game, but he has brown breeches instead of black and a small brown [[waistcoat]] and red cummerbund sash.\n\nIn ''Escape from Monkey Island'' Guybrush has multiple outfits, which change during the game. He starts with a red, buttoned-up jacket, boots and a large belt with a belt buckle that has his initials on it (an [[in-joke]] from ''[[Grim Fandango]]''). When venturing to Lucre and Jambalaya Island he wears a similar outfit to his appearance in the first game, except that his trousers are a light blue and his shirt has longer sleeves. When he is once more stranded on Monkey Island in the third act he wears his red jacket, but no shoes. His trousers have been ripped from knee down and his jacket seems slightly beaten up.\n\nIn ''Tales of Monkey Island'' Guybrush wears an outfit very similar to the one he wears in ''LeChuck's Revenge'', although his trousers are brown instead of black and his coat is royal blue instead of marine blue, with a yellow \"S\" pattern over it.\n\nAll of Guybrush's in-game possessions are stored in his pants, even if they are too large to fit (the giant cotton swab in \"Secret\" is one example), except in 'Tales of Monkey Island', in which there are several references to items being stored in Guybrush's jacket.\n\n==Attributes==\n\n===Personality===\n\nIn his first appearance, Guybrush appears youthful, excited and somewhat simple, mirroring the attitude of a child. Guybrush is however noted for his moments of self-assurance which often backfire on him, but is known to possess a razor sharp wit, allowing him to get out of dire situations. In ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'', Guybrush displays a noticeably nastier personality, performing morally wrong acts just to spite or to progress through the game. He has also become much more egotistical from his previous accomplishments, though still displays a sharp wit and clever thinking.\n\nBy ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'', Guybrush's personality seems to be a combination of his previous simple demeanor and nasty disposition. He is shown to be much more friendly and kind than he was in the previous installment, but is also still capable of making rude and sly comments and committing crimes that are a little less than vicious. Regardless, Guybrush is nowhere near as egotistical as he was previously and is much more contained in gloating.\n\nHe appears to have grown rather neurotic by ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]'', where he is also prone to submitting to Elaine's whim due to them now being married, including legally changing his name to Marley-Threepwood. He has however become a much more polite and caring individual, never committing any particularly nasty acts, and even goes to great lengths to help others. He has also developed a considerable amount of conscience, evident by his guilt over stealing something as simple as a coffee mug.\n\nIn the years up to ''[[Tales of Monkey Island]]'', Guybrush matures significantly. He has become more consistently self-assured of his capabilities, has a sharper wit, and is able to stand up to Elaine on a number of occasions. He has also become more compassionate, allowing him to earn the friendship of Winslow (the former Captain of the Screaming Narwhal that he had bested) and Morgan LeFlay (the pirate hunter and his fan). Every shred of his egotism is gone, Guybrush truly and deeply loves Elaine and refuses to give up on saving her and remains immensely loyal to her, while still having the courage to stand his ground and be firm with her when he needs to be. This seems to have caused Elaine to have more respect for him and belief in his skills. His skills have also improved considerably as he is able to hold his own in a sword fight against Morgan LeFlay, the most skilled bounty hunter in all the seas, and even succeeds in defeating her with his sharp wit.\n\nAside from his razor sharp wit, Guybrush also seems to be highly literate, able to read long passages of literature and pronounce extremely complex words and phrases without having to think about it or sound it out. This is surprising as Guybrush mentions several times throughout the series that he dropped out of school and most pirates lack conventional skills in areas of schooling. This may be a testament to Guybrush's more intelligent side and that while he may lack common sense and a complete educational background, he is much smarter than a majority of the characters in the series.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''The Secret of Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|The Secret of Monkey Island}}\nWhen Guybrush first appeared in ''The Secret of Monkey Island'', set in the [[Caribbean]] during a fictional time period, he was an awkward teenager whose sole ambition in life was to be a pirate. Guybrush, although portrayed as an attractive lad in closeups, is a scrawny blonde youth with minimal amounts of courage, intelligence and [[charisma]]. His primary talent is the ability to hold his breath for ten minutes and he certainly appears to be an unlikely candidate to be a [[buccaneer]]. He does exhibit plenty of persistence, however, and doggedly attempts to complete the three trials of piratehood.\n\nIn the course of exploring M\u00eal\u00e9e Island, he meets and immediately falls in love with the [[Monkey Island (series)#Setting|Tri-Island Area]]'s beautiful [[governor]], [[Elaine Marley]]. Guybrush is not the only one interested in Governor Marley, however: the ghost pirate [[LeChuck]] has long been smitten with her; Elaine, however, does not return his affection. She told him to 'drop dead', so he did. When the villain kidnaps Elaine, Guybrush is compelled to try to rescue her from LeChuck's lair on Monkey Island. She proves capable of protecting herself (as she is the former captain of LeChuck's ghost crew), easily escaping LeChuck's clutches (unbeknownst to the bumbling Threepwood). Guybrush, improbably enough, manages to destroy the ghost pirate LeChuck and becomes a fearsome pirate himself.\n\n===''Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge''===\n{{Main|Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge}}\nIn ''Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge'', almost the entire game takes the form of a flashback as Guybrush tells Elaine what happened to him. Thus, it is possible to die by falling into a pit of acid, upon which the game fades back to the storytelling screen, with Elaine asking him to tell what ''really'' happened since obviously he could not have died if he was right there telling her the story.\n\nAs ''LeChuck's Revenge'' begins, Guybrush has embarked on an epic new adventure to find the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. He soon runs into Largo LaGrande, LeChuck's former [[henchman]], on Scabb Island. Largo discovers that Guybrush has LeChuck's ghostly beard, which he has kept as a [[trophy]]; he steals the beard and uses it to reanimate the corpse of his former boss. Thanks to Guybrush, LeChuck is now a seriously angry zombie with [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] powers instead of a disgruntled ghost.\n\nThe Voodoo Lady tells Guybrush that LeChuck can only be stopped by the power of the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. To find it, he must travel to nearby Phatt Island and Booty Island in search of the four pieces of a [[treasure map]]. As he completes the map, he is captured by LeChuck; while attempting to escape, Guybrush causes an enormous explosion that hurls him to Dinky Island. Coincidentally enough, this happens to be where Big Whoop is hidden. Guybrush uses [[dynamite]] to \"dig\" for the treasure and finds himself in a maze of underground, concrete-lined tunnels.\n\nThe remaining portion of ''LeChuck's Revenge'' is [[surrealism|surrealistic]]: One chases the other in a vague abandoned underground place that includes elevators, machines, an office etc. LeChuck claims that he is Guybrush's brother, in a parody of [[Darth Vader]]'s \"I am your father\" scene with [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. After Guybrush finally defeats LeChuck with a [[voodoo doll]], he kneels and removes the pirate's \"mask\". LeChuck is revealed as Guybrush's bullying older brother \"Chuckie\". Suddenly, both Guybrush and Chuckie are children at an amusement park looking like Booty Island, with their parents; both games seem to have been daydreams by a young boy obsessed with pirates. Only a brief scene during the closing credits hints that this may be untrue: Elaine Marley idly wonders if Guybrush has fallen prey to some evil spell of LeChuck's, and we see \"Chucky\" has red eyes with an evil glow.\n\n===''The Curse of Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|The Curse of Monkey Island}}\n\nSimilar to the gap between the first two games, ''Curse of Monkey Island'' opens with Guybrush floating in the Caribbean in a [[bumper car]], writing in a diary. The player learns that the surreal subterranean place and childhood theme park where Monkey Island 2 ended were the result of LeChuck's deceptive spell. LeChuck had built a sinister theme park known as the Carnival of the Damned. The \"revelation\" that they were brothers was simply part of the evil scheme. After an undisclosed period of entrapment, Guybrush managed to escape in a long and conspicuously unrecorded adventure.\n\nWriting his memories, Guybrush suddenly finds himself in the middle of a battle between the forces of Plunder Island (led by Elaine) and LeChuck's undead crew. Guybrush stumbles into LeChuck's cargo hold and finds an enormous diamond ring, which he decides to use to propose to Elaine. Unfortunately, the ring is cursed, and immediately transforms Elaine into a statue made of solid gold. The Voodoo Lady once again provides magical help, informing Guybrush that the curse can only be broken by replacing the ring with another containing a diamond \"of equal or greater value\".\n\nThe ineffectual hero must assemble a pirate crew and sail to Blood Island and Skull Island. Eventually he manages to break the curse and restore Elaine to flesh and blood. LeChuck, who was killed in the earlier battle, resurfaces as a demon pirate and captures Guybrush LeChuck returns Guybrush to the Carnival of the Damned and once again transforms him into a child. Improbably, Guybrush manages to change himself back to normal and blow up a section of the Roller-Coaster of Death, burying LeChuck under a mountain of ice and snow. Elaine and Guybrush finally marry and sail off into the sunset together.\n\n===''Escape from Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|Escape from Monkey Island}}\nAfter a three-month-long [[honeymoon]], Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley-Threepwood return to M\u00eal\u00e9e Island. While the couple was gone, Elaine was declared dead, legally ending her lifetime appointment as governor. The governor's mansion is scheduled for demolition and a slimy politician named Charles L. Charles is poised to take over the position. With no other choice, Elaine begins a desperate campaign for re-election against Charles (who, unsurprisingly, reveals himself to be none other than LeChuck in disguise). As Guybrush wanders around M\u00eal\u00e9e, he finds that all the local businesses are being taken over by Ozzie Mandrill, an [[Australian]] developer who is winning the deeds in matches of various ''insult games'', such as [[insult swordfighting]]. He is also rather annoyed when people refer to him and Elaine as Mr. and Mrs. Marley, rather than Threepwood.\n\nGuybrush discovers that Ozzie wants to take over the entire Caribbean. Ozzie is seeking a powerful voodoo [[Amulet|talisman]] called the Ultimate Insult, which he will use to turn all pirates into clean, productive members of society. LeChuck is helping Ozzie in exchange for Elaine's hand after her will has been broken by the Ultimate Insult.\n\nOnce again, Guybrush must assemble a reluctant crew, sailing this time to Lucre Island and Jambalaya Island before ending up on Monkey Island. There he finds an enormous, [[robot]]ic monkey and uses it to return to M\u00eal\u00e9e. Ozzie has acquired the Ultimate Insult; he uses its power to enslave LeChuck, who has taken on the form of a gigantic statue of himself. Guybrush, piloting his robotic monkey, manages to hold off defeat long enough to allow Elaine to escape. The statue briefly gains a moment of free will, and crushes the scalp-mounted Ozzie as well as the Ultimate Insult. The power of the Insult causes an immense explosion that seemingly destroys LeChuck as well.\n\n===''Tales of Monkey Island''===\n{{Main|Tales of Monkey Island}}\n''Tales of Monkey Island'' opens with Guybrush catching up with LeChuck and Elaine, who was abducted by the undead pirate once again along with the Monkeys of Montevideo. While LeChuck is casting a spell on the monkeys, Guybrush attempts to kill LeChuck with a voodoo cutlass he assembled, but corrupts the voodoo spell needed to perfect the sword by using grog instead of voodoo [[root beer]]. The result is LeChuck transforming into a human and his voodoo energies being released in the form of the Pox of LeChuck. An explosion results in Guybrush being stranded on Flotsam Island, while the pox infects pirates all over the Caribbean. While on the island, Guybrush meets his old friend the Voodoo Lady, who informs him on the myths of La Esponja Grande, the only known cure of the pox, and tells him to find her former lover, Coronado De Cava, to find it.\n\nAs Guybrush continues his quest, he enlists Reginald Van Winslow as his first mate and crosses paths with the insane Marquis De Singe, who is seeking to use the pox in Guybrush's hand for his own purposes, and Morgan LeFlay, a pirate bounty hunter who idolizes Guybrush and was hired by De Singe to obtain his hand. After losing his hand and defeating Morgan, Guybrush reunites with Elaine on the Jerkbait Islands and is forced to work with a seemingly reformed LeChuck to obtain the summoning artifacts to help him find La Esponja before poxed pirates do. When Guybrush acquires all three artifacts, stops the poxed pirates, and summons the creatures that will guide him to La Esponja, Guybrush goes off to find the sponge while Elaine stays with LeChuck to help him in returning the Monkeys of Montevideo to their proper habitats.\n\nWhile Guybrush and Winslow follow the creatures, they are intercepted by Morgan again who has returned to capture Guybrush for De Singe. Before any harm is done however, all three are swallowed by a giant Manatee, which guides them to the location of the sponge. While in the manatee en route to La Esponja, Guybrush meets an unstable Coronado and collaborates with Morgan, posing as his wife, to get out of the manatee and obtain the sponge. Even though Morgan falls for Guybrush, she betrays him after he obtains La Esponja and hands him back to De Singe on Flotsam Island. Guybrush is taken away by an angry mob however, and is placed on trial for causing the \"Pox of LeChuck\", in which Guybrush is able to stall long enough for Elaine, who is deeply infected by the pox, and LeChuck to come to his aid. LeChuck ultimately saves Guybrush by blaming himself for the pox and reveals the Voodoo Lady has been manipulating the events of the whole series for her own agenda. Guybrush is released and is able to amplify the strength of La Esponja, uses it to cure the pox, and kills De Singe to save his wife from his experiments.\n\nLeChuck however reveals his hand and murders Morgan and Guybrush, revealing the pox and his human transformation to being a part of his plans to find and use La Esponja Grande to obtain infinite voodoo energy directly from the Crossroads and conquer the seas. The Monkeys of Montevideo are revealed to have been hypnotized by LeChuck and placed in strategic locations around the Gulf of Melange to open up the entrance to the Crossroads rather being brought back to their natural habitats. Guybrush arrives at the Crossroads as LeChuck takes over the seas and becomes the Demon Pirate God by using La Esponja to absorb limitless voodoo energy from the Crossroads. Guybrush is able to return to the land of the living first as a ghost and later as zombie, but learns Elaine is under LeChuck's control through the voodoo energy La Esponja is supplying him with. With Morgan's help and the Voodoo Lady's guidance, Guybrush reverses the powers of La Esponja, saves Elaine from LeChuck's control, and banishes LeChuck back to the Crossroads after a brutal showdown with the villain. He is ultimately able to return fully alive with Elaine's wedding ring, given to him earlier in the game.\n\n===Other appearances===\nGuybrush is paid homage to in the [[Naughty Dog]] video game, ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'', where a pirate with major similarities is featured as one of the twelve pirate captains that founded Libertalia. Although he remains unnamed throughout the game, the resemblance is uncanny and his [[Jolly Roger|sigil]] is represented by a monkey. His portrait can be seen in the Libertalia treasury with the other founders and though his name is partly scratched out, the letters still visible spell out the truncated name \"Guy Wood\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://de.ign.com/uncharted-ps4/113528/feature/uncharted-4-easter-eggs-monkey-island-crash-bandicoot-und-co-im-ps4-abenteuer|title=Uncharted 4 Easter Eggs: Monkey Island, Crash Bandicoot und Co. im PS4-Abenteuer|date=2016-05-12}}</ref>\n\nGuybrush appears in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'' as \"Guybrush Threepkiller\" \u2013 a playable skin for [[Starkiller]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Contact Michael McWhertor: Comment |url=http://kotaku.com/5650500/i-am-guybrush-threepwood-mighty-jedi-apprentice |title=I Am Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty...
