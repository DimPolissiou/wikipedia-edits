It lies approximately {{convert|4|mi}} south of [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] and {{convert|25|mi}} east of [[Edinburgh]].\n\nIt groups around the Colstoun Water (locally called Gifford Water) at the junction of the B6369 and B6355 surrounded by rural farmland.\n\n==History==\nThe village takes its name from the 13th-century Sir [[Hugo de Giffard]] of [[Yester House|Yester]], whose ancient [[Scoto-Norman]] family possessed the baronies of Yester, [[Morham]], and [[Duncanlaw]] in [[Haddingtonshire]], and Tayling and Poldame in the counties of [[Perthshire]] and [[Forfar]].<ref>Gifford, John, ''East Lothian Villages'', East Lothian, 1975</ref>\n\nThe first Hugo de Giffard's grandson, Hugh de Giffard, was a noted magician<ref>McWilliam, Colin, ''Lothian Except Edinburgh'', London, 1978: 215</ref> who built [[Yester Castle]] ({{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=out|disp=or}} south-east of the present-day [[Yester House]]), the ruins and an underground chamber (the 'Goblin Ha') of which can be seen in Yester Wood. The same ''Hobgoblin Hall'' featured in the poem \"[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]\" by [[Walter Scott]].<ref>ed [[William Henry Oliphant Smeaton|Smeaton, Oliphant]], ''Poems of Scott'' - ''Marmion: The Host's Tale'', London</ref>\n\nThe [[Mercat Cross]] was built in 1780 and is still standing in the centre of the village.<ref>McWilliam, Colin, 1978: 209</ref>\n\nThe [[ITV Network|ITV]] television series ''[[Adam Smith (TV series)|Adam Smith]]'' was filmed in and around Gifford in the early 1970s.\n\n==Former industries==\nThe initial chief industry in the town was the paper mill, which was once the source of the [[Bank of Scotland]]'s bank notes. However, this mill closed in the late 18th century and since then the village has largely been residential and supported local farming communities, although a pottery, known as Castle Wynd Pottery, operated at Gifford for a short time in the 1950s.\n\n==Church==\n{{main|Yester Parish Church}}\nThe earliest recorded presence of a church in the area is in 1241, the ruins of which lie in the woods beside Yester House, to the south-west of the village centre. A church also once stood at Duncanlaw, a former settlement to the south-east of the main village.  The present building (in the centre of the village) was built in 1710.<ref>McWilliam, Colin, 1978: 208</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure and amenities==\nGifford was the terminus on a branch railway which was originally intended to extend to [[Garvald, East Lothian|Garvald]] and was built by the [[Gifford and Garvald Railway|Gifford and Garvald Light Railway Company]]. The company seal, which features the Mercat Cross, is in the Glasgow Museum of Transport. The line was operated by the [[North British Railway]] and then the [[London and North Eastern Railway]]. The section of line to Gifford was closed in 1947, following the loss of a bridge washed away by flooding. [[British Rail]]ways operated the line as far as [[East Saltoun and West Saltoun|East Saltoun]] until the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching cuts]] of the 1960s.\n\nThe village has a school, church, several shops, two traditional hotels and a garage. A bus service, operated by Prentice Coaches, connects the village to [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] and [[Pencaitland]].\n\nLike the church, the school takes the name of the parish, as Yester Primary School. The current school building was built in 1968, when East Lothian County Council reorganised schooling arrangements in the area. Yester Primary was expanded to accommodate children from the small schools in [[Bolton, East Lothian|Bolton]], [[Morham]], [[Garvald, East Lothian|Garvald]] and Longyester, which were all closed between 1968 and 1971. The school roll in recent years has been around 150 pupils, plus up to 40 children in the attached nursery. Secondary education is provided at [[Knox Academy]], in Haddington.\n\nA large park (known as the [[Bleachfield]], from its historic use) lies near the centre of the village, and the East Lothian Core Paths network has been expanded to improve access to the surrounding countryside. The village has two golf courses. Gifford Golf Club is on the western edge of the village, while Castle Park Golf Club is to the south. The Gifford Cup is an annual golf event, which is held in alternate years between the two courses.\n\nIn 2017 the local Gifford community bought {{convert|55|acre}} of woodland to the north west of the village,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/our-region/east-lothian-group-wins-300k-grant-for-woodland-purchase-1-4318757|title=East Lothian group wins \u00a3300k grant for woodland purchase|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}</ref> which comprises Fawn Wood, Speedy Wood and Station Yard, next to the former [[Gifford and Garvald Railway|Gifford railway station]].
