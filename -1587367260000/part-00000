The ministry was established in 1814 as the Royal Ministry of Church and Education Affairs.\n\nThe current Minister of Education and Integration is [[Guri Melby]] of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and the current Minister of Research and Higher Education is [[Henrik Asheim]] of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].\n\nThe department reports to the legislature ([[Storting]]et). Traditionally this ministry was also responsible for church affairs, but this function was transferred to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs|Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs]] in 2002.\n\n==History==\n\nThe ministry was established in 1814, following the dissolution of the united kingdom of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], in which the joint central government administration of the two formally separate but closely integrated kingdoms had been based in [[Copenhagen]]. Originally named the Ministry of Church and Education Affairs, the ministry was the first of six government ministries established in 1814, and was also known as the First Ministry. The other ministries were the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Police, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of War. Although Norway was in a loose [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]] with a common foreign and defence policy until 1905, church and education policy was entirely the domain of the respective national governments.\n\n==Organisations==\n===Political staff<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/about-the-ministry/other-political-staff.html?id=608 Ministry of Education and Research \u2013 Political staff]</ref>===\n* [[Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8e Isaksen]], minister of Education and Research ([[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]])\n* State Secretaries, [[Bj\u00f8rn Haugstad]] and [[Birgitte Jordahl]]\n* Political Adviser, [[Magnus Thue]]\n\n===Departments===\n* Department of Administration and Development\n* Department of Early Childhood Education and Care<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/About-the-Ministry/Organisation.html?id=610 |title=Organisation |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research}}</ref>\n* Department of Education and Training\n* Department of Governance and Finance\n* Department of Higher Education\n* Department of Policy Analysis, Lifelong Learning and International Affairs\n* Department of Research\n* The Communication Unit\n\n===Subsidiaries===\nThe following [[etat|government agencies]] are subordinate to the ministry:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dep/Underliggende-etater.html?id=115208 |title=Underliggende etater |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n* [[Research Council of Norway]] ''Norges forskningsr\u00e5d'' ([http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Home_page/1177315753906 Official site]) In charge of research funding and research policy.\n* [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]], or ''Utdanningsdirektoratetet'' ([http://www.udir.no Official site]) Responsible for the development of primary and secondary education.

The ministry was established in 1814 as the Royal Ministry of Church and Education Affairs.\n\nThe current Minister of Education and Integration is [[Guri Melby]] of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and the current Minister of Research and Higher Education is [[Henrik Asheim]] of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].\n\nThe department reports to the legislature ([[Storting]]et). Traditionally this ministry was also responsible for church affairs, but this function was transferred to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs|Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs]] in 2002.\n\n==History==\n\nThe ministry was established in 1814, following the dissolution of the united kingdom of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], in which the joint central government administration of the two formally separate but closely integrated kingdoms had been based in [[Copenhagen]]. Originally named the Ministry of Church and Education Affairs, the ministry was the first of six government ministries established in 1814, and was also known as the First Ministry. The other ministries were the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Police, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of War. Although Norway was in a loose [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]] with a common foreign and defence policy until 1905, church and education policy was entirely the domain of the respective national governments.\n\n==Organisations==\n===Political staff<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/about-the-ministry/other-political-staff.html?id=608 Ministry of Education and Research \u2013 Political staff]</ref>===\n* [[Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8e Isaksen]], minister of Education and Research ([[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]])\n* State Secretaries, [[Bj\u00f8rn Haugstad]] and [[Birgitte Jordahl]]\n* Political Adviser, [[Magnus Thue]]\n\n===Departments===\n* Department of Administration and Development\n* Department of Early Childhood Education and Care<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/About-the-Ministry/Organisation.html?id=610 |title=Organisation |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research}}</ref>\n* Department of Education and Training\n* Department of Governance and Finance\n* Department of Higher Education\n* Department of Policy Analysis, Lifelong Learning and International Affairs\n* Department of Research\n* The Communication Unit\n\n===Subsidiaries===\nThe following [[etat|government agencies]] are subordinate to the ministry:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dep/Underliggende-etater.html?id=115208 |title=Underliggende etater |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |author=Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n* [[Research Council of Norway]] ''Norges forskningsr\u00e5d'' ([http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Home_page/1177315753906 Official site]) In charge of research funding and research policy.\n* [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]], or ''Utdanningsdirektoratetet'' ([http://www.udir.no Official site]) Responsible for the development of primary and secondary education.

For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of ''being circular'' or ''exemplifying circularity'',<ref>Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3</ref> or bear the same name, \"circular cup holder\" or two daughters that have in common ''being the female offsprings of Frank.'' There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female,being a potato, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.<ref>Loux (2001), p. 4</ref> While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in [[reality]] or merely in thought, speech and sight or do not exist at all.\n\nThe problem of universals relates to a number of questions in close relation to not only metaphysics but, to [[logic]] and [[epistemology]], all in efforts to understand how the thought of universals has a connection to those of singular properties.<ref name=\"Stanford Universals\">{{Citation|last=Klima|first=Gyula|title=The Medieval Problem of Universals|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/universals-medieval/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\nExamples for application of \"exist\": plato do not exist but was existed, pegasus did not exist; do not exist and will not exist, \"you\" exist, \"you\" will probably exist  tomorrow.\n\n==Ancient philosophy==\nThe problem of universals is considered a central issue in traditional metaphysics and can be traced back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]'s philosophy,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stamos|first=David N.|title=The Species Problem: Biological Species, Ontology, and the Metaphysics of Biology|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2003|isbn=0-7391-0503-5|location=Lanham, MD|pages=8}}</ref> particularly in their attempt to explain the nature and status of forms.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Loux|first=Michael J.|title=Metaphysics: Contemporary Readings|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0-415-26108-2|location=London|pages=3}}</ref> These philosophers explored the problem through predication.\n\n====Plato====\nPlato believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or [[substantial form|forms]]: one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have [[knowledge]] about the latter.  For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general.<ref>MacLeod & Rubenstein (2006), \u00a71b.</ref>  For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [[Allegory of the cave|sunlight]], while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [[Allegory of the cave|shadows]]. This [[Platonic realism]], however, in denying that the [[theory of forms|eternal Forms]] are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.\n\nOne of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said \"I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy|others=Translated by Guy Davenport|title=Herakleitos and Diogenes|publisher=Grey Fox Press|location=Bolinas|year=1979|pages=[https://archive.org/details/herakleitosdioge00hera/page/57 57]|isbn=0-912516-35-6|url=https://archive.org/details/herakleitosdioge00hera/page/57}}</ref>\n\n====Aristotle====\n{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\n\nPlato's student Aristotle disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into \"[[Four causes#Formal cause|formal causes]]\", the blueprints or [[essence]]s of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized [[geometry]], Aristotle emphasized [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of [[natural kind]]s. The philosopher distinguished highest genera like animal and species like man but he maintained that both are predicated of individual men.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Berchman|first=Robert|title=Studies on Plato, Aristotle and Proclus: The Collected Essays on Ancient Philosophy of John Cleary, Volume 15|last2=Finamore|first2=John|publisher=BRILL|year=2013|isbn=978-90-04-23323-2|location=Leiden|pages=364}}</ref> This was considered part of an approach to the principle of things, which adheres to the criterion that what is most universal is also most real.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nConsider for example a particular [[oak]] tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical [[Empiricism|empiricist]] and a founder of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Aristotle was a new, [[Moderate realism|moderate]] sort of realist about universals.\n\n==Medieval philosophy==\n\n====Boethius====\nThe problem was introduced to the medieval world by [[Boethius]], by his translation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]. It begins:\n\n\"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_02_translation.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories of Aristotle (1853) vol. 2. pp.609-633.|last=Porphyry|date=|website=www.tertullian.org}}</ref>\n\nBoethius, in his commentaries on the aforementioned translation, says that a universal, if it were to exist has to apply to several particulars entirely. He also specifies that they apply simultaneously at once and not in a temporal succession. He reasons that they cannot be mind-independent, i.e. they do not have a real existence, because a quality cannot be both one thing and common to many particulars in such a way that it forms part of a particular's substance, as it would then be partaking of universality and particularity. However, he also says that universals can't also be of the mind since a mental construct of a quality is an abstraction and understanding of something outside of the mind. He concludes that this representation is either a true understanding of the quality, in which case we revert to the earlier problem faced by those who believe universals are real. Conversely, if the mental abstractions were not a true understanding, then 'what is understood otherwise than the thing is false'.<ref name=\"Stanford Universals\" />\n\nHis solution to this problem was to state that the mind is able to separate in thought what is not necessarily separable in reality. He cites the human mind's ability to abstract from concrete particulars as an instance of this. This, according to Boethius, avoids the problem of Platonic universals being out there in the real world, but also the problem of them being purely constructs of the mind in that universals are simply the mind thinking of particulars in an abstract, universal way.<ref name=\"Stanford Universals\" /> His assumption focuses on the problems that language create. Boethius maintained that the structure of language corresponds to the structure of things and that language creates what he called as philosophical babble of confused and contradictory accounts of the nature of things.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Eileen|title=Logic, Theology and Poetry in Boethius, Anselm, Abelard, and Alan of Lille: Words in the Absence of Things|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=978-1-349-73540-2|location=New York|pages=9-10}}</ref> To illustrate his view, suppose that although the mind cannot think of 2 or 4 as an odd number, as this would be a false representation, it can think of an even number that is neither 2 nor 4.\n\n===Medieval realism===\n{{main|Medieval realism}}\nBoethius stayed quite close to Aristotle in his thinking about universals. Realism was also argued for by both [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) and [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265-1308). Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct;<ref>On Being and Essence, Ch I.</ref> in this regard he is also Aristotelian. \n\n[[Duns Scotus]] argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a [[formal distinction]].<ref>Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2</ref> Scotus believed that universals exist only inside the things that they exemplify, and that they \"contract\" with the [[haecceity]] of the thing to create the individual. As a result of his realist position, he argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for [[Scotist realism]], a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard. That is to say, Scotus believed that such properties as 'redness' and 'roundness' exist in reality and are mind-independent entities. \n\nFurthermore, Duns Scotus wrote about this problem in his own commentary (''Quaestiones'') on Porphyry's ''Isagoge'', as Boethius had done. Scotus was interested in how the mind forms universals, and he believed this to be 'caused by the intellect'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scotus |first1=Duns |title=Quaestiones in librum Porphyrii Isagoge |pages=q. 4 proemium}}</ref> This intellect acts on the basis that the nature of, say, 'humanity' that is found in other humans and also that the quality is attributable to other individual humans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Noone |first=Timothy B. |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=Thomas |title=The Cambridge Companion to Duns Scotus |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2003 |pages=100\u2013129 |chapter=Universals and Individuation |isbn=978-0-521-63563-9}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval nominalism===\n{{main|Medieval nominalism}}\n[[File:William_of_Ockham.png|thumb|150px|William of Ockham]]\nThe opposing view to realism is one called nominalism, which at its strongest maintains that universals are verbal constructs and that they do not inhere in objects or pre-exist them. Therefore, universals in this view are something which are peculiar to [[cognition|human cognition]] and language. The French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (1050\u20131125) was an early, prominent proponent of this view. His particular view was that universals are little more than vocal utterances (''voces'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salisbury |first1=John of |editor1-last=Webb |editor1-first=Clemens C.I. |title=Metalogicon 2.17 |date=1929 |publisher=Oxford |page=92}}</ref>\n\n[[William of Ockham]] (1285-1347) wrote extensively on this topic. He argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words or concepts (at best) that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.<ref>{{Citation|last=Panaccio|first=Claude|last2=Spade|first2=Paul Vincent|title=William of Ockham|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ockham/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> His opposition to universals was not based on his [[Ockham's razor|eponymous Razor]], but rather he found that regarding them as real was contradictory in some sense. An early work has Ockham stating that 'no thing outside the soul is universal, either through itself or through anything real or rational added on, no matter how it is considered or understood'. Nevertheless, his position did shift away from an outright opposition to accommodating them in his later works such as the ''Summae Logicae'' (albeit in a modified way that would not classify him as a complete realist).\n\n==Modern and contemporary philosophy==\n\n===Mill===\n{{also|Psychologism}}\nThe 19th-century British philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Mill wrote, \"The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object\".\n\nHowever, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:\n\n{{Quotation |But, though meaning them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined. While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently intense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other attributes and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept.|as quoted in William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}\n\nIn other words, we may be \"temporarily unconscious\" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.\n\n===Peirce===\nThe 19th-century American logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], known as the father of [[pragmatism]], developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that \"Berkeley's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop\".<ref>Peirce, C.S. (1871), Review: Fraser's Edition of the ''Works of George Berkeley'' in ''North American Review'' 113(October):449-72, reprinted in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 8, paragraphs 7-38 and in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 462-486. ''Peirce Edition Project'' [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_48/v2_48.htm Eprint].</ref> He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of \"the possibility of forming the simplest general conception\". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works ''in practice'' the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. \"If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?\" Peirce also held as a matter of [[ontology]] that what he called \"thirdness\", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.\n\n===James===\n[[William James]] learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance \u2013 which was not to Peirce's taste: he came to complain that James had \"kidnapped\" the term and eventually to call himself a \"pragmaticist\" instead. Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:\n\n{{Quotation | From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising. Why, from Plato and Aristotle, philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular and in adoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things and that the things of worth are all concretes and singulars. The only value of universal characters is that they help us, by reasoning, to know new [[truth]]s about individual things.|William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}\n\nThere are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars: the moral\u2013political answer, the mathematical\u2013scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.\n\n===Weaver===\nThe moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher [[Richard M. Weaver]] in ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of \"the fateful doctrine of nominalism\" was \"the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence\".<ref name=\"Hoeveler1991\">{{cite book|author=J.

V. O. Quine]] addressed the problem of universals throughout his career. In his paper, 'On Universals', from [[1947]], he states the problem of universals is chiefly understood as being concerned with entities and not the linguistic aspect of naming a universal. He says that Platonists believe that our ability to form general conceptions of things is incomprehensible unless universals exist outside of the mind, whereas nominalists believe that such ideas are 'empty verbalism'. Quine himself does not propose to resolve this particular debate. What he does say however is that certain types of 'discourse' which presuppose universals which nominalists must therefore give up as potential discourse or knowledge. Quine's approach is therefore more an epistemological one, i.e. what can be known, rather than a metaphysical one, i.e. what is real.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Quine |first1=W. V. |title=On Universals |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |date=September 1947 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=74\u201384 |jstor=2267212|doi=10.2307/2267212 }}</ref>\n\n===Cocchiarella===\n[[Nino Cocchiarella]] put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads (\"Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication\", ''[[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]]'', vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.\n\n===Armstrong===\nThe Australian philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' (1978) and ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to \"natural classes\" (a view he ascribes to [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist \"trope\" accounts (which he describes in the ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' volumes as \"particularism\"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.\n\n===Penrose===\n[[Roger Penrose]] contends that the [[philosophy of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]] can't be understood absent the Platonic view that \"mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own...\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|url=https://archive.org/details/emperorsnewmindc00penr|url-access=registration|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198519737|page=[https://archive.org/details/emperorsnewmindc00penr/page/151 151]}}</ref>\n\n==Positions<!--'Extreme realism' and 'Strong realism' redirect here--> ==\nThere are many philosophical positions regarding universals.\n\n# [[Platonic realism]] (also called \"'''extreme realism'''\"<ref name=\"IEP2\">MacLeod & Rubenstein (2006), \u00a73.</ref><ref name=\":12\">Herbert Hochberg, \"Nominalism and Idealism,\" ''Axiomathes'', June 2013, '''23'''(2), pp. 213\u2013234.</ref>) is the view that universals or [[Platonic forms|forms]] in this sense, are the causal explanation behind the notion of what things exactly are; (the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars).\n# [[Aristotelian realism]] (also called \"'''strong realism'''\"<ref name=\"IEP2\" /><ref name=\":12\" />) is the rejection of extreme realism. This position establishes the view of a universal as being that of the quality within a thing and every other thing individual to it; (the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them).\n# [[Anti-realism]] is the objection to both positions. Anti-realism is divided into two subcategories; (1) [[Nominalism]] and (2) [[Conceptualism]]. \n\nTaking \"beauty\" as example, each of these positions will state the following:\n\n* Beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.\n* Beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.\n* Beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.\n\nExtreme realism and strong realism are also known as [[exaggerated realism]] and [[moderate realism]] respectively.<ref>[[wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism \u2013 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]</ref>\n\n===Realism<!--Linked from 'Philosophical realism'-->===\n{{main|Metaphysical realism}}\nThe school of realism makes the claim that universals are real and that they exist distinctly from the particulars that instantiate them. Two major forms metaphysical realism are [[Platonic realism]] (''universalia ante res''), meaning \"'universal before things'\"<ref name=\"Stanford Universals\" /> and [[Aristotelian realism]] (''universalia in rebus''), meaning \"'universals in things'\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Orilia|first=Francesco|title=Properties|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/properties/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-02-26|last2=Swoyer|first2=Chris}}</ref> ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.\n\nRealists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. A common realist argument said to be found in Plato's writings, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence \"[[Djivan Gasparyan]] is a musician\" for instance. The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Therefore, it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.<ref>(MacLeod & Rubenstein, 2006, \u00a71b)</ref>\n\n===Nominalism<!--Linked from 'Anti-realism'-->===\n{{main|Nominalism}}\nNominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; ''universalia post res''). The term \"nominalism\" comes from the Latin ''nomen'' (\"name\"). Four major forms of nominalism are [[predicate nominalism]], [[resemblance nominalism]], [[trope nominalism]], and [[conceptualism]].<ref name=\"IEP\">MacLeod & Rubenstein (2006), \u00a73.</ref> One with a nominalist view claims that we predicate the same property of/to multiple entities, but argues that the entities only share a name and not have a real quality in common.   \n\nNominalists often argue this view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore\u2014by [[Occam's razor]], and its principle of simplicity\u2014nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities. Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including [[Chrysippus]],<ref>John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84\u201385: \"[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ...

Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.\n\nThus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of [[psychology]] and [[epistemology]].

For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general.<ref>MacLeod & Rubenstein (2006), \u00a71b.</ref>  For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [[Allegory of the cave|sunlight]], while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [[Allegory of the cave|shadows]]. This [[Platonic realism]], however, in denying that the [[theory of forms|eternal Forms]] are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.\n\nOne of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said \"I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy|others=Translated by Guy Davenport|title=Herakleitos and Diogenes|publisher=Grey Fox Press|location=Bolinas|year=1979|pages=[https://archive.org/details/herakleitosdioge00hera/page/57 57]|isbn=0-912516-35-6|url=https://archive.org/details/herakleitosdioge00hera/page/57}}</ref>\n\n====Aristotle====\n{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\n\nPlato's student Aristotle disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into \"[[Four causes#Formal cause|formal causes]]\", the blueprints or [[essence]]s of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized [[geometry]], Aristotle emphasized [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of [[natural kind]]s. The philosopher distinguished highest genera like animal and species like man but he maintained that both are predicated of individual men.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Berchman|first=Robert|title=Studies on Plato, Aristotle and Proclus: The Collected Essays on Ancient Philosophy of John Cleary, Volume 15|last2=Finamore|first2=John|publisher=BRILL|year=2013|isbn=978-90-04-23323-2|location=Leiden|pages=364}}</ref> This was considered part of an approach to the principle of things, which adheres to the criterion that what is most universal is also most real.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nConsider for example a particular [[oak]] tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical [[Empiricism|empiricist]] and a founder of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Aristotle was a new, [[Moderate realism|moderate]] sort of realist about universals.\n\n==Medieval philosophy==\n\n====Boethius====\nThe problem was introduced to the medieval world by [[Boethius]], by his translation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]. It begins:\n\n\"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_02_translation.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories of Aristotle (1853) vol. 2. pp.609-633.|last=Porphyry|date=|website=www.tertullian.org}}</ref>\n\nBoethius, in his commentaries on the aforementioned translation, says that a universal, if it were to exist has to apply to several particulars entirely. He also specifies that they apply simultaneously at once and not in a temporal succession. He reasons that they cannot be mind-independent, i.e. they do not have a real existence, because a quality cannot be both one thing and common to many particulars in such a way that it forms part of a particular's substance, as it would then be partaking of universality and particularity. However, he also says that universals can't also be of the mind since a mental construct of a quality is an abstraction and understanding of something outside of the mind. He concludes that this representation is either a true understanding of the quality, in which case we revert to the earlier problem faced by those who believe universals are real. Conversely, if the mental abstractions were not a true understanding, then 'what is understood otherwise than the thing is false'.<ref name=\"Stanford Universals\" />\n\nHis solution to this problem was to state that the mind is able to separate in thought what is not necessarily separable in reality. He cites the human mind's ability to abstract from concrete particulars as an instance of this. This, according to Boethius, avoids the problem of Platonic universals being out there in the real world, but also the problem of them being purely constructs of the mind in that universals are simply the mind thinking of particulars in an abstract, universal way.<ref name=\"Stanford Universals\" /> His assumption focuses on the problems that language create. Boethius maintained that the structure of language corresponds to the structure of things and that language creates what he called as philosophical babble of confused and contradictory accounts of the nature of things.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Eileen|title=Logic, Theology and Poetry in Boethius, Anselm, Abelard, and Alan of Lille: Words in the Absence of Things|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=978-1-349-73540-2|location=New York|pages=9-10}}</ref> To illustrate his view, suppose that although the mind cannot think of 2 or 4 as an odd number, as this would be a false representation, it can think of an even number that is neither 2 nor 4.\n\n===Medieval realism===\n{{main|Medieval realism}}\nBoethius stayed quite close to Aristotle in his thinking about universals. Realism was also argued for by both [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) and [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265-1308). Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct;<ref>On Being and Essence, Ch I.</ref> in this regard he is also Aristotelian. \n\n[[Duns Scotus]] argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a [[formal distinction]].<ref>Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2</ref> Scotus believed that universals exist only inside the things that they exemplify, and that they \"contract\" with the [[haecceity]] of the thing to create the individual. As a result of his realist position, he argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for [[Scotist realism]], a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard. That is to say, Scotus believed that such properties as 'redness' and 'roundness' exist in reality and are mind-independent entities. \n\nFurthermore, Duns Scotus wrote about this problem in his own commentary (''Quaestiones'') on Porphyry's ''Isagoge'', as Boethius had done. Scotus was interested in how the mind forms universals, and he believed this to be 'caused by the intellect'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scotus |first1=Duns |title=Quaestiones in librum Porphyrii Isagoge |pages=q. 4 proemium}}</ref> This intellect acts on the basis that the nature of, say, 'humanity' that is found in other humans and also that the quality is attributable to other individual humans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Noone |first=Timothy B. |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=Thomas |title=The Cambridge Companion to Duns Scotus |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2003 |pages=100\u2013129 |chapter=Universals and Individuation |isbn=978-0-521-63563-9}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval nominalism===\n{{main|Medieval nominalism}}\n[[File:William_of_Ockham.png|thumb|150px|William of Ockham]]\nThe opposing view to realism is one called nominalism, which at its strongest maintains that universals are verbal constructs and that they do not inhere in objects or pre-exist them. Therefore, universals in this view are something which are peculiar to [[cognition|human cognition]] and language. The French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (1050\u20131125) was an early, prominent proponent of this view. His particular view was that universals are little more than vocal utterances (''voces'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salisbury |first1=John of |editor1-last=Webb |editor1-first=Clemens C.I. |title=Metalogicon 2.17 |date=1929 |publisher=Oxford |page=92}}</ref>\n\n[[William of Ockham]] (1285-1347) wrote extensively on this topic. He argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words or concepts (at best) that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.<ref>{{Citation|last=Panaccio|first=Claude|last2=Spade|first2=Paul Vincent|title=William of Ockham|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ockham/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> His opposition to universals was not based on his [[Ockham's razor|eponymous Razor]], but rather he found that regarding them as real was contradictory in some sense. An early work has Ockham stating that 'no thing outside the soul is universal, either through itself or through anything real or rational added on, no matter how it is considered or understood'. Nevertheless, his position did shift away from an outright opposition to accommodating them in his later works such as the ''Summae Logicae'' (albeit in a modified way that would not classify him as a complete realist).\n\n==Modern and contemporary philosophy==\n\n===Mill===\n{{also|Psychologism}}\nThe 19th-century British philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Mill wrote, \"The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object\".\n\nHowever, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:\n\n{{Quotation |But, though meaning them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined. While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently intense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other attributes and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept.|as quoted in William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}\n\nIn other words, we may be \"temporarily unconscious\" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.\n\n===Peirce===\nThe 19th-century American logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], known as the father of [[pragmatism]], developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that \"Berkeley's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop\".<ref>Peirce, C.S. (1871), Review: Fraser's Edition of the ''Works of George Berkeley'' in ''North American Review'' 113(October):449-72, reprinted in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 8, paragraphs 7-38 and in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 462-486. ''Peirce Edition Project'' [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_48/v2_48.htm Eprint].</ref> He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of \"the possibility of forming the simplest general conception\". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works ''in practice'' the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. \"If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?\" Peirce also held as a matter of [[ontology]] that what he called \"thirdness\", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.\n\n===James===\n[[William James]] learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance \u2013 which was not to Peirce's taste: he came to complain that James had \"kidnapped\" the term and eventually to call himself a \"pragmaticist\" instead. Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:\n\n{{Quotation | From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising. Why, from Plato and Aristotle, philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular and in adoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things and that the things of worth are all concretes and singulars. The only value of universal characters is that they help us, by reasoning, to know new [[truth]]s about individual things.|William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}\n\nThere are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars: the moral\u2013political answer, the mathematical\u2013scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.\n\n===Weaver===\nThe moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher [[Richard M. Weaver]] in ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of \"the fateful doctrine of nominalism\" was \"the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence\".<ref name=\"Hoeveler1991\">{{cite book|author=J.

V. O. Quine]] addressed the problem of universals throughout his career. In his paper, 'On Universals', from [[1947]], he states the problem of universals is chiefly understood as being concerned with entities and not the linguistic aspect of naming a universal. He says that Platonists believe that our ability to form general conceptions of things is incomprehensible unless universals exist outside of the mind, whereas nominalists believe that such ideas are 'empty verbalism'. Quine himself does not propose to resolve this particular debate. What he does say however is that certain types of 'discourse' which presuppose universals which nominalists must therefore give up as potential discourse or knowledge. Quine's approach is therefore more an epistemological one, i.e. what can be known, rather than a metaphysical one, i.e. what is real.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Quine |first1=W. V. |title=On Universals |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |date=September 1947 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=74\u201384 |jstor=2267212|doi=10.2307/2267212 }}</ref>\n\n===Cocchiarella===\n[[Nino Cocchiarella]] put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads (\"Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication\", ''[[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]]'', vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.\n\n===Armstrong===\nThe Australian philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' (1978) and ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to \"natural classes\" (a view he ascribes to [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist \"trope\" accounts (which he describes in the ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' volumes as \"particularism\"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.\n\n===Penrose===\n[[Roger Penrose]] contends that the [[philosophy of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]] can't be understood absent the Platonic view that \"mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own...\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|url=https://archive.org/details/emperorsnewmindc00penr|url-access=registration|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198519737|page=[https://archive.org/details/emperorsnewmindc00penr/page/151 151]}}</ref>\n\n==Positions<!--'Extreme realism' and 'Strong realism' redirect here--> ==\nThere are many philosophical positions regarding universals.\n\n# [[Platonic realism]] (also called \"'''extreme realism'''\"<ref name=\"IEP2\">MacLeod & Rubenstein (2006), \u00a73.</ref><ref name=\":12\">Herbert Hochberg, \"Nominalism and Idealism,\" ''Axiomathes'', June 2013, '''23'''(2), pp. 213\u2013234.</ref>) is the view that universals or [[Platonic forms|forms]] in this sense, are the causal explanation behind the notion of what things exactly are; (the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars).\n# [[Aristotelian realism]] (also called \"'''strong realism'''\"<ref name=\"IEP2\" /><ref name=\":12\" />) is the rejection of extreme realism. This position establishes the view of a universal as being that of the quality within a thing and every other thing individual to it; (the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them).\n# [[Anti-realism]] is the objection to both positions. Anti-realism is divided into two subcategories; (1) [[Nominalism]] and (2) [[Conceptualism]]. \n\nTaking \"beauty\" as example, each of these positions will state the following:\n\n* Beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.\n* Beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.\n* Beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.\n\nExtreme realism and strong realism are also known as [[exaggerated realism]] and [[moderate realism]] respectively.<ref>[[wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism \u2013 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]</ref>\n\n===Realism<!--Linked from 'Philosophical realism'-->===\n{{main|Metaphysical realism}}\nThe school of realism makes the claim that universals are real and that they exist distinctly from the particulars that instantiate them. Two major forms metaphysical realism are [[Platonic realism]] (''universalia ante res''), meaning \"'universal before things'\"<ref name=\"Stanford Universals\" /> and [[Aristotelian realism]] (''universalia in rebus''), meaning \"'universals in things'\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Orilia|first=Francesco|title=Properties|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/properties/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-02-26|last2=Swoyer|first2=Chris}}</ref> ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.\n\nRealists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. A common realist argument said to be found in Plato's writings, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence \"[[Djivan Gasparyan]] is a musician\" for instance. The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Therefore, it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.<ref>(MacLeod & Rubenstein, 2006, \u00a71b)</ref>\n\n===Nominalism<!--Linked from 'Anti-realism'-->===\n{{main|Nominalism}}\nNominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; ''universalia post res''). The term \"nominalism\" comes from the Latin ''nomen'' (\"name\"). Four major forms of nominalism are [[predicate nominalism]], [[resemblance nominalism]], [[trope nominalism]], and [[conceptualism]].<ref name=\"IEP\">MacLeod & Rubenstein (2006), \u00a73.</ref> One with a nominalist view claims that we predicate the same property of/to multiple entities, but argues that the entities only share a name and not have a real quality in common.   \n\nNominalists often argue this view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore\u2014by [[Occam's razor]], and its principle of simplicity\u2014nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities. Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including [[Chrysippus]],<ref>John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84\u201385: \"[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ...

Oxford University Press. 8 April 2008.</ref> Conceptualists argue that the \"concept\" of universals are not mere \"inventions but are reflections of similarities among particular things themselves.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"conceptualism.\" The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.. .

Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.\n\nThus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of [[psychology]] and [[epistemology]]. Kant's position has been interpreted as a conceptualist one.<ref>Oberst, Michael. 2015. \"Kant on Universals.\" ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335\u2013352.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[Abstract object]]\n* [[Bundle theory]]\n* [[Constructor theory]]\n* [[Crystal system]]\n* [[Object (philosophy)]]\n* [[ Observation]] \n* [[Philosophy of mathematics]]\n* [[Platonic form]]\n* [[Present]]\n* [[Qualia]]\n* [[Realism (philosophy)]]\n* [[Self]]\n* [[Transcendental nominalism]]\n* [[Universality (philosophy)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n; Historical studies\n* Klima, Gyula (2008). \"The Medieval Problem of Universals\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edward N.
