It was written by comedian [[Peter Cook]] and starred both Cook and his comedy partner [[Dudley Moore]]. It is a comic retelling of the [[Faust]] legend, set in the [[Swinging London]] of the 1960s. The Devil (Peter Cook) offers an unhappy young man (Moore) seven wishes in return for his soul, but twists the spirit of the wishes to frustrate the man's hopes.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Moon works as a cook in a [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy]]'s restaurant and is infatuated with the waitress Margaret Spencer but lacks confidence and is too socially inhibited to approach her. In despair  at his life, he attempts [[suicide]] by hanging but is interrupted by a man claiming to be the Devil, incarnated as George Spiggott. When Stanley accuses George of being delusional, he offers Stanley a \"trial wish\". Stanley wishes for a raspberry [[ice lolly]], and George takes him to buy one from a nearby shop.\n\nSpiggott is in a game with God, trying to be the first to gather 100 billion souls. If he achieves this first, he will be readmitted to Heaven. He is also busy with minor acts of vandalism and spite, helped by his staff of the [[seven deadly sins]], notably Lust and Envy.\n\nIn [[Deal with the Devil|return for his soul]], Spiggott offers Stanley seven wishes. Stanley uses these trying to satisfy his love for Margaret, but Spiggott twists his words to frustrate him. All of Stanley's wish scenes feature characters played by Peter Cook, George explaining that \"There's a little of me in everyone.\" Stanley is told that [[blowing a raspberry]] will free him from the effects of a wish, if he changes his mind.\n\n# Stanley first wishes to be more articulate. George Spiggott turns him into a talkative and pretentious intellectual with a strong  [[Welsh accent]]. Margaret becomes an equally pretentious character, who enthusiastically agrees with all of Stanley's beliefs. Stanley stresses the importance of breaking free from one's social and moral constraints. When Stanley makes his move, however, she is horrified and starts screaming \"rape\".\n# In his second wish, Stanley wishes to be a multi-millionaire with Margaret as his \"very physical\" wife. She ignores him and his lavish gifts, instead having affairs with his friends.\n# In the third wish, Stanley is a rock star. However, his fame is very short lived and he is usurped by a new band (\"This year's most exciting discovery, Drimble Wedge and The Vegetation\") whose lead singer sings in a hypnotic, monotone voice about his disdain for anyone except himself (\"You fill me with inertia\"). Margaret, one of many entranced groupies, screams with excitement as she and other fans mob Drimble. \n# Stanley comments in passing that he wishes he was \"a fly on the wall\" and George seizes on the opportunity to use this as Stanley's fourth wish. They both become flies on the wall in a morgue, where the police inspector is showing Margaret various dead bodies, hoping that she will identify one as Stanley. When the inspector invites Margaret to a [[vice squad]] party, Stanley launches an attack on him.\n# Stanley wishes for a quiet life in the countryside, with children, and Margaret making the anniversary dinner. It soon becomes apparent, however, that Margaret is another man's wife. While deeply in love, even the attempt to consummate their affection drives both Stanley and Margaret into emotional agony.\n# Stanley attempts to frame a sixth wish that George cannot ruin for him. He wishes that he and Margaret loved one another, lived away from the big city, and would always be together. However, George turns him into a nun of the Order of Saint Beryl, or the Leaping Beryllians, who glorify their founder by jumping on trampolines (expanding on a sketch that previously appeared in Cook and Moore's TV show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]'').  Margaret is also a nun in the order, but refuses to consider consummating their love as they are both women. Stanley attempts to escape the wish by blowing a raspberry, to no effect, and he returns to London to confront George.\n# When Stanley tries to use his seventh wish, George reveals he has ''already used it'': his trial wish for an [[ice pop|ice lolly]].\n\nUltimately, Spiggott spares Stanley eternal [[damnation]] because he has exceeded his quota of 100 billion souls and can afford to be generous. Stanley is duly returned to his old job and life, wiser and more clear-sighted. Spiggott ascends to Heaven to meet God, but is rejected again; St Peter explains that when he gave Stanley back his soul, Spiggott did the right thing, but with the wrong motive.\n\nIn the closing scene, Stanley and Margaret are back in the restaurant. Stanley finally asks her out but she says she's already doing something, though she does suggest perhaps another night. Stanley smiles, happy that he has found the courage to talk to her.  Spiggott tries to entice Stanley again, but Stanley turns him down. Frustrated, Spiggott leaves and threatens revenge on [[God]] by unleashing all the tawdry and shallow technological curses of the modern age.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Peter Cook]] as George Spiggott / The Devil\n* [[Dudley Moore]] as Stanley Moon\n* [[Eleanor Bron]] as Margaret Spencer\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Lust / Lilian Lust\n* Alba as Vanity\n* [[Robert Russell (English actor)|Robert Russell]] as Anger\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Envy\n* Parnell McGarry as Gluttony\n* Dani\u00e8le No\u00ebl as Avarice (as Daniele Noel)\n* [[Howard Goorney]] as Sloth\n* [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as Inspector Clarke\n* [[Bernard Spear]] as Irving Moses\n* [[Robin Hawdon]] as Randolph - Harp Teacher\n* [[Michael Trubshawe]] as Lord Dowdy\n* Evelyn Moore as Mrs. Wisby\n* [[Valentine Dyall]] (uncredited) as God\n}}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nCook and Moore wrote ''Bedazzled''<nowiki/>'s soundtrack, which was performed by the Dudley Moore Trio.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bedazzled-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0001674279 |title=Bedazzled [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] - Dudley Moore,The Dudley Moore Trio |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> The title track, Moore's best known song, was performed in the movie by the fictional [[psychedelic rock]] band Drimble Wedge and the Vegetation.
