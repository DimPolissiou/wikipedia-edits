It is owned and operated by Energy Northwest, a Washington state, not-for-profit joint operating agency. Licensed by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] in 1983, Columbia first produced electricity in May 1984, and entered commercial operation in December 1984.\n\nColumbia produces 1,107 megawatts net of electricity, which is about 10 percent of the electricity generated in Washington state.\n\n== Design and function ==\nColumbia Generating Station is a [[GE BWR|BWR-5]]. It features a [[Containment building#Boiling water reactors|Mark II containment structure]].\n\nThe reactor core holds up to 764 fuel assemblies, and 185 [[Control rod|control rods]], more technically known as control blades.  The reactor is licensed for a power output of 3486 [[thermal megawatt]]s\n(MWt).

Each tower cascades clean warmed water, a byproduct of water heat exchanging with steam after leaving a turbine, down itself and subsequently cools the warmed water via a combination of evaporation and heat exchange with the surrounding air.  Some water droplets fall back to earth in the process, thereby creating a [[hoar frost]] in the winter. At times, the vapor cloud from the cooling towers can reach {{convert|10000|ft}} in height and can be seen at a great distance. Replacement water for the evaporated water is drawn from the nearby [[Columbia River]].\n\n==History==\nColumbia was built by the former [[Washington Public Power Supply System]], known since 1998 as [[Energy Northwest]]. Its construction permit was issued in March 1973, and construction began in late 1975. Because of cost overruns and construction delays, the plant did not begin commercial operation until December 1984. Of the five commercial reactors originally planned by the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] and the Supply System in Washington, Columbia was the only one completed. The nuclear power plant was also known as Hanford Two, with Hanford One being the 800 MWe power generating plant connected to the [[N-Reactor]] (decommissioned in 1987), a dual purpose reactor operated by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission | Atomic Energy Commission]]: producing plutonium for the nuclear weapons stockpile, as well as generating electricity for the grid.<ref>http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2015/11/02/hanford-one/ Article about Hanford One and the N-Reactor</ref> \n\nWhen the Supply System changed its name to Energy Northwest, the plant's name went from WNP-2 (Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Project number 2) to Columbia Generating Station. In 2000, then-Executive Board Chairman Rudi Bertschi said the plant's former name referred \"to an earlier era when the Washington Public Power Supply System was building five nuclear power plants. Those days are long gone,\" said Bertschi. \"Our plant has made the transition, as has Energy Northwest, from being a marginal producer to being a key cog in the region's energy machine.\"\n\nColumbia's original NRC license to operate was scheduled to expire in December 2023. In January 2010, Energy Northwest filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license renewal \u2013 through 2043. In May 2012, the NRC approved the 20-year license renewal.\n\nIn 2012, Energy Northwest entered into agreements with the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], the U.S. Enrichment Corporation and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] to turn depleted uranium (also called uranium tails) into low-cost enriched uranium product for further future processing into nuclear fuel. Buying under market value at a set price to obtain a nine-year fuel supply, the transaction is estimated to bring between $171 and $275 million in savings to the region through 2028.\n\n== Economics ==\nIn late 2012, the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] and Energy Northwest came together to analyze the financial value of Columbia in light of low energy prices in the wholesale electricity market and historic low fuel costs for natural gas-fired power plants. The agencies studied three scenarios and concluded, in April 2013, that Columbia's continued operation was the most cost-effective option for consumers.\n\nIn April 2013, Energy Northwest commissioned a third-party study by IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a firm with a 75-year reputation for independent expertise in the fields of energy, economics, market conditions and business risk. IHS CERA came to the same conclusion as the April 2013 joint BPA-EN study.\n\nIn 2013, the Columbia Generating Station set a record for electricity generation during a refueling outage year \u2013 8.4 million megawatt hours of electricity sent to the regional power grid. In 2012 \u2013 a non-refueling outage year \u2013 Columbia generated a record 9.3 million megawatt hours of electricity for the regional power grid (95% capacity factor).\n\nIn January 2014, the Public Power Council, representing Northwest consumer-owned utilities, examined the competing market assessments and said they found no compelling evidence that ceasing operation of Columbia is economically advisable for the region. The PPC assessment supported public statements by BPA affirming Columbia's provision of unique, firm, baseload, non-carbon emitting generation with predictable costs for the region's ratepayers.\n\nThe Public Power Council observed in February 2014 that the variable cost of Columbia operations in recent years were slightly above spot market energy prices. However, the council stated that a single unanticipated shift in the markets \"can easily wipe out years of anticipated benefits\" gained from replacement power.\n\nThe council referenced the [[California electricity crisis|Western Energy Crisis]] of 2000-2001. During that relatively short energy crisis, according to the council, the cost benefit of Columbia's power \"dwarf[ed] the modest benefits that would have been achieved\" through replacement power. \"In 2001 alone the operation of Columbia Generating Station compared to the market saved Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers $1.4 billion,\" according to the council.\n\n==Spent fuel==\nColumbia Generating Station's spent fuel pool is able to accommodate 2,658 fuel assemblies.  It was designed as a short-term storage option until a national repository could be built.  Since there is no projected operations start date for the proposed but stalled national long-term nuclear waste storage facility at [[Yucca Mountain Repository]] in Nevada, the station obtained approval for dry-cask storage to avoid exceeding the pool's licensed capacity.  The Columbia Generating Station has an on-site [[dry cask storage]] installation, which allows for storage of spent fuel rods in specially designed and manufactured casks. As of 2014, 36 casks have been loaded and stored in the installation, making room in the spent fuel pool for receipt of new fuel.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.energy-northwest.com/ourenergyprojects/Columbia/Pages/Used-Fuel.aspx\n| title      = Used Fuel\n| publisher  = [[Energy Northwest]]\n| accessdate = Sep 15, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n==Surrounding population==\nThe [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of {{convert|10|mi}}, concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about {{convert|50|mi}}, concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactive materials.<ref name='background'>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/emerg-plan-prep-nuc-power.html|title=Backgrounder on Emergency Preparedness at Nuclear Power Plants|publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010 population within {{convert|10|mi}} of Columbia was 10,055, an increase of 10.4 percent in a decade.<ref name=\"msnbc2011\"/> The 2010 population within {{convert|50|mi}} was 445,416, an increase of 23.4 percent since 2000.

In modern usage, \"Greek letter organization\" is often synonymous with the terms \"fraternity\" and \"sorority\". Two additional types of fraternities, professional fraternities and honor societies, incorporate some limited elements of traditional fraternity organization, but are generally considered a different type of association. Traditional fraternities of the type described in this article are often called \"social fraternities\".\n\nGenerally, membership in a fraternity or sorority is obtained as an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[Higher education|student]] but continues, thereafter, for life.

The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]]. The further birthing of [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841) and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) collectively established Union College as the [[Mother of Fraternities]].\nThe social fraternity [[Chi Phi]], although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiphi.dynamic.omegafi.com/about-chi-phi/|title=History of Chi Phi|author=|date=|website=www.chiphi.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldest.org/culture/fraternities-north-america/|title=7 Oldest Fraternities in North America|author=|date=|website=www.oldest.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFraternities represented the intersection between [[dining club]]s, [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and secret initiatory orders such as [[Freemasonry]]. Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\".

The Adelphean, founded in 1851 eventually became [[Alpha Delta Pi]], while The Philomathean, begun in 1852, eventually became [[Phi Mu]]. Together, these sororities are known as the \"Macon Magnolias\". Several other unrelated \"Philomathean Societies\" emerged during the 19th Century, most notably a literary society at UPenn and another, unrelated, at NYU.</ref> though fraternity-like organizations for women didn't take their current form until the establishment of [[Pi Beta Phi]] in 1867 and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] in 1870. The term \"sorority\" was invented by a professor of Latin who felt the word \"fraternity\" was inappropriate for a group of ladies. The first organization to use the term \"sorority\" was [[Gamma Phi Beta]], established in 1874.<ref name=\"bairdtwo\"/>\n\nThe development of \"fraternities for women\" during this time was a major accomplishment in the way of women's rights and equality. By mere existence, these organizations were defying the odds; the founding women were able to advance their organizations despite many factors working against them.

Today, both social and multicultural sororities are present on more than 650 college campuses across the United States and Canada. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) serves as the \"umbrella organization\" for 26 (inter)national sororities. Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines.

While these limitations have since been abolished by both the [[Interfraternity Conference]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], students of various ethnicities have come together to form a council of multicultural Greek organizations. The Multicultural Greek Council, officially formed in 1998, is a coordinating body of 19 Greek organizations, including nine fraternities, and ten sororities with cultural affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MGC|url=http://mgc.tamu.edu/history|website=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first multicultural sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, was established in November 1981 at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=\"nationalmgc.org\">{{cite web|title=EMERGENCE OF MULTICULTURAL FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS|url=http://nationalmgc.org/about/|website=National Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=National Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  The formation of this Greek organization allowed for the emergence of a multicultural fraternity and sorority movement, giving birth to a multicultural movement.\n\n==Structure and organization==\n===Common elements===\n====Gender exclusivity====\nFraternities and sororities traditionally have been single-sex organizations, with fraternities consisting exclusively of men and sororities consisting exclusively of women. In the United States, fraternities and sororities have a statutory exemption from [[Title IX]] legislation prohibiting this type of gender exclusion within student groups, and organizations such as the [[Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee]] lobby to maintain it.<ref name=\"bi1\">{{cite news|title=Why One School Decided To Make All Of Its Fraternities And Sororities Co-Ed |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-college-fraternities-sororities-co-ed-2014-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=9 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"bl\">{{cite news|title=Fraternities Lobby Against Campus Rape Investigations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/fraternities-lobby-against-campus-rape-investigations|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-20th century a small number of fraternities, such as [[Alpha Theta]] and [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]], have opted to become co-educational and admit female members; however, these generally represent a minority of Greek-letter organizations and no such fraternity is currently a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, the largest international association of fraternities.<ref name=\"bi1\" /><ref name=\"bl\" />  The first coed fraternity was Pi Alpha Tau (1963\u20131991) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pi Alpha Tau Papers, 1963\u20131991, UIC Archives|url = http://findingaids.library.uic.edu/ead/lhsc/059-07-16.pdf|website = uic.edu|accessdate = 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nMuch more commonly, coed fraternities exist in the form of \"service\" fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]], Alpha Tau Mu [[Service fraternities and sororities|and others]]. These organizations are similar to \"social\" fraternities and sororities, with the exception of being coed and non-residential.\n\nIn 2016, [[Chi Phi]] began allowing transgender members, or those identifying as male, to join the social fraternity.<ref>http://college.usatoday.com/2016/07/08/chi-phi-transgender-pledges/</ref> Several sororities have adjusted their policies to confirm that transgender prospective members are allowable.\n\nImportantly, all these variants have stemmed from a process of ''self-determination,'' without challenge by other Greeks. But in a [[bellwether]] case, in 2016 Harvard University changed its student conduct code to bar members of single-sex groups from leading campus groups, serving as captains of sports teams or participating in valuable academic fellowships. This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters.

During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delta Upsilon Ode2.ogg|thumb|\"Delta Upsilon Ode,\" a traditional [[Delta Upsilon]] song written in 1884 by Edward La Wall Seip (sample)]]\n[[File:\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir\".ogg|thumb|\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir,\" a traditional Sigma Chi song written in 1885 by Charles Eldridge (sample)]]\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\n[[File:Adphicornell.jpg|thumb|left|The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at [[Cornell University]]]]\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority.

A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities. \n\n[[File:Zeta Psi Fraternity House, Lafayette College 01.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Zeta Psi]] chapter house at [[Lafayette College]]]]\n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\n[[File:Phi Kappa Sigma 1872 W&J College.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] at [[Washington & Jefferson College]] in 1872]]\n[[File:Fraternity Initiation.png|thumb|right|A dramatized depiction of a fraternity initiation ritual]]\n[[File:The Model Chapter Room (526839509).jpg|thumb|A \"model chapter room\" of [[Kappa Sigma]]]]\n\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies.

The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].

Hazing during the pledge period can sometimes culminate in an event commonly known as \"Hell Week\" in which a week-long series of physical and mental torments are inflicted on pledges. Common hazing practices include sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and other types of spanking, use of [[stress positions]], forced runs, [[Busy work#Military settings|busy work]], forced drinking and [[mind games]]. Rarer incidents involving [[human branding|branding]], [[enemas]], urination on pledges and the forced consumption of [[spoiled food]] have been reported.

Supporters of fraternities also note that hazing is not unique to Greek-letter organizations and is often reported in other student organizations, such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 2007, an anti-hazing hotline was set up to report incidents of hazing on college campuses. Currently, 46 national fraternity and sorority organizations support the toll-free number, which generates automatic email messages regarding hazing and sends them to the national headquarters directly from the National Anti-Hazing Hotline.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fraternal Law \u00bb Anti-Hazing Hotline|url = http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|website = fraternallaw.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027112504/http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|archive-date = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead}}</ref> Every year, the last week of September is considered to be National Hazing Prevention Week (NHPW).

The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]]. The further birthing of [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841) and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) collectively established Union College as the [[Mother of Fraternities]].\nThe social fraternity [[Chi Phi]], although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiphi.dynamic.omegafi.com/about-chi-phi/|title=History of Chi Phi|author=|date=|website=www.chiphi.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldest.org/culture/fraternities-north-america/|title=7 Oldest Fraternities in North America|author=|date=|website=www.oldest.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFraternities represented the intersection between [[dining club]]s, [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and secret initiatory orders such as [[Freemasonry]]. Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\".

The Adelphean, founded in 1851 eventually became [[Alpha Delta Pi]], while The Philomathean, begun in 1852, eventually became [[Phi Mu]]. Together, these sororities are known as the \"Macon Magnolias\". Several other unrelated \"Philomathean Societies\" emerged during the 19th Century, most notably a literary society at UPenn and another, unrelated, at NYU.</ref> though fraternity-like organizations for women didn't take their current form until the establishment of [[Pi Beta Phi]] in 1867 and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] in 1870. The term \"sorority\" was invented by a professor of Latin who felt the word \"fraternity\" was inappropriate for a group of ladies. The first organization to use the term \"sorority\" was [[Gamma Phi Beta]], established in 1874.<ref name=\"bairdtwo\"/>\n\nThe development of \"fraternities for women\" during this time was a major accomplishment in the way of women's rights and equality. By mere existence, these organizations were defying the odds; the founding women were able to advance their organizations despite many factors working against them.

Today, both social and multicultural sororities are present on more than 650 college campuses across the United States and Canada.

Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines.

While these limitations have since been abolished by both the [[Interfraternity Conference]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], students of various ethnicities have come together to form a council of multicultural Greek organizations. The Multicultural Greek Council, officially formed in 1998, is a coordinating body of 19 Greek organizations, including nine fraternities, and ten sororities with cultural affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MGC|url=http://mgc.tamu.edu/history|website=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first multicultural sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, was established in November 1981 at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=\"nationalmgc.org\">{{cite web|title=EMERGENCE OF MULTICULTURAL FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS|url=http://nationalmgc.org/about/|website=National Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=National Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  The formation of this Greek organization allowed for the emergence of a multicultural fraternity and sorority movement, giving birth to a multicultural movement.\n\n==Structure and organization==\n===Common elements===\n====Gender exclusivity====\nFraternities and sororities traditionally have been single-sex organizations, with fraternities consisting exclusively of men and sororities consisting exclusively of women. In the United States, fraternities and sororities have a statutory exemption from [[Title IX]] legislation prohibiting this type of gender exclusion within student groups, and organizations such as the [[Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee]] lobby to maintain it.<ref name=\"bi1\">{{cite news|title=Why One School Decided To Make All Of Its Fraternities And Sororities Co-Ed |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-college-fraternities-sororities-co-ed-2014-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=9 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"bl\">{{cite news|title=Fraternities Lobby Against Campus Rape Investigations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/fraternities-lobby-against-campus-rape-investigations|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-20th century a small number of fraternities, such as [[Alpha Theta]] and [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]], have opted to become co-educational and admit female members; however, these generally represent a minority of Greek-letter organizations and no such fraternity is currently a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, the largest international association of fraternities.<ref name=\"bi1\" /><ref name=\"bl\" />  The first coed fraternity was Pi Alpha Tau (1963\u20131991) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pi Alpha Tau Papers, 1963\u20131991, UIC Archives|url = http://findingaids.library.uic.edu/ead/lhsc/059-07-16.pdf|website = uic.edu|accessdate = 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nMuch more commonly, coed fraternities exist in the form of \"service\" fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]], Alpha Tau Mu [[Service fraternities and sororities|and others]]. These organizations are similar to \"social\" fraternities and sororities, with the exception of being coed and non-residential.\n\nIn 2016, [[Chi Phi]] began allowing transgender members, or those identifying as male, to join the social fraternity.<ref>http://college.usatoday.com/2016/07/08/chi-phi-transgender-pledges/</ref> Several sororities have adjusted their policies to confirm that transgender prospective members are allowable.\n\nImportantly, all these variants have stemmed from a process of ''self-determination,'' without challenge by other Greeks. But in a [[bellwether]] case, in 2016 Harvard University changed its student conduct code to bar members of single-sex groups from leading campus groups, serving as captains of sports teams or participating in valuable academic fellowships. This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters. These federal structures are largely governed by alumni members of the fraternity, though with some input from the active (student) members.<ref>{{cite web|title=GOVERNANCE OF UNDERGRADUATE SOCIAL FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES|url=http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|website=upenn.edu|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=4 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727030604/http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|archive-date=27 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ERM, ORSA and Corporate Governance: The Small Company Challenges|url=http://www.firstconsulting.com/erm-orsa-and-corporate-governance-small-company-challenges|website=firstconsulting.com|publisher=First Consulting}}</ref>\n\n====Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)====\n{{See also|Sorority recruitment}}\n\nMost Greek letter organizations select potential members through a two-part process of vetting and probation, called rushing and pledging, respectively. During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Delta Upsilon Ode2.ogg|thumb|\"Delta Upsilon Ode,\" a traditional [[Delta Upsilon]] song written in 1884 by Edward La Wall Seip (sample)]]\n[[File:\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir\".ogg|thumb|\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir,\" a traditional Sigma Chi song written in 1885 by Charles Eldridge (sample)]]\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\n[[File:Adphicornell.jpg|thumb|left|The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at [[Cornell University]]]]\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority. Such prospective candidates are known as \"legacies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |title=Glossary of Greek Life Terms |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=gmu.edu |publisher=George Mason University Interfraternity Council |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325043212/http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/fraternity-legacy/ |title=Fraternity Legacies |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=thefraternityadvisor.com |publisher=The Fraternity Advisor |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nMembership in more than one fraternity or sorority is almost always prohibited. Recently, some Greek-letter organizations have replaced the term \"pledge\" with that of \"associate member\" or \"new member\".  [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], in 2014, abolished pledging altogether. Potential members are now immediately initiated into the fraternity upon accepting a bid.<ref name=tfa/><ref>{{cite news|title=Deadliest U.S. Fraternity Abolishes Pledging for New Members|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-07/most-deadly-u-s-fraternity-scraps-initiation-for-new-members|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|issue=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Residency====\nUnique among most campus organizations, members of social Greek letter organizations often live together in a large house (generally privately owned by the fraternity itself, or by the fraternity's alumni association) or a distinct part of the university dormitories. A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities. \n\n[[File:Zeta Psi Fraternity House, Lafayette College 01.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Zeta Psi]] chapter house at [[Lafayette College]]]]\n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies. While the identity of members or officers is rarely concealed, fraternities and sororities initiate members following the pledge period through sometimes elaborate private rituals, frequently drawn or adopted from Masonic ritual practice or that of the Greek mysteries.<ref name=handbook/>\n\nAt the conclusion of an initiation ritual, the organization's secret motto, secret purpose and secret identification signs, such as handshakes and passwords, are usually revealed to its new members.

Most fraternities also have assumed heraldic achievements. Members of fraternities and sororities address members of the same organization as \"brother\" (in the case of fraternities) or \"sister\" (in the case of sororities). The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].

Hazing during the pledge period can sometimes culminate in an event commonly known as \"Hell Week\" in which a week-long series of physical and mental torments are inflicted on pledges. Common hazing practices include sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and other types of spanking, use of [[stress positions]], forced runs, [[Busy work#Military settings|busy work]], forced drinking and [[mind games]]. Rarer incidents involving [[human branding|branding]], [[enemas]], urination on pledges and the forced consumption of [[spoiled food]] have been reported. Hazing, in many cases, has been reported and has led to the permanent disposal of particular chapters of fraternities and sororities across the country.\n\n[[File:Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of fraternity hazing from the early 20th century]]\nSupporters of fraternities note that hazing is almost universally prohibited by national fraternity organizations, and the occurrence of hazing in undergraduate fraternity chapters goes against official policy. Supporters of fraternities also note that hazing is not unique to Greek-letter organizations and is often reported in other student organizations, such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 2007, an anti-hazing hotline was set up to report incidents of hazing on college campuses. Currently, 46 national fraternity and sorority organizations support the toll-free number, which generates automatic email messages regarding hazing and sends them to the national headquarters directly from the National Anti-Hazing Hotline.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fraternal Law \u00bb Anti-Hazing Hotline|url = http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|website = fraternallaw.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027112504/http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|archive-date = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead}}</ref> Every year, the last week of September is considered to be National Hazing Prevention Week (NHPW). From hazingprevention.org, \"NHPW is an opportunity for campuses, schools, communities, organizations and individuals to raise awareness about the problem of hazing, educating others about hazing, and promoting the prevention of hazing.
