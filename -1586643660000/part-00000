One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> [[John Horton Conway|Conway's]] initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.<ref name=\"chapman\"> It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"bcg\">{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970.

For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal.

A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is '''''B'''orn'' if it has exactly three neighbours, '''''S'''urvives'' if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations.

State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours.

One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> [[John Horton Conway|Conway's]] initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.<ref name=\"chapman\"> It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"bcg\">{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A.

Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[Asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[Breeder (cellular automaton)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.\n\nIt is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary \"Elementary\"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21</ref>\n\n==Undecidability==\n\nMany patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=399&p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini \u2013 LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman-Greene construction arms.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is '''''B'''orn'' if it has exactly three neighbours, '''''S'''urvives'' if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

The vast majority of these 2<sup>18</sup> different rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Life-like#Life-like_cellular_automata |title=Life-like cellular automata - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behavior. A further generalization produces the ''isotropic'' rulespace, with 2<sup>102</sup> possible CA rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Isotropic |title=Isotropic - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> (Conway's Life again being one of them). These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>\n\nConway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[Spaceship (CA)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes on the fourth value, and otherwise, like ''Immigration'', it takes the majority value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_q.htm#quadlife |title=QuadLife |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

The city of [[Nabarangpur]] is the district headquarters. Most of its population is [[tribe|tribal]], and most of the land is [[forested]]. Situated in the southwest corner of Odisha, it borders [[Koraput District]]. Nabarangpur district is situated at 19.14\u2019 latitude and 82.32\u2019 longitude at an average elevation of {{convert|1876|ft|m}}.\n\n== History ==\n'''Pre-History''', '''Proto History''' and '''Early Historical perspective''' of the district.\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nUnlike other Districts of Odisha state, the pre-History of the Nabarangpur district is not known, proper scientific study is yet to be done to know the prehistory of this region.\n\nThe geographical setting of the Nabarangpur district has made this region to a large extent isolated from the plain coastal districts like Balesore, Cuttack and Puri. This isolation made the original inhabitants of this region preserve some of their manners, lifestyle, customs, and tradition until today.\n\nAlmost all the tribes such as Gond, Bhatra, Halba, Banjara, Kandha and others who constitute a bulk of population of the district speaking either histories or the Dravidian tongues, are the original people of this region since very old times. They have their own culture and ethnic values. But after the advent of foreign rule, the role of local chieftains, feudal lords, they accepted some norms of modern life and some discernible changes occurred in them. The cultural and administrative contacts after independence became rapid and they become the part of the main stream civilization.\n\nExcept the rites and rituals of these tribals, the pre-history of this region is not very limited. It is said by historians that the literary and epigraphic sources refer to a land mass known as atavi and the people were termed as atavikas (the forest dwellers) during the 3rd and 4th century BC Towards the 3rd century BC the land mass known as kantar of mahakantar was ruled by one Byaghraja and the area of kantar was spread from the central province to the foothills of the vindyas in the north to Indravati in the south Kantar or Mahakantar (great, dense forest.) Kingdom, this must have composed the present kalahandi, Nabarangpur, Koraput of odisha state and Bastar region of Chhattisgarh state.\n\nThe proposed modern regions of the Nabarangpur district for identification with Atavi or Mahakantar need deep study and scientific revealers.\n\nThe study of ancient writings, paleolithic study of the earlier period of the Stone Age when people made stone weapons and tools neolithic study of the latest period of the Stone Age, the study of paleontology about 10,000 years ago and when people of this district began to settle in the villages, grow crops, keep animals, polisi stores for tools and used the wheels the pre-history of this district will come into light. Proper study of megalithic of Neolithic evidences will throw some light of the pre-history on the district.\n\nThe in-depth study of the burial rites and rituals of the original people, preserving the memory of the dead and secondly offering a seat for some deity should be made to know the pre and proto history of the district.\n\nEarly historical perspective of the Nabarangpur district can be a scribed (may be attributed to the discoveries of archeological evidences, coins, copper plates etc. important antiquities, of this district, which were reflected in Epigraphic India vole xxiv, vol-xix, the madras Epigraphic report for the year 1921\u201322, inscriptions of central province and beral to know the early history of the Nabarangpur district.\n\n=== Early Historical Perspective of the district ===\nThe territory comprising the modern district of Nabarangpur into her hills and river systems, forests and habitats was the part of the ancient atavik land (land of dense forests) as referred by Ashoka, the emperor of Magadha in his special rock edicts (261 BC). in fact rock edits-xiii and M.R.E-ii of Ashok use it in the sense of people living in the border forest land of kalinga. Historians like S.N Rajguru, A.C Mittal and N.K Sahu identity the atavi or Atavikas in pre-Christian periods with the forest kingdoms nestled on the borders of Kalinga that is the tel and the Indravati valley.\n\n==== Atavikas ====\nThe people of Atavi or Atavika rajya were brave and a great source of strength of kalinga in the 3rd century BC These people were not conquered by Ashok for their ferociousness and war like attitude; Ashok treaded them as his allies.\n\nVery little is known about the history of this region after Ashoka till the rise of Mahameghabahan Kharvel. Atavik region became an important part of his empire. This region is referred to as the \u201cinvincible vidyadhar region\u201d. In the hatigumpha inscription of Kharvel. Then the history of this region fed into oblivion.\n\nSystematic chronicling of potential historical data of the Nabarangpur district is not seriously done. As it is a recent phenomenon, some historians start the process of probe using materials of original and collateral resources like literature, epigraphy, iconology, numismatics, architecture and archeology particularly on the field studies surveys and excavations in podagada sights ({{convert|23|km}} from Umerkote, Nabarangpur district) During (290-300 AD) kautar the kingdom in which the Nabarangpur was a part was ruled by the Nala dynastic found by sisuka.\n\n=== District under Various dynasties ===\nAs the recent Nabarangpur district once was the part of ataxic and kantar kingdom in the 4th and 3rd century BC it is penitent to know the history of the district under various dynasties since 4th century BC to today.\n\n==== The Satabahans ====\nThe Nasith inscription of vasisthaputra pulumavie (circa 149 AD) indicates the existence of this region. Which was under Gouthamputra satakarni (circa 106 to 130 AD) from (circa 130-159) vasib sitaputra pulumahi ruled over the territory. From (eir 159 to 174 AD) the ruler of the territory is not known. The great king of satabahanas dynasty sri yaga satakarni was the ruler of this region from 174 AD to 202 AD but there is no historical evidence of his hold over Nabarangpur territory.\n\n==== The Ikshvkus ====\nIn the 3rd century AD the satabahanas power declined and the Koraput region of which Nabarangpur was a part passed to Ikshvkus dynasty sri santomula the founder of Ikshvkus power won extensive territories by Digvilaya. His son and successor of mathariputra sri Virapurush datta the greatest minaret of this dynasty ruled over Koraput region.\n\n==== The Vakatakas ====\nBy the middle of the 3rd century AD Vindyasakti, the founder of the vakatak dynasty succeeded in extending his kingdom from Malaya to Vidarbha. His son pravarsen 1, the successor of Vindyasakti conquered the eastern and north eastern region very likely brought Bastar -Koraput area to Vakatak dominion.\n\nBut the Koraput region was not under the Vakatakas at the time of Samudragupta as campaign in cer -350AD. By that line Koraput region was forming the part of the Mahakantha of territory was their ruled by a king named Vyagkraraj. This Mahakantha territory is very likely the same as the lord of Mahavan (From Nagaraju Konda inscription). Probably the Koraput region was not under the rule of the Guptas. The emevgence of Saivision and Vaishnavism in the inaccessible region of Koraput (Including Nabarangpur) may be ascribed to the influence of the Gupta-Vakatak culture.\n\n==== The Nalas ====\nIn the 4th \u2013 5th century AD the Nalas rose to prominence with their capital metropolis at puskari in modern Umerkote tahsil of Nabarangpur District. The Nalas ruled over the Bastor \u2013Koraput region including Nabarangpur.\n\nThe rule of the Nala dynasty was the glorious chapter of the Nabarngpur district which reflects the political history of this area under the rule of Bhabadattaburman (435 AD-465 AD), Arthas Patiraja (c-465-480), and Skaadavarman (c-480-515).\n\n==== Bhabadatta Varman (c-435-465 AD) ====\nFrom the available records, archaeological evidence ruins, icons, numismatic proves, we get a transparent or clear picture of the Nala rulers of their prosperous region, which is full of activities, achievements both political and cultural.\n\nBhabadatta Varman a son and success of Vasahraj perhaps laid a strong trandation of the Nala kingdom. Bhabadatta Varman is known form the Podagada store inscription Rithapur grant issued from Nanda Vardban. The Podagada stone inscription of Skanda Varman (2nd son of Bhabadatta Varman) throws light of Bhabadatta Varman. He had a glorious eventful region of some 30 years.\n\nThe original capital of the Nalas was puskari (a place of blooming puskars(lotus) is ponds and tanks surrounding the capital city) i.e. modern Podagada (Altekar-op-ci P.114) and apparently Bhabadatta Varman ruled from this place, till he shifted to Nandi Vardhan. His queen's name was Achali Bhattanika (Rathapur grant)\n\n\u201cMama chachapi (pi)(Achali) Bhattarickasya/Damptya (Dampya) tasya vamala manu pruhatyani,\u201d(Epigraphic India- vol-XIX,P.202).She was the chief queen of Maharaja Bhabadatta Varman.\n\nHis royal title was \u201cMaheswar mahasenati srista rajya Vibhavah/Nalanrupa vansa prasutah/Tripathakadhvajah sir Maharaja Bhabadatta Varman\u201d.The king was a devout worshiper of siva and Kalikey.\n\n(Finding of number of siva temples/ lings in the 5&nbsp;km radius of Padagada fort till amply proves his religious faith.)\n\nBhabadatta Varman was a great administrator an invincible worrier, he had a beautiful capital at Puskari which was evident from the ruins of Padagada a well-fortified city well planned with temple and orchards and gardens. The present \u201cBhandariguda\u201d GP, the name of ancient Puskari bears the illustrious name of Bhabadatta Varman.\n\nThe Puskari, ON the Bank of Singari rivulet (the perennial water source) might have been a wonderful city of his age.\n\n==== Arthapati (c-465-480) ====\nMaharaja Arthapati Bhattaraka succeeded his father Bhavadata Varaman in 465 AD and ruled up to 480 Ad. He ruled in the territory of original Nala rule from capital Puskari. The Keshari beda grants we come to know that he was a great king.Sri Arthapati Maharaja Bhattaraka\u201d. He donated the village, the Keselaka gram (Kesharbeda) in his 7th regal year to Durgatya, Ravivarya, Ravidaftarya and Matrarya of Kautsasa gotra. (Kesaribeda is in Umerkote tahasil of the Nabarangpur District). The site of Kesaribeda is full of relics and ruins with a very old tank per fobs of the 5th century AD. From the Podagada stone inscription it is known that as Arthapati repailed and repopulated the deva staled city of Puskari. In the year 480 AD he was defeated by the mighty Vakatak king Pritfisen. Like his father, he was also an able administrator with a benevolent disposition. Sanskrit was his court language. He was a great patron of learning and literature.\n\n==== Skanda varman (cir-480 AD- 515 AD) ====\nSkanda varman, the second son of Bhave dattavarman ascended the throne in year 480Ad at Paskari. He repulsed the vakatak arraign, retrieve the lost territory of his ancestor and repopulate the city of Puskar. He was a great warrior of his time. Skanda karma is known to us from his Podagada stone inscription (E.I.XIXPP 153\u201357). The grant has been issued in his 12 the regional year (cir-492 AD) from his capital. It consists of 13 verses composed in Anustuppa ethanda (E.I.XIXPP.153\u2013157). He was a great Vaishnvite. He founded of a foot print (Padamala) of Vishnu and donated some holdings to chakradrone for the maintenance of the temple.\n\nSkanda varman enhanced the glory of his father Bhabadatta Varman. In his reign, he pursued the worship of Vishnu and also Shiva. The icons/stone, images found from the ruins of the Padagada and the 13 users of the stone inscription clearly mentions that, \u201cthis print or century was made by the illustrious king Skanda Varman, the noble son of king Bhabadatta Varman, who was the foremost scion of the glorious Nala family and repelled his enemies by his valor, on having reclaimed the lost royal prosperity, which had fallen into others hand or was unsettled and having repeopled the deserted (Sunya) town of Puskari, with the hope of obtaining religious merit for his father, other ancestors and mother and desiring welfare for himself.\u201d(Epigraphic India \u2013 vol-XXI-PP 153\u2013157).\n\nWith the death of Skanda Varman in the year 515 AD, the glorious chapter of Puskari domination come to an end, and the successor of Skanda Varman were vanquished by Chalukya Kirtivarman.\n\n==== The Mathars ====\nAfter the decline of the Nalas for sometime Koraput region was under the sway of the Mothers dynasty. The earliest Mathars king was Visakha Varman. The last ruler of the Mathars dynasty was Nanda Pravanjan Varman who ruled over the Koraput region till he was overthrown by the Eastern Gangs about 498 AD.\n\nThe Eastern Gangs:\n\nNot much is known about the ruling of the Eastern Gangs over the Bastar Koraput region.\n\n==== The Somavaxsis ====\nIn the year 9th century AD trikaling under the rule of Somavaxsis king Mahavaba Gupta Janmajaya I extended his territory up to Bastar, Koraput region (in the Nabarangpur area). His successor Janmajaya2, Puranjay and Karnadas were weak kings, so in the year 1023AD, the Tamoas Chloa king Rajendra Chola occupied the Bastar Koraput region, these known as Chakrakote. His victory of this territory was short lived. After his withdrawal from this area the Gang king Vajrahasta V, claimed his sovereignty over this territory assuming the family life \u201cThrikalingadhipati\u201d. The gang ruled up to 1305 AD.\n\n==== The Chhidak Nagas ====\nDuring the interregnum of the Gangas and Kalehuri King over the domain of Trikalinga territory, the Bastar-Koraput region underwent political changes. The Naga dynasty had already occupied these regions as early as 1023 AD (Hiralal : inscription of cp and Beraf,P-166).\n\nThe Errakote inscription dated 1023 AD refers to the Naga king Nrupati Bhusan the earliest king of the Chhiadak Nagas in Chakrakote (roughly consisting of the [[Bastar district|Bastar]]-[[Koraput district|Koraput]] region). Some war was the last king of the Chhiadak Nagas. After him, sons of his family continued to rule in the Bastar Koraput region during the 13 century AD. A king named Jagadeva Bhusan Narasingha was ruling over this region during 1218-1224 AD (Epigraphic India Vol X-P40/1BID Jatanpal and Danteswar Inscription).\n\nThe Matsya Family: By the middle of the 13th century AD the Chhiadak Nagas' dominion passed on to the foads of the Matsya family. The family may have ruled the Bastar Koraput region for some time.\n\n==== The Silavamsis ====\nThe Silavamsis of Nandapur were a branch of famous Silavamsis who ruled over the Vindya tract from their capital at Nandi Bardhan (22 miles North West from Nagpur). Three generations of this dynasty rule in Nandapur region. King Gang Raja (Middle of the 14 century AD).His son Viswanath Raja alias Bhairab Raja and Pratap Ganga Raja were the rulers. According to Bidyadhar singh Deos Nandapur forsaken Kingdom. Their territory extends to the north of up to Budha kalinga in the present Kalahandi district on the south up to Kambamottu in the Malkangiri area, in the west up to Bhaskar (Bhaskel River) in the Umerkote area and in the east up to chicacole Nagar. So the Silavamsis ruled in Nabaragnpur area for a century or so.\n\n==== The Suryavansa: (The solar dynasty) ====\nThe last king of the Silavansa of Nandapur was Pratap Ganga Raja, after his death, he was succeeded by one Vinayak Deo, who founded the solar dynasty.\n\nThe suryavansa ruled the dominion of Nandapur kingdom till the end of the British period. The Nandapur kingdom spread to a vast execute of area including the recent Nabarangpur region.\n\nThe family chronicles, various copper plate granted by earlier Rajas, references made by Ferista, the Mahamedan historian of the Kutabsati sultans of Golkonda, we know the genealogy of the suryavansi kings who ruled from 1443 AD to 1947 AD. The family chronicles give the following dates for the founded of the Suryavansa cine and his successor:-\n\nVinayak Deo -1443-76\n\nHis son Vinaya Chandra Deo -1476-1510\n\nHis son Bhairab Deo -1510-27\n\nHis son Viswanath Deo -1527-71\n\nHis son Balaram DEo -1571-97\n\nHis son Yasvanta Deo -1597-1637\n\nHis son Virvikram Deo -1637-69\n\nHis son Krisna Deo -1669-72\n\nHis son Biswambar Deo 1 -1672-76\n\nHis brother Mallikamardhan krisna rao -1676-81\n\nHis brother Hari Deo -1681-84\n\nHis brother Balaram Deo2 -1684-86\n\nHis adopted son Raghunath krisna Deo -1686-1708\n\nHis son Ramchandra Deo1 -1708-11\n\nHis Brother Balaram Deo3 -1711-13\n\nHis Brother Biswambar Deo2 -1713-52\n\nHis step Brother Lalakrisna Deo -1752-58\n\nHis brother Bikram Deo1 -1758-81\n\nHis son Ramchandra Deo2 -1781-1825 From the time of Ramachandra Deo2 there is contemporary historical record of the history of the Jeypore states the northern part of which is the recent Nabarangpur region. The kings of the Suryavansa ruled for nearly (1443 AD-1947 AD) 500years. By their rule Nabarangpur develop and nourished as a part of the kingdom.\n\n==== Muslim Occupation ====\nWhen the Nandapur kingdom was ruled by the suryavansi king Viswanath Deo by the end of his rule he saw Muslim invasion to his kingdom. He breathed his last in 1571 AD and his son Balaam Deo succeeded him but was defeated by Rullfat Khan, The lieutent of Ibrahim qutab shah the sultan, of Golconda and agreed to pay tributes to the sultan of goal ganda and his name entered into jamu Kashmir.with Balaram Deo the nandapur kingdom came under Muslim occupation. So the northern corners were completely under the sway of the quth saffis. The nandapur kingdom came under the fauzdar of chicacole .The suryavansi kings paid tribute to the sultan of goalconda an account of rs 24 thosands per annum. Ruled Jeypore estate till is the estate is taken over by the British government. Through the recent Nabarangpur was the part of the Jeypore estate. The region never encountered in to the direct onslaught of the Muslims, but ruled but the suryavansi king.\n\n==== Anglo-French Conflict ====\nAfter the death of Aurangajeb in 1707 AD the subedar of Deccan became independent. He appointed Anwaruddin as the fauzdar of chicacole. In the political turmoil difference declared Salabatjung, the third son of Asaf Jha as the nizam and obtained four northern areas under chicacola circle in 1753. But the discontented fauzadar of chicola JatarAli resisted the French occupation of chicole but was defeated by the franc. After the death of Vijayram Raja the Galati of Vijaynagaram, his son Ananda Raju a great enemy of the French revolution against the French supremacy and invited the English to help him. Lord Clive immediately sent. Forde by sea who regained Visakhapatnam and help Ananda Raja. After the Rajahmundry battle on the 9th dec 1757.salabati Jung the Nabab of Hyderabad deserted the French and the English restored that authority over the northern sir car.\n\nIn 1765 the Mughal Emperor of Delhi Saha alam granted the Northen circle to Robert Clive along into the Dewani of Bihar, Bengal and Orissa to the East India Company by a firmer. Through the northern circle came under the British Jeypore (EState revised out side the sphere of the British administration till 1865).Almost a century close before they directly administer the Jeypore estate. So Nabarangpur also as the part of the Jeypore state spread the British rule up to the said date.\n\n==== Brithish Occupation ====\nA conflict arose between the kings Vijayaram Raju, the king of Vijaynagaram successor and the king of Jeypore regarding the Jeypore territory in the year 1768 under an alleged patta granted in 1752 by Salabetijung, the subedar of Deccan. The patta recorded the grant of the villagers- kasipuram, nandapuram and Madgal by way of jagir to Raja Vijayaram Raju on an annual payment of Rs.24, 0000. The Jeypore Maharaja Vikram Deo refuted the claim of the Vijaya nagaram king and sends his agent Jagannath patra to Vizagpatanam to get support of the British authority. But the British supported the claim of the king of the Vijayanagaram, This action of the British made some disaffected clients and Zamindars to revolt against the Vijayanagaram king. In 1773 the Jeypore king Bikram Deo gathered a strong force and 2000 martha horses to fight against the vijayanagaram king at Rayagada Valley. Taking the advantages of this disturbance the British first asserted their authority over the hill tracks of Jeypore.\n\nCaptain Richard Mathews, the then commander of Northern circle was sent by the east India Company to march to hill country Jeypore with a company of Sibbandis of the Raja of Vijayanagaram. Caption Mathews took the possession the Rayagada on 15.01.1775. He possessed the past of Narayanpatna .Braving the shift resistance by the troops of the Jeypore king, captain Mathews reached Jeypore, the capital of the Suryavans kings with his army. He designed the Jeypore fort in the last week of February -1775 and defeated the Maratha troop of the Vikram Deo. The king Vikram Deo surrenders to captain Mathews. The fort was ruined by the British troop. As a result of this campaign, the Jeypore territory was completely occupied and subjugated by the British.\n\nThe Madras Government appointed a committee of the circle in 1776 to study the revenue system of the northern circle. When in the year 1784 the Madras government came to know the oppression of the Vijayanagaram dewan Sitaram Raju and malad instruction of the chief of the council of vizagpatam, the government condoned such act and separated the Jeypore Zamindar. Independent of Vijayanagaram seeing such action of the British the king of vijayanagarm rose against then and a pitched battle was fought at Padmanavam in which the king of vijayanagaram was defeated and killed by Lt.Col.Prendargast. At this juncture the king of Jeypore Ramachandra Deo2 kept himself aloof from this situation and did at support the king of Vijayanagaram. The British seeing the neutrality of the Jeypore king granted him a permanent sauanda for Jeypore for an annual tribute of Rs.25000/-. In 1802-03 permanent settlement was attached throughout the Vizagpatam district and Ramachandra Deo accepted the settlement and got his Peshkash reduced to Rs .16000/-.\n\nOn 10 July 1855, the Madras Govt. authorized the British agent to assume the control of both policy and revenue of the hill tracts of Jeypore estate. The old maharaja Vikram Deo died on 10 August 1860 and his son Ramachandra Deo from the, then three British agent proposed to located assistant agent together with all assistants superintendent of police at Jeypore, which was sanctioned by the govt.\n\nWith the assumption of the direct administration of the Jeypore estate, four sub-magistrate were placed at Jeypore, Nabarangpur (Nawarangpur), Mahadeoput and Aurade.\n\nIn this way, the recent Nabarangpur region came under the British rule and sub-magistrate looked after the police and revenue of this area since 1860 to onwards.\n\nBefore such arrangement (the Nabarangpur district of 1992), the Nabarangpur region was a thana under the Jeypore estate. In the year 1820, Raja Ramachandra Deo 2 (1781-1825) granted Nabarangpur Thana as a grant to his brother Jagannath Deo (second son of Vikram Deo) to look after the area. Jagannath Deos son Krishna Deo, succeed this father and ruled. This region from 1814 to 1843 krisna Doe, bring issueless, son of Narasingha Deo(3rd son of Vikram Deo1), Chaitanaya Deo managed Nabarangpur region as a ruler from 1843-1876 AD, a stint of 33years.He was a great ruler of Nabarangpur, a benevolent, peace loving king, who erected temples, and tanks and ponds and tapes in every villages. He was a man of culture and one of the best king of all the suryavansi kings. From 1876, Nabarangpur was ruled by the queen up to 1911.Then the Nabarangpur thauf merged in the jeypore estate according to the verdict of the Madras Government in the year 1912 AD\n\n(Source: The Vinsasatadir Nabarangpur,Gopabandhu Beosoyi-1914)\n\nEvolution of Modern Nabarangpur:\n\nIn the year due to constant demands and representation, the British govt. in England passed an act in the year 1935 to create a separate province of Odisha. In 1936 Odisha became a spate state. Nabarangpur was incorporated in New Koraput district as a sub-division. The state was constituted according to the Board my Commission Report of 1932 up to 1962, Nabarangpur was the largest sub- division of the Koraput district.\n\nOn 2 October 1992, on the auspicious day of Mahatma Gandhis birthday, the government of Odisha declared Nabarangpur as an independent district. it is carved out of the Koraput district.Sri.T.ramachandrudu IAS appointed as the first collector of the new district.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe entire text of this chapter is prepared basing or the secondary sources of books, periodicals and journals.

Freedom and social welfare have many instances, so the uprisings of the natives and nontribals as well against the British rule and the atrocities committed by the royal family and their followers bore a bright testimony and the Nabarangpur district is no exception to it.\n\nThe Nabarangpur district has experienced the uprisings of the tribals and non-tribals in the 4th decade of the 20th century .the struggles have many faceted dimensions .these struggles were basically economical struggles against the non-tribal money launderers, traders, amenders, administrators who tried to exploit the tribal way of life and people of the lower strata of the society. During this period 1940 to 1947AD, the natives of the Nabarangpur district joined the groups of led by Indian national congress taking up specific issues and struggles launched by Mahatma Gandhi and his followers.\n\nDuring the British rule, the policing and revenue acts of the madras government was strictly imposed upon the local people of the Nabarangpur district.

As India was the vassal state of England by that time the wartime Prime Minister of England Winston Churchill, ordered the viceroy of India to collect manpower from India to fight the war and collect war funds to meet the war expenditure from the Indian people. Mahatma Gandhi resented the proposal of the British govt. and the Indian National Congress passed a regulation on 10.10.1939 not to support the British in the war and decided to protest through personal Satyagraha.

On 20.08.1942, Lakshmichandra Das was arrested and was kept in a temporary Jail of Nabarangpur as an under trial prisoner from 20.08.1943 and 21.12.1942.\n\nThe Nabarangpur region, as a Sub-division of the Koraput district played a prominent role in the freedom struggle between 1939\u201342. When Mahatma Gandhi declared Quit India Movement and Do or Die Mantra in the Bombay Convention of the Indian National Congress on 8 August 1942, the call never be rated all over India. Number of freedom fighters were arrested or the 9th August 1942.\n\nAs per previous decision of the Koraput District Congress Committee.Mathili the Thana was generated of the 21st August 1942 (Friday) at 2.00PM under the leadership of LakshmanNayak of Tentuliguda village. There was great commotion on that day. Where the freedom fighters moved towards Mathili Thana. The check and control the procession of the Freedom Fighters, the Police Station Officer JagarnathKalu Dora warned not to enter the Thana, but when the procession did at pay any attention to this working and marched onward the thana, seeing the rush of the mob, the then Deputy Magistrate who was present there ordered firing at the Freedom Fighter to dispense then by the force, the result of which was the death of five freedom fighters on spot by bullet wound. The Freedom fighters who braved the Police force and became the martyrs were: NakulMadakani of Saragiguda. BCNayak of Samara village LingaBhumia of Timasguda, ArjunKotia of Kukudaguda, NarasingaDomb of Nuaguda Somara Nayak of Mangariguda, GopiPujari of Sangumma,Gurukutia of Tiwasput Balram Bhumia of Temrupali. Many more were wounded by lathi charge. LakshmanNayak was beaten till he fell flat unconscious on the ground by a rifle but and when he was senseless, the Police thinking him dead, throw him into a nearby stream covered with dense bamboo forest.\n\n( source -Saheed LakshmanNayak by Dasrathi Nanda 8th edition 1999)\n\nAfter three days of Mathili firing the same was repeated at papadahandi of Nabarangpur Sub Division.\n\nThe Turi River Massacre at papadahandi on 24.08.1942 needs a special mention for its great historical importance.\n\nOn 23-8-1943, at 5 PM, nearly 500 people of Congress followers gathered at Gurumaguda village under the leadership of MadhabPradhani. They decided to move to Dabugam to discuss the course of the Congress also with regard to Quit India Movement 24-8- 1942. On 24.08.1942 the Congress worker with the Congress flag on their heads chanting Ramadev started towards Papadahandi, 6&nbsp;km from Gummaguda.\n\nNear Gouti river of Chikilipadar another group of Freedom fighters of different villages jointed to the first batch of the congress worker. The crowd grew to thousands (as per Police record-2000 or more people) It was 2PM in the afternoon time when the crowd reached Papadahandi village.\n\nApprehending the attack of Papadahandi out Post by the Congress workers the ARP Force as well as the local Police of Papadahandi Out Post with the help of the Local anti-Congress people, got ready to face the crowd, but when they found that the crowd instead of attacking the outpost were marching towards Dabugoan; the Police to check the crowd and to dispense them posted themselves by the west end of the wooden bridge of the turi River at the 35 mile stone with weapons. When the Congress People tried to cross the wooden bridge and passed over the bridge, some disturbances were created .some Police personels were pushed drawn, seeing this the Drill Inspector P.K.Gouda, the sergent of the A.R.P. Koraput ordered for firing to quell the marching of the Congress workers . The continuous firing resulted in the death of 12 Congress workers on the spot.\n\nThe dead body of the 12 Congress workers laid down there from 2PM of 24-08-1942 to 10AM of 26.08.1942 unsafe for identification, till the arrival of P.K.Tripathy.SDO Nabarangpur return to Papadahandi from Kodinga. Another7 Congress men were succumbed to bullet injury and died in the Jail premises. Hundreds of the crowd jumped into the flooded river to save themselves from the firing, 108persons was arrested.\n\nIn this blood curdling atrocities, the savage and barbarous police force killed 19 Congress workers in this fateful event. The sons of the soil become the martyrs, who laid their valuable lives for the freedom of the mother land.\n\nTo commemorate the sacrifice of the brave martyrs, a \u201cSaheed Minar\u201d has been erected in by Govt of Odisha. In the year 1985 by the then Governor of Odisha, Bisambarnath Pandey inaugurated the Minar as homage to the following martyrs, whose names were written in the history of the Freedom fighting of the Nabarangpur Sub-Division. Today the place is declared as a sacred place for the tourist.\n\nIt is praise worthy of the Freedom Fighters who for a noble cause shed their Blood in the Turi River Massacre and counted a glorious death to adore the golden page of the history of the freedom struggle forever. These brave sons were:-\n\n1 BastariaBhotra- Dolaiguda village, 2 SonuBhotra Nandahandi, 3 Bali Soura Tanda, 4 BuduAmanatya Usuripadar, 5 RatanRandhari Turunji,\n\n6 SukruMuduli Murlabai, 7 KhagapatiAmanatya Kongra, 8 Bharat Pujari Usuripadar, 9 RamachandraAmanaty Phupugam, 10 GhasiJani Nuagam,\n\n11 DinabandhuJani Nuagam, 12 BuduAmanatya Burunji, 13 JagannathAmanatya Patroput, 14 SadebPujari Padeiguda 15 MangaruBhatra Umurigam 16 Aananda Gouda Dukhuguda 17 ParamanandaSoura Mantriguda 18 BhagabanBhota Mantriguda 19 Shyamsundar Gouda Soruguda\n\nAfter the crack incident of 24.08.1942 another 90 Congress workers including Lakshmichandra Das, MadhavPradhani were arrested under sections.147,148,149,307 and 332 of IPC beings accused of criminal conspiracy against the Government of India for trial and punishment.\n\n(Sources:\n\n1.BiplabiLaxmichandra Das by Subash Chandra Mishra-2001 2.BinsaSatabdira Nabarangpur Gopabandhu Besoi-2014\n\n3.KorapatiaraSwarajSangram by SatyaPriya Das-1972 4.

Ancient relics are found scaltered all around the hill fort and the revenue village Bhandariguda represents the ancient city of Puskari.\u201d (Source: Dynastic history of NalasC.B.Patel 1990 PP 159)\n\nThe Puskari metropolis (township) was located on the left bank of the periperial river let \u201cSingari\u201d which joins the river BhaskelatNandapura. It is clearly evident from the Owens and traces of the Podagada, in its heyday Puskari metropolis seemed to spread between the twin river valleys of Singari and Nangi. Nangiriver flows 6&nbsp;km to the north of Podaguda and joins the Bhaskel River near Dhodra village.\n\nBoth the riverlets Singari and Nangi are of pererial in nature have originated from thehilly and forest area of Podagadaplateau of 2000 feet height .thePodagada hill that contains the fort and the stone inscription of the Nala king Skandavarman rises to a height of 3043 feet.\u201dThe highest peak of the mountain is 19 degree 36 the range extends from 82 degree E to 82 degree16 N and 84 degree 14 inches (Source : Indian atlas Sheet No.63)\n\nThe Podagada hill fort (Pushkaridurga) with its stategie location resembles to a great extent to the yadava hill fort of Devagiri (now known as Daulatabad)\n\nThe antiquity of ancient Puskari (Podagada) is very remote. According to G. RamadasPusqari is identifical with the famous Puskartirth of Mahabharat (JBRSxxxx111-1-11 PP7-19)\n\nKrishnamachaflu, who visitiedPodagada tract and discovered the rock inscription in the month of March and April 1922, has described the vast archaeological evidence of Puskari. I Epigraphic India P.153)\n\nG.Ramdas, the archaeologist of Madras Presidency, who visited the Podagada area in the year 1943 remarked that, \u201c in almost all or the vicinity of every village in this progantha(Padagada area) are found the vesiges of ancient civilization that was rampant here in the obscure antiquity\n\nDescription of some of the monuments and relies of Podagada :-\n\nThe ruins of Podagada clearly indicates that there was a fort located in the hill but was devastated by te enemy by fire and sword, so the fort was called later on as Podagada (the burnt fort)\n\nThe fort was well planned .the entrance of the fort was from the southern side. A large number of brickbats, fragments of sculptured stones, burnt brickpillars, and doors lambs are seen. The brickmeasurd 8x4x2 and the door Jamb contain floral designs. There were a number of stops made of stones raising from the bottom of the entrance of the fort upwards to climbs the fort.\n\nThere was a stone inscription promulgated by the second son of BhavadettaVarman, the mighty SquandaVarman Maharaja, at a height of 40 feet from the ground level. Some brothers stone pillars lied on the steps to indicate that there was an arch representing and collaborate and massive gateway. There was a massive stone pillar standing near the entrance of the fort. This is called locally as \u201cthe Hatibndha Pakana (a stone pillar meant for laying the elephants). There was a second gateway to the fort proper.\n\nIt is evident that there was probably a temple ( as per the inscription). Another set of stare case is found that rose up to 20 feet to a flat surface. There were the evidences of pottery, brickbats, floors and tiles to indicate the existence of some residential complex.\n\nA light of step are seen to the east down to the valley \u201c To the west and the North side of the fort, there was an extensive that surface with ruins of, pottery, tile, rammed floor brick and ruble wall (Dynastic History of Naas by CB Patel-1990)\n\nThe fort was built over the flat rock surface of the hill, in the north and west the flat rock surface ends in precipitous tall.\n\nFrom the top of the hill one can see the surrounding area clearly for miles. The valley was plain and spreading miles together giving an impression of past war fields. A joint sign of dried moat encircling the hill fort is presently found, and the muat as being connected with the perennial water source of the Singaririvalet .there was a pond near the southern entrance of the fort.\n\nIn the north beyond the moat another mountain is there, which night have been used as the watch tower. To the east of Podagada hills the depression running straight lines clearly indicates the existence of the roads and streets. To the east of Podagada hill, between the moat and the Singari rivaled(the present village of Bhandariguda), the extensive ruins of a township is seen in the shape of terracedttasbashills, pottery, broken pieces of terracotta and wax boggles, beads of clay and semi precious stones.\n\nTo the west near the old fortification area, a broken brick, temple between two ancient tanks may be secure. According to Epigraphic Tudia-xx.IV.P.153, the temple right be representing to a Siva shrine. The temple is in uncomplete ruin .the study of the nearly sculptures and remnants confirms the existence of two chambered Siva Temple.\n\nAt present, the existed sanction of the temple we find a Barb image and a Lingam along with a brisabha. There are different icons are seen in front of the temple like Brisabha, Ganesh, worhipper couple memorial Sati Pillars. In one of the later pillars, a warrior riding the horse and piercing a slid animal in a long spear had been engraved.\n\n\u201cTo the north of this place at a distance of I am there are another group of memorial pillars. Apart from these antiquities, the old residential evidence are forced like tiles, pottering terracotta fingers etc. as a pure sign of the existence of a township .there are the signs of Vibars, agrahars, places in this locality.\n\nThe Podagada stone inscription of SkandaVarman throws a light on their period. The verses depicted in the inscription clearly envisages that the king SkandaVarman had resorted the city from his enemy repopulated the city once again, rebuilt the city with palatial buildings. Residential houses, fortified the place the as a religious King and a dewat Vishnav established the total points of Vishnu (Padamouja), that may be a Vishnu vihar, to which a satra was also attached.\n\nFrom the above archaeological evidences and epigraphic reference we can safely include that, Pdagada, the ancients seta of Nalas, the ancient Puskari was a bashing city of attendance and appolenceschichreprsentstheglocious rule of the Nala dynasty from 4th and 5th Century AD.\n\nThe Kesaribeda Township or the Kesalak Grama Apart from the capital city Pucker, the nails had established other town and village, among which Kesaribeda (recently the village baring the same name is situated 17&nbsp;km from Umerkote Tahasils of Nabarangpur District (JBPS,xxxIII -1II-PP.7\u201319)\n\nKeisalakagrama was donated by Maharaja Asthapati, the first son of Nala King Bhave data Varman, to durggirgga, Raviraryya and Ravidattaryya. The village can be identified with the present Kesharbeda village.\n\nKesaribeda village is located at a distance of 25&nbsp;km from to the north west of Puskari in Padagda near the source of river Tel.\n\nIn the year 19, the archaeologist, G.Ramdas visited to find the spot of Kesaribeda charge had Charter had visibly depicts in his report that there were 5 mounds existed of rubbles and pieces of bricks and a tank of 100 yards square (JBRSxxxIII-I-II0P 7-19)\n\nThe tank still exists in Kesaribeda village in its arabaic look. There is a village named Andhri, near Asthapeti, who devoted this village.\n\nA trial excavation was made of this Kesharibeda village by G. Ramdas and in one of the mounts he found a rectangular room of 8x4x and build of walls 2\u201d thick of bricks (18x8x1) .the extent of wall measured about 26\u201d floors of the room paved with bricks . A carved beautiful Vishnu image was also found from the structure.\n\nNear the tank there was another mound excavation of which yielded a room with 2 feet high wall. Another two tanks were also found drag with the sculptured image of Siva and Vishnu. The looks of the images give an impression of the Nula age and the images of Puskari. The ruin found in Kesaribeda village spreading over a big area with tank indicates that Kesaribeda was a small town having temples residential habitants.\n\nArt and Architecture: the Podagada School of art and architecture-\n\nThe splendid arts and architecture that flourished during the Nula rules, the signs of which are seen in the rains of Podagadadesrveds mention. Elaborate system of fortification, religious, edifices, monasko institutions, plastic arts, and sculptural art expressed in architecture as well as in cult icons are found in Podagada rains.\n\nThe tell fort of Podagada (4th/5th century AD), the terracotta arts, the panel of Siva Parvati, the Saiva and Vishnu shrine, the image of Bhairab, Ganesh, Brisav, the yakshya image, the satti pillars give us a clear picture of the art and architecture of Podagada of the Nabarangpur District, this old village.\n\nSo the Nabarangpur district is forwarded enough to have such archaeological evidence to show the glorious post of this district. So it is elect from the above analyses the Nalas ruled a vast stretches of Nabarangpur region for 200 years. The 4th and 5th of Koraput.1966: Govt. of Odisha)\n\nCoins: A hoard of coins was discovered from the different places of Bastar-Koraput region bearing the evidence of the Nala period. In the 4th and 5th century AD the Nalas established a strong kingdom, their capital being Puskari, the recent Padagada in the present Nabarangpur district. Their Kingdom was contiguous to estate of Bastar in MadhyaPradhesh Crow the Chhattisgarh state where 1939 is a hoard of 32 gold coins, belonging to king varahraj Sri Arthapati Raja and BhaladattaVarman was discovered.

The city of [[Nabarangpur]] is the district headquarters. Most of its population is [[tribe|tribal]], and most of the land is [[forested]]. Situated in the southwest corner of Odisha, it borders [[Koraput District]]. Nabarangpur district is situated at 19.14\u2019 latitude and 82.32\u2019 longitude at an average elevation of {{convert|1876|ft|m}}.\n\n== History ==\n'''Pre-History''', '''Proto History''' and '''Early Historical perspective''' of the district.\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nUnlike other Districts of Odisha state, the pre-History of the Nabarangpur district is not known, proper scientific study is yet to be done to know the prehistory of this region.\n\nThe geographical setting of the Nabarangpur district has made this region to a large extent isolated from the plain coastal districts like Balesore, Cuttack and Puri. This isolation made the original inhabitants of this region preserve some of their manners, lifestyle, customs, and tradition until today.\n\nAlmost all the tribes such as Gond, Bhatra, Halba, Banjara, Kandha and others who constitute a bulk of population of the district speaking either histories or the Dravidian tongues, are the original people of this region since very old times. They have their own culture and ethnic values. But after the advent of foreign rule, the role of local chieftains, feudal lords, they accepted some norms of modern life and some discernible changes occurred in them. The cultural and administrative contacts after independence became rapid and they become the part of the main stream civilization.\n\nExcept the rites and rituals of these tribals, the pre-history of this region is not very limited. It is said by historians that the literary and epigraphic sources refer to a land mass known as atavi and the people were termed as atavikas (the forest dwellers) during the 3rd and 4th century BC Towards the 3rd century BC the land mass known as kantar of mahakantar was ruled by one Byaghraja and the area of kantar was spread from the central province to the foothills of the vindyas in the north to Indravati in the south Kantar or Mahakantar (great, dense forest.) Kingdom, this must have composed the present kalahandi, Nabarangpur, Koraput of odisha state and Bastar region of Chhattisgarh state.\n\nThe proposed modern regions of the Nabarangpur district for identification with Atavi or Mahakantar need deep study and scientific revealers.\n\nThe study of ancient writings, paleolithic study of the earlier period of the Stone Age when people made stone weapons and tools neolithic study of the latest period of the Stone Age, the study of paleontology about 10,000 years ago and when people of this district began to settle in the villages, grow crops, keep animals, polisi stores for tools and used the wheels the pre-history of this district will come into light. Proper study of megalithic of Neolithic evidences will throw some light of the pre-history on the district.\n\nThe in-depth study of the burial rites and rituals of the original people, preserving the memory of the dead and secondly offering a seat for some deity should be made to know the pre and proto history of the district.\n\nEarly historical perspective of the Nabarangpur district can be a scribed (may be attributed to the discoveries of archeological evidences, coins, copper plates etc. important antiquities, of this district, which were reflected in Epigraphic India vole xxiv, vol-xix, the madras Epigraphic report for the year 1921\u201322, inscriptions of central province and beral to know the early history of the Nabarangpur district.\n\n=== Early Historical Perspective of the district ===\nThe territory comprising the modern district of Nabarangpur into her hills and river systems, forests and habitats was the part of the ancient atavik land (land of dense forests) as referred by Ashoka, the emperor of Magadha in his special rock edicts (261 BC). in fact rock edits-xiii and M.R.E-ii of Ashok use it in the sense of people living in the border forest land of kalinga. Historians like S.N Rajguru, A.C Mittal and N.K Sahu identity the atavi or Atavikas in pre-Christian periods with the forest kingdoms nestled on the borders of Kalinga that is the tel and the Indravati valley.\n\n==== Atavikas ====\nThe people of Atavi or Atavika rajya were brave and a great source of strength of kalinga in the 3rd century BC These people were not conquered by Ashok for their ferociousness and war like attitude; Ashok treaded them as his allies.\n\nVery little is known about the history of this region after Ashoka till the rise of Mahameghabahan Kharvel. Atavik region became an important part of his empire. This region is referred to as the \u201cinvincible vidyadhar region\u201d. In the hatigumpha inscription of Kharvel. Then the history of this region fed into oblivion.\n\nSystematic chronicling of potential historical data of the Nabarangpur district is not seriously done. As it is a recent phenomenon, some historians start the process of probe using materials of original and collateral resources like literature, epigraphy, iconology, numismatics, architecture and archeology particularly on the field studies surveys and excavations in podagada sights ({{convert|23|km}} from Umerkote, Nabarangpur district) During (290-300 AD) kautar the kingdom in which the Nabarangpur was a part was ruled by the Nala dynastic found by sisuka.\n\n=== District under Various dynasties ===\nAs the recent Nabarangpur district once was the part of ataxic and kantar kingdom in the 4th and 3rd century BC it is penitent to know the history of the district under various dynasties since 4th century BC to today.\n\n==== The Satabahans ====\nThe Nasith inscription of vasisthaputra pulumavie (circa 149 AD) indicates the existence of this region. Which was under Gouthamputra satakarni (circa 106 to 130 AD) from (circa 130-159) vasib sitaputra pulumahi ruled over the territory. From (eir 159 to 174 AD) the ruler of the territory is not known. The great king of satabahanas dynasty sri yaga satakarni was the ruler of this region from 174 AD to 202 AD but there is no historical evidence of his hold over Nabarangpur territory.\n\n==== The Ikshvkus ====\nIn the 3rd century AD the satabahanas power declined and the Koraput region of which Nabarangpur was a part passed to Ikshvkus dynasty sri santomula the founder of Ikshvkus power won extensive territories by Digvilaya. His son and successor of mathariputra sri Virapurush datta the greatest minaret of this dynasty ruled over Koraput region.\n\n==== The Vakatakas ====\nBy the middle of the 3rd century AD Vindyasakti, the founder of the vakatak dynasty succeeded in extending his kingdom from Malaya to Vidarbha. His son pravarsen 1, the successor of Vindyasakti conquered the eastern and north eastern region very likely brought Bastar -Koraput area to Vakatak dominion.\n\nBut the Koraput region was not under the Vakatakas at the time of Samudragupta as campaign in cer -350AD. By that line Koraput region was forming the part of the Mahakantha of territory was their ruled by a king named Vyagkraraj. This Mahakantha territory is very likely the same as the lord of Mahavan (From Nagaraju Konda inscription). Probably the Koraput region was not under the rule of the Guptas. The emevgence of Saivision and Vaishnavism in the inaccessible region of Koraput (Including Nabarangpur) may be ascribed to the influence of the Gupta-Vakatak culture.\n\n==== The Nalas ====\nIn the 4th \u2013 5th century AD the Nalas rose to prominence with their capital metropolis at puskari in modern Umerkote tahsil of Nabarangpur District. The Nalas ruled over the Bastor \u2013Koraput region including Nabarangpur.\n\nThe rule of the Nala dynasty was the glorious chapter of the Nabarngpur district which reflects the political history of this area under the rule of Bhabadattaburman (435 AD-465 AD), Arthas Patiraja (c-465-480), and Skaadavarman (c-480-515).\n\n==== Bhabadatta Varman (c-435-465 AD) ====\nFrom the available records, archaeological evidence ruins, icons, nureismatic proves, we get a transparent or clear picture of the Nala rulers of their prosperous region, which is full of activities, achievements both political and cultural.\n\nBhabadatta Varman a son and success of Vasahraj perhaps laid a strong trandation of the Nala kingdom. Bhabadatta Varman is known form the Podagada store inscription Rithapur grant issued from Nanda Vardban. The Podagada stone inscription of Skanda Varman (2nd son of Bhabadatta Varman) throws light of Bhabadatta Varman. He had a glorious eventful region of some 30 years.\n\nThe original capital of the Nalas was puskari (a place of blooming puskars(lotus) is ponds and tanks surrounding the capital city) i.e. modern Podagada (Altekar-op-ci P.114) and apparently Bhabadatta Varman ruled from this place, till he shifted to Nandi Vardhan. His queen's name was Achali Bhattanika (Rathapur grant)\n\n\u201cMama chachapi (pi)(Achali) Bhattarickasya/Damptya (Dampya) tasya vamala manu pruhatyani,\u201d(Epigraphic India- vol-XIX,P.202).She was the chief queen of Maharaja Bhabadatta Varman.\n\nHis royal title was \u201cMaheswar mahasenati srista rajya Vibhavah/Nalanrupa vansa prasutah/Tripathakadhvajah sir Maharaja Bhabadatta Varman\u201d.The king was a devout worshiper of siva and Kalikey.\n\n(Finding of number of siva temples/ lings in the 5&nbsp;km radius of Padagada fort till amply proves his religious faith.)\n\nBhabadatta Varman was a great administrator an invincible worrier, he had a beautiful capital at Puskari which was evident from the ruins of Padagada a well-fortified city well planned with temple and orchards and gardens. The present \u201cBhandariguda\u201d GP, the name of ancient Puskari bears the illustrious name of Bhabadatta Varman.\n\nThe Puskari, ON the Bank of Singari rivulet (the perennial water source) might have been a wonderful city of his age.\n\n==== Arthapati (c-465-480) ====\nMaharaja Arthapati Bhattaraka succeeded his father Bhavadata Varaman in 465 AD and ruled up to 480 Ad. He ruled in the territory of original Nala rule from capital Puskari. The Keshari beda grants we come to know that he was a great king.Sri Arthapati Maharaja Bhattaraka\u201d. He donated the village, the Keselaka gram (Kesharbeda) in his 7th regal year to Durgatya, Ravivarya, Ravidaftarya and Matrarya of Kautsasa gotra. (Kesaribeda is in Umerkote tahasil of the Nabarangpur District). The site of Kesaribeda is full of relics and ruins with a very old tank per fobs of the 5th century AD. From the Podagada stone inscription it is known that as Arthapati repailed and repopulated the deva staled city of Puskari. In the year 480 AD he was defeated by the mighty Vakatak king Pritfisen. Like his father, he was also an able administrator with a benevolent disposition. Sanskrit was his court language. He was a great patron of learning and literature.\n\n==== Skanda varman (cir-480 AD- 515 AD) ====\nSkanda varman, the second son of Bhave dattavarman ascended the throne in year 480Ad at Paskari. He repulsed the vakatak arraign, retrieve the lost territory of his ancestor and repopulate the city of Puskar. He was a great warrior of his time. Skanda karma is known to us from his Podagada stone inscription (E.I.XIXPP 153\u201357). The grant has been issued in his 12 the regional year (cir-492 AD) from his capital. It consists of 13 verses composed in Anustuppa ethanda (E.I.XIXPP.153\u2013157). He was a great Vaishnvite. He founded of a foot print (Padamala) of Vishnu and donated some holdings to chakradrone for the maintenance of the temple.\n\nSkanda varman enhanced the glory of his father Bhabadatta Varman. In his reign, he pursued the worship of Vishnu and also Shiva. The icons/stone, images found from the ruins of the Padagada and the 13 users of the stone inscription clearly mentions that, \u201cthis print or century was made3 by the illustrious king Skanda Varman, the noble son of king Bhabadatta Varman, who was the foremost scion of the glorious Nala family and repelled his enemies by his valor, on having reclaimed the lost royal prosperity, which had fallen into others hand or was unsettled and having repeopled the deserted (Sunya) town of Puskari, with the hope of obtaining religious merit for his father, other ancestors and mother and desiring welfare for himself.\u201d(Epigraphic India \u2013 vol-XXI-PP 153\u2013157).\n\nWith the death of Skanda Varman in the year 515 AD, the glorious chapter of Puskari domination come to an end, and the successor of Skanda Varman were vanquished by Chalukya Kirtivarman.\n\n==== The Mathars ====\nAfter the decline of the Nalas for sometime Koraput region was under the sway of the Mothers dynasty. The earliest Mathars king was Visakha Varman. The last ruler of the Mathars dynasty was Nanda Pravanjan Varman who ruled over the Koraput region till he was overthrown by the Eastern Gangs about 498 AD.\n\nThe Eastern Gangs:\n\nNot much is known about the ruling of the Eastern Gangs over the Bastar Koraput region.\n\n==== The Somavaxsis ====\nIn the year 9th century AD trikaling under the rule of Somavaxsis king Mahavaba Gupta Janmajaya I extended his territory up to Bastar, Koraput region (in the Nabarangpur area). His successor Janmajaya2, Puranjay and Karnadas were weak kings, so in the year 1023AD, the Tamoas Chloa king Rajendra Chola occupied the Bastar Koraput region, these known as Chakrakote. His victory of this territory was short lived. After his withdrawal from this area the Gang king Vajrahasta V, claimed his sovereignty over this territory assuming the family life \u201cThrikalingadhipati\u201d. The gang ruled up to 1305 AD.\n\n==== The Chhidak Nagas ====\nDuring the interregnum of the Gangas and Kalehuri King over the domain of Trikalinga territory, the Bastar-Koraput region underwent political changes. The Naga dynasty had already occupied these regions as early as 1023 AD (Hiralal : inscription of cp and Beraf,P-166).\n\nThe Errakote inscription dated 1023 AD refers to the Naga king Nrupati Bhusan the earliest king of the Chhiadak Nagas in Chakrakote (roughly consisting of the [[Bastar district|Bastar]]-[[Koraput district|Koraput]] region). Some war was the last king of the Chhiadak Nagas. After him, sons of his family continued to rule in the Bastar Koraput region during the 13 century AD. A king named Jagadeva Bhusan Narasingha was ruling over this region during 1218-1224 AD (Epigraphic India Vol X-P40/1BID Jatanpal and Danteswar Inscription).\n\nThe Matsya Family: By the middle of the 13th century AD the Chhiadak Nagas' dominion passed on to the foads of the Matsya family. The family may have ruled the Bastar Koraput region for some time.\n\n==== The Silavamsis ====\nThe Silavamsis of Nandapur were a branch of famous Silavamsis who ruled over the Vindya tract from their capital at Nandi Bardhan (22 miles North West from Nagpur). Three generations of this dynasty rule in Nandapur region. King Gang Raja (Middle of the 14 century AD).His son Viswanath Raja alias Bhairab Raja and Pratap Ganga Raja were the rulers. According to Bidyadhar singh Deos Nandapur forsaken Kingdom. Their territory extends to the north of up to Budha kalinga in the present Kalahandi district on the south up to Kambamottu in the Malkangiri area, in the west up to Bhaskar (Bhaskel River) in the Umerkote area and in the east up to chicacole Nagar. So the Silavamsis ruled in Nabaragnpur area for a century or so.\n\n==== The Suryavansa: (The solar dynasty) ====\nThe last king of the Silavansa of Nandapur was Pratap Ganga Raja, after his death, he was succeeded by one Vinayak Deo, who founded the solar dynasty.\n\nThe suryavansa ruled the dominion of Nandapur kingdom till the end of the British period. The Nandapur kingdom spread to a vast execute of area including the recent Nabarangpur region.\n\nThe family chronicles, various copper plate granted by earlier Rajas, references made by Ferista, the Mahamedan historian of the Kutabsati sultans of Golkonda, we know the genealogy of the suryavansi kings who ruled from 1443 AD to 1947 AD. The family chronicles give the following dates for the founded of the Suryavansa cine and his successor:-\n\nVinayak Deo -1443-76\n\nHis son Vinaya Chandra Deo -1476-1510\n\nHis son Bhairab Deo -1510-27\n\nHis son Viswanath Deo -1527-71\n\nHis son Balaram DEo -1571-97\n\nHis son Yasvanta Deo -1597-1637\n\nHis son Virvikram Deo -1637-69\n\nHis son Krisna Deo -1669-72\n\nHis son Biswambar Deo 1 -1672-76\n\nHis brother Mallikamardhan krisna rao -1676-81\n\nHis brother Hari Deo -1681-84\n\nHis brother Balaram Deo2 -1684-86\n\nHis adopted son Raghunath krisna Deo -1686-1708\n\nHis son Ramchandra Deo1 -1708-11\n\nHis Brother Balaram Deo3 -1711-13\n\nHis Brother Biswambar Deo2 -1713-52\n\nHis step Brother Lalakrisna Deo -1752-58\n\nHis brother Bikram Deo1 -1758-81\n\nHis son Ramchandra Deo2 -1781-1825 From the time of Ramachandra Deo2 there is contemporary historical record of the history of the Jeypore states the northern part of which is the recent Nabarangpur region. The kings of the Suryavansa ruled for nearly (1443 AD-1947 AD) 500years. By their rule Nabarangpur develop and nourished as a part of the kingdom.\n\n==== Muslim Occupation ====\nWhen the Nandapur kingdom was ruled by the suryavansi king Viswanath Deo by the end of his rule he saw Muslim invasion to his kingdom. He breathed his last in 1571 AD and his son Balaam Deo succeeded him but was defeated by Rullfat Khan, The lieutent of Ibrahim qutab shah the sultan, of Golconda and agreed to pay tributes to the sultan of goal ganda and his name entered into jamu Kashmir.with Balaram Deo the nandapur kingdom came under Muslim occupation. So the northern corners were completely under the sway of the quth saffis. The nandapur kingdom came under the fauzdar of chicacole .The suryavansi kings paid tribute to the sultan of goalconda an account of rs 24 thosands per annum. Ruled Jeypore estate till is the estate is taken over by the British government. Through the recent Nabarangpur was the part of the Jeypore estate. The region never encountered in to the direct onslaught of the Muslims, but ruled but the suryavansi king.\n\n==== Anglo-French Conflict ====\nAfter the death of Aurangajeb in 1707 AD the subedar of Deccan became independent. He appointed Anwaruddin as the fauzdar of chicacole. In the political turmoil difference declared Salabatjung, the third son of Asaf Jha as the nizam and obtained four northern areas under chicacola circle in 1753. But the discontented fauzadar of chicola JatarAli resisted the French occupation of chicole but was defeated by the franc. After the death of Vijayram Raja the Galati of Vijaynagaram, his son Ananda Raju a great enemy of the French revolution against the French supremacy and invited the English to help him. Lord Clive immediately sent. Forde by sea who regained Visakhapatnam and help Ananda Raja. After the Rajahmundry battle on the 9th dec 1757.salabati Jung the Nabab of Hyderabad deserted the French and the English restored that authority over the northern sir car.\n\nIn 1765 the Mughal Emperor of Delhi Saha alam granted the Northen circle to Robert Clive along into the Dewani of Bihar, Bengal and Orissa to the East India Company by a firmer. Through the northern circle came under the British Jeypore (EState revised out side the sphere of the British administration till 1865).Almost a century close before they directly administer the Jeypore estate. So Nabarangpur also as the part of the Jeypore state spread the British rule up to the said date.\n\n==== Brithish Occupation ====\nA conflict arose between the kings Vijayaram Raju, the king of Vijaynagaram successor and the king of Jeypore regarding the Jeypore territory in the year 1768 under an alleged patta granted in 1752 by Salabetijung, the subedar of Deccan. The patta recorded the grant of the villagers- kasipuram, nandapuram and Madgal by way of jagir to Raja Vijayaram Raju on an annual payment of Rs.24, 0000. The Jeypore Maharaja Vikram Deo refuted the claim of the Vijaya nagaram king and sends his agent Jagannath patra to Vizagpatanam to get support of the British authority. But the British supported the claim of the king of the Vijayanagaram, This action of the British made some disaffected clients and Zamindars to revolt against the Vijayanagaram king. In 1773 the Jeypore king Bikram Deo gathered a strong force and 2000 martha horses to fight against the vijayanagaram king at Rayagada Valley. Taking the advantages of this disturbance the British first asserted their authority over the hill tracks of Jeypore.\n\nCaptain Richard Mathews, the then commander of Northern circle was sent by the east India Company to march to hill country Jeypore with a company of Sibbandis of the Raja of Vijayanagaram. Caption Mathews took the possession the Rayagada on 15.01.1775. He possessed the past of Narayanpatna .Braving the shift resistance by the troops of the Jeypore king, captain Mathews reached Jeypore, the capital of the Suryavans kings with his army. He designed the Jeypore fort in the last week of February -1775 and defeated the Maratha troop of the Vikram Deo. The king Vikram Deo surrenders to captain Mathews. The fort was ruined by the British troop. As a result of this campaign, the Jeypore territory was completely occupied and subjugated by the British.\n\nThe Madras Government appointed a committee of the circle in 1776 to study the revenue system of the northern circle. When in the year 1784 the Madras government came to know the oppression of the Vijayanagaram dewan Sitaram Raju and malad instruction of the chief of the council of vizagpatam, the government condoned such act and separated the Jeypore Zamindar. Independent of Vijayanagaram seeing such action of the British the king of vijayanagarm rose against then and a pitched battle was fought at Padmanavam in which the king of vijayanagaram was defeated and killed by Lt.Col.Prendargast. At this juncture the king of Jeypore Ramachandra Deo2 kept himself aloof from this situation and did at support the king of Vijayanagaram. The British seeing the neutrality of the Jeypore king granted him a permanent sauanda for Jeypore for an annual tribute of Rs.25000/-. In 1802-03 permanent settlement was attached throughout the Vizagpatam district and Ramachandra Deo accepted the settlement and got his Peshkash reduced to Rs .16000/-.\n\nOn 10 July 1855, the Madras Govt. authorized the British agent to assume the control of both policy and revenue of the hill tracts of Jeypore estate. The old maharaja Vikram Deo died on 10 August 1860 and his son Ramachandra Deo from the, then three British agent proposed to located assistant agent together with all assistants superintendent of police at Jeypore, which was sanctioned by the govt.\n\nWith the assumption of the direct administration of the Jeypore estate, four sub-magistrate were placed at Jeypore, Nabarangpur (Nawarangpur), Mahadeoput and Aurade.\n\nIn this way, the recent Nabarangpur region came under the British rule and sub-magistrate looked after the police and revenue of this area since 1860 to onwards.\n\nBefore such arrangement (the Nabarangpur district of 1992), the Nabarangpur region was a thana under the Jeypore estate. In the year 1820, Raja Ramachandra Deo 2 (1781-1825) granted Nabarangpur Thana as a grant to his brother Jagannath Deo (second son of Vikram Deo) to look after the area. Jagannath Deos son Krishna Deo, succeed this father and ruled. This region from 1814 to 1843 krisna Doe, bring issueless, son of Narasingha Deo(3rd son of Vikram Deo1), Chaitanaya Deo managed Nabarangpur region as a ruler from 1843-1876 AD, a stint of 33years.He was a great ruler of Nabarangpur, a benevolent, peace loving king, who erected temples, and tanks and ponds and tapes in every villages. He was a man of culture and one of the best king of all the suryavansi kings. From 1876, Nabarangpur was ruled by the queen up to 1911.Then the Nabarangpur thauf merged in the jeypore estate according to the verdict of the Madras Government in the year 1912 AD\n\n(Source: The Vinsasatadir Nabarangpur,Gopabandhu Beosoyi-1914)\n\nEvolution of Modern Nabarangpur:\n\nIn the year due to constant demands and representation, the British govt. in England passed an act in the year 1935 to create a separate province of Odisha. In 1936 Odisha became a spate state. Nabarangpur was incorporated in New Koraput district as a sub-division. The state was constituted according to the Board my Commission Report of 1932 up to 1962, Nabarangpur was the largest sub- division of the Koraput district.\n\nOn 2 October 1992, on the auspicious day of Mahatma Gandhis birthday, the government of Odisha declared Nabarangpur as an independent district. it is carved out of the Koraput district.Sri.T.ramachandrudu IAS appointed as the first collector of the new district.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe entire text of this chapter is prepared basing or the secondary sources of books, periodicals and journals.

Freedom and social welfare have many instances, so the uprisings of the natives and nontribals as well against the British rule and the atrocities committed by the royal family and their followers bore a bright testimony and the Nabarangpur district is no exception to it.\n\nThe Nabarangpur district has experienced the uprisings of the tribals and non-tribals in the 4th decade of the 20th century .the struggles have many faceted dimensions .these struggles were basically economical struggles against the non-tribal money launderers, traders, amenders, administrators who tried to exploit the tribal way of life and people of the lower strata of the society. During this period 1940 to 1947AD, the natives of the Nabarangpur district joined the groups of led by Indian national congress taking up specific issues and struggles launched by Mahatma Gandhi and his followers.\n\nDuring the British rule, the policing and revenue acts of the madras government was strictly imposed upon the local people of the Nabarangpur district. There has been an increasing enhancement on tribal people hills and plains and oppressions of the tribal by the aliens. The aliens or non tribals like inamdars, mokkasadars, brukots, gountias naiks, chalans, gaudas, land lords, merchants.\n\nMoney lenders and the zamindars agent and government officials jeopardized the life style of the local natives of the Nabarangpur district, then the region is under the rule of the suryavansis of the Jeypore estate, so they rose against these systems who were exploiting the natives economic resources including their land, labor and forests.\n\nThe evil system of bethi goti, supply and gadam broke the backbones of the native peasents and people of this district. arson, loot, ropes were common agenda of the police people, the harsa treatment of the revenue official in exacting taxes of different nature.the atrocities committed by the village head men agent of the kings argumented the uprisings of the people of this district, under the agencies of the Indian national congress, the cried call of mahatma Gandhi for freedom movement. Created such an upheaval in this district that the rulers lost their sleeps.\n\nThe historical background of the freedom movement of this district its organization, development and the cherished goal to achieve the positive result is attributed to the great leaders of the Indian national congress of this district named Radha Krishna Biswasray, Sadasiva Tripathy,Laxmichandra Das, Radhamohan Sahu, Annaji Rao, Md. Baji, Ananda Behera, Rabisingh Majhi, Sanu Majhi and lots of others.\n\nThe Indian National congress became more active and aggressive to augment the spirit of freedom movement in this area .People of this district following the instruction of INC of the country and state, collected thousands of four anna congress members from this district. By the end of 1939 there were 26,900 four anna members, who were ready to fight none violently against the rulers internal administration.\n\nThe Indian national congress demanded the full independence of India in its lucknow convention on 01.04.1936 and took a unanimous decision not to support the imperial power in any means, the decision was meant for the British govt. When the 2nd world war began on 01.09.1939, Germany attacked Poland on 03.09.1939. England declared war against Germany being a part of the allied power. As India was the vassal state of England by that time the wartime Prime Minister of England Winston Churchill, ordered the viceroy of India to collect manpower from India to fight the war and collect war funds to meet the war expenditure from the Indian people. Mahatma Gandhi resented the proposal of the British govt. and the Indian National Congress passed a regulation on 10.10.1939 not to support the British in the war and decided to protest through personal Satyagraha. Gandhi appealed the congress people to court jail voluntarily declaring not to give man or money to the British govt. and support the war obeying Gandhis appeal congress leaders of hundreds of them courted jail, the Nabarangpur was no exception to it.\n\nFirst satyagraha of the Nabarangpur region:\n\nAs per the decision of the district congress committee, Koraput, 110 freedom fighter court jail declaring that, \u201cIt is a sin to help Radhakrishan Biswasray and Radhamohan Sahu.\n\nOn 14th July 1942, Quit India resolution was passed by the working committee of the Indian National congress. The call of Quit India and \u201cDo or Die\u201d by Mahatma Gandhi spread all over India like wild fire, Nabarangpur region also responded the call whole heartedly. Meeting was organizing in every nook and corner of Nabarangpur region. Thousand of pamphlets distributed all over the Nabarangpur region regarding congress movement and peoples participation in it.\n\nOn 11.08.1942 Sadasiva Tripathy was again arrested from Nabarangpur town for August movement of 1942 along with all the forat class congress leaders. Repression started by the govt. On 13.08.1942 the congress office of the Nabarangpur forcibly closed by police. Police confiscated all the belongs of the office congress office was sealed. On that day G Annaji Rao, the Nabarangpur congress committee president organized a great procession on the protestation of the government action, in the everything of 13.08.1642, G. Annaji Roa, Sadananda mohanty, Raghunath choudhury and Anauda Behera, the eminent congress leader were arrested.\n\nGouramaguda- the pioneer of the freedom movement:\n\nGummaguda a small village 9 k.ms of the sub-divisional headquarters Nabarangpur near Taragam organized a meeting for quit- India movement under the leadership of the congress leader Madhab Pradhani of the Baghsiuni village.. On 17.08.1942 another meeting was held on 19.08.1942 nearly 200 congress workers broke the wooden bridge of the Gauta River. Some to block the road of Nabarangpur \u2013Papadahandi cut hundreds of trees from the reserve forest.\n\nThe British Government with Men Power or Money.\n\nThe Sub-Divisional Congress Committee of Nabarangpur decided that SadasivaTripathy, the president of the same committee should be the first Satyagrahi to protest the Government to conscript the people forward and exact money to accumulate war fund. The prominent congress leader of the Nabarangpur Congress Committee wrote the incident in his personal diary, \u201cPersonal Satyagraha -1939 the world war began. There was a German in the Nabarangpur Church. He was arrested .A list of Satyagrahies was sent. At first the MLAs should do Satyagrah, so SadasivaBabu, Biswasroybabu and RadhamohanBabu joined the Satyagrah and were arrested .SadasivaBabu from his house started on foot to attend the meeting to be held in Dharmasala total (A mango grove named Dharamsala) .when he reached near the grocery shop of mine, he was offered a glass of molasses sarbat. He was garlanded by the congress members. SadasivaBabu declared in the meeting that it is a sin to help the War \u201cPolice arrested him than and there. By that time I told him,\u201d come with Swarja and he smiled a little( refer Biplab LaxmichandraDashbySubash Chandra Mishra PP.77\u201378)\n\nThen, the Congress members of different primary congress committees joined the Satyagrah and awarded 4 to 6 months of imprisonment by the then Deputy Magistrate Somnath Mishra. Among these Satyagrahies Laxmi Chandra Das Simanchal Behera, AurandaBehera, SonuMajhii, Md.Baji, Rabi SinghMajhi and others actively participated and the Nabarangpur created a history in this regard.\n\nQuit India Movement and the course of events in the Nabarangpur region.\n\nSadasivaTripathy was arrested and sent to Central Jail, Berhampur for Satyagrah and released in the month of June Day along with police was informed about the incident. 32 Congress workers were arrested as per case No.122/42 (SR Case No.49/42) with IPC Section 143,149 and 431.\n\nDtd.20.08.1943 under the leadership of SonuMajhi, the Congress leader of Kasabandha Village of Dabugam nearly 700 Congress workers broke the Sadaguda wooden bridge and blocked the road leading to Umerkote . SanuMajhi and others were arrested on the same day as per IPC U/s 147,426, and 427. Hundreds of the Freedom Fighter was beaten black and blue by the order of the Nabarangpur Sub Divisional Magistrate.\n\nThe entire regional congress leader was taken into police custody as a precautionary measure by the British Government. According to Quit India Movement Congress decided to Gherao all the thanas to protest the Government sarbritrary action. So it was decided to arrest Lakshmichandra Das, the flamboyant Congress leader of Nabarangpur as per case No 21/42 and 34/42 of Debug then a U/s 109, 147 and 431 of IPC, because his speech and work may create much disturbance. Then the SDO of Nabarangpur P.K.Tripathy ordered his arrest. On 20.08.1942, Lakshmichandra Das was arrested and was kept in a temporary Jail of Nabarangpur as an under trial prisoner from 20.08.1943 and 21.12.1942.\n\nThe Nabarangpur region, as a Sub-division of the Koraput district played a prominent role in the freedom struggle between 1939\u201342. When Mahatma Gandhi declared Quit India Movement and Do or Die Mantra in the Bombay Convention of the Indian National Congress on 8 August 1942, the call never be rated all over India. Number of freedom fighters were arrested or the 9th August 1942.\n\nAs per previous decision of the Koraput District Congress Committee.Mathili the Thana was generated of the 21st August 1942 (Friday) at 2.00PM under the leadership of LakshmanNayak of Tentuliguda village. There was great commotion on that day. Where the freedom fighters moved towards Mathili Thana.

Many more were wounded by lathi charge. LakshmanNayak was beaten till he fell flat unconscious on the ground by a rifle but and when he was senseless, the Police thinking him dead, throw him into a nearby stream covered with dense bamboo forest.\n\n( source -Saheed LakshmanNayak by Dasrathi Nanda 8th edition 1999)\n\nAfter three days of Mathili firing the same was repeated at papadahandi of Nabarangpur Sub Division.\n\nThe Turi River Massacre at papadahandi on 24.08.1942 needs a special mention for its great historical importance.\n\nOn 23-8-1943, at 5 PM, nearly 500 people of Congress followers gathered at Gurumaguda village under the leadership of MadhabPradhani. They decided to move to Dabugam to discuss the course of the Congress also with regard to Quit India Movement 24-8- 1942. On 24.08.1942 the Congress worker with the Congress flag on their heads chanting Ramadev started towards Papadahandi, 6&nbsp;km from Gummaguda.\n\nNear Gouti river of Chikilipadar another group of Freedom fighters of different villages jointed to the first batch of the congress worker. The crowd grew to thousands (as per Police record-2000 or more people) It was 2PM in the afternoon time when the crowd reached Papadahandi village.\n\nApprehending the attack of Papadahandi out Post by the Congress workers the ARP Force as well as the local Police of Papadahandi Out Post with the help of the Local anti-Congress people, got ready to face the crowd, but when they found that the crowd instead of attacking the outpost were marching towards Dabugoan; the Police to check the crowd and to dispense them posted themselves by the west end of the wooden bridge of the turi River at the 35 mile stone with weapons.

Ancient relics are found scaltered all around the hill fort and the revenue village Bhandariguda represents the ancient city of Puskari.\u201d (Source: Dynastic history of NalasC.B.Patel 1990 PP 159)\n\nThe Puskari metropolis (township) was located on the left bank of the periperial river let \u201cSingari\u201d which joins the river BhaskelatNandapura. It is clearly evident from the Owens and traces of the Podagada, in its heyday Puskari metropolis seemed to spread between the twin river valleys of Singari and Nangi. Nangiriver flows 6&nbsp;km to the north of Podaguda and joins the Bhaskel River near Dhodra village.\n\nBoth the riverlets Singari and Nangi are of pererial in nature have originated from thehilly and forest area of Podagadaplateau of 2000 feet height .thePodagada hill that contains the fort and the stone inscription of the Nala king Skandavarman rises to a height of 3043 feet.\u201dThe highest peak of the mountain is 19 degree 36 the range extends from 82 degree E to 82 degree16 N and 84 degree 14 inches (Source : Indian atlas Sheet No.63)\n\nThe Podagada hill fort (Pushkaridurga) with its stategie location resembles to a great extent to the yadava hill fort of Devagiri (now known as Daulatabad)\n\nThe antiquity of ancient Puskari (Podagada) is very remote. According to G. RamadasPusqari is identifical with the famous Puskartirth of Mahabharat (JBRSxxxx111-1-11 PP7-19)\n\nKrishnamachaflu, who visitiedPodagada tract and discovered the rock inscription in the month of March and April 1922, has described the vast archaeological evidence of Puskari. I Epigraphic India P.153)\n\nG.Ramdas, the archaeologist of Madras Presidency, who visited the Podagada area in the year 1943 remarked that, \u201c in almost all or the vicinity of every village in this progantha(Padagada area) are found the vesiges of ancient civilization that was rampant here in the obscure antiquity\n\nDescription of some of the monuments and relies of Podagada :-\n\nThe ruins of Podagada clearly indicates that there was a fort located in the hill but was devastated by te enemy by fire and sword, so the fort was called later on as Podagada (the burnt fort)\n\nThe fort was well planned .the entrance of the fort was from the southern side. A large number of brickbats, fragments of sculptured stones, burnt brickpillars, and doors lambs are seen. The brickmeasurd 8x4x2 and the door Jamb contain floral designs. There were a number of stops made of stones raising from the bottom of the entrance of the fort upwards to climbs the fort.\n\nThere was a stone inscription promulgated by the second son of BhavadettaVarman, the mighty SquandaVarman Maharaja, at a height of 40 feet from the ground level. Some brothers stone pillars lied on the steps to indicate that there was an arch representing and collaborate and massive gateway. There was a massive stone pillar standing near the entrance of the fort. This is called locally as \u201cthe Hatibndha Pakana (a stone pillar meant for laying the elephants). There was a second gateway to the fort proper.\n\nIt is evident that there was probably a temple ( as per the inscription). Another set of stare case is found that rose up to 20 feet to a flat surface. There were the evidences of pottery, brickbats, floors and tiles to indicate the existence of some residential complex.\n\nA light of step are seen to the east down to the valley \u201c To the west and the North side of the fort, there was an extensive that surface with ruins of, pottery, tile, rammed floor brick and ruble wall (Dynastic History of Naas by CB Patel-1990)\n\nThe fort was built over the flat rock surface of the hill, in the north and west the flat rock surface ends in precipitous tall.\n\nFrom the top of the hill one can see the surrounding area clearly for miles. The valley was plain and spreading miles together giving an impression of past war fields. A joint sign of dried moat encircling the hill fort is presently found, and the muat as being connected with the perennial water source of the Singaririvalet .there was a pond near the southern entrance of the fort.\n\nIn the north beyond the moat another mountain is there, which night have been used as the watch tower. To the east of Podagada hills the depression running straight lines clearly indicates the existence of the roads and streets. To the east of Podagada hill, between the moat and the Singari rivaled(the present village of Bhandariguda), the extensive ruins of a township is seen in the shape of terracedttasbashills, pottery, broken pieces of terracotta and wax boggles, beads of clay and semi precious stones.\n\nTo the west near the old fortification area, a broken brick, temple between two ancient tanks may be secure. According to Epigraphic Tudia-xx.IV.P.153, the temple right be representing to a Siva shrine. The temple is in uncomplete ruin .the study of the nearly sculptures and remnants confirms the existence of two chambered Siva Temple.\n\nAt present, the existed sanction of the temple we find a Barb image and a Lingam along with a brisabha. There are different icons are seen in front of the temple like Brisabha, Ganesh, worhipper couple memorial Sati Pillars. In one of the later pillars, a warrior riding the horse and piercing a slid animal in a long spear had been engraved.\n\n\u201cTo the north of this place at a distance of I am there are another group of memorial pillars. Apart from these antiquities, the old residential evidence are forced like tiles, pottering terracotta fingers etc. as a pure sign of the existence of a township .there are the signs of Vibars, agrahars, places in this locality.\n\nThe Podagada stone inscription of SkandaVarman throws a light on their period. The verses depicted in the inscription clearly envisages that the king SkandaVarman had resorted the city from his enemy repopulated the city once again, rebuilt the city with palatial buildings. Residential houses, fortified the place the as a religious King and a dewat Vishnav established the total points of Vishnu (Padamouja), that may be a Vishnu vihar, to which a satra was also attached.\n\nFrom the above archaeological evidences and epigraphic reference we can safely include that, Pdagada, the ancients seta of Nalas, the ancient Puskari was a bashing city of attendance and appolenceschichreprsentstheglocious rule of the Nala dynasty from 4th and 5th Century AD.\n\nThe Kesaribeda Township or the Kesalak Grama Apart from the capital city Pucker, the nails had established other town and village, among which Kesaribeda (recently the village baring the same name is situated 17&nbsp;km from Umerkote Tahasils of Nabarangpur District (JBPS,xxxIII -1II-PP.7\u201319)\n\nKeisalakagrama was donated by Maharaja Asthapati, the first son of Nala King Bhave data Varman, to durggirgga, Raviraryya and Ravidattaryya. The village can be identified with the present Kesharbeda village.\n\nKesaribeda village is located at a distance of 25&nbsp;km from to the north west of Puskari in Padagda near the source of river Tel.\n\nIn the year 19, the archaeologist, G.Ramdas visited to find the spot of Kesaribeda charge had Charter had visibly depicts in his report that there were 5 mounds existed of rubbles and pieces of bricks and a tank of 100 yards square (JBRSxxxIII-I-II0P 7-19)\n\nThe tank still exists in Kesaribeda village in its arabaic look. There is a village named Andhri, near Asthapeti, who devoted this village.\n\nA trial excavation was made of this Kesharibeda village by G. Ramdas and in one of the mounts he found a rectangular room of 8x4x and build of walls 2\u201d thick of bricks (18x8x1) .the extent of wall measured about 26\u201d floors of the room paved with bricks . A carved beautiful Vishnu image was also found from the structure.\n\nNear the tank there was another mound excavation of which yielded a room with 2 feet high wall. Another two tanks were also found drag with the sculptured image of Siva and Vishnu. The looks of the images give an impression of the Nula age and the images of Puskari. The ruin found in Kesaribeda village spreading over a big area with tank indicates that Kesaribeda was a small town having temples residential habitants.\n\nArt and Architecture: the Podagada School of art and architecture-\n\nThe splendid arts and architecture that flourished during the Nula rules, the signs of which are seen in the rains of Podagadadesrveds mention. Elaborate system of fortification, religious, edifices, monasko institutions, plastic arts, and sculptural art expressed in architecture as well as in cult icons are found in Podagada rains.\n\nThe tell fort of Podagada (4th/5th century AD), the terracotta arts, the panel of Siva Parvati, the Saiva and Vishnu shrine, the image of Bhairab, Ganesh, Brisav, the yakshya image, the satti pillars give us a clear picture of the art and architecture of Podagada of the Nabarangpur District, this old village.\n\nSo the Nabarangpur district is forwarded enough to have such archaeological evidence to show the glorious post of this district. So it is elect from the above analyses the Nalas ruled a vast stretches of Nabarangpur region for 200 years. The 4th and 5th of Koraput.1966: Govt. of Odisha)\n\nCoins: A hoard of coins was discovered from the different places of Bastar-Koraput region bearing the evidence of the Nala period. In the 4th and 5th century AD the Nalas established a strong kingdom, their capital being Puskari, the recent Padagada in the present Nabarangpur district. Their Kingdom was contiguous to estate of Bastar in MadhyaPradhesh Crow the Chhattisgarh state where 1939 is a hoard of 32 gold coins, belonging to king varahraj Sri Arthapati Raja and BhaladattaVarman was discovered.
