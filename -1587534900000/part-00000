It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and another wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows, and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls, and other rare birds. Ashy Dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and another wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows, and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls, and other rare birds. Ashy Dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen.

Before the [[World War I|First World War]], \"Near East\" was used in English to refer to the [[Balkans]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while \"Middle East\" referred to [[Iran]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Afghanistan]], Central Asia, and [[Turkestan]]. In contrast, \"Far East\" referred to the countries of [[East Asia]] (e.g. [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], etc.)\n\nWith the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, \"Near East\" largely fell out of common use in English, while \"Middle East\" came to be applied to the re-emerging countries of the [[Islamic world]]. However, the usage \"Near East\" was retained by a variety of academic disciplines, including [[archaeology]] and [[ancient history]], where it describes an area identical to the term ''Middle East'', which is not used by these disciplines (see [[Ancient Near East]]).\n\nThe first official use of the term \"Middle East\" by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] was in the 1957 [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], which pertained to the [[Suez Crisis]]. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] defined the Middle East as \"the area lying between and including [[Libya]] on the west and [[Pakistan]] on the east, [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] on the North and the Arabian peninsula to the south, plus the [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]].\"<ref name=\"davison\"/> In 1958, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] explained that the terms \"Near East\" and \"Middle East\" were interchangeable, and defined the region as including only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Near East' is Mideast, Washington Explains |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq='Near%20East'%20is%20Mideast,%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |newspaper= The New York Times |date= August 14, 1958 |accessdate= 2009-01-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044505/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq=%27Near%20East%27%20is%20Mideast%2C%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |archivedate= October 15, 2009 |df=  }}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Associated Press]] Stylebook says that Near East formerly referred to the farther west countries while Middle East referred to the eastern ones, but that now they are synonymous.

In [[German language|German]] the term ''[[:de:Naher Osten|Naher Osten]]'' (Near East) is still in common use (nowadays the term ''Mittlerer Osten'' is more and more common in press texts translated from English sources, albeit having a distinct meaning) and in [[Russian language|Russian]] [[:ru:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a]] or ''Blizhniy Vostok'', [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[:bg:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043a \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a]], [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[:pl:Bliski Wsch\u00f3d|Bliski Wsch\u00f3d]]'' or [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''[[:hr:Bliski istok|Bliski istok]]'' (meaning ''Near East'' in all the four Slavic languages) remains as the only appropriate term for the region. However, some languages do have \"Middle East\" equivalents, such as the [[French language|French]] [[:fr:Moyen-Orient|Moyen-Orient]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[:sv:Mellan\u00f6stern|Mellan\u00f6stern]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[:es:Oriente Medio|Oriente Medio or Medio Oriente]], and the [[Italian language|Italian]] [[:it:Medio Oriente|Medio Oriente]].<ref group=\"note\">In Italian, the expression \"Vicino Oriente\" (Near East) was also widely used to refer to Turkey, and ''Estremo Oriente'' (Far East or Extreme East) to refer to all of Asia east of Middle East</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of the influence of the Western press, the Arabic equivalent of ''Middle East'' (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637  ''ash-Sharq al-Awsa\u1e6d'') has become standard usage in the mainstream Arabic press, comprising the same meaning as the term \"Middle East\" in North American and Western European usage. The designation, ''[[Mashriq]]'', also from the Arabic root for ''East'', also denotes a variously defined region around the [[Levant]], the eastern part of the Arabic-speaking world (as opposed to the ''[[Maghreb]]'', the western part).<ref>{{cite book |author=Anderson, Ewan W., William Bayne Fisher |title=The Middle East: Geography and Geopolitics |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Even though the term originated in the West, apart from Arabic, other languages of countries of the Middle East also use a translation of it.

It is the birthplace and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] center of religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Yezidi]], [[Druze]], [[Yarsan]] and [[Mandeanism]], and in Iran, [[Mithraism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheanism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]. Throughout its history the Middle East has been a major center of world affairs; a strategically, economically, politically, culturally, and religiously sensitive area.\n\nThe world's earliest civilizations, Mesopotamia ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]) and [[ancient Egypt]], originated in the Fertile Crescent and [[Nile]] Valley regions of the ancient Near East. These were followed by the [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Urartian]] civilisations of [[Asia Minor]], [[Elam]] in pre-Iranian Persia, as well as the civilizations of the [[History of the Levant|Levant]] (such as [[Ebla]], [[Ugarit]], [[Canaan]], [[Aramea]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Israel]]), [[History of Iran|Persian]] and [[Medes|Median]] civilizations in Iran, [[North Africa]] ([[Carthage]]/Phoenicia) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] ([[Majan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Sheba]], [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]]). The Near East was first largely unified under the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], then the [[Achaemenid Empire]] followed later by the [[Macedonian Empire]] and after this to some degree by the [[History of Iran|Iranian empires]] (namely the [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire]]s), the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]. However, it would be the later [[Caliphate|Arab Caliphates]] of the [[Middle Ages]], or [[Islamic Golden Age]] which began with the Arab conquest of the region in the 7th century AD, that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Islamic]] [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that largely (but not exclusively) persists today. The [[Mongols]], the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]], the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire also dominated the region.\n\nThe modern Middle East began after [[World War I]], when the Ottoman Empire, which was allied with the [[Central Powers]], was defeated by the British Empire and their allies and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioned]] into a number of separate nations, initially under British and French Mandates. Other defining events in this transformation included the establishment of Israel in 1948 and the eventual departure of European powers, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] by the end of the 1960s. They were supplanted in some part by the rising influence of the United States from the 1970s onwards.\n\nIn the 20th century, the region's significant stocks of [[crude oil]] gave it new strategic and economic importance. Mass production of oil began around 1945, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] having large quantities of oil.<ref>Goldschmidt (1999), p. 8</ref> Estimated [[Oil reserves#Estimated reserves by country|oil reserves]], especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, are some of the highest in the world, and the international oil cartel [[OPEC]] is dominated by Middle Eastern countries.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Middle East was a theater of ideological struggle between the two superpowers and their allies: [[NATO]] and the United States on one side, and the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] on the other, as they competed to influence regional allies. Besides the political reasons there was also the \"ideological conflict\" between the two systems. Moreover, as [[Louise Fawcett]] argues, among many important areas of contention, or perhaps more accurately of anxiety, were, first, the desires of the superpowers to gain strategic advantage in the region, second, the fact that the region contained some two-thirds of the world's oil reserves in a context where oil was becoming increasingly vital to the economy of the Western world [...]<ref>Louise, Fawcett. ''International Relations of the Middle East''.

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the region has experienced both periods of relative peace and tolerance and periods of conflict particularly between [[Sunni]]s and [[Shiite]]s.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Middle East}}\n{{see also|Largest metropolitan areas of the Middle East}}\n[[File:Maunsell&#039;s map, Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of eastern Turkey in Asia, Syria and western Persia 01.jpg|thumb|Maunsell's map, a Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of the Middle East]]\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{main|Ethnic groups in the Middle East}}\n[[Arabs]] constitute the largest ethnic group in the Middle East, followed by various [[Iranian peoples]] and then by [[Turkic people|Turkic speaking groups]] ([[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Azeris]], and [[Iraqi Turkmen]]). Native ethnic groups of the region include, in addition to Arabs, [[Arameans in Syria|Arameans]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Baloch peoples|Baloch]], [[Berbers]], [[Copts]], [[Druze]], [[Greek Cypriots]], [[Jews]], [[Kurds]], [[Lurs]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Samaritans]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]], [[Tat people (Iran)|Tats]], and [[Zazas]]. European ethnic groups that form a diaspora in the region include [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Circassians]] (including [[Kabardians]]), [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Greeks]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Franco-Levantines]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)#Italian Levantines|Italo-Levantines]], and [[Iraqi Turkmens]].

For the period between the 1970s and 1990s, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in particular provided a rich source of employment for workers from Egypt, Yemen and the countries of the Levant, while Europe had attracted young workers from North African countries due both to proximity and the legacy of colonial ties between France and the majority of North African states.\"<ref name=\"Hassan and Dyer\">{{cite journal|last1=Hassan|first1=Islam|last2=Dyer|first2=Paul|title=The State of Middle Eastern Youth.|journal=The Muslim World|date=2017|volume=107|issue=1|pages=3\u201312|url=https://www.academia.edu/31029084|hdl=10822/1042998|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403002800/http://www.academia.edu/31029084/The_Muslim_World_CIRS_Special_Issue_The_State_of_Middle_Eastern_Youth|archivedate=2017-04-03|df=|doi=10.1111/muwo.12175}}</ref> According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation migrants from [[Arab nations]] in the world, of which 5.8 reside in other Arab countries. Expatriates from Arab countries contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009 Arab countries received a total of US$35.1&nbsp;billion in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |title=IOM Intra regional labour mobility in Arab region Facts and Figures (English) |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010601/http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20%28English%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}</ref> In [[Somalia]], the [[Somali Civil War]] has greatly increased the size of the [[Somali diaspora]], as many of the best educated Somalis left for Middle Eastern countries as well as [[Europe]] and [[North America]].\n\nNon-Arab Middle Eastern countries such as [[Turkey]], [[Israel]] and [[Iran]] are also subject to important migration dynamics.\n\nA fair proportion of those migrating from Arab nations are from ethnic and religious minorities facing racial and or religious persecution and are not necessarily ethnic Arabs, Iranians or Turks.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Large numbers of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Jewish people|Jews]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Greek people|Greeks]] and [[Armenian people|Armenians]] as well as many [[Mandean]]s have left nations such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey for these reasons during the last century. In Iran, many religious minorities such as [[Christians]], [[Baha'i]]s and [[Zoroastrians]] have left since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of 1979]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Religions===\n{{main|Religion in the Middle East}}\n[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|Islam is the largest religion in the Middle East. Here, Muslim men are [[prostration|prostrating]] during prayer in a mosque.]]\n\nThe Middle East is very diverse when it comes to [[Major religious groups|religions]], many of which originated there. [[Islam]] is the largest religion in the Middle East, but other faiths that originated there, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], are also well represented. Christians represent 40.5% of Lebanon, where the [[President of Lebanon|Lebanese president]], half of the cabinet, and half of the parliament follow one of the various Lebanese Christian rites. There are also important minority religions like the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Yarsanism]], [[Yazidis]]m, [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Druze]], and [[Shabak people#Religious beliefs|Shabakism]], and in ancient times the region was home to [[ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian religions]], [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite religions]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithraism]] and various [[monotheist]] [[gnostic]] sects.\n\n===Languages===\nThe five top languages, in terms of numbers of speakers, are [[Arabic dialects|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]]. Arabic and Hebrew represent the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]]. Persian and Kurdish belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. Turkish belongs to [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language family. About 20 minority languages are also spoken in the Middle East.\n\nArabic, with all its dialects, are the most widely spoken languages in the Middle East, with [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] being official in all North African and in most West Asian countries. Arabic dialects are also spoken in some adjacent areas in neighbouring Middle Eastern non-Arab countries. It is a member of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the Afro-Asiatic languages. Several [[Modern South Arabian languages]] such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]] and [[Soqotri language|Soqotri]] are also spoken Yemen and Oman. Another Semitic language such as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and its dialects are spoken mainly by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Mandaeans]]. There is also an [[Berber languages|Oasis Berber]]-speaking community in Egypt where the language is also known as [[Siwa language|Siwa]]. It is a non-Semitic Afro-Asiatic language.\n\n[[Persian language|Persian]] is the second most spoken language. While it is primarily spoken in [[Iran]] and some border areas in neighbouring countries, the country is one of the region's largest and most populous. It belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]] of the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. Other Western Iranic languages spoken in the region include [[Achomi language|Achomi]], [[Daylami language|Daylami]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] dialects, [[Semnani language|Semmani]], [[Luri language|Lurish]], amongst many others.\n\nThe third-most widely spoken language, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is largely confined to Turkey, which is also one of the region's largest and most populous countries, but it is present in areas in neighboring countries. It is a member of the [[Turkic languages]], which have their origins in Central Asia. Another Turkic language, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], is spoken by Azerbaijanis in Iran.\n\n[[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]] is one of the two official languages of [[Israel]], the other being Arabic. Hebrew is spoken and used by over 80% of Israel's population, the other 20% using Arabic.\n\n[[English language|English]] is commonly taught and used as a second language, especially among the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]]es, in countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |title= World Factbook \u2013 Jordan |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165359/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |archivedate= 2011-06-29 |df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |title= World Factbook \u2013 Kuwait |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140702040108/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |archivedate= 2014-07-02 |df=  }}</ref> It is also a main language in some Emirates of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n[[French language|French]] is taught and used in many government facilities and media in [[Lebanon]], and is taught in some primary and secondary schools of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].

[[Georgian language|Georgian]] is spoken by the Georgian diaspora. [[Russian language|Russian]] is spoken by a large portion of the Israeli population, because of [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|emigration in the late 1990s]]. Russian today is a popular unofficial language in use in [[Israel]]; news, radio and sign boards can be found in Russian around the country after Hebrew and Arabic. [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Circassian]] is also spoken by the diaspora in the region and by almost all Circassians in Israel who speak Hebrew and English as well.

The lowest-ranking country in the Middle East, in terms of per capita income (PPP), is the autonomous Palestinian Authority of Gaza and the West Bank ($1,100).\n\nThe economic structure of Middle Eastern nations are different in the sense that while some nations are heavily dependent on export of only oil and oil-related products (such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait), others have a highly diverse economic base (such as Cyprus, Israel, Turkey and Egypt). Industries of the Middle Eastern region include oil and oil-related products, agriculture, cotton, cattle, dairy, textiles, leather products, surgical instruments, defence equipment (guns, ammunition, tanks, submarines, fighter jets, UAVs, and missiles). Banking is also an important sector of the economies, especially in the case of UAE and Bahrain.\n\nWith the exception of Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon and Israel, tourism has been a relatively undeveloped area of the economy, in part because of the socially conservative nature of the region as well as political turmoil in certain regions of the Middle East. In recent years, however, countries such as the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan have begun attracting greater number of tourists because of improving tourist facilities and the relaxing of tourism-related restrictive policies.\n\nUnemployment is notably high in the Middle East and North Africa region, particularly among young people aged 15\u201329, a demographic representing 30% of the region's total population.

(which is mostly in [[North Africa]]). The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term [[Near East]] (as opposed to the [[Far East]]) beginning in the early 20th century. The broader concept of the \"[[Greater Middle East]]\" (or [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]]) also adds the [[Maghreb]], [[Sudan]], [[Djibouti]], [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and sometimes even [[Central Asia]] and [[Transcaucasia]] into the region. The term \"Middle East\" has led to some confusion over its changing definitions.\n\nMost Middle Eastern countries (13 out of 18) are part of the [[Arab world]].

Before the [[World War I|First World War]], \"Near East\" was used in English to refer to the [[Balkans]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while \"Middle East\" referred to [[Iran]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Afghanistan]], Central Asia, and [[Turkestan]]. In contrast, \"Far East\" referred to the countries of [[East Asia]] (e.g. [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], etc.)\n\nWith the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, \"Near East\" largely fell out of common use in English, while \"Middle East\" came to be applied to the re-emerging countries of the [[Islamic world]]. However, the usage \"Near East\" was retained by a variety of academic disciplines, including [[archaeology]] and [[ancient history]], where it describes an area identical to the term ''Middle East'', which is not used by these disciplines (see [[Ancient Near East]]).\n\nThe first official use of the term \"Middle East\" by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] was in the 1957 [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], which pertained to the [[Suez Crisis]]. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] defined the Middle East as \"the area lying between and including [[Libya]] on the west and [[Pakistan]] on the east, [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] on the North and the Arabian peninsula to the south, plus the [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]].\"<ref name=\"davison\"/> In 1958, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] explained that the terms \"Near East\" and \"Middle East\" were interchangeable, and defined the region as including only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Near East' is Mideast, Washington Explains |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq='Near%20East'%20is%20Mideast,%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |newspaper= The New York Times |date= August 14, 1958 |accessdate= 2009-01-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044505/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq=%27Near%20East%27%20is%20Mideast%2C%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |archivedate= October 15, 2009 |df=  }}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Associated Press]] Stylebook says that Near East formerly referred to the farther west countries while Middle East referred to the eastern ones, but that now they are synonymous.

In [[German language|German]] the term ''[[:de:Naher Osten|Naher Osten]]'' (Near East) is still in common use (nowadays the term ''Mittlerer Osten'' is more and more common in press texts translated from English sources, albeit having a distinct meaning) and in [[Russian language|Russian]] [[:ru:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a]] or ''Blizhniy Vostok'', [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[:bg:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043a \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a]], [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[:pl:Bliski Wsch\u00f3d|Bliski Wsch\u00f3d]]'' or [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''[[:hr:Bliski istok|Bliski istok]]'' (meaning ''Near East'' in all the four Slavic languages) remains as the only appropriate term for the region.

The designation, ''[[Mashriq]]'', also from the Arabic root for ''East'', also denotes a variously defined region around the [[Levant]], the eastern part of the Arabic-speaking world (as opposed to the ''[[Maghreb]]'', the western part).<ref>{{cite book |author=Anderson, Ewan W., William Bayne Fisher |title=The Middle East: Geography and Geopolitics |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Even though the term originated in the West, apart from Arabic, other languages of countries of the Middle East also use a translation of it.

It is the birthplace and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] center of religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Yezidi]], [[Druze]], [[Yarsan]] and [[Mandeanism]], and in Iran, [[Mithraism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheanism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]. Throughout its history the Middle East has been a major center of world affairs; a strategically, economically, politically, culturally, and religiously sensitive area.\n\nThe world's earliest civilizations, Mesopotamia ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]) and [[ancient Egypt]], originated in the Fertile Crescent and [[Nile]] Valley regions of the ancient Near East. These were followed by the [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Urartian]] civilisations of [[Asia Minor]], [[Elam]] in pre-Iranian Persia, as well as the civilizations of the [[History of the Levant|Levant]] (such as [[Ebla]], [[Ugarit]], [[Canaan]], [[Aramea]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Israel]]), [[History of Iran|Persian]] and [[Medes|Median]] civilizations in Iran, [[North Africa]] ([[Carthage]]/Phoenicia) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] ([[Majan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Sheba]], [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]]). The Near East was first largely unified under the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], then the [[Achaemenid Empire]] followed later by the [[Macedonian Empire]] and after this to some degree by the [[History of Iran|Iranian empires]] (namely the [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire]]s), the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]. However, it would be the later [[Caliphate|Arab Caliphates]] of the [[Middle Ages]], or [[Islamic Golden Age]] which began with the Arab conquest of the region in the 7th century AD, that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Islamic]] [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that largely (but not exclusively) persists today. The [[Mongols]], the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]], the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire also dominated the region.\n\nThe modern Middle East began after [[World War I]], when the Ottoman Empire, which was allied with the [[Central Powers]], was defeated by the British Empire and their allies and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioned]] into a number of separate nations, initially under British and French Mandates. Other defining events in this transformation included the establishment of Israel in 1948 and the eventual departure of European powers, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] by the end of the 1960s. They were supplanted in some part by the rising influence of the United States from the 1970s onwards.\n\nIn the 20th century, the region's significant stocks of [[crude oil]] gave it new strategic and economic importance. Mass production of oil began around 1945, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] having large quantities of oil.<ref>Goldschmidt (1999), p. 8</ref> Estimated [[Oil reserves#Estimated reserves by country|oil reserves]], especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, are some of the highest in the world, and the international oil cartel [[OPEC]] is dominated by Middle Eastern countries.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Middle East was a theater of ideological struggle between the two superpowers and their allies: [[NATO]] and the United States on one side, and the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] on the other, as they competed to influence regional allies. Besides the political reasons there was also the \"ideological conflict\" between the two systems. Moreover, as [[Louise Fawcett]] argues, among many important areas of contention, or perhaps more accurately of anxiety, were, first, the desires of the superpowers to gain strategic advantage in the region, second, the fact that the region contained some two-thirds of the world's oil reserves in a context where oil was becoming increasingly vital to the economy of the Western world [...]<ref>Louise, Fawcett. ''International Relations of the Middle East''. (Oxford University Press, New York, 2005)</ref> Within this contextual framework, the United States sought to divert the Arab world from Soviet influence. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the region has experienced both periods of relative peace and tolerance and periods of conflict particularly between [[Sunni]]s and [[Shiite]]s.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Middle East}}\n{{see also|Largest metropolitan areas of the Middle East}}\n[[File:Maunsell&#039;s map, Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of eastern Turkey in Asia, Syria and western Persia 01.jpg|thumb|Maunsell's map, a Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of the Middle East]]\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{main|Ethnic groups in the Middle East}}\n[[Arabs]] constitute the largest ethnic group in the Middle East, followed by various [[Iranian peoples]] and then by [[Turkic people|Turkic speaking groups]] ([[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Azeris]], and [[Iraqi Turkmen]]). Native ethnic groups of the region include, in addition to Arabs, [[Arameans in Syria|Arameans]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Baloch peoples|Baloch]], [[Berbers]], [[Copts]], [[Druze]], [[Greek Cypriots]], [[Jews]], [[Kurds]], [[Lurs]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Samaritans]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]], [[Tat people (Iran)|Tats]], and [[Zazas]]. European ethnic groups that form a diaspora in the region include [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Circassians]] (including [[Kabardians]]), [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Greeks]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Franco-Levantines]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)#Italian Levantines|Italo-Levantines]], and [[Iraqi Turkmens]]. Among other migrant populations are [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Filipinos in Saudi Arabia|Filipinos]], [[Indians in Saudi Arabia|Indians]], [[Indonesians in Saudi Arabia|Indonesians]], [[Pakistanis]], [[Pashtuns]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and [[Afro-Arab]]s.\n\n\n===Migration===\n\"Migration has always provided an important vent for labor market pressures in the Middle East. For the period between the 1970s and 1990s, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in particular provided a rich source of employment for workers from Egypt, Yemen and the countries of the Levant, while Europe had attracted young workers from North African countries due both to proximity and the legacy of colonial ties between France and the majority of North African states.\"<ref name=\"Hassan and Dyer\">{{cite journal|last1=Hassan|first1=Islam|last2=Dyer|first2=Paul|title=The State of Middle Eastern Youth.|journal=The Muslim World|date=2017|volume=107|issue=1|pages=3\u201312|url=https://www.academia.edu/31029084|hdl=10822/1042998|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403002800/http://www.academia.edu/31029084/The_Muslim_World_CIRS_Special_Issue_The_State_of_Middle_Eastern_Youth|archivedate=2017-04-03|df=|doi=10.1111/muwo.12175}}</ref> According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation migrants from [[Arab nations]] in the world, of which 5.8 reside in other Arab countries. Expatriates from Arab countries contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009 Arab countries received a total of US$35.1&nbsp;billion in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |title=IOM Intra regional labour mobility in Arab region Facts and Figures (English) |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010601/http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20%28English%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}</ref> In [[Somalia]], the [[Somali Civil War]] has greatly increased the size of the [[Somali diaspora]], as many of the best educated Somalis left for Middle Eastern countries as well as [[Europe]] and [[North America]].\n\nNon-Arab Middle Eastern countries such as [[Turkey]], [[Israel]] and [[Iran]] are also subject to important migration dynamics.\n\nA fair proportion of those migrating from Arab nations are from ethnic and religious minorities facing racial and or religious persecution and are not necessarily ethnic Arabs, Iranians or Turks.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Large numbers of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Jewish people|Jews]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Greek people|Greeks]] and [[Armenian people|Armenians]] as well as many [[Mandean]]s have left nations such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey for these reasons during the last century. In Iran, many religious minorities such as [[Christians]], [[Baha'i]]s and [[Zoroastrians]] have left since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of 1979]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Religions===\n{{main|Religion in the Middle East}}\n[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|Islam is the largest religion in the Middle East. Here, Muslim men are [[prostration|prostrating]] during prayer in a mosque.]]\n\nThe Middle East is very diverse when it comes to [[Major religious groups|religions]], many of which originated there. [[Islam]] is the largest religion in the Middle East, but other faiths that originated there, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], are also well represented. Christians represent 40.5% of Lebanon, where the [[President of Lebanon|Lebanese president]], half of the cabinet, and half of the parliament follow one of the various Lebanese Christian rites. There are also important minority religions like the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Yarsanism]], [[Yazidis]]m, [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Druze]], and [[Shabak people#Religious beliefs|Shabakism]], and in ancient times the region was home to [[ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian religions]], [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite religions]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithraism]] and various [[monotheist]] [[gnostic]] sects.\n\n===Languages===\nThe five top languages, in terms of numbers of speakers, are [[Arabic dialects|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]]. Arabic and Hebrew represent the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]]. Persian and Kurdish belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. Turkish belongs to [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language family. About 20 minority languages are also spoken in the Middle East.\n\nArabic, with all its dialects, are the most widely spoken languages in the Middle East, with [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] being official in all North African and in most West Asian countries. Arabic dialects are also spoken in some adjacent areas in neighbouring Middle Eastern non-Arab countries. It is a member of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the Afro-Asiatic languages. Several [[Modern South Arabian languages]] such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]] and [[Soqotri language|Soqotri]] are also spoken Yemen and Oman. Another Semitic language such as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and its dialects are spoken mainly by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Mandaeans]]. There is also an [[Berber languages|Oasis Berber]]-speaking community in Egypt where the language is also known as [[Siwa language|Siwa]]. It is a non-Semitic Afro-Asiatic language.\n\n[[Persian language|Persian]] is the second most spoken language. While it is primarily spoken in [[Iran]] and some border areas in neighbouring countries, the country is one of the region's largest and most populous. It belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]] of the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. Other Western Iranic languages spoken in the region include [[Achomi language|Achomi]], [[Daylami language|Daylami]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] dialects, [[Semnani language|Semmani]], [[Luri language|Lurish]], amongst many others.\n\nThe third-most widely spoken language, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is largely confined to Turkey, which is also one of the region's largest and most populous countries, but it is present in areas in neighboring countries. It is a member of the [[Turkic languages]], which have their origins in Central Asia. Another Turkic language, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], is spoken by Azerbaijanis in Iran.\n\n[[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]] is one of the two official languages of [[Israel]], the other being Arabic. Hebrew is spoken and used by over 80% of Israel's population, the other 20% using Arabic.\n\n[[English language|English]] is commonly taught and used as a second language, especially among the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]]es, in countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |title= World Factbook \u2013 Jordan |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165359/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |archivedate= 2011-06-29 |df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |title= World Factbook \u2013 Kuwait |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140702040108/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |archivedate= 2014-07-02 |df=  }}</ref> It is also a main language in some Emirates of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n[[French language|French]] is taught and used in many government facilities and media in [[Lebanon]], and is taught in some primary and secondary schools of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].

[[Georgian language|Georgian]] is spoken by the Georgian diaspora. [[Russian language|Russian]] is spoken by a large portion of the Israeli population, because of [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|emigration in the late 1990s]]. Russian today is a popular unofficial language in use in [[Israel]]; news, radio and sign boards can be found in Russian around the country after Hebrew and Arabic. [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Circassian]] is also spoken by the diaspora in the region and by almost all Circassians in Israel who speak Hebrew and English as well.

The lowest-ranking country in the Middle East, in terms of per capita income (PPP), is the autonomous Palestinian Authority of Gaza and the West Bank ($1,100).\n\nThe economic structure of Middle Eastern nations are different in the sense that while some nations are heavily dependent on export of only oil and oil-related products (such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait), others have a highly diverse economic base (such as Cyprus, Israel, Turkey and Egypt). Industries of the Middle Eastern region include oil and oil-related products, agriculture, cotton, cattle, dairy, textiles, leather products, surgical instruments, defence equipment (guns, ammunition, tanks, submarines, fighter jets, UAVs, and missiles). Banking is also an important sector of the economies, especially in the case of UAE and Bahrain.\n\nWith the exception of Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon and Israel, tourism has been a relatively undeveloped area of the economy, in part because of the socially conservative nature of the region as well as political turmoil in certain regions of the Middle East.

Territorial boundaries were somewhat ambiguous. After the Mexican Republic formally ceded the region to the United States in 1848, this temporary wartime/military government persisted until September 9, 1850.\n\nEarlier in the year 1850, a bid for New Mexico statehood was underway under a proposed state constitution prohibiting [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The request was approved at the same time that the [[Utah Territory]] was created to the north. The proposed state boundaries were to extend as far east as the 100th meridian West and as far north as the [[Arkansas River]], thus encompassing the present-day [[Texas Panhandle|Texas]] and [[Oklahoma Panhandle|Oklahoma]] panhandles and parts of present-day [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], and [[Arizona]], as well as most of present-day [[New Mexico]]. Texas raised great opposition to this plan, as it claimed much of the same territory, although it did not control these lands. In addition, slaveholders worried about not being able to expand slavery to the west of their current slave states.\n\n==Compromise of 1850 and disputes over slavery==\n[[File:New Mexico Territory, 1852.png|thumb|left|New Mexico Territory, 1852]]\n[[File:Gadsden Purchase Cities ZP.svg|thumb|left|The Gadsden Purchase, 1853]]\n[[File:Wpdms arizona territory 1860 idx.png|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Wpdms arizona new mexico territories 1863 idx.png|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Wpdms new mexico territory 1866.png|thumb|left]]\n\nThe [[Compromise of 1850]] put an end to the push for immediate New Mexico statehood. Approved by the [[United States Congress]] in September 1850, the legislation provided for the establishment of New Mexico Territory and [[Utah Territory]]. It also firmly established the disputed western boundary of [[Texas]].\n\nThe status of [[slavery]] during the territorial period provoked considerable debate. The granting of statehood was up to a Congress sharply divided on the slavery issue. Some (including [[Stephen A. Douglas]]) maintained that the territory could not restrict slavery, as under the earlier [[Missouri Compromise]], while others (including [[Abraham Lincoln]]) insisted that older Mexican Republic legal traditions of the territory, which abolished black, but not [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]], slavery in 1834, took precedence and should be continued. Regardless of its official status, slavery was rare in [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] New Mexico. Black slaves never numbered more than about a dozen.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/new-mexico-territory-slave-code-1859-1867 New Mexico Territory Slave Code (1859\u20131867) | The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs one of the final attempts at compromise to avoid the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], in December 1860, a U.S. House of Representatives committee proposed to admit New Mexico as a slave state immediately. Although the measure was approved by the committee on December 29, 1860, Southern representatives did not take up this offer, as many of them had already left Congress due to imminent declarations of secession by their states.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Impending Crisis|author=David M.

As in New Mexico, slavery was already extremely limited, due to earlier Mexican traditions, laws, and patterns of settlement. The northwestern corner of New Mexico Territory was included in Arizona Territory until it was added to the southernmost part of the newly admitted [[Nevada|State of Nevada]] in 1864. Eventually, Arizona Territory was organized as the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]].\n\n==Territorial evolution==\nThe Purchase treaty defines the new border as \"up the middle of that river (the [[Rio Grande]]) to the point where the parallel of 31\u00b0 47' north latitude crosses the same {{Coord|31|47|0|N|106|31|41.5|W}}; thence due west one hundred miles; thence south to the parallel of 31\u00b0 20' north latitude; thence along the said parallel of 31\u00b0 20' to the [[111th meridian west|111th meridian of longitude west]] of Greenwich {{Coord|31|20|N|111|0|W}}; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado River twenty English miles below the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers; thence up the middle of the said river Colorado until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico.\" The new border included a few miles of the [[Colorado River]] at the western end; the remaining land portion consisted of line segments between points, including {{Coord|32.49399|N|114.813043|W}} at the Colorado River, west of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]] at {{Coord|31.33214|N|111.07423|W}}, near AZ-NM-Mexico tripoint at {{Coord|31.332099|N|109.05047|W}}, the eastern corners of NM southern bootheel ([[Hidalgo County, New Mexico|Hidalgo County]]) at {{Coord|31.78378|N|108.20854|W}}, and the west bank of [[Rio Grande]] at {{Coord|31.78377|N|106.52864|W}}.\n\nThe boundaries of the New Mexico Territory at the time of establishment (September 9, 1850) contained most of the present-day [[State of New Mexico]], more than half of the present-day [[State of Arizona]], and portions of the present-day states of [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]]. Although this area was smaller than what had been included in the failed statehood proposal of early 1850, the boundary disputes with [[Texas]] had been dispelled by the [[Compromise of 1850]].\n\nThe [[Gadsden Purchase]] was acquired by the United States from [[Mexico]] in 1853/1854 (known as the \"Venta de La Mesilla\" or the \"Sale of La Mesilla\"), arranged by the then-American ambassador to Mexico, [[James Gadsden]]. This added today's southern strip of [[Arizona]] and a smaller area in today's southwestern [[New Mexico]] to the New Mexico Territory, bringing its land area to the maximum size achieved in its history as an organized territory. The land of {{convert|29640|sqmi}} provided a more easily constructed route for a future southern [[transcontinental railroad]] line (second of the routes) for the future [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], constructed later in 1881/1883.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/dwe/87721.htm |title=Department of State \u2013 Gadsden Purchase |accessdate=2008-04-04 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Colorado Territory]] was established by the \"[[Colorado Organic Act]]\" on February 28, 1861, with the same boundaries that would ultimately constitute the [[State of Colorado]]. This Act removed the Colorado lands from the New Mexico Territory.\n\nThe creation of the Union [[Arizona Territory]] (two years after the ill-fated [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Arizona Territory]]) by the \"[[Arizona Organic Act]]\" on February 24, 1863, removed all the land west of the [[109th meridian west|109th meridian]] from the New Mexico Territory, i.e. the entire present-day [[State of Arizona]] plus the land that would become the southern part of the [[State of Nevada]] in 1864.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/03/10/90518536.pdf New York Times \u2013 The New Territory of Arizona]</ref> This Act left the New Mexico Territory with boundaries identical to the eventual [[State of New Mexico]] for a half-century until admitted to the Union in 1912 as the 47th state (followed just under six weeks later by the [[Arizona Territory]]/[[State of Arizona]], which became the 48th state, finally filling out the coast-to-coast continental expanse of the United States).\n\n==American Civil War==\n{{main|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\nAs the route to [[California]], New Mexico Territory was disputed territory during the [[American Civil War]]. Settlers in the southern part of the Territory willingly joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in 1861 as the newly organized [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Territory of Arizona]], with a representative delegate to the [[Confederate Congress]] in the capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. This territory consisted of the southern half of the earlier Federal New Mexico Territory of 1851 and was in contrast to the later Federal [[Arizona Territory]] established by the [[United States|Union]] in 1863, which was the western half split off from the original U.S. New Mexico Territory.

Territorial boundaries were somewhat ambiguous. After the Mexican Republic formally ceded the region to the United States in 1848, this temporary wartime/military government persisted until September 9, 1850.\n\nEarlier in the year 1850, a bid for New Mexico statehood was underway under a proposed state constitution prohibiting [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The request was approved at the same time that the [[Utah Territory]] was created to the north. The proposed state boundaries were to extend as far east as the 100th meridian West and as far north as the [[Arkansas River]], thus encompassing the present-day [[Texas Panhandle|Texas]] and [[Oklahoma Panhandle|Oklahoma]] panhandles and parts of present-day [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], and [[Arizona]], as well as most of present-day [[New Mexico]]. Texas raised great opposition to this plan, as it claimed much of the same territory, although it did not control these lands. In addition, slaveholders worried about not being able to expand slavery to the west of their current slave states.\n\n==Compromise of 1850 and disputes over slavery==\n[[File:New Mexico Territory, 1852.png|thumb|left|New Mexico Territory, 1852]]\n[[File:Gadsden Purchase Cities ZP.svg|thumb|left|The Gadsden Purchase, 1853]]\n[[File:Wpdms arizona territory 1860 idx.png|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Wpdms arizona new mexico territories 1863 idx.png|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Wpdms new mexico territory 1866.png|thumb|left]]\n\nThe [[Compromise of 1850]] put an end to the push for immediate New Mexico statehood. Approved by the [[United States Congress]] in September 1850, the legislation provided for the establishment of New Mexico Territory and [[Utah Territory]]. It also firmly established the disputed western boundary of [[Texas]].\n\nThe status of [[slavery]] during the territorial period provoked considerable debate. The granting of statehood was up to a Congress sharply divided on the slavery issue. Some (including [[Stephen A. Douglas]]) maintained that the territory could not restrict slavery, as under the earlier [[Missouri Compromise]], while others (including [[Abraham Lincoln]]) insisted that older Mexican Republic legal traditions of the territory, which abolished black, but not [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]], slavery in 1834, took precedence and should be continued. Regardless of its official status, slavery was rare in [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] New Mexico. Black slaves never numbered more than about a dozen.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/new-mexico-territory-slave-code-1859-1867 New Mexico Territory Slave Code (1859\u20131867) | The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs one of the final attempts at compromise to avoid the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], in December 1860, a U.S. House of Representatives committee proposed to admit New Mexico as a slave state immediately. Although the measure was approved by the committee on December 29, 1860, Southern representatives did not take up this offer, as many of them had already left Congress due to imminent declarations of secession by their states.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Impending Crisis|author=David M.

As in New Mexico, slavery was already extremely limited, due to earlier Mexican traditions, laws, and patterns of settlement. The northwestern corner of New Mexico Territory was included in Arizona Territory until it was added to the southernmost part of the newly admitted [[Nevada|State of Nevada]] in 1864. Eventually, Arizona Territory was organized as the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]].\n\n==Territorial evolution==\nThe Purchase treaty defines the new border as \"up the middle of that river (the [[Rio Grande]]) to the point where the parallel of 31\u00b0 47' north latitude crosses the same {{Coord|31|47|0|N|106|31|41.5|W}}; thence due west one hundred miles; thence south to the parallel of 31\u00b0 20' north latitude; thence along the said parallel of 31\u00b0 20' to the [[111th meridian west|111th meridian of longitude west]] of Greenwich {{Coord|31|20|N|111|0|W}}; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado River twenty English miles below the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers; thence up the middle of the said river Colorado until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico.\" The new border included a few miles of the [[Colorado River]] at the western end; the remaining land portion consisted of line segments between points, including {{Coord|32.49399|N|114.813043|W}} at the Colorado River, west of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]] at {{Coord|31.33214|N|111.07423|W}}, near AZ-NM-Mexico tripoint at {{Coord|31.332099|N|109.05047|W}}, the eastern corners of NM southern bootheel ([[Hidalgo County, New Mexico|Hidalgo County]]) at {{Coord|31.78378|N|108.20854|W}}, and the west bank of [[Rio Grande]] at {{Coord|31.78377|N|106.52864|W}}.\n\nThe boundaries of the New Mexico Territory at the time of establishment (September 9, 1850) contained most of the present-day [[State of New Mexico]], more than half of the present-day [[State of Arizona]], and portions of the present-day states of [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]]. Although this area was smaller than what had been included in the failed statehood proposal of early 1850, the boundary disputes with [[Texas]] had been dispelled by the [[Compromise of 1850]].\n\nThe [[Gadsden Purchase]] was acquired by the United States from [[Mexico]] in 1853/1854 (known as the \"Venta de La Mesilla\" or the \"Sale of La Mesilla\"), arranged by the then-American ambassador to Mexico, [[James Gadsden]]. This added today's southern strip of [[Arizona]] and a smaller area in today's southwestern [[New Mexico]] to the New Mexico Territory, bringing its land area to the maximum size achieved in its history as an organized territory. The land of {{convert|29640|sqmi}} provided a more easily constructed route for a future southern [[transcontinental railroad]] line (second of the routes) for the future [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], constructed later in 1881/1883.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/dwe/87721.htm |title=Department of State \u2013 Gadsden Purchase |accessdate=2008-04-04 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Colorado Territory]] was established by the \"[[Colorado Organic Act]]\" on February 28, 1861, with the same boundaries that would ultimately constitute the [[State of Colorado]]. This Act removed the Colorado lands from the New Mexico Territory.\n\nThe creation of the Union [[Arizona Territory]] (two years after the ill-fated [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Arizona Territory]]) by the \"[[Arizona Organic Act]]\" on February 24, 1863, removed all the land west of the [[109th meridian west|109th meridian]] from the New Mexico Territory, i.e. the entire present-day [[State of Arizona]] plus the land that would become the southern part of the [[State of Nevada]] in 1864.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/03/10/90518536.pdf New York Times \u2013 The New Territory of Arizona]</ref> This Act left the New Mexico Territory with boundaries identical to the eventual [[State of New Mexico]] for a half-century until admitted to the Union in 1912 as the 47th state (followed just under six weeks later by the [[Arizona Territory]]/[[State of Arizona]], which became the 48th state, finally filling out the coast-to-coast continental expanse of the United States).\n\n==American Civil War==\n{{main|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\nAs the route to [[California]], New Mexico Territory was disputed territory during the [[American Civil War]]. Settlers in the southern part of the Territory willingly joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in 1861 as the newly organized [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Territory of Arizona]], with a representative delegate to the [[Confederate Congress]] in the capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. This territory consisted of the southern half of the earlier Federal New Mexico Territory of 1851 and was in contrast to the later Federal [[Arizona Territory]] established by the [[United States|Union]] in 1863, which was the western half split off from the original U.S. New Mexico Territory.
