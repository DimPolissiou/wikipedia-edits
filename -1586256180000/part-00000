All of these derivatives are likely to share some of their psychoactive effects with PCP itself, although a range of potencies and varying mixtures of anesthetic, dissociative, and stimulant effects are known, depending on the particular drug and its substituents. In some countries such as the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, all of these compounds would be considered controlled substance analogs of PCP under the [[Federal Analog Act]] and are hence illegal drugs if sold for human consumption.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Itzhak Y, Kalir A, Weissman BA, Cohen S | title = New analgesic drugs derived from phencyclidine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 496\u20139 | date = May 1981 | pmid = 7241506 | doi = 10.1021/jm00137a004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudieu I, Vignon J, Chicheportiche M, Kamenka JM, Trouiller G, Chicheportiche R | title = Role of the aromatic group in the inhibition of phencyclidine binding and dopamine uptake by PCP analogs | journal = Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 699\u2013705 | date = Mar 1989 | pmid = 2544905 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(89)90020-8 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPCP was initially made in 1926 and brought to market as an [[anesthetic]] medication in the 1950s.<ref name=Zed2007/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bunney|first1=W.

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the [[Romantic poetry|poetry]] and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. What he called his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] were said by 20th-century critic [[Northrop Frye]] to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".<ref>Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D.

The Nonesuch Press, 1927. p. 167.</ref>\n\nAlthough Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\".<ref>''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge''. 2004, p. 351.</ref> A committed Christian who was hostile to the [[Church of England]] (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s.<ref>Blake, William.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cSxDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Letters+of+William+Blake:+Together+with+a+Life&lr=&as_brr=3 The Letters of William Blake: Together with a Life]''. 1906, p. 7.</ref> After Blake complained to the Dean, the schoolboys' privilege was withdrawn.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" /> Blake claimed that he experienced visions in the Abbey. He [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|saw Christ]] with his [[Apostles]] and a great procession of monks and priests, and heard their chant.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" />\n\n=== Royal Academy ===\nOn 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the Strand.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwnLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT103|title=Jerusalem!: The Real Life of William Blake|first=Tobias|last=Churton |authorlink=Tobias Churton |date=16 April 2015|publisher=Watkins Media|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781780287881}}</ref> While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/completepoetrypr00blak |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by \"E\" and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.</ref> Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable [[oil painting]], Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].\n\nDavid Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather \"against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice.\"<ref>Bindman, D. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.</ref> Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.\n\nBlake became a friend of [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69\u201376.</ref>\n\n=== Gordon Riots ===\nBlake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]].<ref>Gilchrist, A., ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30.</ref> The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass }}</ref> Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

Blake taught Catherine to write, and she helped him colour his printed poems.<ref>Bentley, G.

That is how he rationalizes the Book's unusual ending, but notes that he is speculating.<ref>Damon, Samuel Foster (1988). A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house, present at his expiration, said, \"I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed angel.\"<ref>Gilchrist, ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1863, 405</ref>\n\n[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] gives the following account of Blake's death in a letter to [[Samuel Palmer]]:\n\n{{quote|He died ... in a most glorious manner.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions.

Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings.

Watercolour on wood.]]\nBlake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the \"discernment\" of the senses. Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\".

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels.

My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me. What it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty I question not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a Window concerning a Sight I look thro it & not with it. (E565-6)}}\n\nDespite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.<ref name=\"flavorwire1\" />\n\nAware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, \"There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was \"a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few\", who \"led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=978-1-60303-696-2 |page=81 |url= }}</ref> Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that \"the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence\".\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}\n[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

Canadian music composer [[Kathleen Yearwood]] is one of many contemporary musicians that have set Blake's poems to music. After World War II, Blake's role in popular culture came to the fore in a variety of areas such as popular music, film, and the [[graphic novel]], leading Edward Larrissy to assert that \"Blake is the Romantic writer who has exerted the most powerful influence on the twentieth century.\"<ref>Edward Larrissy.

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the [[Romantic poetry|poetry]] and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. What he called his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] were said by 20th-century critic [[Northrop Frye]] to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".<ref>Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D.

His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\".<ref>''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge''. 2004, p. 351.</ref> A committed Christian who was hostile to the [[Church of England]] (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s.<ref>Blake, William.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cSxDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Letters+of+William+Blake:+Together+with+a+Life&lr=&as_brr=3 The Letters of William Blake: Together with a Life]''. 1906, p. 7.</ref> After Blake complained to the Dean, the schoolboys' privilege was withdrawn.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" /> Blake claimed that he experienced visions in the Abbey. He [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|saw Christ]] with his [[Apostles]] and a great procession of monks and priests, and heard their chant.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\" />\n\n=== Royal Academy ===\nOn 8 October 1779, Blake became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] in Old Somerset House, near the Strand.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IwnLCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT103|title=Jerusalem!: The Real Life of William Blake|first=Tobias|last=Churton |authorlink=Tobias Churton |date=16 April 2015|publisher=Watkins Media|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781780287881}}</ref> While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691. All quotations from Blake's writings are from {{cite book |author=Erdman, David V |title=The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake |edition=2nd |isbn=0-385-15213-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/completepoetrypr00blak |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} Subsequent references follow the convention of providing plate and line numbers where appropriate, followed by \"E\" and the page number from Erdman, and correspond to Blake's often unconventional spelling and punctuation.</ref> Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds' fashionable [[oil painting]], Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].\n\nDavid Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake, Reynolds held [[history painting]] to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture), but rather \"against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice.\"<ref>Bindman, D. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', ed. Morris Eaves. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003, p. 86.</ref> Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy, submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808.\n\nBlake became a friend of [[John Flaxman]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[George Cumberland]] during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views, with Stothard and Cumberland joining the [[Society for Constitutional Information]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, pp. 69\u201376.</ref>\n\n=== Gordon Riots ===\nBlake's first biographer, [[Alexander Gilchrist]], records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed [[Newgate Prison]].<ref>Gilchrist, A., ''The Life of William Blake'', London, 1842, p. 30.</ref> The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes, set the building ablaze, and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church, where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Blake | title = St. Mary's Church Parish website | quote = St Mary's Modern Stained Glass }}</ref> Later, in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write, Blake trained her as an engraver. Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings.

Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\". Ackroyd, Peter (1995). Blake. London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.</ref> On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.<ref name=bent78 />\n\n[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819\u20131820.

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R.

In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me.

This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

The thickness of the skin varies considerably over all parts of the body, and between men and women and the young and the old. An example is the skin on the forearm which is on average 1.3&nbsp;mm in the male and 1.26&nbsp;mm in the female.<ref name=Millington/> The average square inch (6.5&nbsp;cm\u00b2) of skin holds 650 sweat glands, 20 blood vessels, 60,000 melanocytes, and more than 1,000 nerve endings.<ref name=Bennett/>{{better source|date=July 2016}} The average human skin cell is about 30 micrometres in diameter, but there are variants. A skin cell usually ranges from 25-40 micrometres (squared), depending on a variety of factors.\n\nSkin is composed of three primary layers: the [[epidermis]], the [[dermis]] and the [[hypodermis]].<ref name=Millington>{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=P.F.

It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body's surface which also serves as a barrier to [[infection]] and is made up of stratified squamous [[epithelium]] with an underlying [[basal lamina]].\n\nThe epidermis contains no [[blood vessel]]s, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air<ref name=\"St\u00fccker2002\"/> and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are [[Merkel cell]]s, [[keratinocyte]]s, with [[melanocyte]]s and [[Langerhans cell]]s also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following ''strata'' (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, and basale. Cells are formed through [[mitosis]] at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see [[cell division]]) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein [[keratin]] is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off ([[desquamation]]). This process is called [[cornification|\"keratinization\"]]. This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and [[pathogen]]s out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.\n\n[[File:HautFingerspitzeOCT nonanimated.gif|thumb |209px|\n2D projection of a 3D [[Optical coherence tomography|OCT]]-tomogram of the skin at the fingertip, depicting the [[stratum corneum]] (~500&nbsp;\u00b5m thick) with the stratum disjunctum on top and the [[stratum lucidum]] in the middle. At the bottom are the superficial parts of the dermis. The sweatducts are clearly visible. (See also:&nbsp;[[:Image:HautFingerspitzeOCT.gif|Rotating 3D Version]])]]\n\n====Components====\nThe epidermis contains no [[blood vessel]]s and is nourished by [[diffusion]] from the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are [[keratinocyte]]s, [[melanocyte]]s, [[Langerhans cell]]s, and [[Merkel cell]]s. The epidermis helps the skin regulate body temperature.\n\n====Layers====\nThe epidermis is divided into several layers, where cells are formed through [[mitosis]] at the innermost layers. They move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with [[keratin]]. They eventually reach the top layer called ''stratum corneum'' and are sloughed off, or desquamated. This process is called ''[[keratinization]]'' and takes place within weeks. The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells.\n\n====Sublayers====\nThe epidermis is divided into the following 5 sublayers or strata:\n*[[Stratum corneum]]\n*[[Stratum lucidum]]\n*[[Stratum granulosum]]\n*[[Stratum spinosum]]\n*[[Stratum basale]] (also called \"stratum germinativum\")\n\nBlood capillaries are found beneath the epidermis and are linked to an arteriole and a venule. Arterial shunt vessels may bypass the network in ears, the nose and fingertips.\n\n==== Genes and proteins expressed in the epidermis ====\nAbout 70% of all human protein-coding genes are expressed in the skin.<ref name=\"atlas\">{{cite web|title=The human proteome in skin - The Human Protein Atlas|url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/skin|website=www.proteinatlas.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uhl\u00e9n|first=Mathias|last2=Fagerberg|first2=Linn|last3=Hallstr\u00f6m|first3=Bj\u00f6rn M.|last4=Lindskog|first4=Cecilia|last5=Oksvold|first5=Per|last6=Mardinoglu|first6=Adil|last7=Sivertsson|first7=\u00c5sa|last8=Kampf|first8=Caroline|last9=Sj\u00f6stedt|first9=Evelina|date=23 January 2015|title=Tissue-based map of the human proteome|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6220|page=1260419|doi=10.1126/science.1260419|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25613900}}</ref> Almost 500 genes have an elevated pattern of expression in the skin.

The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a [[basement membrane]]. It also harbors many [[mechanoreceptor|nerve endings]] that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the [[hair follicles]], [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[apocrine gland]]s, [[lymphatic vessels]] and [[blood vessels]]. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells as well as from the stratum basale of the epidermis.\n\nThe dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the ''papillary region'', and a deep thicker area known as the ''reticular region''.\n\n====Papillary region====\nThe papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]]. It is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'', which extend toward the epidermis. The papillae provide the dermis with a \"bumpy\" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.\n\nIn the palms, fingers, soles, and toes, the influence of the papillae projecting into the epidermis forms contours in the skin's surface. These [[epidermal ridges]] occur in patterns (''see:'' [[fingerprint]]) that are genetically and [[epigenetic]]ally determined and are therefore unique to the individual, making it possible to use fingerprints or footprints as a means of [[Forensic identification|identification]].\n\n====Reticular region====\nThe reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagenous]], [[Elastin|elastic]], and [[reticular fiber|reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity.\n\nAlso located within the reticular region are the [[Hair#Root of the hair|roots of the hairs]], [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and blood vessels.\n\nTattoo ink is held in the dermis. [[Stretch marks]], often from pregnancy and [[obesity]], are also located in the dermis.\n\n===Subcutaneous tissue===\n\nThe [[subcutaneous tissue]] (also ''hypodermis'' and ''subcutis'') is not part of the skin, but lies below the dermis of the [[cutis (anatomy)|cutis]]. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue, adipose tissue and [[elastin]]. The main cell types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (subcutaneous tissue contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.\n\n===Cross-section===\n{{wide image|Skin_layers.svg|800px|Skin layers, of both hairy and hairless skin}}\n\n==Development==\n{{Further|Human embryogenesis#Integumentary system}}\n\n===Skin color===\n{{main|Human skin color}}\nHuman skin shows high skin color variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white hues. Human skin shows higher variation in color than any other single mammalian species and is the result of [[natural selection]]. Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UVR) penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.<ref name=jabl1/>\n\nThe actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances, although the single most important substance determining human skin color is the pigment [[melanin]]. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called [[melanocyte]]s and it is the main determinant of the skin color of [[Dark skin|darker-skinned]] humans. The skin color of people with [[light skin]] is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the [[dermis]] and by the [[hemoglobin]] circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible, especially in the face, when, as consequence of [[physical exercise]] or the stimulation of the [[nervous system]] (anger, fear), [[arterioles]] dilate.<ref name=Jabl06/>\n\nThere are at least five different pigments that determine the color of the skin.<ref>Handbook of General Anatomy by B. D. Chaurasia. {{ISBN|978-81-239-1654-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mananatomy.com/basic-anatomy/pigmentation-skin |title=Pigmentation of Skin |publisher=Mananatomy.com |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> These pigments are present at different levels and places.\n*[[Melanin]]: It is brown in color and present in the [[basal layer]] of the [[epidermis]].\n*Melanoid: It resembles melanin but is present diffusely throughout the epidermis.\n*[[Carotene]]: This pigment is yellow to orange in color. It is present in the stratum corneum and fat cells of dermis and [[superficial fascia]].\n*[[Hemoglobin]] (also spelled ''haemoglobin''): It is found in blood and is not a pigment of the skin but develops a purple color.\n*Oxyhemoglobin: It is also found in blood and is not a pigment of the skin. It develops a red color.\n\nThere is a correlation between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that highlight higher amounts of UVR reflect darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer towards the equator. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations.<ref name=webb06/>\n\nIn the same population it has been observed that adult human [[woman|female]]s are considerably lighter in skin pigmentation than [[man|male]]s. Females need more [[calcium]] during [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]], and [[vitamin D]] which is synthesized from sunlight helps in absorbing calcium. For this reason it is thought that females may have evolved to have lighter skin in order to help their bodies absorb more calcium.<ref name=Jabl00/>\n\nThe [[Fitzpatrick scale]]<ref name=Skininc>{{cite journal|title=The Fitzpatrick Skin Type Classification Scale|journal=Skin Inc.|issue=November 2007|url=http://www.skininc.com/skinscience/physiology/10764816.html|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=ARPNSA>{{cite web|title=Fitzpatrick Skin Type|url=http://www.arpansa.gov.au/pubs/RadiationProtection/FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf|publisher=Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency|accessdate=7 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331085655/http://www.arpansa.gov.au///pubs/RadiationProtection/FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2016}}</ref> is a numerical classification schema for human skin color developed in 1975 as a way to classify the typical response of different types of skin to ultraviolet (UV) light:\n{|\n|-\n! \n|-\n| I\n| Always burns, never tans\n| Pale, Fair, Freckles\n|-\n| II\n| Usually burns, sometimes tans\n| Fair\n|-\n| III\n| May burn, usually tans\n| Light Brown\n|-\n| IV\n| Rarely burns, always tans\n| Olive brown\n|-\n| V\n| Moderate constitutional pigmentation\n| Brown\n|-\n| VI\n| Marked constitutional pigmentation\n| Black\n|}\n\n=== Aging ===\n{{details|senescence}}\n{{details|Intrinsic and extrinsic aging}}\n[[File:Rash.jpg|thumb|A typical rash]]\n[[File:Scabies-burrow.jpg|thumb|Skin infected with [[scabies]]]]\nAs skin ages, it becomes thinner and more easily damaged. Intensifying this effect is the decreasing ability of skin to heal itself as a person ages.\n\nAmong other things, skin aging is noted by a decrease in volume and elasticity. There are many [[Intrinsic and extrinsic aging|internal and external causes]] to skin aging. For example, aging skin receives less blood flow and lower glandular activity.\n\nA validated comprehensive grading scale has categorized the clinical findings of skin aging as laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), and the various facets of photoaging, including [[erythema]] (redness), and [[telangiectasia]], dyspigmentation (brown discoloration), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths) and poor texture.<ref>Alexiades-Armenakas, M.

In younger skin, sun damage will heal faster since the cells in the [[epidermis]] have a faster turnover rate, while in the older population the skin becomes thinner and the epidermis turnover rate for cell repair is lower, which may result in the [[dermis]] layer being damaged.<ref name=Gilchrest/>\n\n==Functions==\nSkin performs the following functions:\n\n# '''Protection''': an anatomical barrier from pathogens and damage between the internal and external environment in bodily defense; [[Langerhans cell]]s in the skin are part of the [[adaptive immune system]].<ref name=\"Proksch\"/><ref name=\"Madison\"/> Perspiration contains [[lysozyme]] that break the bonds within the cell walls of bacteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/innate_3.html|title=Immune Defense against Bacterial Pathogens: Innate Immunity|last=WI|first=Kenneth Todar, Madison|website=textbookofbacteriology.net|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n# '''[[Wikt:sensation|Sensation]]''': contains a variety of nerve endings that react to [[thermoreceptor|heat and cold]], touch, pressure, vibration, and tissue injury; see [[somatosensory system]] and [[hapticity|haptics]].\n# '''Heat regulation''': the skin contains a blood supply far greater than its requirements which allows precise control of energy loss by radiation, convection and conduction. Dilated blood vessels increase perfusion and heatloss, while constricted vessels greatly reduce cutaneous blood flow and conserve heat.\n# '''Control of evaporation''': the skin provides a relatively dry and semi-impermeable barrier to fluid loss.<ref name=\"Madison\"/> Loss of this function contributes to the massive fluid loss in [[burn (injury)|burns]].\n# '''Aesthetics and communication''': others see our skin and can assess our mood, physical state and attractiveness.\n# '''Storage and synthesis''': acts as a storage center for lipids and water, as well as a means of synthesis of [[vitamin D]] by action of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] on certain parts of the skin.\n# '''Excretion''': [[sweat]] contains [[urea]], however its concentration is 1/130th that of [[urine]], hence [[excretion]] by sweating is at most a secondary function to temperature regulation.\n# '''Absorption''': the cells comprising the outermost 0.25\u20130.40&nbsp;mm of the skin are \"almost exclusively supplied by external oxygen\", although the \"contribution to total respiration is negligible\".<ref name=\"St\u00fccker2002\"/> In addition, medicine can be administered through the skin, by ointments or by means of adhesive [[transdermal patch|patch]], such as the [[nicotine patch]] or [[iontophoresis]]. The skin is an important site of transport in many other organisms.\n# '''Water resistance''': The skin acts as a water-resistant barrier so essential nutrients are not washed out of the body.\n\n===Skin flora===\n{{Main|Skin flora}}\n\nThe human skin is a rich environment for microbes.<ref name=\"Grice\"/><ref name=\"Pappas\"/> Around 1000 species of [[bacteria]] from 19 bacterial [[phylum|phyla]] have been found. Most come from only four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%). [[Propionibacteria]] and [[Staphylococci]] species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. There are three main ecological areas: moist, dry and sebaceous. In moist places on the body [[Corynebacteria]] together with [[Staphylococci]] dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but dominated by b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]]. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry ones. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside\nthe nostril), and on the back.\n\nReflecting upon the diversity of the human skin researchers on the human skin [[microbiome]] have observed: \"hairy, moist underarms lie a short distance from smooth dry forearms, but these two niches are likely as ecologically dissimilar as rainforests are to deserts.\"<ref name=\"Grice\"/>\n\nThe [[NIH]] has launched the [[Human Microbiome Project]] to characterize the human microbiota which includes that on the skin and the role of this microbiome in health and disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hmpdacc.org/micro_analysis/microbiome_analyses.php |title=NIH Human Microbiome Project |publisher=Hmpdacc.org |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n<!-- TODO: this paragraph was misplaced (in Hypodermis section...), should probably be consolidated with text above -->Microorganisms like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface. The density of skin flora depends on region of the skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the hair follicle, gut and urogenital openings.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{details|skin disease}}\nDiseases of the skin include [[skin infection]]s and [[skin neoplasm]]s (including skin cancer).\n\n[[Dermatology]] is the branch of [[medicine]] that deals with conditions of the skin.<ref name=\"lookingbill\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Hygiene and skin care===\n{{See also|Exfoliation (cosmetology)}}\nThe skin supports its own [[ecosystem]]s of [[microorganism]]s, including [[yeast]]s and bacteria, which cannot be removed by any amount of cleaning. Estimates place the number of individual bacteria on the surface of one square inch (6.5 square cm) of human skin at 50 million, though this figure varies greatly over the average {{convert|20|sqft|m2}} of human skin. Oily surfaces, such as the face, may contain over 500 million bacteria per square inch (6.5&nbsp;cm\u00b2). Despite these vast quantities, all of the bacteria found on the skin's surface would fit into a volume the size of a pea.<ref>Theodor Rosebury. ''Life on Man'': Secker & Warburg, 1969 {{ISBN|0-670-42793-4}}</ref> In general, the microorganisms keep one another in check and are part of a healthy skin. When the balance is disturbed, there may be an overgrowth and infection, such as when [[antibiotic]]s kill [[microbe]]s, resulting in an overgrowth of yeast. The skin is continuous with the inner [[epithelial]] lining of the body at the orifices, each of which supports its own complement of microbes.\n\nCosmetics should be used carefully on the skin because these may cause allergic reactions. Each season requires suitable clothing in order to facilitate the evaporation of the sweat. Sunlight, water and air play an important role in keeping the skin healthy.\n\n====Oily skin====\nOily skin is caused by over-active sebaceous glands, that produce a substance called [[sebum]], a naturally healthy skin lubricant.<ref name=Hcare/><ref name=\":0\" /> A high [[Glycemic index|glycemic-index]] diet and [[dairy product]]s (except for cheese) consumption increase [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] generation which in turn increases sebum production.<ref name=\":0\" /> Overwashing the skin does not cause sebum overproduction but may cause dryness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the skin produces excessive [[sebum]], it becomes heavy and thick in texture. Oily skin is typified by shininess, blemishes and [[pimples]].<ref name=\"Hcare\" /> The oily-skin type is not necessarily bad, since such skin is less prone to wrinkling, or other signs of aging,<ref name=\"Hcare\" /> because the oil helps to keep needed moisture locked into the [[epidermis]] (outermost layer of skin).\n\nThe negative aspect of the oily-skin type is that oily complexions are especially susceptible to clogged pores, [[blackhead]]s, and buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin.<ref name=Hcare/> Oily skin can be sallow and rough in texture and tends to have large, clearly visible pores everywhere, except around the eyes and neck.<ref name=Hcare/>\n\n==Permeability==\n\nHuman skin has a low [[Permeation|permeability]]; that is, most foreign substances are unable to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most [[inorganic]] nanosized particles.<ref name = \"Baroli2010\"/><ref name=\"Filipe2009\"/> This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to come into contact with internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in [[nanomedicine]] and [[biology]] to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where [[nanoparticles]] can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms ([[Cancer|cancer cells]]). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.\n\n===Nanoparticles===\n\nNanoparticles 40&nbsp;nm in diameter and smaller have been successful in penetrating the skin.<ref name=\"Vogt\"/><ref name = \"Sonavane2008\"/><ref name = \"Ryman-Rasmussen2006\"/> Research confirms that nanoparticles larger than 40&nbsp;nm do not penetrate the skin past the stratum corneum.<ref name=\"Vogt\"/> Most particles that do penetrate will diffuse through skin cells, but some will travel down [[hair follicle]]s and reach the dermis layer.\n\nThe permeability of skin relative to different shapes of nanoparticles has also been studied. Research has shown that spherical particles have a better ability to penetrate the skin compared to [[rectangle|oblong]] (ellipsoidal) particles because spheres are symmetric in all three spatial dimensions.<ref name=\"Ryman-Rasmussen2006\"/> One study compared the two shapes and recorded data that showed spherical particles located deep in the epidermis and dermis whereas ellipsoidal particles were mainly found in the stratum corneum and epidermal layers.<ref name = Ryman>Ryman-Rasmussen, J.P., Riviere, J.E. and Monteiro-Riviere, N.A.

Transdermal patches have been limited to administer a small number of drugs, such as [[nicotine]], because of the limitations in permeability of the skin. Development of techniques that increase skin permeability has led to more drugs that can be applied via transdermal patches and more options for patients.<ref name = \"Mark\"/>\n\nIncreasing the permeability of skin allows nanoparticles to penetrate and target [[cancer]] cells. Nanoparticles along with [[Medical imaging|multi-modal imaging]] techniques have been used as a way to diagnose cancer [[non-invasive]]ly. Skin with high permeability allowed quantum dots with an [[antibody]] attached to the surface for active targeting to successfully penetrate and identify cancerous [[tumors]] in mice. Tumor targeting is beneficial because the particles can be excited using [[fluorescence microscopy]] and emit light energy and heat that will destroy cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = X. | last2 = Cui | first2 = Y. | last3 = Levenson | first3 = R. | last4 = Chung | first4 = L. | last5 = Nie | first5 = S. | year = 2005 | title = ''In vivo'' cancer targeting and imaging with semiconductor quantum dots | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 22 | issue = 8| pages = 969\u2013976 | doi=10.1038/nbt994 | pmid=15258594}}</ref>\n\n===Sunblock and sunscreen===\nSunblock and sunscreen are different important skin-care products though both offer full protection from the sun.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sunscreen or sunblock |url=http://cancer.about.com/od/skincancermelanoma/f/Sunscreen-Or-Sunblock.htm |accessdate=July 2015}}</ref><ref>An update on Suncreens; 2007; P 23- 29.

For the average adult human, the skin has a surface area of between 1.5-2.0 square metres (16.1-21.5 sq ft.). The thickness of the skin varies considerably over all parts of the body, and between men and women and the young and the old.

It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body's surface which also serves as a barrier to [[infection]] and is made up of stratified squamous [[epithelium]] with an underlying [[basal lamina]].\n\nThe epidermis contains no [[blood vessel]]s, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air<ref name=\"St\u00fccker2002\"/> and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are [[Merkel cell]]s, [[keratinocyte]]s, with [[melanocyte]]s and [[Langerhans cell]]s also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following ''strata'' (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, and basale. Cells are formed through [[mitosis]] at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see [[cell division]]) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein [[keratin]] is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off ([[desquamation]]). This process is called [[cornification|\"keratinization\"]]. This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and [[pathogen]]s out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.\n\n[[File:HautFingerspitzeOCT nonanimated.gif|thumb |209px|\n2D projection of a 3D [[Optical coherence tomography|OCT]]-tomogram of the skin at the fingertip, depicting the [[stratum corneum]] (~500&nbsp;\u00b5m thick) with the stratum disjunctum on top and the [[stratum lucidum]] in the middle.

(See also:&nbsp;[[:Image:HautFingerspitzeOCT.gif|Rotating 3D Version]])]]\n\n====Components====\nThe epidermis contains no [[blood vessel]]s and is nourished by [[diffusion]] from the dermis. The main type of cells that make up the epidermis are [[keratinocyte]]s, [[melanocyte]]s, [[Langerhans cell]]s, and [[Merkel cell]]s. The epidermis helps the skin regulate body temperature.\n\n====Layers====\nThe epidermis is divided into several layers, where cells are formed through [[mitosis]] at the innermost layers. They move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with [[keratin]]. They eventually reach the top layer called ''stratum corneum'' and are sloughed off, or desquamated. This process is called ''[[keratinization]]'' and takes place within weeks. The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells.\n\n====Sublayers====\nThe epidermis is divided into the following 5 sublayers or strata:\n*[[Stratum corneum]]\n*[[Stratum lucidum]]\n*[[Stratum granulosum]]\n*[[Stratum spinosum]]\n*[[Stratum basale]] (also called \"stratum germinativum\")\n\nBlood capillaries are found beneath the epidermis and are linked to an arteriole and a venule. Arterial shunt vessels may bypass the network in ears, the nose and fingertips.\n\n==== Genes and proteins expressed in the epidermis ====\nAbout 70% of all human protein-coding genes are expressed in the skin.<ref name=\"atlas\">{{cite web|title=The human proteome in skin - The Human Protein Atlas|url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/skin|website=www.proteinatlas.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uhl\u00e9n|first=Mathias|last2=Fagerberg|first2=Linn|last3=Hallstr\u00f6m|first3=Bj\u00f6rn M.|last4=Lindskog|first4=Cecilia|last5=Oksvold|first5=Per|last6=Mardinoglu|first6=Adil|last7=Sivertsson|first7=\u00c5sa|last8=Kampf|first8=Caroline|last9=Sj\u00f6stedt|first9=Evelina|date=23 January 2015|title=Tissue-based map of the human proteome|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6220|page=1260419|doi=10.1126/science.1260419|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25613900}}</ref> Almost 500 genes have an elevated pattern of expression in the skin.

The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a [[basement membrane]]. It also harbors many [[mechanoreceptor|nerve endings]] that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the [[hair follicles]], [[sweat gland]]s, [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[apocrine gland]]s, [[lymphatic vessels]] and [[blood vessels]]. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells as well as from the stratum basale of the epidermis.\n\nThe dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the ''papillary region'', and a deep thicker area known as the ''reticular region''.\n\n====Papillary region====\nThe papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]]. It is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'', which extend toward the epidermis. The papillae provide the dermis with a \"bumpy\" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.\n\nIn the palms, fingers, soles, and toes, the influence of the papillae projecting into the epidermis forms contours in the skin's surface. These [[epidermal ridges]] occur in patterns (''see:'' [[fingerprint]]) that are genetically and [[epigenetic]]ally determined and are therefore unique to the individual, making it possible to use fingerprints or footprints as a means of [[Forensic identification|identification]].\n\n====Reticular region====\nThe reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagenous]], [[Elastin|elastic]], and [[reticular fiber|reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity.\n\nAlso located within the reticular region are the [[Hair#Root of the hair|roots of the hairs]], [[sebaceous gland]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and blood vessels.\n\nTattoo ink is held in the dermis. [[Stretch marks]], often from pregnancy and [[obesity]], are also located in the dermis.\n\n===Subcutaneous tissue===\n\nThe [[subcutaneous tissue]] (also ''hypodermis'' and ''subcutis'') is not part of the skin, but lies below the dermis of the [[cutis (anatomy)|cutis]]. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and [[muscle]] as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue, adipose tissue and [[elastin]]. The main cell types are [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[adipocyte]]s (subcutaneous tissue contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.\n\n===Cross-section===\n{{wide image|Skin_layers.svg|800px|Skin layers, of both hairy and hairless skin}}\n\n==Development==\n{{Further|Human embryogenesis#Integumentary system}}\n\n===Skin color===\n{{main|Human skin color}}\nHuman skin shows high skin color variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white hues. Human skin shows higher variation in color than any other single mammalian species and is the result of [[natural selection]]. Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UVR) penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.<ref name=jabl1/>\n\nThe actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances, although the single most important substance determining human skin color is the pigment [[melanin]]. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called [[melanocyte]]s and it is the main determinant of the skin color of [[Dark skin|darker-skinned]] humans. The skin color of people with [[light skin]] is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the [[dermis]] and by the [[hemoglobin]] circulating in the veins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible, especially in the face, when, as consequence of [[physical exercise]] or the stimulation of the [[nervous system]] (anger, fear), [[arterioles]] dilate.<ref name=Jabl06/>\n\nThere are at least five different pigments that determine the color of the skin.<ref>Handbook of General Anatomy by B. D. Chaurasia. {{ISBN|978-81-239-1654-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mananatomy.com/basic-anatomy/pigmentation-skin |title=Pigmentation of Skin |publisher=Mananatomy.com |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> These pigments are present at different levels and places.\n*[[Melanin]]: It is brown in color and present in the [[basal layer]] of the [[epidermis]].\n*Melanoid: It resembles melanin but is present diffusely throughout the epidermis.\n*[[Carotene]]: This pigment is yellow to orange in color. It is present in the stratum corneum and fat cells of dermis and [[superficial fascia]].\n*[[Hemoglobin]] (also spelled ''haemoglobin''): It is found in blood and is not a pigment of the skin but develops a purple color.\n*Oxyhemoglobin: It is also found in blood and is not a pigment of the skin. It develops a red color.\n\nThere is a correlation between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that highlight higher amounts of UVR reflect darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer towards the equator. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations.<ref name=webb06/>\n\nIn the same population it has been observed that adult human [[woman|female]]s are considerably lighter in skin pigmentation than [[man|male]]s. Females need more [[calcium]] during [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]], and [[vitamin D]] which is synthesized from sunlight helps in absorbing calcium. For this reason it is thought that females may have evolved to have lighter skin in order to help their bodies absorb more calcium.<ref name=Jabl00/>\n\nThe [[Fitzpatrick scale]]<ref name=Skininc>{{cite journal|title=The Fitzpatrick Skin Type Classification Scale|journal=Skin Inc.|issue=November 2007|url=http://www.skininc.com/skinscience/physiology/10764816.html|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=ARPNSA>{{cite web|title=Fitzpatrick Skin Type|url=http://www.arpansa.gov.au/pubs/RadiationProtection/FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf|publisher=Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency|accessdate=7 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331085655/http://www.arpansa.gov.au///pubs/RadiationProtection/FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2016}}</ref> is a numerical classification schema for human skin color developed in 1975 as a way to classify the typical response of different types of skin to ultraviolet (UV) light:\n{|\n|-\n! \n|-\n| I\n| Always burns, never tans\n| Pale, Fair, Freckles\n|-\n| II\n| Usually burns, sometimes tans\n| Fair\n|-\n| III\n| May burn, usually tans\n| Light Brown\n|-\n| IV\n| Rarely burns, always tans\n| Olive brown\n|-\n| V\n| Moderate constitutional pigmentation\n| Brown\n|-\n| VI\n| Marked constitutional pigmentation\n| Black\n|}\n\n=== Aging ===\n{{details|senescence}}\n{{details|Intrinsic and extrinsic aging}}\n[[File:Rash.jpg|thumb|A typical rash]]\n[[File:Scabies-burrow.jpg|thumb|Skin infected with [[scabies]]]]\nAs skin ages, it becomes thinner and more easily damaged. Intensifying this effect is the decreasing ability of skin to heal itself as a person ages.\n\nAmong other things, skin aging is noted by a decrease in volume and elasticity. There are many [[Intrinsic and extrinsic aging|internal and external causes]] to skin aging. For example, aging skin receives less blood flow and lower glandular activity.\n\nA validated comprehensive grading scale has categorized the clinical findings of skin aging as laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), and the various facets of photoaging, including [[erythema]] (redness), and [[telangiectasia]], dyspigmentation (brown discoloration), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths) and poor texture.<ref>Alexiades-Armenakas, M.

In younger skin, sun damage will heal faster since the cells in the [[epidermis]] have a faster turnover rate, while in the older population the skin becomes thinner and the epidermis turnover rate for cell repair is lower, which may result in the [[dermis]] layer being damaged.<ref name=Gilchrest/>\n\n==Functions==\nSkin performs the following functions:\n\n# '''Protection''': an anatomical barrier from pathogens and damage between the internal and external environment in bodily defense; [[Langerhans cell]]s in the skin are part of the [[adaptive immune system]].<ref name=\"Proksch\"/><ref name=\"Madison\"/> Perspiration contains [[lysozyme]] that break the bonds within the cell walls of bacteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/innate_3.html|title=Immune Defense against Bacterial Pathogens: Innate Immunity|last=WI|first=Kenneth Todar, Madison|website=textbookofbacteriology.net|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n# '''[[Wikt:sensation|Sensation]]''': contains a variety of nerve endings that react to [[thermoreceptor|heat and cold]], touch, pressure, vibration, and tissue injury; see [[somatosensory system]] and [[hapticity|haptics]].\n# '''Heat regulation''': the skin contains a blood supply far greater than its requirements which allows precise control of energy loss by radiation, convection and conduction. Dilated blood vessels increase perfusion and heatloss, while constricted vessels greatly reduce cutaneous blood flow and conserve heat.\n# '''Control of evaporation''': the skin provides a relatively dry and semi-impermeable barrier to fluid loss.<ref name=\"Madison\"/> Loss of this function contributes to the massive fluid loss in [[burn (injury)|burns]].\n# '''Aesthetics and communication''': others see our skin and can assess our mood, physical state and attractiveness.\n# '''Storage and synthesis''': acts as a storage center for lipids and water, as well as a means of synthesis of [[vitamin D]] by action of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] on certain parts of the skin.\n# '''Excretion''': [[sweat]] contains [[urea]], however its concentration is 1/130th that of [[urine]], hence [[excretion]] by sweating is at most a secondary function to temperature regulation.\n# '''Absorption''': the cells comprising the outermost 0.25\u20130.40&nbsp;mm of the skin are \"almost exclusively supplied by external oxygen\", although the \"contribution to total respiration is negligible\".<ref name=\"St\u00fccker2002\"/> In addition, medicine can be administered through the skin, by ointments or by means of adhesive [[transdermal patch|patch]], such as the [[nicotine patch]] or [[iontophoresis]]. The skin is an important site of transport in many other organisms.\n# '''Water resistance''': The skin acts as a water-resistant barrier so essential nutrients are not washed out of the body.\n\n===Skin flora===\n{{Main|Skin flora}}\n\nThe human skin is a rich environment for microbes.<ref name=\"Grice\"/><ref name=\"Pappas\"/> Around 1000 species of [[bacteria]] from 19 bacterial [[phylum|phyla]] have been found. Most come from only four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%). [[Propionibacteria]] and [[Staphylococci]] species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. There are three main ecological areas: moist, dry and sebaceous. In moist places on the body [[Corynebacteria]] together with [[Staphylococci]] dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but dominated by b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]]. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry ones. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside\nthe nostril), and on the back.\n\nReflecting upon the diversity of the human skin researchers on the human skin [[microbiome]] have observed: \"hairy, moist underarms lie a short distance from smooth dry forearms, but these two niches are likely as ecologically dissimilar as rainforests are to deserts.\"<ref name=\"Grice\"/>\n\nThe [[NIH]] has launched the [[Human Microbiome Project]] to characterize the human microbiota which includes that on the skin and the role of this microbiome in health and disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hmpdacc.org/micro_analysis/microbiome_analyses.php |title=NIH Human Microbiome Project |publisher=Hmpdacc.org |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n<!-- TODO: this paragraph was misplaced (in Hypodermis section...), should probably be consolidated with text above -->Microorganisms like ''[[Staphylococcus]] epidermidis'' colonize the skin surface. The density of skin flora depends on region of the skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the hair follicle, gut and urogenital openings.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{details|skin disease}}\nDiseases of the skin include [[skin infection]]s and [[skin neoplasm]]s (including skin cancer).\n\n[[Dermatology]] is the branch of [[medicine]] that deals with conditions of the skin.<ref name=\"lookingbill\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Hygiene and skin care===\n{{See also|Exfoliation (cosmetology)}}\nThe skin supports its own [[ecosystem]]s of [[microorganism]]s, including [[yeast]]s and bacteria, which cannot be removed by any amount of cleaning. Estimates place the number of individual bacteria on the surface of one square inch (6.5 square cm) of human skin at 50 million, though this figure varies greatly over the average {{convert|20|sqft|m2}} of human skin. Oily surfaces, such as the face, may contain over 500 million bacteria per square inch (6.5&nbsp;cm\u00b2). Despite these vast quantities, all of the bacteria found on the skin's surface would fit into a volume the size of a pea.<ref>Theodor Rosebury. ''Life on Man'': Secker & Warburg, 1969 {{ISBN|0-670-42793-4}}</ref> In general, the microorganisms keep one another in check and are part of a healthy skin. When the balance is disturbed, there may be an overgrowth and infection, such as when [[antibiotic]]s kill [[microbe]]s, resulting in an overgrowth of yeast. The skin is continuous with the inner [[epithelial]] lining of the body at the orifices, each of which supports its own complement of microbes.\n\nCosmetics should be used carefully on the skin because these may cause allergic reactions. Each season requires suitable clothing in order to facilitate the evaporation of the sweat. Sunlight, water and air play an important role in keeping the skin healthy.\n\n====Oily skin====\nOily skin is caused by over-active sebaceous glands, that produce a substance called [[sebum]], a naturally healthy skin lubricant.<ref name=Hcare/><ref name=\":0\" /> A high [[Glycemic index|glycemic-index]] diet and [[dairy product]]s (except for cheese) consumption increase [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] generation which in turn increases sebum production.<ref name=\":0\" /> Overwashing the skin does not cause sebum overproduction but may cause dryness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the skin produces excessive [[sebum]], it becomes heavy and thick in texture. Oily skin is typified by shininess, blemishes and [[pimples]].<ref name=\"Hcare\" /> The oily-skin type is not necessarily bad, since such skin is less prone to wrinkling, or other signs of aging,<ref name=\"Hcare\" /> because the oil helps to keep needed moisture locked into the [[epidermis]] (outermost layer of skin).\n\nThe negative aspect of the oily-skin type is that oily complexions are especially susceptible to clogged pores, [[blackhead]]s, and buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin.<ref name=Hcare/> Oily skin can be sallow and rough in texture and tends to have large, clearly visible pores everywhere, except around the eyes and neck.<ref name=Hcare/>\n\n==Permeability==\n\nHuman skin has a low [[Permeation|permeability]]; that is, most foreign substances are unable to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most [[inorganic]] nanosized particles.<ref name = \"Baroli2010\"/><ref name=\"Filipe2009\"/> This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to come into contact with internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in [[nanomedicine]] and [[biology]] to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where [[nanoparticles]] can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms ([[Cancer|cancer cells]]). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.\n\n===Nanoparticles===\n\nNanoparticles 40&nbsp;nm in diameter and smaller have been successful in penetrating the skin.<ref name=\"Vogt\"/><ref name = \"Sonavane2008\"/><ref name = \"Ryman-Rasmussen2006\"/> Research confirms that nanoparticles larger than 40&nbsp;nm do not penetrate the skin past the stratum corneum.<ref name=\"Vogt\"/> Most particles that do penetrate will diffuse through skin cells, but some will travel down [[hair follicle]]s and reach the dermis layer.\n\nThe permeability of skin relative to different shapes of nanoparticles has also been studied. Research has shown that spherical particles have a better ability to penetrate the skin compared to [[rectangle|oblong]] (ellipsoidal) particles because spheres are symmetric in all three spatial dimensions.<ref name=\"Ryman-Rasmussen2006\"/> One study compared the two shapes and recorded data that showed spherical particles located deep in the epidermis and dermis whereas ellipsoidal particles were mainly found in the stratum corneum and epidermal layers.<ref name = Ryman>Ryman-Rasmussen, J.P., Riviere, J.E. and Monteiro-Riviere, N.A.

Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature [[gradient]] causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.\n\nThis effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is determined by the polarity of the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.\n\nThe term \"thermoelectric effect\" encompasses three separately identified effects: the '''Seebeck effect''', '''Peltier effect''', and '''Thomson effect'''. The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the '''Peltier\u2013Seebeck effect''' (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] and [[Baltic German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]]). The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier\u2013Seebeck model and is credited to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].\n\n[[Joule heating]], the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a resistive material, is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect.

His apparatus consisted of two glasses of water.  Dipped in each glass was a wire that was connected to one or the other hind leg of a frog.  An iron rod was bent into a bow and one end was heated in boiling water.  When the ends of the iron bow were dipped into the two glasses, a thermoelectric current passed through the frog's legs and caused them to twitch.

This was because the electron energy levels shifted differently in the different metals, creating a [[potential difference]] between the junctions which in turn created an electrical current through the wires, and therefore a [[magnetic field]] around the wires. Seebeck did not recognize that an electric current was involved, so he called the phenomenon \"thermomagnetic effect\".

The local [[current density]] is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf J = \\sigma (-\\nabla V + \\mathbf E_\\text{emf}),</math>\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the local [[voltage]],<ref>The voltage in this case does not refer to electric potential but rather the \"voltmeter\" voltage <math>V = -\\mu/e</math>, where <math>\\mu</math> is the [[Fermi level]].</ref> and <math>\\sigma</math> is the local [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. In general, the Seebeck effect is described locally by the creation of an electromotive field\n\n:<math>\\mathbf E_\\text{emf} = -S \\nabla T,</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the [[Seebeck coefficient]] (also known as thermopower), a property of the local material, and  <math>\\nabla T</math> is the temperature gradient.\n\nThe Seebeck coefficients generally vary as function of temperature and depend strongly on the composition of the conductor. For ordinary materials at room temperature, the Seebeck coefficient may range in value from \u2212100&nbsp;\u03bcV/K to +1,000&nbsp;\u03bcV/K (see [[Seebeck coefficient]] article for more information).\n\nIf the system reaches a steady state, where <math>\\mathbf J = 0</math>, then the voltage gradient is given simply by the emf: <math>\\Delta V = S \\Delta T</math>. This simple relationship, which does not depend on conductivity, is used in the [[thermocouple]] to measure a temperature difference; an absolute temperature may be found by performing the voltage measurement at a known reference temperature. A metal of unknown composition can be classified by its thermoelectric effect if a metallic probe of known composition is kept at a constant temperature and held in contact with the unknown sample that is locally heated to the probe temperature. It is used commercially to identify metal alloys. Thermocouples in series form a [[thermopile]].

This is known as the Peltier Effect. The '''Peltier effect''' is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors and is named after French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]], who discovered it in 1834.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peltier|title=Nouvelles exp\u00e9riences sur la caloricit\u00e9 des courants \u00e9lectrique|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1834|volume=56|pages=371\u2013386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA371#v=onepage&q&f=false|trans-title=New experiments on the heat effects of electric currents|language=French}}</ref> When a current is made to flow through a junction between two conductors, A and B, heat may be generated or removed at the junction. The Peltier heat generated at the junction per unit time is\n\n:<math>\\dot{Q} = (\\Pi_\\text{A} - \\Pi_\\text{B}) I,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are the Peltier coefficients of conductors A and B, and <math>I</math> is the electric current (from A to B). The total heat generated is not determined by the Peltier effect alone, as it may also be influenced by Joule heating and thermal-gradient effects (see below).\n\nThe Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. Since charge current must be continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are different. The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the [[Counter-electromotive force|back-EMF]] in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed, then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (by the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction. The close relationship between Peltier and Seebeck effects can be seen in the direct connection between their coefficients: <math>\\Pi = T S</math> (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]).\n\nA typical Peltier [[heat pump]] involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric heat pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do [[thermoelectric cooling]] devices found in refrigerators.\n\n== Thomson effect ==\nIn different materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not constant in temperature, and so a spatial gradient in temperature can result in a gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient, then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur. This '''Thomson effect''' was predicted and later observed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (William Thomson).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On a mechanical theory of thermo-electric currents|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1851|volume=3|issue=42|pages=91\u201398|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/19876#page/111/mode/1up}}</ref>  It describes the heating or cooling of a current-carrying conductor with a temperature gradient.\n\nIf a current density <math>\\mathbf J</math> is passed through a homogeneous conductor, the Thomson effect predicts a heat production rate per unit volume\n\n:<math>\\dot q = -\\mathcal K \\mathbf J \\cdot \\nabla T,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla T</math> is the temperature gradient, and <math>\\mathcal K</math> is the Thomson coefficient.

This equation, however, neglects Joule heating and ordinary thermal conductivity (see full equations below).\n\n== Full thermoelectric equations ==\n\n{{see also|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}\n\nOften, more than one of the above effects is involved in the operation of a real thermoelectric device. The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; this also includes the effects of [[Joule heating]] and ordinary heat conduction. As stated above, the Seebeck effect generates an electromotive force, leading to the current equation<ref name=\"fsu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/nt_pelt.html |title=A.11 Thermoelectric effects |publisher=Eng.fsu.edu |date=2002-02-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf J = \\sigma (-\\boldsymbol \\nabla V - S \\nabla T).</math>\n\nTo describe the Peltier and Thomson effects, we must consider the flow of energy.

It was not satisfactorily proven until the advent of the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager relations]], and it is worth noting that this second Thomson relation is only guaranteed for a time-reversal symmetric material; if the material is placed in a magnetic field or is itself magnetically ordered ([[ferromagnetic]], [[antiferromagnetic]], etc.), then the second Thomson relation does not take the simple form shown here.<ref>There is a generalized second Thomson relation relating anisotropic Peltier and Seebeck coefficients with reversed magnetic field and magnetic order.

The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients can only be easily determined for pairs of materials; hence, it is difficult to find values of absolute Seebeck or Peltier coefficients for an individual material.\n\nIf the Thomson coefficient of a material is measured over a wide temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and Seebeck coefficients. This needs to be done only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise Seebeck coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the reference material.

The Peltier effect is also used by many [[thermal cyclers]], laboratory devices used to amplify DNA by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).

Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature [[gradient]] causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.\n\nThis effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is determined by the polarity of the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.\n\nThe term \"thermoelectric effect\" encompasses three separately identified effects: the '''Seebeck effect''', '''Peltier effect''', and '''Thomson effect'''. The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the '''Peltier\u2013Seebeck effect''' (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] and [[Baltic German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]]). The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier\u2013Seebeck model and is credited to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].\n\n[[Joule heating]], the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a resistive material, is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect.

For ordinary materials at room temperature, the Seebeck coefficient may range in value from \u2212100&nbsp;\u03bcV/K to +1,000&nbsp;\u03bcV/K (see [[Seebeck coefficient]] article for more information).\n\nIf the system reaches a steady state, where <math>\\mathbf J = 0</math>, then the voltage gradient is given simply by the emf: <math>\\Delta V = S \\Delta T</math>. This simple relationship, which does not depend on conductivity, is used in the [[thermocouple]] to measure a temperature difference; an absolute temperature may be found by performing the voltage measurement at a known reference temperature. A metal of unknown composition can be classified by its thermoelectric effect if a metallic probe of known composition is kept at a constant temperature and held in contact with the unknown sample that is locally heated to the probe temperature. It is used commercially to identify metal alloys. Thermocouples in series form a [[thermopile]].

This is known as the Peltier Effect. The '''Peltier effect''' is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors and is named after French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]], who discovered it in 1834.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peltier|title=Nouvelles exp\u00e9riences sur la caloricit\u00e9 des courants \u00e9lectrique|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1834|volume=56|pages=371\u2013386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA371#v=onepage&q&f=false|trans-title=New experiments on the heat effects of electric currents|language=French}}</ref> When a current is made to flow through a junction between two conductors, A and B, heat may be generated or removed at the junction. The Peltier heat generated at the junction per unit time is\n\n:<math>\\dot{Q} = (\\Pi_\\text{A} - \\Pi_\\text{B}) I,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are the Peltier coefficients of conductors A and B, and <math>I</math> is the electric current (from A to B). The total heat generated is not determined by the Peltier effect alone, as it may also be influenced by Joule heating and thermal-gradient effects (see below).\n\nThe Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. Since charge current must be continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are different. The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the [[Counter-electromotive force|back-EMF]] in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed, then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (by the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction. The close relationship between Peltier and Seebeck effects can be seen in the direct connection between their coefficients: <math>\\Pi = T S</math> (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]).\n\nA typical Peltier [[heat pump]] involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric heat pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do [[thermoelectric cooling]] devices found in refrigerators.\n\n== Thomson effect ==\nIn different materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not constant in temperature, and so a spatial gradient in temperature can result in a gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient, then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur.

The Thomson coefficient is related to the Seebeck coefficient as <math>\\mathcal K = T \\tfrac{dS}{dT}</math> (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]). This equation, however, neglects Joule heating and ordinary thermal conductivity (see full equations below).\n\n== Full thermoelectric equations ==\n\n{{see also|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}\n\nOften, more than one of the above effects is involved in the operation of a real thermoelectric device. The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; this also includes the effects of [[Joule heating]] and ordinary heat conduction. As stated above, the Seebeck effect generates an electromotive force, leading to the current equation<ref name=\"fsu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/nt_pelt.html |title=A.11 Thermoelectric effects |publisher=Eng.fsu.edu |date=2002-02-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf J = \\sigma (-\\boldsymbol \\nabla V - S \\nabla T).</math>\n\nTo describe the Peltier and Thomson effects, we must consider the flow of energy.

The first term is the [[Thermal conduction#Fourier's law|Fourier's heat conduction law]], and the second term shows the energy carried by currents. The third term, <math>\\dot q_\\text{ext}</math>, is the heat added from an external source (if applicable).\n\nIf the material has reached a steady state, the charge and temperature distributions are stable, so <math>\\dot e = 0</math> and <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf J = 0</math>.

Combined with the Seebeck equation for <math>\\mathbf J</math>, this can be used to solve for the steady-state voltage and temperature profiles in a complicated system.\n\nIf the material is not in a steady state, a complete description needs to include dynamic effects such as relating to electrical [[capacitance]], [[inductance]] and [[heat capacity]].\n\n==Thomson relations==\n\n{{see also|Onsager reciprocal relations|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}\n\nIn 1854, Lord Kelvin found relationships between the three coefficients, implying that the Thomson, Peltier, and Seebeck effects are different manifestations of one effect (uniquely characterized by the Seebeck coefficient).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On the dynamical theory of heat. Part V.

This relationship is easily shown given that the Thomson effect is a continuous version of the Peltier effect. Using the second relation (described next), the first Thomson relation becomes <math>\\mathcal K = T \\tfrac{dS}{dT}</math>.\n\nThe second Thomson relation is\n\n:<math>\\Pi = TS.</math>\n\nThis relation expresses a subtle and fundamental connection between the Peltier and Seebeck effects. It was not satisfactorily proven until the advent of the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager relations]], and it is worth noting that this second Thomson relation is only guaranteed for a time-reversal symmetric material; if the material is placed in a magnetic field or is itself magnetically ordered ([[ferromagnetic]], [[antiferromagnetic]], etc.), then the second Thomson relation does not take the simple form shown here.<ref>There is a generalized second Thomson relation relating anisotropic Peltier and Seebeck coefficients with reversed magnetic field and magnetic order.

M. | date = 2010 | publisher = [[CRC Press]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Thomson coefficient is unique among the three main thermoelectric coefficients because it is the only one directly measurable for individual materials. The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients can only be easily determined for pairs of materials; hence, it is difficult to find values of absolute Seebeck or Peltier coefficients for an individual material.\n\nIf the Thomson coefficient of a material is measured over a wide temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and Seebeck coefficients. This needs to be done only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise Seebeck coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the reference material. For more details on absolute Seebeck coefficient determination, see [[Seebeck coefficient]].\n\n==Applications==\n{{see also|Thermoelectric materials}}\n\n===Thermoelectric generators===\n{{main|Thermoelectric generator}}\n\nThe Seebeck effect is used in thermoelectric generators, which function like [[heat engine]]s, but are less bulky, have no moving parts, and are typically more expensive and less efficient. They have a use in power plants for converting [[waste heat]] into additional electrical power (a form of [[energy recycling]]) and in automobiles as [[automotive thermoelectric generator]]s (ATGs) for increasing [[fuel efficiency]]. Space probes often use [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s with the same mechanism but using radioisotopes to generate the required heat difference.

Such refrigerators are useful in applications where their advantages outweigh the disadvantage of their very low efficiency. The Peltier effect is also used by many [[thermal cyclers]], laboratory devices used to amplify DNA by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). PCR requires the cyclic heating and cooling of samples to specified temperatures. The inclusion of many thermocouples in a small space enables many samples to be amplified in parallel.\n\n===Temperature measurement===\n{{Main|Thermocouple}}\n[[Thermocouple]]s and [[thermopile]]s are devices that use the Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two objects.\nThermocouples are often used to measure high temperatures, holding the temperature of one junction constant or measuring it independently ([[thermocouple|cold junction compensation]]). Thermopiles use many thermocouples electrically connected in series, for sensitive measurements of very small temperature difference.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Nernst effect]] \u2013 a thermoelectric phenomenon when a sample allowing electrical conduction in a magnetic field and a temperature gradient normal (perpendicular) to each other\n* [[Ettingshausen effect]] \u2013 thermoelectric phenomenon affecting current in a conductor in a magnetic field\n* [[Pyroelectricity]] \u2013 the creation of an electric polarization in a crystal after heating/cooling, an effect distinct from thermoelectricity\n* [[Thermogalvanic cell]] - the production of electrical power from a galvanic cell with electrodes at different temperatures\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | title=Thermoelectrics Handbook:Macro to Nano|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|date=2006|isbn=0-8493-2264-2|editor=Rowe, D.
