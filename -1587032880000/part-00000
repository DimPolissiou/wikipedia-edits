According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. Relatively to other neighbouring regions, the Plav-Gusinje area in general was densely populated at the end of the 15th century with 15 villages and over a thousand households in total.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that of the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian.

In the early 1960s, a system of legal discrimination, known as [[Jim Crow laws]], were pervasive in the [[Southern United States|American South]], ensuring that African-Americans remained oppressed. They also experienced discrimination from businesses and governments, and in some places were prevented from voting through intimidation and violence.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 31, 34\u201336.</ref> Twenty-one states prohibited [[interracial marriage]].<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 128.</ref>\n\nThe impetus for a march on Washington developed over a long period of time, and earlier efforts to organize such a demonstration included the [[March on Washington Movement]] of the 1940s. [[A. Philip Randolph]]\u2014the president of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], president of the Negro American Labor Council,<ref name=WDL>{{cite web|title=Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Mathew Ahmann, Executive Director of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice, in a Crowd|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2738/|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> and vice president of the [[AFL-CIO]]\u2014was a key instigator in 1941. With [[Bayard Rustin]], Randolph called for 100,000 black workers to march on Washington,<ref name=\"Veterans\"/> in protest of discriminatory hiring by [[List of United States defense contractors|U.S. military contractors]] and demanding an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]].<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 44\u201346.</ref> Faced with a mass march scheduled for July 1, 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

They envisioned several large marches during the 1940s, but all were called off (despite criticism from Rustin).<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 16\u201317.</ref> Their [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]], held at the Lincoln Memorial on May 17, 1957, featured key leaders including [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.|Adam Clayton Powell]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Roy Wilkins]]. [[Mahalia Jackson]] performed.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe 1963 march was an important part of the rapidly expanding [[Civil Rights Movement]], which involved demonstrations and [[nonviolent direct action]] across the United States.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 142. \"In 1963, however, the March on Washington was but one aspect of a national explosion of actions against racial discrimination that many criticized as being outside traditional politics. ... In the South after 1960, the widespread adoption of direct action\u2014purposeful defiance of segregation laws and injunctions against demonstrations\u2014inspired activists and attracted new attention from the media, the federal government, and white segregationists.\"</ref> 1963 also marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Members of The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] put aside their differences and came together for the march. Many whites and blacks also came together in the urgency for change in the nation.\n\nViolent confrontations broke out in the South: in Cambridge, Maryland; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Goldsboro, North Carolina; Somerville, Tennessee; Saint Augustine, Florida; and across Mississippi. Most of these incidents involved white people retaliating against nonviolent demonstrators.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. xvi. \"Violence swept the South all year. Vigilantes in Clarksdale firebombed the home of Aaron Henry, the head of Mississippi's NAACP. After a gas bomb went off in a church in Itta Bena, Mississippi, mobs threw bottles and rocks at activists spilling onto the streets. Vigilantes shot into the home of college professors helping the movement in Jackson. A civil rights worker traveling from Itta Bena to Jackson was shot in the neck and shoulder. A bomb destroyed a two-family home in Jackson. Whites in the North Carolina town of Goldsboro ran down demonstrators in a car and threw bottles and rocks. Whites in Pine Bluff, in Arkansas, attacked civil rights workers with ammonia and bottles. Someone shot into the home of an NAACP board member in Saint Augustine. When nine activists prayed in a country courthouse in Somerville, Tennessee, police allowed hoodlums into the building to beat them up.\"</ref> Many people wanted to march on Washington, but disagreed over how the march should be conducted. Some called for a complete shutdown of the city through [[civil disobedience]]. Others argued that the movement should remain nationwide in scope, rather than focus its energies on the nation's capital.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 2.</ref> There was a widespread perception that the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] had not lived up to its promises in the 1960 election, and King described Kennedy's race policy as \"tokenism\".<ref name=Bartlett />\n\nOn May 24, 1963, Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] invited African-American novelist [[James Baldwin]], along with a large group of cultural leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have an adequate understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which came to be known as the [[Baldwin\u2013Kennedy meeting]], underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 120\u2013121. \"In the TV interview, Baldwin was ashen, disoriented. He had had no idea, before now, just how aloof the Kennedys appeared. He thought the administration's caution came from ruthless political calculation. But now it seemed that the pampered sons of old Joe Kennedy just had no idea\u2014''no understanding at all''\u2014about race in America. The secret meeting was immediately leaked to the press. Within weeks, the velocity of the civil rights movement would lead President [[John F. Kennedy]] to give the most aggressive presidential address in history on race, which was quickly followed with the most comprehensive legislation in modern history.</ref> On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy gave his famous [[Civil Rights Address|civil rights address]] on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation\u2014the law which eventually became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. That night, Mississippi activist [[Medgar Evers]] was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of [[racial inequality in the United States|racial inequality]].<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 67\u201369.</ref>\n\n== Planning and organization ==\n[[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]] began planning the march in December 1961. They envisioned two days of protest, including sit-ins and lobbying followed by a mass rally at the Lincoln Memorial. They wanted to focus on joblessness and to call for a public works program that would employ blacks. In early 1963 they called publicly for \"a massive March on Washington for jobs\".<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 144.</ref> They received help from [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] unionist [[Stanley Aronowitz]], who gathered support from radical organizers who could be trusted not to report their plans to the Kennedy administration. The unionists offered tentative support for a march that would be focused on jobs.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 17. \"By going to the old Communists and socialists, Arnowitz later recalled, Rustin hoped to 'outflank Kennedy's labor connections' and King's moderate, nonviolent SCLC. If Rustin went to Kennedy's backers, they would report to the president. Later, in fact, when United Auto Workers joined the march effort, UAW people fed inside intelligence to the White House. In the earliest planning stages, in 1962, it was better to steer clear of Kennedy's financial and political network.\"</ref>\n\nOn May 15, 1963, without securing the cooperation of the NAACP or the Urban League, Randolph announced an \"October Emancipation March on Washington for Jobs\".<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 20.</ref> He reached out to union leaders, winning the support of the UAW's [[Walter Reuther]], but not of [[AFL\u2013CIO]] president [[George Meany]].<ref name=Euchner21>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 21.</ref> Randolph and Rustin intended to focus the March on economic inequality, stating in their original plan that \"integration in the fields of education, housing, transportation and public accommodations will be of limited extent and duration so long as fundamental economic inequality along racial lines persists.\"<ref>[[David J.

The civil rights activists insisted on holding the march. Wilkins pushed for the organizers to rule out [[civil disobedience]] and described this proposal as the \"perfect compromise\". King and Young agreed. Leaders from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), who wanted to conduct direct actions against the Department of Justice, endorsed the protest before they were informed that civil disobedience would not be allowed. Finalized plans for the March were announced in a press conference on July 2.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> President Kennedy spoke favorably of the March on July 17, saying that organizers planned a peaceful assembly and had cooperated with the Washington, D.C., police.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 149.</ref>[[File:Civil_Rights_March_on_Washington,_D.C._(Leaders_of_the_march_posing_in_front_of_the_statue_of_Abraham_Lincoln..._-_NARA_-_542063.tif|thumb|350x350px|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

Rustin was a long-time associate of both Randolph and Dr. King. With Randolph concentrating on building the march's political coalition, Rustin built and led the team of two hundred activists and organizers who publicized the march and recruited the marchers, coordinated the buses and trains, provided the marshals, and set up and administered all of the logistic details of a mass march in the nation's capital.{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=872}}  During the days leading up to the march, these 200 volunteers used the ballroom of Washington DC radio station [[WUST]] as their operations headquarters.<ref>Euchner, Charles, \"Nobody Turn Me Around: A People's History of the 1963 March on Washington\", 2010.</ref>\n\nThe march was not universally supported among civil rights activists. Some, including Rustin (who assembled 4,000 volunteer marshals from New York), were concerned that it might turn violent, which could undermine pending legislation and damage the international image of the movement.{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=871}} The march was condemned by [[Malcolm X]], spokesperson for the [[Nation of Islam]], who termed it the \"farce on Washington\".{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=874}}\n\nMarch organizers themselves disagreed over the purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League saw it as a gesture of support for a civil rights bill that had been introduced by the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] Administration.

They gathered early this morning [August 27] in Birmingham's [[Kelly Ingram Park]], where state troopers once [four months previous in May] used fire hoses and dog  to put down their demonstrations. It was peaceful in the Birmingham park as the marchers waited for the buses. The police, now part of a moderate city power structure, directed traffic around the square and did not interfere with the gathering ... An old man commented on the 20-hour ride, which was bound to be less than comfortable: \"You forget we Negroes have been riding buses all our lives. We don't have the money to fly in airplanes.\"</blockquote>\n\nJohn Marshall Kilimanjaro, a demonstrator traveling from Greensboro, North Carolina, said:<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 81.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Contrary to the mythology, the early moments of the March\u2014getting there\u2014was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' but for the most part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing. We were secretly praying that nothing violent happened.</blockquote>\n\nOther bus rides featured racial tension, as black activists criticized liberal white participants as fair-weather friends.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 25.</ref>\n\nHazel Mangle Rivers, who had paid $8 for her ticket\u2014\"one-tenth of her husband's weekly salary\"\u2014was quoted in the August 29 ''New York Times''.

Why, when I was out there at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, \"Excuse me,\" and I said \"Certainly!\" That's the first time that has ever happened to me.

Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would need to call greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967\u20131968, he organized a [[Poor People's Campaign]] to occupy the National Mall with a shantytown.<ref name=Barber167>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 176\u2013178.</ref>\n\n===Critics===\n[[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] [[Malcolm X]], in his [[Message to the Grass Roots]] speech, criticized the march, describing it as \"a picnic\" and \"a circus\". He said the civil rights leaders had diluted the original purpose of the march, which had been to show the strength and anger of black people, by allowing white people and organizations to help plan and participate in the march.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Malcolm X |authorlink=Malcolm X |editor=George Breitman |title=Malcolm X Speaks |origyear=1965 |year=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York |isbn=0-8021-3213-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 14\u201317] |url=https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 }}</ref> One SNCC staffer commented during the march, \"He's denouncing us as clowns, but he's right there with the clown show.\"<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 16.</ref> But the membership of SNCC, increasingly frustrated with the tactics of the NAACP and other moderate groups, gradually embraced Malcolm X's position.<ref name=Barber167 />\n\nSegregationists including [[William Jennings Bryan Dorn]] criticized the government for cooperating with the civil rights activists.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 153. \"Segregationists and black nationalists launched scathing criticisms of the Kennedy administration for its support. For rabid segregationist Representative W.J. Bryan Dorn, a Democrat from South Carolina, the absurdity was that 'for the first time in the history of our Nation ... the Federal government has itself encouraged a \"march on Washington.\"'\"</ref> Senator [[Olin D. Johnston]] rejected an invitation to attend, writing: \"You are committing the worst possible mistake in promoting this March. You should know that criminal, fanatical, and communistic elements, as well as crackpots, will move in to take every advantage of this mob. You certainly will have no influence on any member of Congress, including myself.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 95.</ref>\n\n=== Participants ===\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street.) - NARA - 542003.tif|thumb|Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street]]\nMany participants said they felt the March was a historic and life-changing experience. Nan Grogan Orrock, a student at Mary Washington College, said: \"You couldn't help but get swept up in the feeling of the March. It was an incredible experience of this mass of humanity with one mind moving down the street. It was like being part of a glacier. You could feel the sense of collective will and effort in the air.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 142.</ref>  SNCC organizer Bob Zellner reported that the event \"provided dramatic proof that the sometimes quiet and always dangerous work we did in the Deep South had had a profound national impact. The spectacle of a quarter of a million supporters and activists gave me an assurance that the work I was in the process of dedicating my life to was worth doing.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 38.</ref>\n\nRichard Brown, then a white graduate student at Harvard University, recalls that the March fostered direct actions for economic progress: \"Henry Armstrong and I compared notes. I realized the Congress of Racial Equality might help black employment in Boston by urging businesses to hire contractors like Armstrong. He agreed to help start a list of reliable contractors that CORE could promote. It was a modest effort \u2014 but it moved in the right direction.\"<ref>Richard D. Brown, \"[http://articles.courant.com/2013-08-16/news/hc-op-march-on-washington-50-years-ago-20130816_1_washington-monument-henry-armstrong-congress March On Washington Was Day To Remember \u2014 And Relive The Bus, Henry Armstrong \u2014 And The Work Left Undone]\"; ''Hartford Courant'', 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nOther participants, more sympathetic to Malcolm X and the black nationalists, expressed ambivalence. One marcher from New York explained:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It's like [[St Patrick's Day]]. I came out of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the official approval from ''Mastah'' Kennedy, ''Mastah'' Wagner, ''Mastah'' Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march was going to be a mockery, that ''they'' were giving ''us'' something again.</blockquote>\n\nMarcher Beverly Alston thought that the day had its greatest impact within the movement: \"Culturally, there has been tremendous progress over the past forty years. Black awareness and self-determination has soared. Politically, I just don't think we've made enough progress.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 72.</ref> Fifteen-year-old Ericka Jenkins from Washington said:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I saw people laughing and listening and standing very close to one another, almost in an embrace. Children of every size, pregnant women, elderly people who seemed tired but happy to be there, clothing that made me know that they struggled to make it day to day, made me know they worked in farms or offices or even nearby for the government. I didn't see teenagers alone; I saw groups of teenagers with teachers. <br />\nWhite people [were] standing in wonder. Their eyes were open, they were ''listening''. Openness and nothing on guard\u2014I saw that in everybody. I was so happy to see that in the white people that they could listen and take in and respect and believe in the words of a black person. I had never seen anything like that.</blockquote>\n\nSome people discussed racism becoming less explicit after the March. Reverend Abraham Woods of Birmingham commented: \"Everything has changed. And when you look at it, nothing has changed. Racism is under the surface, and an incident that could scratch it, can bring it out.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 101.</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe symbolism of the March has been contested since before it even took place. In the years following the March, movement radicals increasingly subscribed to Malcolm X's narrative of the March as a co-optation by the white establishment. Liberals and conservatives tended to embrace the March, but focused mostly on King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech and the legislative successes of 1964 and 1965.<ref name=JonesDissent>William P.

In the early 1960s, a system of legal discrimination, known as [[Jim Crow laws]], were pervasive in the [[Southern United States|American South]], ensuring that African-Americans remained oppressed. They also experienced discrimination from businesses and governments, and in some places were prevented from voting through intimidation and violence.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 31, 34\u201336.</ref> Twenty-one states prohibited [[interracial marriage]].<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 128.</ref>\n\nThe impetus for a march on Washington developed over a long period of time, and earlier efforts to organize such a demonstration included the [[March on Washington Movement]] of the 1940s. [[A. Philip Randolph]]\u2014the president of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], president of the Negro American Labor Council,<ref name=WDL>{{cite web|title=Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Mathew Ahmann, Executive Director of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice, in a Crowd|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2738/|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> and vice president of the [[AFL-CIO]]\u2014was a key instigator in 1941. With [[Bayard Rustin]], Randolph called for 100,000 black workers to march on Washington,<ref name=\"Veterans\"/> in protest of discriminatory hiring by [[List of United States defense contractors|U.S. military contractors]] and demanding an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]].<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 44\u201346.</ref> Faced with a mass march scheduled for July 1, 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 8802]] on June 25.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 49\u201351.</ref> The order established the [[Committee on Fair Employment Practice]] and banned discriminatory hiring in the defense industry.<ref>Neil A.

They envisioned several large marches during the 1940s, but all were called off (despite criticism from Rustin).<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 16\u201317.</ref> Their [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]], held at the Lincoln Memorial on May 17, 1957, featured key leaders including [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.|Adam Clayton Powell]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Roy Wilkins]]. [[Mahalia Jackson]] performed.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe 1963 march was an important part of the rapidly expanding [[Civil Rights Movement]], which involved demonstrations and [[nonviolent direct action]] across the United States.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 142. \"In 1963, however, the March on Washington was but one aspect of a national explosion of actions against racial discrimination that many criticized as being outside traditional politics. ... In the South after 1960, the widespread adoption of direct action\u2014purposeful defiance of segregation laws and injunctions against demonstrations\u2014inspired activists and attracted new attention from the media, the federal government, and white segregationists.\"</ref> 1963 also marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Members of The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] put aside their differences and came together for the march. Many whites and blacks also came together in the urgency for change in the nation.\n\nViolent confrontations broke out in the South: in Cambridge, Maryland; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Goldsboro, North Carolina; Somerville, Tennessee; Saint Augustine, Florida; and across Mississippi. Most of these incidents involved white people retaliating against nonviolent demonstrators.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. xvi. \"Violence swept the South all year. Vigilantes in Clarksdale firebombed the home of Aaron Henry, the head of Mississippi's NAACP. After a gas bomb went off in a church in Itta Bena, Mississippi, mobs threw bottles and rocks at activists spilling onto the streets. Vigilantes shot into the home of college professors helping the movement in Jackson. A civil rights worker traveling from Itta Bena to Jackson was shot in the neck and shoulder. A bomb destroyed a two-family home in Jackson. Whites in the North Carolina town of Goldsboro ran down demonstrators in a car and threw bottles and rocks. Whites in Pine Bluff, in Arkansas, attacked civil rights workers with ammonia and bottles. Someone shot into the home of an NAACP board member in Saint Augustine. When nine activists prayed in a country courthouse in Somerville, Tennessee, police allowed hoodlums into the building to beat them up.\"</ref> Many people wanted to march on Washington, but disagreed over how the march should be conducted. Some called for a complete shutdown of the city through [[civil disobedience]]. Others argued that the movement should remain nationwide in scope, rather than focus its energies on the nation's capital.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 2.</ref> There was a widespread perception that the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] had not lived up to its promises in the 1960 election, and King described Kennedy's race policy as \"tokenism\".<ref name=Bartlett />\n\nOn May 24, 1963, Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] invited African-American novelist [[James Baldwin]], along with a large group of cultural leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have an adequate understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which came to be known as the [[Baldwin\u2013Kennedy meeting]], underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 120\u2013121. \"In the TV interview, Baldwin was ashen, disoriented. He had had no idea, before now, just how aloof the Kennedys appeared. He thought the administration's caution came from ruthless political calculation. But now it seemed that the pampered sons of old Joe Kennedy just had no idea\u2014''no understanding at all''\u2014about race in America. The secret meeting was immediately leaked to the press. Within weeks, the velocity of the civil rights movement would lead President [[John F. Kennedy]] to give the most aggressive presidential address in history on race, which was quickly followed with the most comprehensive legislation in modern history.</ref> On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy gave his famous [[Civil Rights Address|civil rights address]] on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation\u2014the law which eventually became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. That night, Mississippi activist [[Medgar Evers]] was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of [[racial inequality in the United States|racial inequality]].<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), pp. 67\u201369.</ref>\n\n== Planning and organization ==\n[[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]] began planning the march in December 1961. They envisioned two days of protest, including sit-ins and lobbying followed by a mass rally at the Lincoln Memorial. They wanted to focus on joblessness and to call for a public works program that would employ blacks. In early 1963 they called publicly for \"a massive March on Washington for jobs\".<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 144.</ref> They received help from [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]] unionist [[Stanley Aronowitz]], who gathered support from radical organizers who could be trusted not to report their plans to the Kennedy administration. The unionists offered tentative support for a march that would be focused on jobs.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 17. \"By going to the old Communists and socialists, Arnowitz later recalled, Rustin hoped to 'outflank Kennedy's labor connections' and King's moderate, nonviolent SCLC. If Rustin went to Kennedy's backers, they would report to the president. Later, in fact, when United Auto Workers joined the march effort, UAW people fed inside intelligence to the White House. In the earliest planning stages, in 1962, it was better to steer clear of Kennedy's financial and political network.\"</ref>\n\nOn May 15, 1963, without securing the cooperation of the NAACP or the Urban League, Randolph announced an \"October Emancipation March on Washington for Jobs\".<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 20.</ref> He reached out to union leaders, winning the support of the UAW's [[Walter Reuther]], but not of [[AFL\u2013CIO]] president [[George Meany]].<ref name=Euchner21>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 21.</ref> Randolph and Rustin intended to focus the March on economic inequality, stating in their original plan that \"integration in the fields of education, housing, transportation and public accommodations will be of limited extent and duration so long as fundamental economic inequality along racial lines persists.\"<ref>[[David J.

King and Young agreed. Leaders from the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), who wanted to conduct direct actions against the Department of Justice, endorsed the protest before they were informed that civil disobedience would not be allowed.

Rustin was a long-time associate of both Randolph and Dr. King. With Randolph concentrating on building the march's political coalition, Rustin built and led the team of two hundred activists and organizers who publicized the march and recruited the marchers, coordinated the buses and trains, provided the marshals, and set up and administered all of the logistic details of a mass march in the nation's capital.{{sfn|Branch|1988|p=872}}  During the days leading up to the march, these 200 volunteers used the ballroom of Washington DC radio station [[WUST]] as their operations headquarters.<ref>Euchner, Charles, \"Nobody Turn Me Around: A People's History of the 1963 March on Washington\", 2010.</ref>\n\nThe march was not universally supported among civil rights activists.

The NAACP and Urban League saw it as a gesture of support for a civil rights bill that had been introduced by the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] Administration. Randolph, King, and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) saw it as a way of raising both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill.

They gathered early this morning [August 27] in Birmingham's [[Kelly Ingram Park]], where state troopers once [four months previous in May] used fire hoses and dog  to put down their demonstrations. It was peaceful in the Birmingham park as the marchers waited for the buses. The police, now part of a moderate city power structure, directed traffic around the square and did not interfere with the gathering ... An old man commented on the 20-hour ride, which was bound to be less than comfortable: \"You forget we Negroes have been riding buses all our lives.

Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' but for the most part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing.

Why, when I was out there at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, \"Excuse me,\" and I said \"Certainly!\" That's the first time that has ever happened to me.

A tribute to \"Negro Women Fighters for Freedom\" was then led by [[Bayard Rustin]], at which [[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)|Daisy Bates]] spoke briefly in place of [[Myrlie Evers]], who had missed her flight.<ref name=\"alternet.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.alternet.org/activism/civil-rights-leader-gloria-richardson-reflects-1963-march-washington|title=Civil Rights Leader Gloria Richardson Reflects on the 1963 March on Washington|first=Amy|last=Goodman|date=28 August 2013|publisher=|via=AlterNet}}</ref><ref name=\"motherjones.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/slideshows/2013/08/50th-anniversary-march-washington/protestors-march-washington-1|title=Photos: The Women of the March on Washington|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/28/us/mlk-i-have-a-dream-9-things/index.html | work=CNN | title=9 things about Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech, March on Washington - CNN.com | date=August 28, 2013}}</ref> The tribute introduced [[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)|Daisy Bates]], [[Diane Nash]], [[Prince E. Lee]], [[Rosa Parks]], and [[Gloria Richardson]]. The following speakers were SNCC chairman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], labor leader [[Walter Reuther]] and CORE chairman [[Floyd McKissick]] (substituting for arrested CORE director [[James Farmer]]). The Eva Jessye Choir then sang, and Rabbi Uri Miller (president of the Synagogue Council of America) offered a prayer, followed by National Urban League director [[Whitney Young]], NCCIJ director [[Mathew Ahmann]], and NAACP leader [[Roy Wilkins]]. After a performance by singer [[Mahalia Jackson]], American Jewish Congress president [[Joachim Prinz]] spoke, followed by SCLC president [[Martin Luther King Jr]]. Rustin then read the march's official demands for the crowd's approval, and Randolph led the crowd in a pledge to continue working for the march's goals. The program was closed with a benediction by Morehouse College president [[Benjamin Mays]].\n\nAlthough one of the officially stated purposes of the march was to support the civil rights bill introduced by the Kennedy Administration, several of the speakers criticized the proposed law as insufficient. Two government agents stood by in a position to cut power to the microphone if necessary.<ref>Garrow, ''Bearing the Cross'' (1986), p. 283. \"Two Kennedy aides stood ready to 'pull the plug' on the public address system in case anything went amiss.\"</ref>\n\n=== Roy Wilkins ===\nRoy Wilkins announced that [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] had died in Ghana the previous night; the crowd observed a moment of silence in his memory.<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 122.</ref> Wilkins had initially refused to announce the news because he despised Du Bois as a Communist\u2014but then insisted on making the announcement when he realized that Randolph would make it if he didn't.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 180\u2013181.</ref> Wilkins said: \"Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that at the dawn of the twentieth century his was the voice that was calling you to gather here today in this cause.

That night, O'Boyle and other members of the Catholic delegation began preparing a statement announcing their withdrawal from the March. Reuther convinced them to wait and called Rustin; Rustin informed Lewis at 2 A.M. on the day of the march that his speech was unacceptable to key coalition members. (Rustin also reportedly contacted [[Tom Kahn]], mistakenly believing that Kahn had edited the speech and inserted the line about [[Sherman's March to the Sea]].  Rustin asked, \"How could you do this? Do you know what Sherman ''did''?) But Lewis did not want to change the speech. Other members of SNCC, including [[Stokely Carmichael]], were also adamant that the speech not be censored.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 45\u201349.</ref> The dispute continued until minutes before talks were scheduled to begin. Under threat of public denouncement by the religious leaders, and under pressure from the rest of his coalition, Lewis agreed to omit the 'inflammatory' passages.<ref>Garrow, ''Bearing the Cross'' (1986), pp. 282\u2013283. \"With the program only minutes away, the leadership arrived at the Lincoln Memorial with the controversy over Lewis's text still unresolved. Rustin promised O'Boyle that the necessary changes would be made, and the cardinal agreed to appear on the platform and deliver the invocation, so long as he was handed a copy of the revised Lewis text at least ten minutes before the SNCC chairman's appearance. O'Boyle told Rustin that if it were unsatisfactory, or if Lewis delivered the original draft, he and other religious leaders would get up and leave.\"</ref> Many activists from SNCC, CORE, and even SCLC were angry at what they considered censorship of his speech.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Carson | first = Clayborne | title = In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 1981}}</ref> In the end, Lewis added a qualified endorsement of Kennedy's civil rights legislation, saying: \"It is true that we support the administration's Civil Rights Bill. We support it with great reservation, however.\"<ref name=\"JonesDissent\" /> Even after toning down his speech, Lewis called for activists to \"get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes\".<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 169\u2013170.</ref>[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivering his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech]]\n\n===Martin Luther King Jr.===\n{{Main|I Have a Dream}}\nThe speech given by SCLC president King, who spoke last, became known as the \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, which was carried live by TV stations and subsequently considered the most impressive moment of the march.<ref>Hansen, D.

He said,\n\n<blockquote>American democracy is on trial in the eyes of the world ... We cannot successfully preach democracy in the world unless we first practice democracy at home. American democracy will lack the moral credentials and be both unequal to and unworthy of leading the forces of freedom against the forces of tyranny unless we take bold, affirmative, adequate steps to bridge the moral gap between American democracy's noble promises and its ugly practices in the field of civil rights.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/content/meet-the-march-organizers/9/|title=Meet the 1963 March on Washington Organizers {{!}} BillMoyers.com|work=BillMoyers.com|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Irving Bluestone]], who was standing near the platform while Reuther delivered his remarks, he overheard two black women talking.

What struck me most horribly was that virtually no one in power (including some blacks or Negroes who were somewhere next door to power) was able, even remotely, to accept the depth, the dimension, of the passion and the faith of the people.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Actor Lena Horne, a close-up view.) - NARA - 542057.tif|thumb|right|Actress/singer [[Lena Horne]] was present but excluded from speaking. ]]\nDespite the protests of organizer [[Anna Arnold Hedgeman]], no women gave a speech at the March. Male organizers attributed this omission to the \"difficulty of finding a single woman to speak without causing serious problems vis-\u00e0-vis other women and women's groups\".<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 158.</ref> Hedgeman read a statement at an August 16 meeting, charging:\n\n<blockquote>In light of the role of Negro women in the struggle for freedom and especially in light of the extra burden they have carried because of the castration of our Negro men in this culture, it is incredible that no woman should appear as a speaker at the historic March on Washington Meeting at the Lincoln Memorial. . .</blockquote>\n\nThe assembled group agreed that [[Myrlie Evers]], the new widow of Medgar Evers, could speak during the \"Tribute to Women\".

This position was eliminated, furthering criticism of the March's middle-class bias.<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 159.</ref>\n\n==Singers==\nGospel legend [[Mahalia Jackson]] sang \"[[How I Got Over]]\", and [[Marian Anderson]] sang \"[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]\". This was not Marian Anderson's first appearance at the Lincoln Memorial. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[Constitution Hall]].  With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on [[Easter]] Sunday, 1939, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Joan Baez]] and [[Bob Dylan]] performing at the March on Washington]]\n[[Joan Baez]] led the crowds in several verses of \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\" and \"[[Oh Freedom]]\". Musician [[Bob Dylan]] performed \"[[When the Ship Comes In]]\", for which he was joined by Baez. Dylan also performed \"[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]\", a provocative and not completely popular choice because it asserted that [[Byron De La Beckwith]], as a poor white man, was not personally or primarily to blame for the murder of Medgar Evers.<ref>Jones, ''March on Washington'' (2013), p.

[[Josephine Baker]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[James Baldwin]], [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Diahann Carroll]], and [[Lena Horne]] were among the black celebrities attending. There were also quite a few white and Latino celebrities who attended the march in support of the cause: [[Judy Garland]], [[James Garner]], [[Robert Ryan]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Joanne Woodward]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Burt Lancaster]], among others.<ref name = \"post1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/celebrities-who-joined-the-march-on-washington/2013/08/19/ed761f1a-005a-11e3-9711-3708310f6f4d_gallery.html|title=Celebrities Who Joined the March on Washington |website=washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-22}}</ref><ref name = \"realclear\">{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/08/29/hollywood_whos_who_marched_with_king_in_63__119762.html |title=Hollywood Who's Who Marched with King in '63 |website=realclearpolitics.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-22}}</ref>\n\n== Meeting with President Kennedy ==\n[[File:JFK meets with leaders of March on Washington 8-28-63.JPG|thumb|Kennedy meets with march leaders]]\n\nAfter the March, the speakers travelled to the White House for a brief discussion of proposed civil rights legislation with President Kennedy.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 172.</ref> Kennedy had watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. According to biographer [[Thomas C. Reeves]], Kennedy \"felt that he would be booed at the March, and also didn't want to meet with organizers before the March because he didn't want a list of demands. He arranged a 5 P.M. meeting at the White House with the 10 leaders on the 28th.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 94.</ref> The March was considered a \"triumph of managed protest\" and Kennedy felt it was a victory for him as well\u2014bolstering the chances for his [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights bill]].<ref>Reeves, Richard, ''President Kennedy: Profile of Power'' (1993) pp. 580\u2013584</ref>\n\n==Media coverage==\n[[File:The March (1964 film).webm|thumb|''[[The March (1964 film)|The March]]'', a documentary film produced by the [[United States Information Agency]].

In his section ''The March on Washington and Television News'', William Thomas notes: \"Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://southernspaces.org/2004/television-news-and-civil-rights-struggle-views-virginia-and-mississippi#section6|title=Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle: The Views in Virginia and Mississippi|first=Thomas, William|last=G|date=28 August 2018|publisher=|volume=2004}}</ref> The major networks broadcast some of the March live, though they interspersed footage of interviews with politicians. Subsequent broadcasts focused heavily on the \"I have a dream\" portion of King's speech.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 175.</ref>\n\nThe [[Voice of America]] translated the speeches and rebroadcast them in 36 languages. The [[United States Information Agency]] organized a press conference for the benefit of foreign journalists, and also created a documentary film of the event for distribution to embassies abroad.<ref name=Barber151 /> Commented Michael Thelwell of SNCC: \"So it happened that Negro students from the South, some of whom still had unhealed bruises from the electric cattle prods which Southern police used to break up demonstrations, were recorded for the screens of the world portraying 'American Democracy at Work.'\"<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), p. 70.</ref>\n\n==Responses and memories==\n\n=== Organizers ===\nAlthough the mass media generally declared the March successful because of its high turnout, organizers were not confident that it would create change. Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would need to call greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967\u20131968, he organized a [[Poor People's Campaign]] to occupy the National Mall with a shantytown.<ref name=Barber167>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), pp. 176\u2013178.</ref>\n\n===Critics===\n[[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] [[Malcolm X]], in his [[Message to the Grass Roots]] speech, criticized the march, describing it as \"a picnic\" and \"a circus\". He said the civil rights leaders had diluted the original purpose of the march, which had been to show the strength and anger of black people, by allowing white people and organizations to help plan and participate in the march.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Malcolm X |authorlink=Malcolm X |editor=George Breitman |title=Malcolm X Speaks |origyear=1965 |year=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York |isbn=0-8021-3213-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 14\u201317] |url=https://archive.org/details/malcolmxspeaksse00xmal/page/14 }}</ref> One SNCC staffer commented during the march, \"He's denouncing us as clowns, but he's right there with the clown show.\"<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 16.</ref> But the membership of SNCC, increasingly frustrated with the tactics of the NAACP and other moderate groups, gradually embraced Malcolm X's position.<ref name=Barber167 />\n\nSegregationists including [[William Jennings Bryan Dorn]] criticized the government for cooperating with the civil rights activists.<ref>Barber, ''Marching on Washington'' (2002), p. 153. \"Segregationists and black nationalists launched scathing criticisms of the Kennedy administration for its support. For rabid segregationist Representative W.J. Bryan Dorn, a Democrat from South Carolina, the absurdity was that 'for the first time in the history of our Nation ... the Federal government has itself encouraged a \"march on Washington.\"'\"</ref> Senator [[Olin D. Johnston]] rejected an invitation to attend, writing: \"You are committing the worst possible mistake in promoting this March. You should know that criminal, fanatical, and communistic elements, as well as crackpots, will move in to take every advantage of this mob. You certainly will have no influence on any member of Congress, including myself.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 95.</ref>\n\n=== Participants ===\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street.) - NARA - 542003.tif|thumb|Leaders of the march leading marchers down the street]]\nMany participants said they felt the March was a historic and life-changing experience. Nan Grogan Orrock, a student at Mary Washington College, said: \"You couldn't help but get swept up in the feeling of the March. It was an incredible experience of this mass of humanity with one mind moving down the street. It was like being part of a glacier. You could feel the sense of collective will and effort in the air.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 142.</ref>  SNCC organizer Bob Zellner reported that the event \"provided dramatic proof that the sometimes quiet and always dangerous work we did in the Deep South had had a profound national impact. The spectacle of a quarter of a million supporters and activists gave me an assurance that the work I was in the process of dedicating my life to was worth doing.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 38.</ref>\n\nRichard Brown, then a white graduate student at Harvard University, recalls that the March fostered direct actions for economic progress: \"Henry Armstrong and I compared notes. I realized the Congress of Racial Equality might help black employment in Boston by urging businesses to hire contractors like Armstrong. He agreed to help start a list of reliable contractors that CORE could promote. It was a modest effort \u2014 but it moved in the right direction.\"<ref>Richard D. Brown, \"[http://articles.courant.com/2013-08-16/news/hc-op-march-on-washington-50-years-ago-20130816_1_washington-monument-henry-armstrong-congress March On Washington Was Day To Remember \u2014 And Relive The Bus, Henry Armstrong \u2014 And The Work Left Undone]\"; ''Hartford Courant'', 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nOther participants, more sympathetic to Malcolm X and the black nationalists, expressed ambivalence. One marcher from New York explained:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It's like [[St Patrick's Day]]. I came out of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the official approval from ''Mastah'' Kennedy, ''Mastah'' Wagner, ''Mastah'' Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march was going to be a mockery, that ''they'' were giving ''us'' something again.</blockquote>\n\nMarcher Beverly Alston thought that the day had its greatest impact within the movement: \"Culturally, there has been tremendous progress over the past forty years. Black awareness and self-determination has soared. Politically, I just don't think we've made enough progress.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 72.</ref> Fifteen-year-old Ericka Jenkins from Washington said:<ref>Euchner, ''Nobody Turn Me Around'' (2010), pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I saw people laughing and listening and standing very close to one another, almost in an embrace. Children of every size, pregnant women, elderly people who seemed tired but happy to be there, clothing that made me know that they struggled to make it day to day, made me know they worked in farms or offices or even nearby for the government. I didn't see teenagers alone; I saw groups of teenagers with teachers. <br />\nWhite people [were] standing in wonder. Their eyes were open, they were ''listening''. Openness and nothing on guard\u2014I saw that in everybody. I was so happy to see that in the white people that they could listen and take in and respect and believe in the words of a black person. I had never seen anything like that.</blockquote>\n\nSome people discussed racism becoming less explicit after the March. Reverend Abraham Woods of Birmingham commented: \"Everything has changed. And when you look at it, nothing has changed. Racism is under the surface, and an incident that could scratch it, can bring it out.\"<ref>Bass, ''Like a Mighty Stream'' (2002), p. 101.</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe symbolism of the March has been contested since before it even took place. In the years following the March, movement radicals increasingly subscribed to Malcolm X's narrative of the March as a co-optation by the white establishment. Liberals and conservatives tended to embrace the March, but focused mostly on King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech and the legislative successes of 1964 and 1965.<ref name=JonesDissent>William P.

An example for this is the salt flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in [[Saudi Arabia]]. These salt flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.<ref>[http://www.prototype-creation.de/rethinking_landscapes.pdf Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-Andr\u00e9 Berdell\u00e9 July 2011] H2O magazine</ref>\n\n[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing [[soil water]] [[Water content|retention]] and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank's BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest \u2014 A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change \u2013 Water Matters \u2013 State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>\n\n===Managed grazing===\nRestoring grasslands store CO<sub>2</sub> from the air as plant material.

Fixating the soil is often done through the use of [[windbreak|shelter belts]], [[woodlot]]s and [[windbreak]]s. Windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. They were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].\n\nSome soils (for example, [[clay]]), due to lack of water can become [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] rather than porous (as in the case of [[sandy soil]]s). Some techniques as [[za\u00ef]] or [[tillage]] are then used to still allow the planting of crops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text.html|title=Our Good Earth \u2013 National Geographic Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref> Waffle gardens can also help as they can provide protection of the plants against wind/sandblasting, and increase the hours of shade falling on the plant.<ref>[https://lifehacker.com/grow-vegetables-in-the-desert-with-a-waffle-garden-1784769118 Grow Vegetables in the Desert With a 'Waffle Garden']</ref>\n\nAnother technique that is useful is [[contour trenching]]. This involves the digging of 150&nbsp;m long, 1&nbsp;m deep trenches in the soil. The trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within the trenches and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nagafoundation.org/|title=Home \u2013 Justdiggit|accessdate=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402205707/https://nagafoundation.org/|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEnriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often achieved by plants. Of these, [[legume|leguminous plants]] which extract [[nitrogen]] from the air and fix it in the soil, [[succulents]] (such as [[Opuntia]]),<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265346914_Cactus_as_a_tool_to_mitigate_drought_and_to_combat_Desertification Cactus as a tool to mitigate drought and to combat Desertification]</ref> and food crops/trees as [[grain]]s, [[barley]], [[beans]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s are the most important. [[Sand fence]]s can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion.<ref>[http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ List of plants to halt desertification; some of which may be soil-fixating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201080944/http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ |date=2011-02-01 }}</ref>\n\nAnother way to restore soil fertility is through the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Due to the higher cost of this fertilizer, many [[smallholding|smallholder]] farmers are reluctant to use it, especially in areas where [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] is common.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krah |first1=Kwabena |last2=Michelson |first2=Hope |last3=Perge |first3=Emilie |last4=Jindal |first4=Rohit |title=Constraints to adopting soil fertility management practices in Malawi: A choice experiment approach |journal=World Development |volume=124 |pages=104651 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104651 |date=1 December 2019}}</ref> Several nations, including India, Zambia, and Malawi have responded to this by implementing [[subsidization|subsidies]] to help encourage adoption of this technique.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duflo |first1=Esther |last2=Kremer |first2=Michael |last3=Robinson |first3=Jonathan |title=Nudging Farmers to Use Fertilizer: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Kenya |journal=American Economic Review |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=2350\u20132390 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.6.2350 |date=October 2011|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w15131.pdf }}</ref>\n\nSome research centres (such as Bel-Air Research Center IRD/ISRA/UCAD) are also experimenting with the inoculation of tree species with [[mycorrhiza]] in arid zones. The mycorrhiza are basically fungi attaching themselves to the roots of the plants. They hereby create a symbiotic relation with the trees, increasing the surface area of the tree's roots greatly (allowing the tree to gather much more nutrient from the soil).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://196.1.95.4/fst/biologie-vegetale/labo_commun.htm|title=D\u00e9partement Biologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tale \u2013 Laboratoire Commun de Microbiologie IRD-ISRA-UCAD|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs there are many different types of deserts, there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies. An example for this is the salt flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in [[Saudi Arabia]]. These salt flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.<ref>[http://www.prototype-creation.de/rethinking_landscapes.pdf Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-Andr\u00e9 Berdell\u00e9 July 2011] H2O magazine</ref>\n\n[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing [[soil water]] [[Water content|retention]] and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank's BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest \u2014 A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change \u2013 Water Matters \u2013 State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>\n\n===Managed grazing===\nRestoring grasslands store CO<sub>2</sub> from the air as plant material.
