The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] (\"Hill of the Angels\"), a site traditionally considered to be the geographical center of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], also lies within the municipal limits.<ref name=\"cerro\">{{cite web |url= http://www.cerrodelosangeles.es/|title= Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles (Official website)|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=es}}</ref> Getafe is located 13&nbsp;km south of [[Madrid]]'s city centre, within a flat area of Spain's [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]] in the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares River]] basin.\n\nGetafe's proximity to central Madrid fostered industrial development during the 20th and 21st centuries. The city's industrialisation in turn led to an increase in population, reaching 170,115 in 2011. Due to its industrial and social networks, the majority of residents work or study within the city. Getafe hosts an [[Airbus]] factory. The increase in population led to the construction of numerous access roads, an increase in available public services, and the creation of new neighborhoods at the end of the 20th century.\n\n== Etymology ==\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], a number of villages were located in the present-day area of Getafe. One of the main villages was Alarnes, which was very close to the current urban center. In 1326, the villagers united themselves into one town, situated on the royal road that linked Madrid with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. This new town was called ''Xatafi,'' a name which came from the Arab word ''jata'' (\"something long\"). It is assumed that the name ''Xatafi'' referred to the royal road, which also served as the town's main street. The town's name evolved over time, from ''Xetafe'' to ''Jetafee'' to ''Jetaphe'' to ''Jetafe'' to ''Getafe.''\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Vista de Getafe (1878).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Engraving]] of Getafe from the 19th century.]]\nThe history of Getafe can be split into three clearly defined eras. In the first era, which lasted from Prehistory until 1326, there existed distinct villages in the area, though Getafe itself did not exist as a municipality. The second era lasted from the 14th century until the 20th century, during which Getafe was established as a town and developed slowly. In the third era, which began in the 20th century and continues to the present day, Getafe changed in nature from a small agricultural town to a large industrial city, with a noticeable increase in commerce, industry, population and size.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |title=Historia de Getafe |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303230826/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Villa-romana-getafe.JPG|thumb|230px|Ruins of the Roman villa of La Torrecilla.]]\nThe presence of humans in the area of Getafe dates back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period (before 100,000 BCE). Various [[stone tools]], pots, and bracelets from this period have been excavated from the banks of the Manzanares River.\n\nThe Romans dominated the Iberian Peninsula from the 2nd century BCE until the 5th century AD. In the 3rd century AD, the Romans constructed a villa called La Torecilla, whose ruins are still visible on the banks of the Manzanares River. The area was subsequently overrun by a series of [[Germanic tribes]], including [[Suebi]], [[Vandals]] and [[Visigoths]], and the Indoeuropean [[Alans]].\n\nThe area currently encompassed by the Getafe municipal district was invaded by the [[Moors]] in the 8th century. King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] conquered the villages of the area in 1085. In 1326, the inhabitants of the villages moved closer to the royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo, in effect creating a new town, Getafe. In that same century, the primitive hermitage of La Magdalena was built, only to be destroyed several centuries later.\n\n=== Contemporary age ===\n[[File:Getafe-sigloxvii.JPG|thumb|190px|left|Map of 17th century Getafe.]]\nIn 1492, famine and disease devastated Getafe, prompting the construction of the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 in 1529. In 1549, the architect [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] began building the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Magdalena, which has since become the Cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Getafe|Diocese of Getafe]]. The church was built on the foundation of the old hermitage, and in 1610 a new hermitage was built on the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. The college of the Escuelas P\u00edas was founded in 1737. In 1763, King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered the construction of a new road connecting Madrid to [[Aranjuez]] and, further on, to [[C\u00e1diz]], which passed along the foot of the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. Napoleonic troops occupied Getafe from 1808 to 1812. A train line connecting Madrid to Aranjuez, and passing through Getafe, was inaugurated in 1851.\n\n=== Modern age ===\n[[File:Gran-teatro-getafe.JPG|thumb|165px|Getafe's Gran Teatro (''Great Theater'') at the end of the 19th century.]]\nElectric street lights were lit for the first time in Getafe on 22 December 1897. The Getafe Air Force Base was permanently established in 1911, followed by the School of Civil Aviation two years later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] inaugurated the first monument to the [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus on the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] on 30 May 1919. In 1924, [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas S.A.]] built its first factory in the area. That same year, [[Juan de la Cierva]]'s [[autogyro]] was flown for the first time from the air force base.\n\nDue to its proximity to Madrid, Getafe underwent an industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in the city's conversion from agricultural city to industrial city. Industrialization also prompted a rapid boom in population, starting in the 1950s. In 1956, [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] established a factory in Getafe, and a year later, [[Siemens AG]] followed suit. The city was forced to create the neighborhoods of San Isidro, El Bercial, Juan de la Cierva, and [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]] in the 1970s in order to support these new industries.\n\nIn 1961, the [[Canal de Isabel II]] began to provide water to Getafe. The first local democratic elections occurred in 1979, after the ratification of the Constitution in 1978. In 1989, the [[Universidad Carlos III]] was founded. The Sector III neighbourhood was constructed between 1979 and 1988; the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built during the late 1990s; the El Bercial neighbourhood is currently being expanded. In April 2003, Madrid Metro System's [[Line 12 (Madrid Metro)|Line 12]] opened, linking the Madrid region's southern population centres with the capital.\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Getafe is divided vertically into two equal halves that represent the two most important characteristics of the municipal district. The left half contains a heart in the center of a [[Latin cross]], representing the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]\u2014a reference to the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]]. The right half contains a repeated pattern of airplanes representing the aeronautical tradition of the area and referencing the nearby Air Force Base. The [[Royal Spanish Crown]] tops the coat of arms, and symbolizes Getafe's loyalty to the Spanish monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |title=Getafe es As\u00ed |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055541/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n== Politics and government ==\nThe current mayor of Getafe is Sara Hern\u00e1ndez Barroso, socialist, thanks to the support of left wing group [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU) and a political platform close to [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] called 'Ahora Getafe'. In 2011, Juan Soler-Espiauba Gallo, of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), was elected mayor and displaced the incumbent, a socialist, who had held this post since 1983. The most popular political parties in the area, other than the PSOE, are the [[People's Party (Spain)|Peoples' Party]] (PP) and the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU). Getafe has always had a large working population, and left-wing groups, especially the PSOE, have traditionally been very influential.\n\nIn the [[Spanish regional elections, 2007|2007 Spanish regional elections]], the PSOE elected 13 town councillors (44.18% of the vote), PP, 11 (36.09%), and IU 3, (11.73%).<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ Resultados de las elecciones municipales de 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531083056/http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ |date=2007-05-31 }}</ref> Other political associations were not able to muster enough votes to receive representation. Local elections occur every four years, along with the autonomous election. \n\nIn the last Spanish General elections celebrated in 2015, PP obtained 25,65% of the vote, very close to Podemos (24,72%) and PSOE (22,60%). Ciudadanos obtained 16,54% of the vote and IU 7,07%.\n\nCabinet meetings are composed of nine councillors: eight from the PSOE and one from IU. The Municipal Corporation is made up of 27 members, detailed previously. The cabinet is presided over by the mayor. The Getafe city council is divided into a number of different focus groups: treasury, wealth, and social security; equality; urbanism; civil action; and management of waste disposal, cleanliness, the environment, and the home. The council holds sessions every month, in addition to frequently held special sessions, in which councillors debate various topics and problems which affect the municipality.\n\nGetafe is at the forefront of the struggle for workers rights in local industry. The most important trade unions in the city are the [[Workers' Commissions]] (CCOO) and the [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] (UGT). Both unions have branch offices in Getafe and list many local workers as members.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Physical location ===\n[[File:Cerro-buenavista.JPG|thumb|220px|Cerro Buenavista, or ''Buenavista hill'', the area of highest elevation in the Getafe municipality at 704 meters (2309 ft).

It is physically located in the centre of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], north of the Southern Submeseta (part of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]]), in the Manzanares River basin. Its elevation is 610 \u2013 640 meters above sea level (2000\u20132100&nbsp;feet). Its coordinates are 40\u00b0 18' N 3\u00b0 43' W. The municipal district is 78.74&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with a perimeter of 46.5&nbsp;km. The easternmost part of the municipal district is located within the [[Parque Regional del Sureste]], a protected forest region.\n\n==== Distances ====\nDue to its central location within the Iberian Peninsula, Getafe is no more than 725.6&nbsp;km from any Spanish provincial capital in mainland Spain. The following are the distances to a few major cities, the oceans which surround the Spanish coasts, and the national borders of Portugal and France.\n<center>\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|\n*[[Puerta del Sol]] of [[Madrid]]: 13&nbsp;km\n*[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]: 59&nbsp;km (capital of the nearest [[Provinces of Spain|province]] other than Madrid)\n*[[Girona]]: 725,6&nbsp;km (capital of the furthest province on the mainland)\n*Center of [[Legan\u00e9s]] (adjacent municipality): 4,3&nbsp;km\n*[[Fuenlabrada]] (adjacent municipality): 7,5&nbsp;km\n*[[Parla]] (adjacent municipality): 8&nbsp;km\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n*[[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]): 348&nbsp;km\n*[[Bay of Biscay]] ([[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]): 398&nbsp;km\n*[[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[C\u00e1diz]]): 640&nbsp;km\n*[[Portugal|Portuguese]] Border: 402&nbsp;km\n*[[Francia|French]] Border: 510&nbsp;km\n|}</center>\n\n=== Relief ===\n[[File:Manzanares-rio.JPG|thumb|205px|left|The bank of the Manzanares River. This is the area with the lowest elevation in the province of Madrid (540 m; 1772 ft).]]\nThe municipal district is mostly flat, with a minor inclination of 5% to the east and an elevation of 631&nbsp;m (2070&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The lowest altitude can be found to the extreme east, at the Manzanares River at 540&nbsp;m (1772&nbsp;ft). The highest elevation is found on the extreme west, on Buenavista, a 704&nbsp;m (2310&nbsp;ft) hill which sits on the border between the municipalities of Getafe and [[Legan\u00e9s]], some 12&nbsp;km South of Madrid. The hilliest area, the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, is located in the Southeast and has a maximum elevation of 698&nbsp;m (2290&nbsp;ft). In the center of Getafe is the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, or ''hill of angels'' (670 m; 2198&nbsp;ft).  Pine forests have been planted at the feet of these hills to deter the erosion of the soil.\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n[[File:Lagunas de Perales.jpg|thumb|210px|Lakes of Perales. Because so few remain, these four small lakes are protected.]]\n\nA number of rivers and other natural waterways pass through Getafe. 9.5&nbsp;km of the Manzanares River passes through the eastern-most parts of the municipal district. In the South, 16.5&nbsp;km of the Culebro Waterway winds its way across Getafe, and in the Southeast 2&nbsp;km of the Filipinas gully descent from the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa. There are two man-made canals, one on each side of the Manzanares River. These parallel canals provide water for cultivated land further from the river.\n\nThe lakes of Perals are 2&nbsp;km East of the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]], and are some of the only undisturbed natural lakes left in the region. For this reason, the lakes are part of a protected area to preserve their natural state.\n\nThe Culebra waterway and the Filipinas gully boast heavy water flow during the winter and little to none during the summer. In contrast, the Manzanares carries water year round. For that reason, Getafe is considered to be within the Manzanares [[river basin]], except for a small portion in the southeast which is part of the [[Jarama]] river basin.\n\n=== Borders ===\nThe city of Getafe borders the following municipalities: to the North, Madrid (city districts [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]] and [[Vallecas]]; to the East, [[Rivas Vaciamadrid]]; to the Southeast, [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]; to the South, [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]; to the Southwest, [[Fuenlabrada]]; to the West, [[Legan\u00e9s]].\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width =\"60%\" border = 2 align=\"center\"\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NW:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''N:'' [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NE:'' [[Vallecas]]\n|-----\n| width =\"10%\" align=\"center\" | ''W:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | '''Getafe'''\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''E:'' [[Rivas-Vaciamadrid]]\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SW'' [[Fuenlabrada]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''S:'' [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SE:'' [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]\n|}</center>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Getafe-nevado.jpg|thumb|230px|left|A park in Getafe on a snowy day.]]\nThe climate of Getafe is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]<ref>[http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 Valores clim\u00e1ticos normales de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095428/http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref> and is influenced by urban conditions. Winters are cool, with temperatures dropping below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (46.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) during the day, and frequently below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) at night. Getafe averages three to four snowfalls per year. Summers are very hot, with median temperatures above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (75.2&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July and August, and with maximum temperatures which often reach 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F). Daily temperatures oscillate within range of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (18&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nPrecipitations are regularly distributed throughout the year, excluding the dry summer months. The rainiest month is October, with 50&nbsp;mm  of rainfall, and the driest month is July, with only 9.4&nbsp;mm. Average yearly precipitation is around 365&nbsp;mm (17.52&nbsp;in).\n\nOne of the major problems of Getafe's climate is air pollution, which increases noticeably when the wind blows South or Southeast. The average annual temperature is 15&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the highest temperature on record listed at 41.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (106.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 24 July 1995, and the lowest temperature recorded at -12&nbsp;\u00b0C (10.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 5 February 1963. The average [[relative humidity]] is 71%, average pressure is 1,015.8 millibars, average number of daylight hours per year is 2,850, and the winds blow predominantly from the northeast.\n\nExtreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, never occur in Getafe thanks to its climate and geography. One common problem in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula is [[drought]], which occurs whenever precipitation ceases during various months.\n\n{{Weather box|location= Getafe (1981-2010) <small>(altitude: 620 m, [http://maps.google.es/?q=Est%3AGetafe%4040.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&t=p&ll=40.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&spn=0.182837%2C0.291824&z=11&output=embed satellite view])</small>\n|metric first= Y\n|single line= Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.8\n|Feb record high C = 23.0\n|Mar record high C = 29.0\n|Apr record high C = 30.7\n|May record high C = 36.2\n|Jun record high C = 40.6\n|Jul record high C = 41.6\n|Aug record high C = 40.6\n|Sep record high C = 40.0\n|Oct record high C = 32.0\n|Nov record high C = 25.2\n|Dec record high C = 21.8\n|year record high C = 41.6\n|Jan high C= 10.5\n|Feb high C= 12.7\n|Mar high C= 16.8\n|Apr high C= 18.6\n|May high C= 23.0\n|Jun high C= 29.3\n|Jul high C= 33.2\n|Aug high C= 32.5\n|Sep high C= 27.5\n|Oct high C= 20.6\n|Nov high C= 14.5\n|Dec high C= 10.7\n|year high C= 20.8\n|Jan mean C= 5.9\n|Feb mean C= 7.5\n|Mar mean C= 10.8\n|Apr mean C= 12.7\n|May mean C= 16.8\n|Jun mean C= 22.4\n|Jul mean C= 25.9\n|Aug mean C= 25.4\n|Sep mean C= 21.1\n|Oct mean C= 15.3\n|Nov mean C= 9.8\n|Dec mean C= 6.5\n|year mean C= 15.0\n|Jan low C= 1.2\n|Feb low C= 2.4\n|Mar low C= 4.9\n|Apr low C= 6.9\n|May low C= 10.5\n|Jun low C= 15.6\n|Jul low C= 18.5\n|Aug low C= 18.2\n|Sep low C= 14.6\n|Oct low C= 9.9\n|Nov low C= 5.0\n|Dec low C= 2.4\n|year low C= 9.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.0\n|Feb record low C = -12.0\n|Mar record low C = -6.2\n|Apr record low C = -2.6\n|May record low C = -1.0\n|Jun record low C = 4.2\n|Jul record low C = 8.2\n|Aug record low C = 7.2\n|Sep record low C = 3.6\n|Oct record low C = -2.0\n|Nov record low C = -5.4\n|Dec record low C = -10.0\n|year record low C = -12.0\n|Jan precipitation mm= 30\n|Feb precipitation mm= 32\n|Mar precipitation mm= 24\n|Apr precipitation mm= 38\n|May precipitation mm= 39\n|Jun precipitation mm= 19\n|Jul precipitation mm= 9\n|Aug precipitation mm= 9\n|Sep precipitation mm= 22\n|Oct precipitation mm= 50\n|Nov precipitation mm= 48\n|Dec precipitation mm= 45\n|year precipitation mm= 365\n|Jan precipitation days= 6\n|Feb precipitation days= 5\n|Mar precipitation days= 4\n|Apr precipitation days= 7\n|May precipitation days= 6\n|Jun precipitation days= 3\n|Jul precipitation days= 1\n|Aug precipitation days= 2\n|Sep precipitation days= 3\n|Oct precipitation days= 7\n|Nov precipitation days= 6\n|Dec precipitation days= 7\n|year precipitation days= 56\n|unit precipitation days= 1&nbsp;mm\n|Jan sun= 150\n|Feb sun= 172\n|Mar sun= 222\n|Apr sun= 237\n|May sun= 279\n|Jun sun= 326\n|Jul sun= 368\n|Aug sun= 339\n|Sep sun= 256\n|Oct sun= 202\n|Nov sun= 152\n|Dec sun= 124\n|year sun= 2850\n|source 1= [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]]<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |title       = Gu\u00eda resumida del clima en Espa\u00f1a (1981-2010)\n |publisher   = AEMet\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130526104145/http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |archivedate = 2013-05-26\n}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Flora and Fauna ===\n[[File:Campo-getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] from the middle of the eastern municipal border. Visible are pine trees, olive trees, and extensive wheat fields.]]\n\nThe native vegetation of Getafe is characteristic of the [[mediterranean forest]] biome, consisting mostly of [[Holm Oak|holm]] and [[Cork Oak|cork oaks]]. Native flowering plants include those of the genus ''[[Cistus]]'' and the [[common broom]] (''Cytisus scoparius''), though these species are not abundant. This native forest and underbrush only occupies 16% of the surface of the municipal territory, mostly in the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa and further east. The shores of the Manzanares River and Culebro Waterway contain deciduous trees and reeds.\n\nMost undeveloped land is devoted to the cultivation of cereals (mostly [[wheat]]), and, to a lesser extent, to gardens in the fertile lowlands of the Manzanares river. Some areas have been reforested with [[stone pine]]s (''Pinus pinea'') and [[aleppo pine]]s (''Pinus halepensis''). These areas include the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, the Prado Acedinos, part of the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, and part of the park in the Sector III neighborhood. Common trees in the parks and streets of the city are the [[horse chestnut]] (''Aesculus hippocastanum''), the [[acacia]], the [[elm]] (''Ulmus minor''), and the stone pine. Other less common trees include [[Cedar wood|cedars]], [[Cupressus|cypress]], aleppo pines, [[plum]] trees, [[Populus|poplars]], [[fir]] trees, and [[Arecaceae|palm trees]].\n\nA significant population of small birds live within the city proper, including [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s and [[Columbidae|pigeons]]. Larger birds, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, and weasels can be found in the more easterly parts of the municipality. The world's largest population of the [[Falco tinnunculus|common kestrel]] can be found in the Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood.\n\n== Town Planning  ==\n[[File:Getafe-norte.jpg|thumb|220px|Modern building in the Getafe Norte neighborhood.]]\nThe urban portions of Getafe are organised in an almost longitudinal manner, from northeast to southwest. Thus, the elongated shape of Getafe today is due primarily to the close proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which impedes city growth to the southeast. The most important streets of the city are Calle Madrid and Calle Toledo. These two roads are pedestrian through the center of Getafe, and are part of what was a royal road connecting Madrid and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] during the Middle Ages. Getafe has other important streets and avenues organizing its neighborhoods, such as the Avenida de Espa\u00f1a, Avenida de Los \u00c1ngeles, Avenida de las Ciudades, Avenida Juan Carlos I, and Calle Ferrocarril.\n\nThe popular architectural style in Getafe is generally characterised by two-story buildings with tile roofs, various small [[balcony|balconies]] on the second floor, and a bare brick fa\u00e7ade. These types of houses can be found in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood, though their numbers are decreasing as existing houses are vacated and demolished to make room for new townhouse developments. The average height of buildings in Getafe is five floors, approximately  60 feet (17 metres). This peculiarity is due to the proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which places limits on the height of buildings. Few buildings in Getafe surpass eight stories in height.\n[[File:Perales-iglesia.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Iglesia de Perales del R\u00edo; one of the oldest buildings in the city.]]\nDue to the developmental limitations imposed by the Air Force Base and the municipality borders, the city's parks and green spaces are important conservation areas. Two of the largest parks are located within the Sector III and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhoods. These green zones include an artificial lake and river, two pine forests, and a number of hiking trails. The parks cover an area approximately the size of Getafe Centro, and make up the western part of the urban centre, separated from the east by the [[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]. A series of parks of various sizes are located within the city proper. Outside of the city are two pine forests with picnic areas, fountains, and kiosks.\n\nGetafe's urban centre is undergoing various expansions of its urban centre. One of these is the construction and establishment of the El Bercial neighbourhood. This expansion of El Bercial will quadruple the size of the neighbourhood and will allow the city to expand to the northeast, linking El Bercial to the urban centre. The Los Olivos [[industrial park]] is expanding eastward, while at the same time, the Perales del R\u00edo neighbourhood grows westward, bringing these two neighbourhoods closer together. The \u00c1rea Tecnol\u00f3gica del Sur is being constructed in the southern parts of the municipal district, along the M-50. The \u00c1rea will be an area dedicated to a number of exposition halls and areas for new industrial development.\n\nGetafe township has a number of projects underway to expand urban areas. One of these projects is expanding the Sector III neighborhood by constructing housing at the feel of Buenavista hill. Another project involves creating a residential neighborhood called Los Molinos, located east of Getafe Norte and north of the Los \u00c1ngeles industrial park. A third project calls for the construction of a university, the ''Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Getafe'', which will include three departments and a central building.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:Ermita del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.pav.jpg|thumb|200px|Hermitage del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.]]\n[[File:Plaza-getafe.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Central plaza in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:La alh\u00f3ndiga, getafe.JPG|thumb|200px|Evening in the La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:Viviendas en el Sector 3 de Getafe.jpg|thumb|200px|Houses in Sector III neighbourhood.]]\n\nPrior to the 20th century, Getafe had only one neighbourhood, which encompassed the modern Getafe Centro and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighborhoods. The Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood is also one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the municipality, dating from approximately the 17th century. Since the 1960s, a population boom prompted the creation of new neighbourhoods, such as those of San Isidro, Juan de la Cierva, [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]], and El Bercial. In the 1980s, the Sector III neighbourhood was built and the Perales del R\u00edo was significantly expanded. During the following decade, the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built. Today, Getafe is divided into nine neighbourhoods and five industrial parks.\n\n;Getafe Centro: The oldest neighbourhood in the Getafe municipality, Getafe Centro includes the city centre. It maintains an authentic, traditional, and commercial ambience. The most populous neighbourhood in Getafe, it includes a large number of pedestrian streets. Town hall, the cathedral, the Colegio de Escuelas P\u00edas, and the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 are all located within this neighbourhood.\n;El Bercial: El Bercial is a small neighbourhood isolated from the city centre and merged with the industrial park Legan\u00e9s. Dating from the 1970s, the neighbourhood is currently experiencing significant growth.\n;Getafe Norte: Constructed in the 1990s, Getafe Norte is the northernmost neighbourhood in the city and contains the football stadium [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]].\n;Juan de la Cierva: Juan de la Cierva is a centrally located commercial neighbourhood named after the famous engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]]. Dating back to the 1970s, the neighbourhood is the second-most populous of Getafe.\n;La Alh\u00f3ndiga: One of the oldest and most authentic neighbourhoods of Getafe, La Alh\u00f3ndiga is located west of Getafe Centro, alongside the [[autov\u00eda A-42]] and the University Hospital of Getafe.\n;Las Margaritas: {{main|Las Margaritas (Madrid)}} Las Margaritas is a small neighbourhood located next to the [[Universidad Carlos III]] and its residence halls. It dates back to the 1970s, and is home to an important sports centre.\n;Perales del R\u00edo: Perales del R\u00edo is the neighborhood located furthest from the city centre. It is located alongside the Manzanares River in the extreme east of the Getafe municipality. One of the oldest neighbourhoods, it is experiencing continuous growth.\n;San Isidro: San Isidro is located south of the city centre, and includes an importance sports centre and large parks. It dates back to the 1970s.\n;Sector III: The Sector III neighbourhood consists primarily of single family homes and living areas. It is the largest neighbourhood in the municipality, and the third most populous.  Built in the 1980s, it was expanded in 1997 to include a new development called Arroyo Culebro. The [[Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe]] is here.\n;Five industrial parks: The five industrial parks are spread out across the peripherals of the city. The eastern areas include Los \u00c1ngeles, San Marcos, and Los Olivos parks. Parks south of the city limits include El Culebro and El Ros\u00f3n.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n[[File:Base-getafe.JPG|thumb|220px|Planes at the Getafe Air Force Base.]]\n[[File:Piscina-getafe.jpg|thumb|220px|Public pool of Getafe Norte. The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] in the background.]]\n\nThis city has grown substantially in the past decades, which has caused similar growth in the number of infrastructures.<ref>[http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page Infraestructuras de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228232342/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page |date=2008-02-28 }}</ref> Some of the more notable of these are:\n* The Humanities and Judicial Sciences faculties and the [[Rector (academia)#Europe|academic rector]] of the [[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]]. These installations are in the central neighborhood of Las Margaritas.\n* The student residence halls \"Fernando de los R\u00edos,\" situated 500 meters from the university in the same neighborhood.\n* The University Hospital of Getafe, famous for its burn unit. It is adjacent to the A-42, and is one of the largest hospitals in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The Getafe Air Force Base, one of the first in Spain. It's located Southeast of the urban center, and it is almost exclusively for military use. The runway of the Getafe Air Force Base is shared with engineering and manufacturing facilities of [[Airbus]] (formerly [[EADS CASA|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uiticas]]) and its three divisions: ''Commercial Aircraft'', ''[[Airbus Defence and Space|Defence and Space]]'', and ''[[Airbus Helicopters|Helicopters]]''.\n* The ''Teatro Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca'', a large cultural center located in the Getafe Centro neighborhood. It was constructed during the 1990s and produces a large number of cultural performances.\n* The [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]], the soccer stadium for [[Getafe CF]], is located in the Getafe Norte neighborhood. Inaugurated in 1998, the stadium has a seating capacity of 14,400.\n* The ''Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe'', located in the Sector III neighborhood. It is the only public musical conservatory in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid]] C-4 train line has passed underground through Getafe since 2001 to minimize noise and divisions. The old train route has been converted into a park.\n* The ''Cementerio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad'' (Cemetery of Our Lady of Peace), located South of the Air Force base, which is no longer accepting new clients due to the construction of a new cemetery.\n* A water purification plant, which purifies the waters of the Manzanares River is located alongside Perales del R\u00edo on the outskirts of Getafe. Another purification plant in Southern Getafe cleans the waters of the Culebro waterway.\n* The bullring, constructed in 2004, is located within the fairgrounds. Bullfights are common here during holidays and festivals.\n* Seven sports centers and three public pools are located within various neighborhoods.\n* Fifteen Catholic churches, eleven civic centers, and five public libraries.\n\n==Media ==\nThe municipality has a number of local newspapers. These include ''El Buz\u00f3n'' and ''El Iceberg'', which can both be found online and in print, ''El Buz\u00f3n de Getafe'', ''Observador'', ''Acci\u00f3n Getafense'', ''Vivir en Getafe'', ''Getafe Ahora'', the sports weekly digest ''Zona Sur'', ''Bolet\u00edn del Ayuntamiento'', ''Getafe al d\u00eda'', ''Getafe Capital'' and ''Mercado'', among others. The local radio broadcast, ''Radio Getafe'', was absorbed by Cadena COPE (101.8 FM). During the 1990s, the city had its own local television station called ''Tele Getafe''. In addition, there exists even more digital-only media.\n\n==Transportation ==\n[[File:Getafe-tren.jpg|thumb|250px|Train and metro station ''Getafe Central''.]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nFour highways and divided highways pass through Getafe: two beltways (A-42 and A-4) and two highways leading through Madrid (M-45 and M-50). Another two-lane road connects Getafe with [[Legan\u00e9s]], and two provincial roads lead to Perales del R\u00edo. The following is a list of major arteries:\n\n;Highways:\n*'''M-45''', highway to Madrid. 4&nbsp;km of this highway is inside Getafe, crossing it from West to East. The road marks the Northern limits of the Getafe Norte and El Bercial neighborhoods.\n*'''M-50''', highway to Madrid. 13.6&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the city center West to East. The road marks the Southern limits of the Sector III neighborhood and the Northern limit of the El Culebro industrial park.\n\n;Motorways ([[Autov\u00eda]]s):\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-4|A-4]]''', the Highway of the South, previously called the N-IV. 7.25&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the center north\u2013south. The road separates the Los \u00c1ngeles and San Marcos industrial parks from the Los Olivos industrial park and the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]].\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]''', the Toledo Highway, previously called the N-401. 6.13&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it cuts across the center in a north\u2013south orientation. The road separates the Section III and El Bercial neighborhoods from the city center. To lessen the isolation of these neighborhoods, the local government has begun a project to create an underground passage for the A-42 as it crosses through Getafe.\n\n;Other roads:\n*M-406, two-lane road. Passes through [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Legan\u00e9s]] and Getafe. Once the M-406 enters Getafe it becomes the Calle Legan\u00e9s.\n*M-301, road which exits [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]], passes through Perales del R\u00edo, and terminates in San Mart\u00edn de la Vega.\n*Road from [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] to Perales del R\u00edo. This road is a continuation of the M-406, and connects central Getafe with Perales del R\u00edo.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe Air Force Base is for military use only. As it is, the city center of Getafe is 26&nbsp;km from [[Madrid Barajas International Airport]], which can be accessed via the M-40.\n\nThe city has eight urban bus lines; eight lines connecting Getafe to Madrid; five lines to the municipalities of Valdemoro, [[Legan\u00e9s]], [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Parla]], [[Serranillos]], Casarrubuelos and Gri\u00f1\u00f3n; and two night lines to Madrid.

From the Middle Ages to 1900, the population varied between 2,500 and 6,000 inhabitants. In 1950, the population was 12,254; in 1970, the population was 69,424; in 1977, 124,601. These figures demonstrate the population growth spurt that began in 1960 and continues to the present day. At present, the city's population is generally growing at a continual, moderate rate, at approximately 1,700 people per year. The year 2006 was the first year since the 17th century that the population actually decreased, falling by 2,043 people.\n\nGetafe is listed as the 41st most populous city in Spain, after [[Salamanca]] and before [[Logro\u00f1o]].

The hills of the Mara\u00f1osa can be seen in the distance.]]\nGetafe's economy was historically agricultural. The first factories were built in the area at the beginning of the 20th century, but it wasn't until the second half of the century that industry gained prominence. By the 1960s, industry had become the primary economic focus.\n\nToday, the economy is mostly industrial, with a large focus on Getafe's five industrial parks. After Madrid, Getafe is the most industrialized city in the community of Madrid, with numerous industries such as [[John Deere]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], and [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA]]. The city boasts five industrial parks spread across the peripheries of the city. The city's industrial activities are divided across several industries: 34% [[metallurgy]], 20% food processing, 14% wood and furniture production, 6% textile, furs, and skins. The remaining 26% includes various other industries, such as paper production, graphic arts, and construction, among others. A number of [[quarry|quarries]] are located in the easterly areas of the municipality which are being mined extensively.\n[[File:Getafe-ayuntamiento1.jpg|thumb|186px|left|Getafe's City hall.]]\nThe service industry began to emerge at the end of the 1990s with the construction of several new malls and entertainment areas. The importance of agriculture on the local economy has decreased significantly in the past century, though eastern parts of the municipality still include good plots of irrigated and nonirrigated land. The major crop is wheat, with smaller cultivations of [[olive trees]], [[Vitis|grape vines]], and vegetables. Herding and livestock are slowly diminishing, though they can still be found in the vicinity of Buenavista hill and the fields along the Manzanares river.\n\nThe median [[per capita income]] of the inhabitants of Getafe is 10,000 \u20ac, which is lower than the 12,500 \u20ac median income of the community of Madrid. The most wealthy neighborhoods are Sector III and Getafe Norte, with a median income of 13,000 \u20ac. The poorest neighborhoods are La Alh\u00f3ndiga, Getafe Centro, and San Isidro, whose median incomes average 9,000 \u20ac. In January 2006, the [[unemployment]] rate was 8.4%\n{{clear}}\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[File:Calle con campanario de iglesia al fondo en Getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|Escuelas P\u00edas, a center of religious education founded in 1609]]\nGetafe has a number of monuments and areas of interest pertaining to its history.

The \"s\u00e1bado de las fiestas\" (''Saturday of the festivities''), as it is popularly known, begins with an address in the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n, following an explosive display of the concussive effects of co-ordinated firecracker and fireworks barrages in the Calle Jardines. A fair is held during these days on the fairgrounds, political parties set up stalls on the Calle Ferrocarril, and there are a number of cultural activities, including concerts and bull fights.

The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] (\"Hill of the Angels\"), a site traditionally considered to be the geographical center of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], also lies within the municipal limits.<ref name=\"cerro\">{{cite web |url= http://www.cerrodelosangeles.es/|title= Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles (Official website)|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=es}}</ref> Getafe is located 13&nbsp;km south of [[Madrid]]'s city centre, within a flat area of Spain's [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]] in the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares River]] basin.\n\nGetafe's proximity to central Madrid fostered industrial development during the 20th and 21st centuries. The city's industrialisation in turn led to an increase in population, reaching 170,115 in 2011. Due to its industrial and social networks, the majority of residents work or study within the city. Getafe hosts an [[Airbus]] factory. The increase in population led to the construction of numerous access roads, an increase in available public services, and the creation of new neighborhoods at the end of the 20th century.\n\n== Etymology ==\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], a number of villages were located in the present-day area of Getafe. One of the main villages was Alarnes, which was very close to the current urban center. In 1326, the villagers united themselves into one town, situated on the royal road that linked Madrid with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. This new town was called ''Xatafi,'' a name which came from the Arab word ''jata'' (\"something long\"). It is assumed that the name ''Xatafi'' referred to the royal road, which also served as the town's main street. The town's name evolved over time, from ''Xetafe'' to ''Jetafee'' to ''Jetaphe'' to ''Jetafe'' to ''Getafe.''\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Vista de Getafe (1878).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Engraving]] of Getafe from the 19th century.]]\nThe history of Getafe can be split into three clearly defined eras. In the first era, which lasted from Prehistory until 1326, there existed distinct villages in the area, though Getafe itself did not exist as a municipality. The second era lasted from the 14th century until the 20th century, during which Getafe was established as a town and developed slowly. In the third era, which began in the 20th century and continues to the present day, Getafe changed in nature from a small agricultural town to a large industrial city, with a noticeable increase in commerce, industry, population and size.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |title=Historia de Getafe |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303230826/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Villa-romana-getafe.JPG|thumb|230px|Ruins of the Roman villa of La Torrecilla.]]\nThe presence of humans in the area of Getafe dates back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period (before 100,000 BCE). Various [[stone tools]], pots, and bracelets from this period have been excavated from the banks of the Manzanares River.\n\nThe Romans dominated the Iberian Peninsula from the 2nd century BCE until the 5th century AD. In the 3rd century AD, the Romans constructed a villa called La Torecilla, whose ruins are still visible on the banks of the Manzanares River. The area was subsequently overrun by a series of [[Germanic tribes]], including [[Suebi]], [[Vandals]] and [[Visigoths]], and the Indoeuropean [[Alans]].\n\nThe area currently encompassed by the Getafe municipal district was invaded by the [[Moors]] in the 8th century. King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] conquered the villages of the area in 1085. In 1326, the inhabitants of the villages moved closer to the royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo, in effect creating a new town, Getafe. In that same century, the primitive hermitage of La Magdalena was built, only to be destroyed several centuries later.\n\n=== Contemporary age ===\n[[File:Getafe-sigloxvii.JPG|thumb|190px|left|Map of 17th century Getafe.]]\nIn 1492, famine and disease devastated Getafe, prompting the construction of the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 in 1529. In 1549, the architect [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] began building the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Magdalena, which has since become the Cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Getafe|Diocese of Getafe]]. The church was built on the foundation of the old hermitage, and in 1610 a new hermitage was built on the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. The college of the Escuelas P\u00edas was founded in 1737. In 1763, King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered the construction of a new road connecting Madrid to [[Aranjuez]] and, further on, to [[C\u00e1diz]], which passed along the foot of the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. Napoleonic troops occupied Getafe from 1808 to 1812. A train line connecting Madrid to Aranjuez, and passing through Getafe, was inaugurated in 1851.\n\n=== Modern age ===\n[[File:Gran-teatro-getafe.JPG|thumb|165px|Getafe's Gran Teatro (''Great Theater'') at the end of the 19th century.]]\nElectric street lights were lit for the first time in Getafe on 22 December 1897. The Getafe Air Force Base was permanently established in 1911, followed by the School of Civil Aviation two years later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] inaugurated the first monument to the [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus on the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] on 30 May 1919. In 1924, [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas S.A.]] built its first factory in the area. That same year, [[Juan de la Cierva]]'s [[autogyro]] was flown for the first time from the air force base.\n\nDue to its proximity to Madrid, Getafe underwent an industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in the city's conversion from agricultural city to industrial city. Industrialization also prompted a rapid boom in population, starting in the 1950s. In 1956, [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] established a factory in Getafe, and a year later, [[Siemens AG]] followed suit. The city was forced to create the neighborhoods of San Isidro, El Bercial, Juan de la Cierva, and [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]] in the 1970s in order to support these new industries.\n\nIn 1961, the [[Canal de Isabel II]] began to provide water to Getafe. The first local democratic elections occurred in 1979, after the ratification of the Constitution in 1978. In 1989, the [[Universidad Carlos III]] was founded. The Sector III neighbourhood was constructed between 1979 and 1988; the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built during the late 1990s; the El Bercial neighbourhood is currently being expanded. In April 2003, Madrid Metro System's [[Line 12 (Madrid Metro)|Line 12]] opened, linking the Madrid region's southern population centres with the capital.\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Getafe is divided vertically into two equal halves that represent the two most important characteristics of the municipal district. The left half contains a heart in the center of a [[Latin cross]], representing the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]\u2014a reference to the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]]. The right half contains a repeated pattern of airplanes representing the aeronautical tradition of the area and referencing the nearby Air Force Base. The [[Royal Spanish Crown]] tops the coat of arms, and symbolizes Getafe's loyalty to the Spanish monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |title=Getafe es As\u00ed |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055541/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n== Politics and government ==\nThe current mayor of Getafe is Sara Hern\u00e1ndez Barroso, socialist, thanks to the support of left wing group [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU) and a political platform close to [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] called 'Ahora Getafe'. In 2011, Juan Soler-Espiauba Gallo, of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), was elected mayor and displaced the incumbent, a socialist, who had held this post since 1983. The most popular political parties in the area, other than the PSOE, are the [[People's Party (Spain)|Peoples' Party]] (PP) and the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU). Getafe has always had a large working population, and left-wing groups, especially the PSOE, have traditionally been very influential.\n\nIn the [[Spanish regional elections, 2007|2007 Spanish regional elections]], the PSOE elected 13 town councillors (44.18% of the vote), PP, 11 (36.09%), and IU 3, (11.73%).<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ Resultados de las elecciones municipales de 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531083056/http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ |date=2007-05-31 }}</ref> Other political associations were not able to muster enough votes to receive representation. Local elections occur every four years, along with the autonomous election. \n\nIn the last Spanish General elections celebrated in 2015, PP obtained 25,65% of the vote, very close to Podemos (24,72%) and PSOE (22,60%). Ciudadanos obtained 16,54% of the vote and IU 7,07%.\n\nCabinet meetings are composed of nine councillors: eight from the PSOE and one from IU. The Municipal Corporation is made up of 27 members, detailed previously. The cabinet is presided over by the mayor. The Getafe city council is divided into a number of different focus groups: treasury, wealth, and social security; equality; urbanism; civil action; and management of waste disposal, cleanliness, the environment, and the home. The council holds sessions every month, in addition to frequently held special sessions, in which councillors debate various topics and problems which affect the municipality.\n\nGetafe is at the forefront of the struggle for workers rights in local industry. The most important trade unions in the city are the [[Workers' Commissions]] (CCOO) and the [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] (UGT). Both unions have branch offices in Getafe and list many local workers as members.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Physical location ===\n[[File:Cerro-buenavista.JPG|thumb|220px|Cerro Buenavista, or ''Buenavista hill'', the area of highest elevation in the Getafe municipality at 704 meters (2309 ft). There is a deposit of water on the summit of the hill from the canal of Isabel II.]]\n[[File:Cerro-angeles.JPG|thumb|right|Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]]\nGetafe is located in the southern zone of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]], Spain, in southwestern Europe. It is physically located in the centre of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], north of the Southern Submeseta (part of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]]), in the Manzanares River basin. Its elevation is 610 \u2013 640 meters above sea level (2000\u20132100&nbsp;feet). Its coordinates are 40\u00b0 18' N 3\u00b0 43' W. The municipal district is 78.74&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with a perimeter of 46.5&nbsp;km. The easternmost part of the municipal district is located within the [[Parque Regional del Sureste]], a protected forest region.\n\n==== Distances ====\nDue to its central location within the Iberian Peninsula, Getafe is no more than 725.6&nbsp;km from any Spanish provincial capital in mainland Spain. The following are the distances to a few major cities, the oceans which surround the Spanish coasts, and the national borders of Portugal and France.\n<center>\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|\n*[[Puerta del Sol]] of [[Madrid]]: 13&nbsp;km\n*[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]: 59&nbsp;km (capital of the nearest [[Provinces of Spain|province]] other than Madrid)\n*[[Girona]]: 725,6&nbsp;km (capital of the furthest province on the mainland)\n*Center of [[Legan\u00e9s]] (adjacent municipality): 4,3&nbsp;km\n*[[Fuenlabrada]] (adjacent municipality): 7,5&nbsp;km\n*[[Parla]] (adjacent municipality): 8&nbsp;km\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n*[[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]): 348&nbsp;km\n*[[Bay of Biscay]] ([[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]): 398&nbsp;km\n*[[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[C\u00e1diz]]): 640&nbsp;km\n*[[Portugal|Portuguese]] Border: 402&nbsp;km\n*[[Francia|French]] Border: 510&nbsp;km\n|}</center>\n\n=== Relief ===\n[[File:Manzanares-rio.JPG|thumb|205px|left|The bank of the Manzanares River. This is the area with the lowest elevation in the province of Madrid (540 m; 1772 ft).]]\nThe municipal district is mostly flat, with a minor inclination of 5% to the east and an elevation of 631&nbsp;m (2070&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The lowest altitude can be found to the extreme east, at the Manzanares River at 540&nbsp;m (1772&nbsp;ft). The highest elevation is found on the extreme west, on Buenavista, a 704&nbsp;m (2310&nbsp;ft) hill which sits on the border between the municipalities of Getafe and [[Legan\u00e9s]], some 12&nbsp;km South of Madrid. The hilliest area, the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, is located in the Southeast and has a maximum elevation of 698&nbsp;m (2290&nbsp;ft). In the center of Getafe is the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, or ''hill of angels'' (670 m; 2198&nbsp;ft).  Pine forests have been planted at the feet of these hills to deter the erosion of the soil.\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n[[File:Lagunas de Perales.jpg|thumb|210px|Lakes of Perales. Because so few remain, these four small lakes are protected.]]\n\nA number of rivers and other natural waterways pass through Getafe. 9.5&nbsp;km of the Manzanares River passes through the eastern-most parts of the municipal district. In the South, 16.5&nbsp;km of the Culebro Waterway winds its way across Getafe, and in the Southeast 2&nbsp;km of the Filipinas gully descent from the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa. There are two man-made canals, one on each side of the Manzanares River. These parallel canals provide water for cultivated land further from the river.\n\nThe lakes of Perals are 2&nbsp;km East of the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]], and are some of the only undisturbed natural lakes left in the region. For this reason, the lakes are part of a protected area to preserve their natural state.\n\nThe Culebra waterway and the Filipinas gully boast heavy water flow during the winter and little to none during the summer. In contrast, the Manzanares carries water year round. For that reason, Getafe is considered to be within the Manzanares [[river basin]], except for a small portion in the southeast which is part of the [[Jarama]] river basin.\n\n=== Borders ===\nThe city of Getafe borders the following municipalities: to the North, Madrid (city districts [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]] and [[Vallecas]]; to the East, [[Rivas Vaciamadrid]]; to the Southeast, [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]; to the South, [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]; to the Southwest, [[Fuenlabrada]]; to the West, [[Legan\u00e9s]].\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width =\"60%\" border = 2 align=\"center\"\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NW:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''N:'' [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NE:'' [[Vallecas]]\n|-----\n| width =\"10%\" align=\"center\" | ''W:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | '''Getafe'''\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''E:'' [[Rivas-Vaciamadrid]]\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SW'' [[Fuenlabrada]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''S:'' [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SE:'' [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]\n|}</center>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Getafe-nevado.jpg|thumb|230px|left|A park in Getafe on a snowy day.]]\nThe climate of Getafe is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]<ref>[http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 Valores clim\u00e1ticos normales de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095428/http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref> and is influenced by urban conditions. Winters are cool, with temperatures dropping below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (46.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) during the day, and frequently below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) at night. Getafe averages three to four snowfalls per year. Summers are very hot, with median temperatures above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (75.2&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July and August, and with maximum temperatures which often reach 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F). Daily temperatures oscillate within range of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (18&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nPrecipitations are regularly distributed throughout the year, excluding the dry summer months. The rainiest month is October, with 50&nbsp;mm  of rainfall, and the driest month is July, with only 9.4&nbsp;mm. Average yearly precipitation is around 365&nbsp;mm (17.52&nbsp;in).\n\nOne of the major problems of Getafe's climate is air pollution, which increases noticeably when the wind blows South or Southeast. The average annual temperature is 15&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the highest temperature on record listed at 41.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (106.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 24 July 1995, and the lowest temperature recorded at -12&nbsp;\u00b0C (10.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 5 February 1963. The average [[relative humidity]] is 71%, average pressure is 1,015.8 millibars, average number of daylight hours per year is 2,850, and the winds blow predominantly from the northeast.\n\nExtreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, never occur in Getafe thanks to its climate and geography. One common problem in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula is [[drought]], which occurs whenever precipitation ceases during various months.\n\n{{Weather box|location= Getafe (1981-2010) <small>(altitude: 620 m, [http://maps.google.es/?q=Est%3AGetafe%4040.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&t=p&ll=40.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&spn=0.182837%2C0.291824&z=11&output=embed satellite view])</small>\n|metric first= Y\n|single line= Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.8\n|Feb record high C = 23.0\n|Mar record high C = 29.0\n|Apr record high C = 30.7\n|May record high C = 36.2\n|Jun record high C = 40.6\n|Jul record high C = 41.6\n|Aug record high C = 40.6\n|Sep record high C = 40.0\n|Oct record high C = 32.0\n|Nov record high C = 25.2\n|Dec record high C = 21.8\n|year record high C = 41.6\n|Jan high C= 10.5\n|Feb high C= 12.7\n|Mar high C= 16.8\n|Apr high C= 18.6\n|May high C= 23.0\n|Jun high C= 29.3\n|Jul high C= 33.2\n|Aug high C= 32.5\n|Sep high C= 27.5\n|Oct high C= 20.6\n|Nov high C= 14.5\n|Dec high C= 10.7\n|year high C= 20.8\n|Jan mean C= 5.9\n|Feb mean C= 7.5\n|Mar mean C= 10.8\n|Apr mean C= 12.7\n|May mean C= 16.8\n|Jun mean C= 22.4\n|Jul mean C= 25.9\n|Aug mean C= 25.4\n|Sep mean C= 21.1\n|Oct mean C= 15.3\n|Nov mean C= 9.8\n|Dec mean C= 6.5\n|year mean C= 15.0\n|Jan low C= 1.2\n|Feb low C= 2.4\n|Mar low C= 4.9\n|Apr low C= 6.9\n|May low C= 10.5\n|Jun low C= 15.6\n|Jul low C= 18.5\n|Aug low C= 18.2\n|Sep low C= 14.6\n|Oct low C= 9.9\n|Nov low C= 5.0\n|Dec low C= 2.4\n|year low C= 9.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.0\n|Feb record low C = -12.0\n|Mar record low C = -6.2\n|Apr record low C = -2.6\n|May record low C = -1.0\n|Jun record low C = 4.2\n|Jul record low C = 8.2\n|Aug record low C = 7.2\n|Sep record low C = 3.6\n|Oct record low C = -2.0\n|Nov record low C = -5.4\n|Dec record low C = -10.0\n|year record low C = -12.0\n|Jan precipitation mm= 30\n|Feb precipitation mm= 32\n|Mar precipitation mm= 24\n|Apr precipitation mm= 38\n|May precipitation mm= 39\n|Jun precipitation mm= 19\n|Jul precipitation mm= 9\n|Aug precipitation mm= 9\n|Sep precipitation mm= 22\n|Oct precipitation mm= 50\n|Nov precipitation mm= 48\n|Dec precipitation mm= 45\n|year precipitation mm= 365\n|Jan precipitation days= 6\n|Feb precipitation days= 5\n|Mar precipitation days= 4\n|Apr precipitation days= 7\n|May precipitation days= 6\n|Jun precipitation days= 3\n|Jul precipitation days= 1\n|Aug precipitation days= 2\n|Sep precipitation days= 3\n|Oct precipitation days= 7\n|Nov precipitation days= 6\n|Dec precipitation days= 7\n|year precipitation days= 56\n|unit precipitation days= 1&nbsp;mm\n|Jan sun= 150\n|Feb sun= 172\n|Mar sun= 222\n|Apr sun= 237\n|May sun= 279\n|Jun sun= 326\n|Jul sun= 368\n|Aug sun= 339\n|Sep sun= 256\n|Oct sun= 202\n|Nov sun= 152\n|Dec sun= 124\n|year sun= 2850\n|source 1= [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]]<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |title       = Gu\u00eda resumida del clima en Espa\u00f1a (1981-2010)\n |publisher   = AEMet\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130526104145/http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |archivedate = 2013-05-26\n}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Flora and Fauna ===\n[[File:Campo-getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] from the middle of the eastern municipal border. Visible are pine trees, olive trees, and extensive wheat fields.]]\n\nThe native vegetation of Getafe is characteristic of the [[mediterranean forest]] biome, consisting mostly of [[Holm Oak|holm]] and [[Cork Oak|cork oaks]]. Native flowering plants include those of the genus ''[[Cistus]]'' and the [[common broom]] (''Cytisus scoparius''), though these species are not abundant. This native forest and underbrush only occupies 16% of the surface of the municipal territory, mostly in the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa and further east. The shores of the Manzanares River and Culebro Waterway contain deciduous trees and reeds.\n\nMost undeveloped land is devoted to the cultivation of cereals (mostly [[wheat]]), and, to a lesser extent, to gardens in the fertile lowlands of the Manzanares river. Some areas have been reforested with [[stone pine]]s (''Pinus pinea'') and [[aleppo pine]]s (''Pinus halepensis''). These areas include the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, the Prado Acedinos, part of the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, and part of the park in the Sector III neighborhood. Common trees in the parks and streets of the city are the [[horse chestnut]] (''Aesculus hippocastanum''), the [[acacia]], the [[elm]] (''Ulmus minor''), and the stone pine. Other less common trees include [[Cedar wood|cedars]], [[Cupressus|cypress]], aleppo pines, [[plum]] trees, [[Populus|poplars]], [[fir]] trees, and [[Arecaceae|palm trees]].\n\nA significant population of small birds live within the city proper, including [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s and [[Columbidae|pigeons]]. Larger birds, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, and weasels can be found in the more easterly parts of the municipality. The world's largest population of the [[Falco tinnunculus|common kestrel]] can be found in the Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood.\n\n== Town Planning  ==\n[[File:Getafe-norte.jpg|thumb|220px|Modern building in the Getafe Norte neighborhood.]]\nThe urban portions of Getafe are organised in an almost longitudinal manner, from northeast to southwest. Thus, the elongated shape of Getafe today is due primarily to the close proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which impedes city growth to the southeast. The most important streets of the city are Calle Madrid and Calle Toledo. These two roads are pedestrian through the center of Getafe, and are part of what was a royal road connecting Madrid and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] during the Middle Ages. Getafe has other important streets and avenues organizing its neighborhoods, such as the Avenida de Espa\u00f1a, Avenida de Los \u00c1ngeles, Avenida de las Ciudades, Avenida Juan Carlos I, and Calle Ferrocarril.\n\nThe popular architectural style in Getafe is generally characterised by two-story buildings with tile roofs, various small [[balcony|balconies]] on the second floor, and a bare brick fa\u00e7ade. These types of houses can be found in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood, though their numbers are decreasing as existing houses are vacated and demolished to make room for new townhouse developments. The average height of buildings in Getafe is five floors, approximately  60 feet (17 metres). This peculiarity is due to the proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which places limits on the height of buildings. Few buildings in Getafe surpass eight stories in height.\n[[File:Perales-iglesia.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Iglesia de Perales del R\u00edo; one of the oldest buildings in the city.]]\nDue to the developmental limitations imposed by the Air Force Base and the municipality borders, the city's parks and green spaces are important conservation areas. Two of the largest parks are located within the Sector III and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhoods. These green zones include an artificial lake and river, two pine forests, and a number of hiking trails. The parks cover an area approximately the size of Getafe Centro, and make up the western part of the urban centre, separated from the east by the [[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]. A series of parks of various sizes are located within the city proper. Outside of the city are two pine forests with picnic areas, fountains, and kiosks.\n\nGetafe's urban centre is undergoing various expansions of its urban centre. One of these is the construction and establishment of the El Bercial neighbourhood. This expansion of El Bercial will quadruple the size of the neighbourhood and will allow the city to expand to the northeast, linking El Bercial to the urban centre. The Los Olivos [[industrial park]] is expanding eastward, while at the same time, the Perales del R\u00edo neighbourhood grows westward, bringing these two neighbourhoods closer together. The \u00c1rea Tecnol\u00f3gica del Sur is being constructed in the southern parts of the municipal district, along the M-50. The \u00c1rea will be an area dedicated to a number of exposition halls and areas for new industrial development.\n\nGetafe township has a number of projects underway to expand urban areas. One of these projects is expanding the Sector III neighborhood by constructing housing at the feel of Buenavista hill. Another project involves creating a residential neighborhood called Los Molinos, located east of Getafe Norte and north of the Los \u00c1ngeles industrial park. A third project calls for the construction of a university, the ''Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Getafe'', which will include three departments and a central building.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:Ermita del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.pav.jpg|thumb|200px|Hermitage del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.]]\n[[File:Plaza-getafe.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Central plaza in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:La alh\u00f3ndiga, getafe.JPG|thumb|200px|Evening in the La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:Viviendas en el Sector 3 de Getafe.jpg|thumb|200px|Houses in Sector III neighbourhood.]]\n\nPrior to the 20th century, Getafe had only one neighbourhood, which encompassed the modern Getafe Centro and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighborhoods. The Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood is also one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the municipality, dating from approximately the 17th century. Since the 1960s, a population boom prompted the creation of new neighbourhoods, such as those of San Isidro, Juan de la Cierva, [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]], and El Bercial. In the 1980s, the Sector III neighbourhood was built and the Perales del R\u00edo was significantly expanded. During the following decade, the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built. Today, Getafe is divided into nine neighbourhoods and five industrial parks.\n\n;Getafe Centro: The oldest neighbourhood in the Getafe municipality, Getafe Centro includes the city centre. It maintains an authentic, traditional, and commercial ambience. The most populous neighbourhood in Getafe, it includes a large number of pedestrian streets. Town hall, the cathedral, the Colegio de Escuelas P\u00edas, and the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 are all located within this neighbourhood.\n;El Bercial: El Bercial is a small neighbourhood isolated from the city centre and merged with the industrial park Legan\u00e9s. Dating from the 1970s, the neighbourhood is currently experiencing significant growth.\n;Getafe Norte: Constructed in the 1990s, Getafe Norte is the northernmost neighbourhood in the city and contains the football stadium [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]].\n;Juan de la Cierva: Juan de la Cierva is a centrally located commercial neighbourhood named after the famous engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]]. Dating back to the 1970s, the neighbourhood is the second-most populous of Getafe.\n;La Alh\u00f3ndiga: One of the oldest and most authentic neighbourhoods of Getafe, La Alh\u00f3ndiga is located west of Getafe Centro, alongside the [[autov\u00eda A-42]] and the University Hospital of Getafe.\n;Las Margaritas: {{main|Las Margaritas (Madrid)}} Las Margaritas is a small neighbourhood located next to the [[Universidad Carlos III]] and its residence halls. It dates back to the 1970s, and is home to an important sports centre.\n;Perales del R\u00edo: Perales del R\u00edo is the neighborhood located furthest from the city centre. It is located alongside the Manzanares River in the extreme east of the Getafe municipality. One of the oldest neighbourhoods, it is experiencing continuous growth.\n;San Isidro: San Isidro is located south of the city centre, and includes an importance sports centre and large parks. It dates back to the 1970s.\n;Sector III: The Sector III neighbourhood consists primarily of single family homes and living areas. It is the largest neighbourhood in the municipality, and the third most populous.  Built in the 1980s, it was expanded in 1997 to include a new development called Arroyo Culebro. The [[Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe]] is here.\n;Five industrial parks: The five industrial parks are spread out across the peripherals of the city. The eastern areas include Los \u00c1ngeles, San Marcos, and Los Olivos parks. Parks south of the city limits include El Culebro and El Ros\u00f3n.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n[[File:Base-getafe.JPG|thumb|220px|Planes at the Getafe Air Force Base.]]\n[[File:Piscina-getafe.jpg|thumb|220px|Public pool of Getafe Norte. The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] in the background.]]\n\nThis city has grown substantially in the past decades, which has caused similar growth in the number of infrastructures.<ref>[http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page Infraestructuras de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228232342/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page |date=2008-02-28 }}</ref> Some of the more notable of these are:\n* The Humanities and Judicial Sciences faculties and the [[Rector (academia)#Europe|academic rector]] of the [[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]]. These installations are in the central neighborhood of Las Margaritas.\n* The student residence halls \"Fernando de los R\u00edos,\" situated 500 meters from the university in the same neighborhood.\n* The University Hospital of Getafe, famous for its burn unit. It is adjacent to the A-42, and is one of the largest hospitals in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The Getafe Air Force Base, one of the first in Spain. It's located Southeast of the urban center, and it is almost exclusively for military use. The runway of the Getafe Air Force Base is shared with engineering and manufacturing facilities of [[Airbus]] (formerly [[EADS CASA|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uiticas]]) and its three divisions: ''Commercial Aircraft'', ''[[Airbus Defence and Space|Defence and Space]]'', and ''[[Airbus Helicopters|Helicopters]]''.\n* The ''Teatro Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca'', a large cultural center located in the Getafe Centro neighborhood. It was constructed during the 1990s and produces a large number of cultural performances.\n* The [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]], the soccer stadium for [[Getafe CF]], is located in the Getafe Norte neighborhood. Inaugurated in 1998, the stadium has a seating capacity of 14,400.\n* The ''Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe'', located in the Sector III neighborhood. It is the only public musical conservatory in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid]] C-4 train line has passed underground through Getafe since 2001 to minimize noise and divisions. The old train route has been converted into a park.\n* The ''Cementerio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad'' (Cemetery of Our Lady of Peace), located South of the Air Force base, which is no longer accepting new clients due to the construction of a new cemetery.\n* A water purification plant, which purifies the waters of the Manzanares River is located alongside Perales del R\u00edo on the outskirts of Getafe. Another purification plant in Southern Getafe cleans the waters of the Culebro waterway.\n* The bullring, constructed in 2004, is located within the fairgrounds. Bullfights are common here during holidays and festivals.\n* Seven sports centers and three public pools are located within various neighborhoods.\n* Fifteen Catholic churches, eleven civic centers, and five public libraries.\n\n==Media ==\nThe municipality has a number of local newspapers. These include ''El Buz\u00f3n'' and ''El Iceberg'', which can both be found online and in print, ''El Buz\u00f3n de Getafe'', ''Observador'', ''Acci\u00f3n Getafense'', ''Vivir en Getafe'', ''Getafe Ahora'', the sports weekly digest ''Zona Sur'', ''Bolet\u00edn del Ayuntamiento'', ''Getafe al d\u00eda'', ''Getafe Capital'' and ''Mercado'', among others. The local radio broadcast, ''Radio Getafe'', was absorbed by Cadena COPE (101.8 FM). During the 1990s, the city had its own local television station called ''Tele Getafe''. In addition, there exists even more digital-only media.\n\n==Transportation ==\n[[File:Getafe-tren.jpg|thumb|250px|Train and metro station ''Getafe Central''.]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nFour highways and divided highways pass through Getafe: two beltways (A-42 and A-4) and two highways leading through Madrid (M-45 and M-50). Another two-lane road connects Getafe with [[Legan\u00e9s]], and two provincial roads lead to Perales del R\u00edo. The following is a list of major arteries:\n\n;Highways:\n*'''M-45''', highway to Madrid. 4&nbsp;km of this highway is inside Getafe, crossing it from West to East. The road marks the Northern limits of the Getafe Norte and El Bercial neighborhoods.\n*'''M-50''', highway to Madrid. 13.6&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the city center West to East. The road marks the Southern limits of the Sector III neighborhood and the Northern limit of the El Culebro industrial park.\n\n;Motorways ([[Autov\u00eda]]s):\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-4|A-4]]''', the Highway of the South, previously called the N-IV. 7.25&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the center north\u2013south. The road separates the Los \u00c1ngeles and San Marcos industrial parks from the Los Olivos industrial park and the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]].\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]''', the Toledo Highway, previously called the N-401. 6.13&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it cuts across the center in a north\u2013south orientation. The road separates the Section III and El Bercial neighborhoods from the city center. To lessen the isolation of these neighborhoods, the local government has begun a project to create an underground passage for the A-42 as it crosses through Getafe.\n\n;Other roads:\n*M-406, two-lane road. Passes through [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Legan\u00e9s]] and Getafe. Once the M-406 enters Getafe it becomes the Calle Legan\u00e9s.\n*M-301, road which exits [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]], passes through Perales del R\u00edo, and terminates in San Mart\u00edn de la Vega.\n*Road from [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] to Perales del R\u00edo. This road is a continuation of the M-406, and connects central Getafe with Perales del R\u00edo.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe Air Force Base is for military use only. As it is, the city center of Getafe is 26&nbsp;km from [[Madrid Barajas International Airport]], which can be accessed via the M-40.\n\nThe city has eight urban bus lines; eight lines connecting Getafe to Madrid; five lines to the municipalities of Valdemoro, [[Legan\u00e9s]], [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Parla]], [[Serranillos]], Casarrubuelos and Gri\u00f1\u00f3n; and two night lines to Madrid.

More than 85% of the population consider themselves Catholic, but only 20% of these people are actual active members of Catholic congregations.\n\nThe population of Getafe has experienced strong growth during the second half of the 20th century. From the Middle Ages to 1900, the population varied between 2,500 and 6,000 inhabitants. In 1950, the population was 12,254; in 1970, the population was 69,424; in 1977, 124,601. These figures demonstrate the population growth spurt that began in 1960 and continues to the present day. At present, the city's population is generally growing at a continual, moderate rate, at approximately 1,700 people per year. The year 2006 was the first year since the 17th century that the population actually decreased, falling by 2,043 people.\n\nGetafe is listed as the 41st most populous city in Spain, after [[Salamanca]] and before [[Logro\u00f1o]].

The hills of the Mara\u00f1osa can be seen in the distance.]]\nGetafe's economy was historically agricultural. The first factories were built in the area at the beginning of the 20th century, but it wasn't until the second half of the century that industry gained prominence. By the 1960s, industry had become the primary economic focus.\n\nToday, the economy is mostly industrial, with a large focus on Getafe's five industrial parks. After Madrid, Getafe is the most industrialized city in the community of Madrid, with numerous industries such as [[John Deere]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], and [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA]]. The city boasts five industrial parks spread across the peripheries of the city. The city's industrial activities are divided across several industries: 34% [[metallurgy]], 20% food processing, 14% wood and furniture production, 6% textile, furs, and skins. The remaining 26% includes various other industries, such as paper production, graphic arts, and construction, among others. A number of [[quarry|quarries]] are located in the easterly areas of the municipality which are being mined extensively.\n[[File:Getafe-ayuntamiento1.jpg|thumb|186px|left|Getafe's City hall.]]\nThe service industry began to emerge at the end of the 1990s with the construction of several new malls and entertainment areas. The importance of agriculture on the local economy has decreased significantly in the past century, though eastern parts of the municipality still include good plots of irrigated and nonirrigated land. The major crop is wheat, with smaller cultivations of [[olive trees]], [[Vitis|grape vines]], and vegetables. Herding and livestock are slowly diminishing, though they can still be found in the vicinity of Buenavista hill and the fields along the Manzanares river.\n\nThe median [[per capita income]] of the inhabitants of Getafe is 10,000 \u20ac, which is lower than the 12,500 \u20ac median income of the community of Madrid. The most wealthy neighborhoods are Sector III and Getafe Norte, with a median income of 13,000 \u20ac. The poorest neighborhoods are La Alh\u00f3ndiga, Getafe Centro, and San Isidro, whose median incomes average 9,000 \u20ac. In January 2006, the [[unemployment]] rate was 8.4%\n{{clear}}\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[File:Calle con campanario de iglesia al fondo en Getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|Escuelas P\u00edas, a center of religious education founded in 1609]]\nGetafe has a number of monuments and areas of interest pertaining to its history.

Many of these groups have created ''Casas Regionales'' (''Regional Houses''), places were people from similar regional backgrounds can meet for cultural activities. Some of the more prominent Casas Regionales are those of [[Extremadura]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Murcia]], [[Andalusia]], and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]]. The [[Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe]] offers concerts of classical music in its 400-seats concert hall.\n\n=== Celebrations and holidays ===\nThe patron saint's day in Getafe is celebrated 40 days after [[Easter Sunday]], which means that the feast day occurs on a different day each year.

The feast officially begin on that Saturday, but celebrations generally begin nine days prior, on the day of the Ascension\u2014the day that the Virgin of the Angels descended from the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.\n\nNine days after the ascension, the celebrations begin officially. The \"s\u00e1bado de las fiestas\" (''Saturday of the festivities''), as it is popularly known, begins with an address in the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n, following an explosive display of the concussive effects of co-ordinated firecracker and fireworks barrages in the Calle Jardines. A fair is held during these days on the fairgrounds, political parties set up stalls on the Calle Ferrocarril, and there are a number of cultural activities, including concerts and bull fights.

With divisions in the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] base over the [[Vietnam War]], and with the traditional [[mid-term election|mid-term]] advantage of the party not holding the presidency, the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] took three Democratic seats. Despite Republican gains, the balance remained overwhelmingly in favor of the Democrats, who retained a 64&ndash;36 majority.

{"title_page": "History of Germany during World War I", "text_new": "{{History of Germany}}\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[German Empire]] was one of the [[Central Powers]] that lost the war. It began participation in the conflict after the declaration of war against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] by its ally, [[Austria-Hungary]]. German forces fought the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] on both the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War I)|western]] fronts, although German territory itself remained relatively safe from widespread invasion for most of the war, except for a brief period in 1914 when [[Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914)|East Prussia was invaded]]. A tight blockade imposed by the [[Royal Navy]] caused severe food shortages in the cities, especially in the winter of 1916\u201317, known as the [[Turnip Winter]]. At the end of the war, Germany's defeat and widespread popular discontent triggered the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]] which overthrew the [[Monarchy of Germany|monarchy]] and established the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{main|German entry into World War I|German Empire#World War I}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-118-18, Mobilmachung.jpg|thumb|190px|World War I mobilization, 1 August 1914]]\nThe German population responded to the outbreak of war in 1914 with a complex mix of emotions, in a similar way to the populations in other countries of Europe; notions of overt enthusiasm known as the [[Spirit of 1914]] have been challenged by more recent scholarship.<ref>Jeffrey Verhey, ''The Spirit of 1914: Militarism, Myth and Mobilization in Germany'' (Cambridge U.P., 2000).</ref> The German government, dominated by the [[Junker]]s, thought of the war as a way to end Germany's disputes with rivals France, Russia and Britain. The beginning of war was presented in Germany as the chance for the nation to secure \"our place under the sun,\" as the Foreign Minister [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]] had put it, which was readily supported by prevalent nationalism among the public. The Kaiser and the German establishment hoped the war would unite the public behind the monarchy, and lessen the threat posed by the dramatic growth of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which had been the most vocal critic of the Kaiser in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] before the war. Despite its membership in the [[Second International]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] ended its differences with the Imperial government and abandoned its principles of internationalism to support the war effort.\n\nIt soon became apparent that Germany was not prepared for a war lasting more than a few months. At first, little was done to regulate the economy for a wartime footing, and the German war economy would remain badly organized throughout the war. Germany depended on imports of food and raw materials, which were stopped by the British [[blockade of Germany]]. Food prices were first limited, then rationing was introduced. In 1915 five million pigs were massacred in the so-called [[Schweinemord]] to both make food and preserve grain.  The winter of 1916/17 was called \"turnip winter\" because the potato harvest was poor and people ate animal feed including vile-tasting turnips. During the war from August 1914 to mid-1919, the excess deaths over peacetime caused by malnutrition and high rates of exhaustion and disease and despair came to about 474,000 civilians.<ref>N.P.

The Belgians fought back, and sabotaged their rail system to delay the Germans. The Germans did not expect this and were delayed, and responded with systematic reprisals on civilians, killing nearly 6,000 Belgian noncombatants, including women and children, and burning 25,000 houses and buildings.<ref>Jeff Lipkes, ''Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914'' (2007)</ref> The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris and initially, the Germans were very successful, particularly in the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] (14\u201324 August). By 12 September, the French with assistance from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British forces]] halted the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5\u201312 September). The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west. The French offensive into Germany launched on 7 August with the [[Battle of Mulhouse]] had limited success.<ref>Barbara Tuchman, ''The Guns of August'' (1962)</ref>\n\nIn the east, only one Field Army defended [[East Prussia]] and when Russia attacked in this region it diverted German forces intended for the Western Front. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] (17 August&nbsp;\u2013 2 September), but this diversion exacerbated problems of insufficient speed of advance from rail-heads not foreseen by the [[German General Staff]]. The Central Powers were thereby denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of obtaining an early victory.\n\n==1916==\n[[File:Armierungs-Bataillon.jpg|thumb|German soldiers digging trenches]]\n1916 was characterized by two great battles on the Western front, at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] and [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]]. They each lasted most of the year, achieved minimal gains, and drained away the best soldiers of both sides. Verdun became the iconic symbol of the murderous power of modern defensive weapons, with 280,000 German casualties, and 315,000 French. At the Somme, there were over 400,000 German casualties, against over 600,000 Allied casualties. At Verdun, the Germans attacked what they considered to be a weak French salient which nevertheless the French would defend for reasons of national pride. The Somme was part of a multinational plan of the Allies to attack on different fronts simultaneously. German woes were also compounded by Russia's grand \"Brusilov offensive\", which diverted more soldiers and resources. Although the Eastern front was held to a standoff and Germany suffered less casualties than their allies with ~150,000 of the ~770,000 Central powers casualties, the simultaneous Verdun offensive stretched the German forces committed to the Somme offensive. German experts are divided in their interpretation of the Somme. Some say it was a standoff, but most see it as a British victory and argue it marked the point at which German morale began a permanent decline and the strategic initiative was lost, along with irreplaceable veterans and confidence.<ref>Fred R. Van Hartesveldt, ''The Battles of the Somme, 1916: Historiography and Annotated Bibliography'' (1996), pp. 26-27.</ref>\n\n==1917==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 104-0669, \u00dcbung deutscher Soldaten mit Flammenwerfer.jpg|thumb|German soldiers operating a flamethrower in 1917]]\nIn early 1917 the SPD leadership became concerned about the activity of its anti-war left-wing which had been organising as the ''Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft'' (SAG, \"Social Democratic Working Group\"). On 17 January they expelled them, and in April 1917 the left-wing went on to form the ''[[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]]'' ({{lang-de|Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands}}). The remaining faction was then known as the ''[[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]]''. This happened as the enthusiasm for war  faded with the enormous numbers of casualties, the dwindling supply of manpower, the mounting difficulties on the homefront, and the never-ending flow of casualty reports. A grimmer and grimmer attitude began to prevail amongst the general population. The highlight only was the first use of [[mustard gas]] in warfare, in the Battle of Ypres.\n\nAfter, morale was helped by victories against Serbia, Greece, Italy, and Russia which made great gains for the Central Powers. Morale was at its greatest since 1914 at the end of 1917 and beginning of 1918 with the defeat of Russia following her rise into revolution, and the German people braced for what [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] said would be the \"Peace Offensive\" in the west.<ref>C.R.M.F. Cruttwell, A History of the Great War: 1914-1918 (1935) ch 15-29</ref><ref>Holger H. Herwig, ''The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914-1918'' (1997) ch. 4-6.</ref>\n\n==1918==\n{{further|Spring Offensive}}\nIn spring 1918, Germany realized that time was running out. It prepared for the decisive strike with new armies and new tactics, hoping to win the war on the Western front before millions of American and British Empire soldiers appeared in battle. General Erich Ludendorff and Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg had full control of the army, they had a large supply of reinforcements moved from the Eastern front, and they trained storm troopers with new tactics to race through the trenches and attack the enemy's command and communications centers. The new tactics would indeed restore mobility to the Western front, but the German army was too optimistic.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917-18 it was \"quiet\" on the Western Front\u2014British casualties averaged \"only\" 3,000 a week. Serious attacks were impossible in the winter because of the deep caramel-thick mud. Quietly the Germans brought in their best soldiers from the eastern front, selected elite storm troops, and trained them all winter in the new tactics. With stopwatch timing, the German artillery would lay down a sudden, fearsome barrage just ahead of its advancing infantry. Moving in small units, firing light machine guns, the storm troopers would bypass enemy strongpoints, and head directly for critical bridges, command posts, supply dumps and, above all, artillery batteries. By cutting enemy communications they would paralyze response in the critical first half hour. By silencing the artillery they would break the enemy's firepower. Rigid schedules sent in two more waves of infantry to mop up the strong points that had been bypassed. The shock troops frightened and disoriented the first line of defenders, who would flee in panic. In one instance an easy-going Allied regiment broke and fled; reinforcements rushed in on bicycles. The panicky men seized the bikes and beat an even faster retreat. The stormtrooper tactics provided mobility, but not increased firepower. Eventually\u2014in 1939 and 1940\u2014the formula would be perfected with the aid of dive bombers and tanks, but in 1918 the Germans lacked both.<ref>Bruce I. Gudmundsson, ''Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation in the German Army, 1914-1918'' (1989), pp. 155-70.</ref>\n\nLudendorff erred by attacking the British first in 1918, instead of the French. He mistakenly thought the British to be too uninspired to respond rapidly to the new tactics. The exhausted, dispirited French perhaps might have folded. The German assaults on the British were ferocious\u2014the largest of the entire war. At the Somme River in March, 63 divisions attacked in a blinding fog. No matter, the German lieutenants had memorized their maps and their orders. The British lost 270,000 men, fell back 40 miles, and then held. They quickly learned how to handle the new German tactics: fall back, abandon the trenches, let the attackers overextend themselves, and then counterattack. They gained an advantage in firepower from their artillery and from tanks used as mobile pillboxes that could retreat and counterattack at will. In April Ludendorff hit the British again, inflicting 305,000 casualties\u2014but he lacked the reserves to follow up. Ludendorff launched five great attacks between March and July, inflicting a million British and French casualties. The Western Front now had opened up\u2014the trenches were still there but the importance of mobility now reasserted itself. The Allies held. The Germans suffered twice as many casualties as they inflicted, including most of their precious stormtroopers. The new German replacements were under-aged youth or embittered middle-aged family men in poor condition. They were not inspired by the elan of 1914, nor thrilled with battle\u2014they hated it, and some began talking of revolution. Ludendorff could not replace his losses, nor could he devise a new brainstorm that might somehow snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. The British likewise were bringing in reinforcements from the whole Empire, but since their home front was in good condition, and since they could see inevitable victory, their morale was higher. The great German spring offensive was a race against time, for everyone could see the Americans were training millions of fresh young men who would eventually arrive on the Western Front.<ref>David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918'' (2011), pp. 30-111.</ref><ref>C.R.M.F.

Germany had used up all the best soldiers they had, and still had not conquered much territory. The British were out of fresh manpower but still had huge reserves from the British Empire, the French nearly exhausted their manpower. Berlin had calculated it would take months for the Americans to ship all their men and supplies\u2014but the U.S. troops arrived much sooner, as they left their supplies behind, and relied on British and French artillery, tanks, airplanes, trucks and equipment. Berlin also assumed that Americans were fat, undisciplined and unaccustomed to hardship and severe fighting. They soon realized their mistake. The Germans reported that \"The qualities of the [Americans] individually may be described as remarkable. They are physically well set up, their attitude is good... They lack at present only training and experience to make formidable adversaries. The men are in fine spirits and are filled with naive assurance.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Allan Millett|title=Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkbAbwcLfAC&pg=PA304|year=1991|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=304|isbn=9780029215968}}</ref>\n\nBy September 1918, the Central Powers were exhausted from fighting, the American forces were pouring into France at a rate of 10,000 a day, the British Empire was mobilised for war peaking at 4.5 million men and 4,000 tanks on the Western Front. The decisive Allied counteroffensive, known as the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], began on 8 August 1918\u2014what Ludendorff called the \"Black Day of the German army.\" The Allied armies advanced steadily as German defenses faltered.<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

They started looking for scapegoats. The hunger and popular dissatisfaction with the war precipitated [[German Revolution|revolution]] throughout Germany. By 11 November Germany had virtually surrendered, the Kaiser and all the royal families had abdicated, and the German Empire had been replaced by the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Home front==\n\n===War fever===\n[[File:Kaiser Wilhelm II Truppenbesuch Ostpreu\u00dfen Lyck 1915.jpg|thumb|Military propaganda postcard: Wounded soldiers cheer to the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who is in a car.]]\nThe \"spirit of 1914\" was the overwhelming, enthusiastic support of all elements of the population for war in 1914. In the Reichstag, the vote for credits was unanimous, with all the Socialists but one ([[Karl Liebknecht]]) joining in. One professor testified to a \"great single feeling of moral elevation of soaring of religious sentiment, in short, the ascent of a whole people to the heights.\"<ref>Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914-1918'' (1998) p. 14</ref> At the same time, there was a level of anxiety; most commentators predicted the short victorious war \u2013 but that hope was dashed in a matter of weeks, as the invasion of Belgium bogged down and the French Army held in front of Paris. The Western Front became a killing machine, as neither army moved more than a few hundred yards at a time. Industry in late 1914 was in chaos, unemployment soared while it took months to reconvert to munitions productions. In 1916, the Hindenburg Program called for the mobilization of all economic resources to produce artillery, shells, and machine guns. Church bells and copper roofs were ripped out and melted down.<ref>Richie, ''Faust's Metropolis'', pp. 272-75.</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nGermany had no plans for mobilizing its civilian economy for the war effort, and no stockpiles of food or critical supplies had been made. Germany had to improvise rapidly. All major political sectors initially supported the war, including the Socialists.\n\nEarly in the war industrialist [[Walter Rathenau]] held senior posts in the Raw Materials Department of the War Ministry, while becoming chairman of AEG upon his father's death in 1915. Rathenau played the key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department ([[Kriegsrohstoffabteilung]] - 'KRA'); he was in charge of it from August 1914 to March 1915 and established the basic policies and procedures. His senior staff were on loan from industry. KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the [[Blockade of Germany|British blockade]], as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices and regulated the distribution to vital war industries. It began the development of ersatz raw materials. KRA suffered many inefficiencies caused by the complexity and selfishness KRA encountered from  commerce, industry, and the government.<ref>D. G.  Williamson, \"Walther Rathenau and the K.R.A. August 1914-March 1915,\" ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Unternehmensgeschichte'' (1978), Issue 11, pp. 118-136.</ref><ref>Hew Strachan, ''The First World War: Volume I: To Arms'' (2001), pp. 1014-49 on Rathenau and KRA.</ref>\n\n[[File:PSM V88 D237 Collecting scrap metal for the german war effort.jpg|thumb|Collecting scrap metal for the war effort, 1916]]\nWhile the KRA handled critical raw materials, the crisis over food supplies grew worse. The mobilization of so many farmers and horses, and the shortages of fertilizer, steadily reduced the food supply. Prisoners of war were sent to work on farms, and many women and elderly men took on work roles. Supplies that had once come in from Russia and Austria were cut off.<ref>Feldman, Gerald D. \"The Political and Social Foundations of Germany's Economic Mobilization, 1914-1916,\" ''Armed Forces & Society'' (1976), 3#1, pp. 121-145. [http://afs.sagepub.com/content/3/1/121 online]</ref>\n\nThe concept of \"[[total war]]\" in World War I, meant that food supplies had to be redirected towards the armed forces and, with German commerce being stopped by the British blockade, German civilians were forced to live in increasingly meager conditions. Food prices were first controlled. Bread rationing was introduced in 1915 and worked well; the cost of bread fell.  Allen says there were no signs of starvation and states, \"the sense of domestic catastrophe one gains from most accounts of food rationing in Germany is exaggerated.\"<ref>Keith Allen, \"Sharing scarcity: Bread rationing and the First World War in Berlin, 1914-1923,\" ''Journal of Social History,'' (1998), 32#2, pp. 371-93, quote p. 380.</ref> However  Howard argues that hundreds of thousands of civilians died from malnutrition\u2014usually from a typhus or a disease their weakened body could not resist.

The causes involved the transfer of so many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916-1917 was known as the \"turnip winter,\" because that hardly-edible vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.<ref>Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914-1918'' (2004) p. 141-42</ref> Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.\n\n[[File:Brotmarke Bayern.jpg|thumb|180px|Wartime ration stamps in Bavaria]]\nThe drafting of miners reduced the main energy source, coal. The textile factories produced Army uniforms, and warm clothing for civilians ran short. The device of using [[Wiktionary:ersatz#English|ersatz]] materials, such as paper and cardboard for cloth and leather proved unsatisfactory. Soap was in short supply, as was hot water. All the cities reduced tram services, cut back on street lighting, and closed down theaters and cabarets.\n\nThe food supply increasingly focused on potatoes and bread, it was harder and harder to buy meat. The meat ration in late 1916 was only 31% of peacetime, and it fell to 12% in late 1918. The fish ration was 51% in 1916, and none at all by late 1917. The rations for cheese, butter, rice, cereals, eggs and lard were less than 20% of peacetime levels.<ref>David Welch, ''Germany, Propaganda and Total War, 1914-1918'' (2000) p.122</ref> In 1917 the harvest was poor all across Europe, and the potato supply ran short, and Germans substituted almost inedible turnips; the \"turnip winter\" of 1916\u201317 was remembered with bitter distaste for generations.<ref>Chickering, ''Imperial Germany'', pp. 140-145.</ref>  Early in the war introduced bread rationing, and the system worked fairly well, albeit with shortfalls  during the Turnip Winter and summer of 1918. White bread used imported flour and became unavailable, but there was enough rye or rye-potato flour to provide a minimal diet for all civilians.<ref>Keith Allen, \"Sharing scarcity: Bread rationing and the First World War in Berlin, 1914-1923,\" ''Journal of Social History'' (1998) 32#2, 00224529, Winter98, Vol. 32, Issue 2</ref>\n\nGerman women were not employed in the Army, but large numbers took paid employment in industry and factories, and even larger numbers engaged in volunteer services. Housewives were taught how to cook without milk, eggs or fat; agencies helped widows find work. Banks, insurance companies and government offices for the first time hired women for clerical positions. Factories hired them for unskilled labor \u2013 by December 1917, half the workers in chemicals, metals, and machine tools were women. Laws protecting women in the workplace were relaxed, and factories set up canteens to provide food for their workers, lest their productivity fall off. The food situation in 1918 was better, because the harvest was better, but serious shortages continued, with high prices, and a complete lack of condiments and fresh fruit. Many migrants had flocked into cities to work in industry, which made for overcrowded housing. Reduced coal supplies left everyone in the cold. Daily life involved long working hours, poor health, and little or no recreation, an increasing fears for the safety of loved ones in the Army and in prisoner of war camps. The men who returned from the front were those who had been permanently crippled; wounded soldiers who had recovered were sent back to the trenches.<ref>Alexandra Richie, ''Faust's Metropolis'' (1998), pp. 277-80.</ref>\n\n==Defeat and revolt==\n{{see also|End of World War I}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R34275, Berlin, R\u00fcckkehr deutscher Truppen.jpg|thumb|Demobilization after World War I]]\nMany Germans wanted an end to the war and increasing numbers of Germans began to associate with the political left, such as the Social Democratic Party and the more radical Independent Social Democratic Party which demanded an end to the war. The third reason was the entry of the [[United States]] into the war in April 1917, which tipped the long-run balance of power even more to the Allies.\nThe end of October 1918, in [[Kiel]], in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. Civilian dock workers led a revolt and convinced many sailors to join them; the revolt quickly spread to other cities. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior generals lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government.\n\nIn November 1918, with [[German Revolution|internal revolution]], a stalemated war, [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] suing for peace, [[Austria-Hungary]] falling apart from multiple ethnic tensions, and pressure from the German high command, the Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed a Republic, in cooperation with the business and middle classes, not the revolting workers. The new government led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]] called for and received an [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] on 11 November 1918; in practice it was a surrender, and the Allies kept up the food blockade to guarantee an upper hand. The war was over; the history books closed on the German Empire. It was succeeded by the democratic, yet flawed, [[Weimar Republic]].<ref>A. J. Ryder, ''The German Revolution of 1918: A Study of German Socialism in War and Revolt'' (2008)</ref>\n\nSeven million soldiers and sailors were quickly demobilized, and they became a conservative voice that drowned out the radical left in cities such as Kiel and Berlin. The radicals formed the Spartakusbund and later the Communist Party of Germany.\n\nGermany lost the war because it was overwhelmed by surmounting enemy forces; it was out of soldiers and ideas, and was losing ground every day by October 1918. Nevertheless, it was still in France when the war ended on Nov. 11 giving die-hard nationalists the chance to blame the civilians back home for betraying the army and surrendering. This was the false \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]\" that soured German politics in the 1920s and caused a distrust of democracy and the Weimar government.<ref>Wilhelm Diest and E. J. Feuchtwanger, \"The Military Collapse of the German Empire: the Reality Behind the Stab-in-the-Back Myth,\" ''War in History,'' April 1996, Vol. 3, Issue 2, pp. 186-207.</ref>\n\n==War deaths==\n{{main|World War I casualties}}\nOut of a population of 65 million, Germany suffered 1.7 million military deaths and 430,000 civilian deaths due to wartime causes (especially the food blockade), plus about 17,000 killed in Africa and the other overseas colonies.<ref>Leo Grebler and Wilhelm Winkler, ''The Cost of the World War to Germany and Austria-Hungary'' (Yale University Press, 1940)</ref>\n\nThe Allied blockade continued until July 1919, causing severe additional hardships.<ref>N.P.

This book is a compilation of German soldiers' letters and memoirs. All the references come from this book.</ref> Some examples from letters home:\n\n''\"A terrible picture presented itself to me. A French and a German soldier on their knees were leaning against each other. They had pierced each other with the bayonet and had dropped like this to the ground...Courage, heroism, does it really exist? I am about to doubt it, since I haven't seen anything else than fear, anxiety, and despair in every face during the battle. There was nothing at all like courage, bravery, or the like. In reality, there is nothing else than terrible discipline and coercion propelling the soldiers forward\"'' Dominik Richert, 1914.<ref>''German Soldiers in the Great War'', 77.</ref>\n\n''\"Our men have reached an agreement with the French to cease fire. They bring us bread, wine, sardines etc., we bring them schnapps. The masters make war, they have a quarrel, and the workers, the little men...have to stand there fighting against each other. Is that not a great stupidity?...If this were to be decided according to the number of votes, we would have been long home by now\"'' Hermann Baur, 1915.<ref>''German Soldiers in the Great War'', 64.</ref>\n\n''\"I have no idea what we are still fighting for anyway, maybe because the newspapers portray everything about the war in a false light which has nothing to do with the reality.....There could be no greater misery in the enemy country and at home. The people who still support the war haven't got a clue about anything...If I stay alive, I will make these things public...We all want peace...What is the point of conquering half of the world, when we have to sacrifice all our strength?..You out there, just champion peace! \u2026 We give away all our worldly possessions and even our freedom.

A tight blockade imposed by the [[Royal Navy]] caused severe food shortages in the cities, especially in the winter of 1916\u201317, known as the [[Turnip Winter]].

The beginning of war was presented in Germany as the chance for the nation to secure \"our place under the sun,\" as the Foreign Minister [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]] had put it, which was readily supported by prevalent nationalism among the public. The Kaiser and the German establishment hoped the war would unite the public behind the monarchy, and lessen the threat posed by the dramatic growth of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which had been the most vocal critic of the Kaiser in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] before the war. Despite its membership in the [[Second International]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] ended its differences with the Imperial government and abandoned its principles of internationalism to support the war effort.\n\nIt soon became apparent that Germany was not prepared for a war lasting more than a few months. At first, little was done to regulate the economy for a wartime footing, and the German war economy would remain badly organized throughout the war. Germany depended on imports of food and raw materials, which were stopped by the British [[blockade of Germany]]. Food prices were first limited, then rationing was introduced. In 1915 five million pigs were massacred in the so-called [[Schweinemord]] to both make food and preserve grain.  The winter of 1916/17 was called \"turnip winter\" because the potato harvest was poor and people ate animal feed including vile-tasting turnips. During the war from August 1914 to mid-1919, the excess deaths over peacetime caused by malnutrition and high rates of exhaustion and disease and despair came to about 474,000 civilians.<ref>N.P.

The Germans did not expect this and were delayed, and responded with systematic reprisals on civilians, killing nearly 6,000 Belgian noncombatants, including women and children, and burning 25,000 houses and buildings.<ref>Jeff Lipkes, ''Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914'' (2007)</ref> The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris and initially, the Germans were very successful, particularly in the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] (14\u201324 August). By 12 September, the French with assistance from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British forces]] halted the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5\u201312 September). The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west. The French offensive into Germany launched on 7 August with the [[Battle of Mulhouse]] had limited success.<ref>Barbara Tuchman, ''The Guns of August'' (1962)</ref>\n\nIn the east, only one Field Army defended [[East Prussia]] and when Russia attacked in this region it diverted German forces intended for the Western Front. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] (17 August&nbsp;\u2013 2 September), but this diversion exacerbated problems of insufficient speed of advance from rail-heads not foreseen by the [[German General Staff]]. The Central Powers were thereby denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of obtaining an early victory.\n\n==1916==\n[[File:Armierungs-Bataillon.jpg|thumb|German soldiers digging trenches]]\n1916 was characterized by two great battles on the Western front, at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] and [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]]. They each lasted most of the year, achieved minimal gains, and drained away the best soldiers of both sides. Verdun became the iconic symbol of the murderous power of modern defensive weapons, with 280,000 German casualties, and 315,000 French. At the Somme, there were over 400,000 German casualties, against over 600,000 Allied casualties. At Verdun, the Germans attacked what they considered to be a weak French salient which nevertheless the French would defend for reasons of national pride. The Somme was part of a multinational plan of the Allies to attack on different fronts simultaneously. German woes were also compounded by Russia's grand \"Brusilov offensive\", which diverted more soldiers and resources. Although the Eastern front was held to a standoff and Germany suffered less casualties than their allies with ~150,000 of the ~770,000 Central powers casualties, the simultaneous Verdun offensive stretched the German forces committed to the Somme offensive. German experts are divided in their interpretation of the Somme. Some say it was a standoff, but most see it as a British victory and argue it marked the point at which German morale began a permanent decline and the strategic initiative was lost, along with irreplaceable veterans and confidence.<ref>Fred R. Van Hartesveldt, ''The Battles of the Somme, 1916: Historiography and Annotated Bibliography'' (1996), pp. 26-27.</ref>\n\n==1917==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 104-0669, \u00dcbung deutscher Soldaten mit Flammenwerfer.jpg|thumb|German soldiers operating a flamethrower in 1917]]\nIn early 1917 the SPD leadership became concerned about the activity of its anti-war left-wing which had been organising as the ''Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft'' (SAG, \"Social Democratic Working Group\"). On 17 January they expelled them, and in April 1917 the left-wing went on to form the ''[[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]]'' ({{lang-de|Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands}}). The remaining faction was then known as the ''[[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]]''. This happened as the enthusiasm for war  faded with the enormous numbers of casualties, the dwindling supply of manpower, the mounting difficulties on the homefront, and the never-ending flow of casualty reports. A grimmer and grimmer attitude began to prevail amongst the general population. The highlight only was the first use of [[mustard gas]] in warfare, in the Battle of Ypres.\n\nAfter, morale was helped by victories against Serbia, Greece, Italy, and Russia which made great gains for the Central Powers. Morale was at its greatest since 1914 at the end of 1917 and beginning of 1918 with the defeat of Russia following her rise into revolution, and the German people braced for what [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] said would be the \"Peace Offensive\" in the west.<ref>C.R.M.F. Cruttwell, A History of the Great War: 1914-1918 (1935) ch 15-29</ref><ref>Holger H. Herwig, ''The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914-1918'' (1997) ch. 4-6.</ref>\n\n==1918==\n{{further|Spring Offensive}}\nIn spring 1918, Germany realized that time was running out. It prepared for the decisive strike with new armies and new tactics, hoping to win the war on the Western front before millions of American and British Empire soldiers appeared in battle. General Erich Ludendorff and Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg had full control of the army, they had a large supply of reinforcements moved from the Eastern front, and they trained storm troopers with new tactics to race through the trenches and attack the enemy's command and communications centers. The new tactics would indeed restore mobility to the Western front, but the German army was too optimistic.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917-18 it was \"quiet\" on the Western Front\u2014British casualties averaged \"only\" 3,000 a week. Serious attacks were impossible in the winter because of the deep caramel-thick mud. Quietly the Germans brought in their best soldiers from the eastern front, selected elite storm troops, and trained them all winter in the new tactics. With stopwatch timing, the German artillery would lay down a sudden, fearsome barrage just ahead of its advancing infantry. Moving in small units, firing light machine guns, the storm troopers would bypass enemy strongpoints, and head directly for critical bridges, command posts, supply dumps and, above all, artillery batteries. By cutting enemy communications they would paralyze response in the critical first half hour. By silencing the artillery they would break the enemy's firepower. Rigid schedules sent in two more waves of infantry to mop up the strong points that had been bypassed. The shock troops frightened and disoriented the first line of defenders, who would flee in panic. In one instance an easy-going Allied regiment broke and fled; reinforcements rushed in on bicycles. The panicky men seized the bikes and beat an even faster retreat. The stormtrooper tactics provided mobility, but not increased firepower. Eventually\u2014in 1939 and 1940\u2014the formula would be perfected with the aid of dive bombers and tanks, but in 1918 the Germans lacked both.<ref>Bruce I. Gudmundsson, ''Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation in the German Army, 1914-1918'' (1989), pp. 155-70.</ref>\n\nLudendorff erred by attacking the British first in 1918, instead of the French. He mistakenly thought the British to be too uninspired to respond rapidly to the new tactics. The exhausted, dispirited French perhaps might have folded. The German assaults on the British were ferocious\u2014the largest of the entire war. At the Somme River in March, 63 divisions attacked in a blinding fog. No matter, the German lieutenants had memorized their maps and their orders. The British lost 270,000 men, fell back 40 miles, and then held. They quickly learned how to handle the new German tactics: fall back, abandon the trenches, let the attackers overextend themselves, and then counterattack. They gained an advantage in firepower from their artillery and from tanks used as mobile pillboxes that could retreat and counterattack at will. In April Ludendorff hit the British again, inflicting 305,000 casualties\u2014but he lacked the reserves to follow up. Ludendorff launched five great attacks between March and July, inflicting a million British and French casualties. The Western Front now had opened up\u2014the trenches were still there but the importance of mobility now reasserted itself. The Allies held. The Germans suffered twice as many casualties as they inflicted, including most of their precious stormtroopers. The new German replacements were under-aged youth or embittered middle-aged family men in poor condition. They were not inspired by the elan of 1914, nor thrilled with battle\u2014they hated it, and some began talking of revolution. Ludendorff could not replace his losses, nor could he devise a new brainstorm that might somehow snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. The British likewise were bringing in reinforcements from the whole Empire, but since their home front was in good condition, and since they could see inevitable victory, their morale was higher. The great German spring offensive was a race against time, for everyone could see the Americans were training millions of fresh young men who would eventually arrive on the Western Front.<ref>David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918'' (2011), pp. 30-111.</ref><ref>C.R.M.F.

Germany had used up all the best soldiers they had, and still had not conquered much territory. The British were out of fresh manpower but still had huge reserves from the British Empire, the French nearly exhausted their manpower. Berlin had calculated it would take months for the Americans to ship all their men and supplies\u2014but the U.S. troops arrived much sooner, as they left their supplies behind, and relied on British and French artillery, tanks, airplanes, trucks and equipment. Berlin also assumed that Americans were fat, undisciplined and unaccustomed to hardship and severe fighting. They soon realized their mistake. The Germans reported that \"The qualities of the [Americans] individually may be described as remarkable. They are physically well set up, their attitude is good... They lack at present only training and experience to make formidable adversaries. The men are in fine spirits and are filled with naive assurance.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Allan Millett|title=Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkbAbwcLfAC&pg=PA304|year=1991|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=304|isbn=9780029215968}}</ref>\n\nBy September 1918, the Central Powers were exhausted from fighting, the American forces were pouring into France at a rate of 10,000 a day, the British Empire was mobilised for war peaking at 4.5 million men and 4,000 tanks on the Western Front. The decisive Allied counteroffensive, known as the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], began on 8 August 1918\u2014what Ludendorff called the \"Black Day of the German army.\" The Allied armies advanced steadily as German defenses faltered.<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer C.

They started looking for scapegoats. The hunger and popular dissatisfaction with the war precipitated [[German Revolution|revolution]] throughout Germany. By 11 November Germany had virtually surrendered, the Kaiser and all the royal families had abdicated, and the German Empire had been replaced by the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Home front==\n\n===War fever===\n[[File:Kaiser Wilhelm II Truppenbesuch Ostpreu\u00dfen Lyck 1915.jpg|thumb|Military propaganda postcard: Wounded soldiers cheer to the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who is in a car.]]\nThe \"spirit of 1914\" was the overwhelming, enthusiastic support of all elements of the population for war in 1914. In the Reichstag, the vote for credits was unanimous, with all the Socialists but one ([[Karl Liebknecht]]) joining in. One professor testified to a \"great single feeling of moral elevation of soaring of religious sentiment, in short, the ascent of a whole people to the heights.\"<ref>Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914-1918'' (1998) p. 14</ref> At the same time, there was a level of anxiety; most commentators predicted the short victorious war \u2013 but that hope was dashed in a matter of weeks, as the invasion of Belgium bogged down and the French Army held in front of Paris. The Western Front became a killing machine, as neither army moved more than a few hundred yards at a time. Industry in late 1914 was in chaos, unemployment soared while it took months to reconvert to munitions productions. In 1916, the Hindenburg Program called for the mobilization of all economic resources to produce artillery, shells, and machine guns. Church bells and copper roofs were ripped out and melted down.<ref>Richie, ''Faust's Metropolis'', pp. 272-75.</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nGermany had no plans for mobilizing its civilian economy for the war effort, and no stockpiles of food or critical supplies had been made. Germany had to improvise rapidly. All major political sectors initially supported the war, including the Socialists.\n\nEarly in the war industrialist [[Walter Rathenau]] held senior posts in the Raw Materials Department of the War Ministry, while becoming chairman of AEG upon his father's death in 1915. Rathenau played the key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department ([[Kriegsrohstoffabteilung]] - 'KRA'); he was in charge of it from August 1914 to March 1915 and established the basic policies and procedures. His senior staff were on loan from industry. KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the [[Blockade of Germany|British blockade]], as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices and regulated the distribution to vital war industries. It began the development of ersatz raw materials. KRA suffered many inefficiencies caused by the complexity and selfishness KRA encountered from  commerce, industry, and the government.<ref>D. G.  Williamson, \"Walther Rathenau and the K.R.A. August 1914-March 1915,\" ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Unternehmensgeschichte'' (1978), Issue 11, pp. 118-136.</ref><ref>Hew Strachan, ''The First World War: Volume I: To Arms'' (2001), pp. 1014-49 on Rathenau and KRA.</ref>\n\n[[File:PSM V88 D237 Collecting scrap metal for the german war effort.jpg|thumb|Collecting scrap metal for the war effort, 1916]]\nWhile the KRA handled critical raw materials, the crisis over food supplies grew worse. The mobilization of so many farmers and horses, and the shortages of fertilizer, steadily reduced the food supply. Prisoners of war were sent to work on farms, and many women and elderly men took on work roles. Supplies that had once come in from Russia and Austria were cut off.<ref>Feldman, Gerald D. \"The Political and Social Foundations of Germany's Economic Mobilization, 1914-1916,\" ''Armed Forces & Society'' (1976), 3#1, pp. 121-145. [http://afs.sagepub.com/content/3/1/121 online]</ref>\n\nThe concept of \"[[total war]]\" in World War I, meant that food supplies had to be redirected towards the armed forces and, with German commerce being stopped by the British blockade, German civilians were forced to live in increasingly meager conditions. Food prices were first controlled. Bread rationing was introduced in 1915 and worked well; the cost of bread fell.  Allen says there were no signs of starvation and states, \"the sense of domestic catastrophe one gains from most accounts of food rationing in Germany is exaggerated.\"<ref>Keith Allen, \"Sharing scarcity: Bread rationing and the First World War in Berlin, 1914-1923,\" ''Journal of Social History,'' (1998), 32#2, pp. 371-93, quote p. 380.</ref> However  Howard argues that hundreds of thousands of civilians died from malnutrition\u2014usually from a typhus or a disease their weakened body could not resist.

The causes involved the transfer of so many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916-1917 was known as the \"turnip winter,\" because that hardly-edible vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.<ref>Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914-1918'' (2004) p. 141-42</ref> Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.\n\n[[File:Brotmarke Bayern.jpg|thumb|180px|Wartime ration stamps in Bavaria]]\nThe drafting of miners reduced the main energy source, coal. The textile factories produced Army uniforms, and warm clothing for civilians ran short. The device of using [[Wiktionary:ersatz#English|ersatz]] materials, such as paper and cardboard for cloth and leather proved unsatisfactory. Soap was in short supply, as was hot water. All the cities reduced tram services, cut back on street lighting, and closed down theaters and cabarets.\n\nThe food supply increasingly focused on potatoes and bread, it was harder and harder to buy meat. The meat ration in late 1916 was only 31% of peacetime, and it fell to 12% in late 1918. The fish ration was 51% in 1916, and none at all by late 1917. The rations for cheese, butter, rice, cereals, eggs and lard were less than 20% of peacetime levels.<ref>David Welch, ''Germany, Propaganda and Total War, 1914-1918'' (2000) p.122</ref> In 1917 the harvest was poor all across Europe, and the potato supply ran short, and Germans substituted almost inedible turnips; the \"turnip winter\" of 1916\u201317 was remembered with bitter distaste for generations.<ref>Chickering, ''Imperial Germany'', pp. 140-145.</ref>  Early in the war introduced bread rationing, and the system worked fairly well, albeit with shortfalls  during the Turnip Winter and summer of 1918. White bread used imported flour and became unavailable, but there was enough rye or rye-potato flour to provide a minimal diet for all civilians.<ref>Keith Allen, \"Sharing scarcity: Bread rationing and the First World War in Berlin, 1914-1923,\" ''Journal of Social History'' (1998) 32#2, 00224529, Winter98, Vol. 32, Issue 2</ref>\n\nGerman women were not employed in the Army, but large numbers took paid employment in industry and factories, and even larger numbers engaged in volunteer services. Housewives were taught how to cook without milk, eggs or fat; agencies helped widows find work. Banks, insurance companies and government offices for the first time hired women for clerical positions. Factories hired them for unskilled labor \u2013 by December 1917, half the workers in chemicals, metals, and machine tools were women. Laws protecting women in the workplace were relaxed, and factories set up canteens to provide food for their workers, lest their productivity fall off. The food situation in 1918 was better, because the harvest was better, but serious shortages continued, with high prices, and a complete lack of condiments and fresh fruit. Many migrants had flocked into cities to work in industry, which made for overcrowded housing. Reduced coal supplies left everyone in the cold. Daily life involved long working hours, poor health, and little or no recreation, an increasing fears for the safety of loved ones in the Army and in prisoner of war camps. The men who returned from the front were those who had been permanently crippled; wounded soldiers who had recovered were sent back to the trenches.<ref>Alexandra Richie, ''Faust's Metropolis'' (1998), pp. 277-80.</ref>\n\n==Defeat and revolt==\n{{see also|End of World War I}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R34275, Berlin, R\u00fcckkehr deutscher Truppen.jpg|thumb|Demobilization after World War I]]\nMany Germans wanted an end to the war and increasing numbers of Germans began to associate with the political left, such as the Social Democratic Party and the more radical Independent Social Democratic Party which demanded an end to the war. The third reason was the entry of the [[United States]] into the war in April 1917, which tipped the long-run balance of power even more to the Allies.\nThe end of October 1918, in [[Kiel]], in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. Civilian dock workers led a revolt and convinced many sailors to join them; the revolt quickly spread to other cities. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior generals lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government.\n\nIn November 1918, with [[German Revolution|internal revolution]], a stalemated war, [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] suing for peace, [[Austria-Hungary]] falling apart from multiple ethnic tensions, and pressure from the German high command, the Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed a Republic, in cooperation with the business and middle classes, not the revolting workers. The new government led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]] called for and received an [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] on 11 November 1918; in practice it was a surrender, and the Allies kept up the food blockade to guarantee an upper hand. The war was over; the history books closed on the German Empire. It was succeeded by the democratic, yet flawed, [[Weimar Republic]].<ref>A. J. Ryder, ''The German Revolution of 1918: A Study of German Socialism in War and Revolt'' (2008)</ref>\n\nSeven million soldiers and sailors were quickly demobilized, and they became a conservative voice that drowned out the radical left in cities such as Kiel and Berlin. The radicals formed the Spartakusbund and later the Communist Party of Germany.\n\nGermany lost the war because it was overwhelmed by surmounting enemy forces; it was out of soldiers and ideas, and was losing ground every day by October 1918. Nevertheless, it was still in France when the war ended on Nov. 11 giving die-hard nationalists the chance to blame the civilians back home for betraying the army and surrendering. This was the false \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]\" that soured German politics in the 1920s and caused a distrust of democracy and the Weimar government.<ref>Wilhelm Diest and E. J.

Germany after 1990 is referred to by historians as the '''Berlin Republic''' (''Berliner Republik''). This time period is also determined by the ongoing process of the \"[[inner reunification]]\" of the formerly divided country.\n\n== Chancellorship of Helmut Kohl in a reunited Germany (1990\u20131998) ==\n\n=== Five new states ===\n{{Main|New states of Germany}}\n[[File:KohlModrowMomperBrandenburgerTor.jpg|thumb|alt=Helmut Kohl addressing crowd|Helmut Kohl after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989]]\nOn October 3, 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] was dissolved, five states were recreated ([[Brandenburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]]) and the new states became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, an event known as the [[German Reunification]].\n\nElections for new state parliaments were held in the five states on October 14, and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] became the largest party in all states except Brandenburg, where the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] became the largest party.\n\nThe reunified [[Berlin]] became the capital of Germany on October 3, although the government continued to have its seat in Bonn until 1999. December 2 marks the first elections for the city parliament after reunification.\n\n=== Kohl's fourth term ===\nThe first federal election after reunification, the [[1990 German federal election|1990 federal election]], took place on December 2 in that year. The CDU became the largest party with 43.8%, followed by the SPD (33.5%) and the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (11%).<ref>Karl Hugo Pruys, ''Kohl: Genius of the Present: A Biography of Helmut Kohl'' (1996)</ref><ref>Diethelm Prowe, \"Kohl and the German Reunification Era,\" ''Journal of Modern History,'' March 2002, Vol. 74 Issue 1, pp 120-38 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/343370 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nOn June 20, 1991, the [[Bundestag]] decided that the parliament and parts of the government and central administration [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|would be relocated]] from [[Bonn]] to the capital, Berlin. At this time, the term \"Berlin Republic\" (alluding to the Cold War era \"[[West Germany|Bonn Republic]]\" and the [[interwar period]] \"[[Weimar Republic]]\") emerged.\n\n[[Roman Herzog]], a former Judge at the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]], was elected [[President of Germany]] in 1994, succeeding [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]].\n\n=== Kohl's fifth term ===\nFollowing the [[1994 German federal election|1994 federal election]], Helmut Kohl was reelected as Chancellor for his fifth and last term.\n<!-- \nAm 16. Oktober 1994 best\u00e4tigten die [[Bundestagswahl 1994|Bundestagswahlen]] die Regierung von [[Helmut Kohl]] im Amt. Die B\u00fcndnisgr\u00fcnen schafften den Sprung \u00fcber die 5-Prozent-H\u00fcrde, die PDS zog wieder in den Bundestag ein, da sie in Berlin drei [[Direktmandat]]e gewinnen konnte. Die [[Treuhandanstalt]], die das Staatsverm\u00f6gen der DDR privatisieren sollte, wurde aufgel\u00f6st. Die ''[[Deutsch-Tschechische Erkl\u00e4rung]]'' vom Januar 1997 versuchte, Irritationen im Verh\u00e4ltnis der beiden Nachbarstaaten auszur\u00e4umen. Im Juni 1997 verw\u00fcstete das [[Oderhochwasser 1997|Hochwasser der Oder]] ganze Landstriche. -->\n\n== Chancellorship of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (1998\u20132005) ==\n[[File:Vladimir Putin with Gerhard Schroeder-1.jpg|thumb|Schr\u00f6der with [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow on 9 May 2005]]\n\n=== First term ===\nThe ruling liberal-conservative coalition government, consisting of the [[CDU/CSU]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], lost the [[1998 German federal election|1998  federal election]], and [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] was elected as Chancellor, the head of a coalition government consisting of his own [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] party and [[The Greens (Germany)|The Greens]]. [[Joschka Fischer]], a leading Green politician, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister.\n\nShortly after the formation of the government, Minister of Finance [[Oskar Lafontaine]], a former SPD chairman and rival of Schr\u00f6der, resigned from the cabinet. He was succeeded as Minister of Finance by [[Hans Eichel]].\n\nIn 1998, it became known that the CDU/CSU had received anonymous funding. Helmut Kohl subsequently resigned as honorary party chairman, and in 2000, [[Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble]] resigned as party chairman. [[Angela Merkel]], the Secretary General of the CDU since 1998, emerged as a leading figure in the party and was elected chairwoman in 2000.\n\n[[File:Johannes Rau 2001.jpeg|thumb|Border|left|alt=Johannes Rau at the Kirchentag|Johannes Rau at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]] in 2001]]\n\nIn 1999, [[Johannes Rau]] was elected President of Germany. Rau had tried to be elected president for several years.\n\nA large tax reform was implemented in 2000. After 2003, the federal government enacted a number of reforms in social and health policy, known as [[Agenda 2010]]. The Schr\u00f6der government also stressed environmental issues and promoted the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]].\n\nGermany took part in the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO war against Yugoslavia]] in 1999, when German forces saw combat for the first time since World War II. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der supported the [[war on terror]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] against the United States, and Germany sent forces to [[Afghanistan]]. Germany also sent forces to [[Kosovo]] and other parts of the world.\n\nIn 1999, Germany partially adopted the [[Euro]], which completely replaced the [[Deutsche Mark]] as the currency of Germany in 2002.\n\nSeveral German cities, notably [[Dresden]] and [[Magdeburg]], experienced severe flooding during the [[2002 European floods]].\n\n=== Second term ===\n\nIn 2002, [[Edmund Stoiber]] was the candidate for Chancellor for the [[CDU/CSU]], the first time a CSU politician was chancellor candidate since the candidacy of [[Franz Josef Strauss]] in 1980. Both CDU/CSU and the SPD polled 38.5% in the [[2002 German federal election|2002 federal election]]. Since the Greens became larger than the liberals, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's government was reelected.\n\nGermany and France vehemently opposed the 2003 [[Iraq War]], leading the administration of [[George W. Bush]] to label Germany and France as the [[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]], as opposed to the countries (mainly former east bloc countries) that supported the war. However, Germany supported the United States militarily in other parts of the world, notably in the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Kuwait]].\n\n[[File:Horst K\u00f6hler.jpg|thumb|upright|President Horst K\u00f6hler]]\n\nThe early 2000s saw increased unemployment and an aging population. The government instituted further reforms to meet these challenges, known as the [[Hartz concept|Hartz reforms]]. However, as the [[Bundesrat of Germany]] had a CDU/CSU majority, the government of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was dependent on support from the conservatives in order to pass legislation.\n\nOn May 23, 2004, [[Horst K\u00f6hler]], the former head of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and a CDU politician, was elected [[President of Germany]]. K\u00f6hler, who was previously relatively unknown in Germany, quickly became one of the country's most popular politicians.\n\nAfter a bitter defeat for the SPD in state elections in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (22 May 2005), Chancellor Schr\u00f6der asked the German [[Bundestag]] (lower house of parliament) for a [[Constructive Vote of No Confidence|vote of no-confidence]].

In addition, they made up numerous large land owners, military officers, and the upper echelons of the imperial service, engineers, scientists, artists, physicians, and the [[bourgeoisie]] in general, because there was strong education among some of the German peoples. The Germans of Russia did not necessarily speak Russian; many spoke German, while French was often used as the language of the high aristocracy. Depending on geography and other circumstances, many Russian-Germans spoke Russian as their first or second language. During the 19th century, many of the early immigrants began to identify primarily as Russians, and particularly during and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  The large numbers of farmers and village tradesmen who arrived following Catherine the Great's invitation were allowed to settle in German-only villages and keep their German language, religion, and culture until the 1920s. She was seeking to repopulate some areas devastated by the Ottoman invasion and disease. \n\nToday's Russian Germans speak mostly [[Russian language|Russian]] as they are in the gradual process of assimilation. As such, many may not necessarily be fluent in German. Consequently, Germany has recently strictly limited their immigration to that nation. A decline in the number of Germans in the Russian Federation has moderated as they are no longer emigrating to Germany. In addition, [[Kazakh Germans]] from [[Kazakhstan]] are moving to Russia rather than Germany. As conditions for the Germans in Russia generally deteriorated in the late 19th century and early 20th century during the period of unrest and revolution, many ethnic Germans migrated from Russia to the Americas and elsewhere. They are collectively known as [[Germans from Russia]].\n\n==Germans in Imperial Russia (partitioned Poland and Caucasus)==\n[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the [[Hanseatic League]]]]\nGerman merchants established a trading post at [[Novgorod]], which they called Peterhof.  In 1229, German merchants at Novgorod were granted certain privileges that made their positions more secure.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu }}</ref>\n\nThe earliest German settlement in [[Moscow]] dates to the reign of [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]], Grand Prince of Moscow, from 1505 to 1533. A handful of German and Dutch craftsmen and traders were allowed to settle in Moscow's [[German Quarter]] (''\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430'', or Nemetskaya ''[[sloboda]]''), as they provided essential technical skills in the capital. Gradually, this policy extended to a few other major cities. In 1682, Moscow had about 200,000 citizens; some 18,000 were classified as ''Nemtsy'', which means either \"German\" or \"western foreigner\".\n\nThe international community located in the German Quarter greatly influenced [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682-1725). His efforts to transform Russia into a more modern European state are believed to have derived in large part from his experiences among Russia's established Germans.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By the late 17th-century, foreigners were no longer so rare in Russian cities, and Moscow's German Quarter had lost its ethnic character by the end of that century.\n\n===Vistula Germans (Poland)===\n{{main article|Vistula Germans}}\n{{see also|Ol\u0119drzy}}\nThrough wars and the partitions of Poland, [[Prussia]] acquired an increasing amount of northern, western, and central Polish territory. The [[Vistula River]] flows south to north, with its mouth on the [[Baltic Sea]] near [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (now [[Gda\u0144sk]]). Germans and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settled its valley beginning at the sea coast and gradually moving further south to the interior. Eventually, Prussia acquired most of the Vistula's watershed, and the central portion of then-Poland became [[South Prussia]]. Its existence was brief - 1793 to 1806, but by its end many German settlers had established [[Protestant]] agricultural settlements within its earlier borders. By contrast, most Polish were Roman Catholics. Some German [[Roman Catholics]] also entered the region from the southwest, especially the area of Prussian [[Silesia]]. The [http://www.upstreamvistula.org/History/Breyer_Map.htm 1935 \"Breyer Map\"] shows the distribution of German settlements in what became central Poland.\n\n[[Napoleon]]'s victories ended the short existence of South Prussia. The French Emperor incorporated that and other territories into the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. After Napoleon's defeat in 1815, however, the Duchy was divided. Prussia annexed the western [[Grand Duchy of Posen|Posen]] region, and what is now central Poland became the Russian client-state known as [[Congress Poland]]. Many Germans continued to live in this central region, maintaining their middle-German Prussian dialect, similar to the Silesian dialect, and their Protestant and Catholic religions. (The Russian population was primarily [[Russian Orthodox]], which was the established national church.) \n\nDuring World Wars I and II, the eastern front was fought over in this area. The Soviet government increased conscription of young men. The rate of Vistula Germans' migrations to this area from Congress Poland increased. Some became [[German minority in Poland|Polonized]], however, and their descendants remain in Poland. \n\nDuring the last year and after World War II, many ethnic Germans fled or were forcibly [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|expelled by the Russians and the Poles]] from Eastern Europe, particularly those who had maintained their German language and separate religions. The Russians and Poles blamed them for being allies of the Nazis and the reason that Nazi Germany had invaded the East in its program of ''[[lebensraum]].'' The Germans were also held to have abused the native populations in internal warfare, allied with the Germans during their occupation. Under the [[Potsdam Agreement]], major population transfers were agreed to by the allies. The deportees generally lost all their property and were often attacked during their deportations. Those who survived joined millions of other [[displaced peoples]] on the road after the war.\n\n===Volga Germans (Russia)===\n{{Main article|Volga Germans}}\n[[File:Catherine II in youth by A.R. Lisiewska (de Gasc), 1742, Russian Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Catherine the Great]] - the most famous Russian Empress of German descent]]<!--She was known as very attractive woman, and a younger image should be found!-->\nTsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] was German, born in [[Stettin]] in Pomerania (now [[Szczecin]] in Poland). After gaining her power, she proclaimed open immigration for foreigners wishing to live in the Russian Empire on July 22, 1763, marking the beginning of a wave of German migration to the Empire. She wanted German farmers to redevelop farmland that had been fallow after conflict with the Ottomans. German [[colony (Russia)|colonies]] were founded in the lower [[Volga river]] area almost immediately afterward. These early colonies were attacked during the [[Yemelyan Pugachev|Pugachev uprising]], which was centred on the Volga area, but they survived the rebellion.\n\nGerman immigration was motivated in part by religious intolerance and warfare in central Europe, as well as by frequently difficult economic conditions, particularly among the southern principalities. Catherine II's declaration freed German immigrants from requirements for military service (which was imposed on native Russians) and from most taxes. It placed the new arrivals outside of Russia's feudal hierarchy and granted them considerable internal autonomy. Moving to Russia gave German immigrants political rights that they would not have possessed in their own lands. Religious minorities found these terms very agreeable, particularly [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] from the [[Vistula River]] valley. Their unwillingness to participate in military service, and their long tradition of dissent from mainstream [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]], made life under the Prussians very difficult for them. Nearly all of the Prussian Mennonites emigrated to Russia over the following century, leaving no more than a handful in Prussia.\n\nOther German minority churches took advantage of Catherine II's offer as well, particularly [[Evangelical Christians]] such as the [[Baptists]]. Although Catherine's declaration forbade them from proselytising among members of the [[Orthodox church]], they could evangelize Russia's [[Muslim]] and other non-Christian minorities.\n\nGerman colonization was most intense in the [[Lower Volga]], but other areas also received immigrants. Many settled in the area around the [[Black Sea]], and the Mennonites favoured the lower [[Dnieper river]] area, around Ekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipro]]) and Aleksandrovsk (now [[Zaporizhia]]).\n\nIn 1803 Catherine II's grandson, [[Tsar Alexander I]], reissued her proclamation. In the chaos of the [[Napoleonic wars]], Germans responded in great number, fleeing their wartorn land. The Tsar's administration eventually imposed minimum financial requirements on new immigrants, requiring them to have either 300 [[South German gulden|gulden]] in cash or special skills in order to be accepted for entry to Russia.\n\nThe abolition of [[serfdom]] in the Russian Empire in 1863 created a shortage of labour in agriculture. The need for workers attracted new German immigration, particularly from the increasingly crowded central European states. There was no longer enough fertile land there for full employment in agriculture.\n\nFurthermore, a sizable portion of Russia's ethnic Germans migrated into Russia from its Polish possessions. The 18th-century [[partitions of Poland]] (1772\u20131795) dismantled the Polish-Lithuanian state, dividing it between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Many Germans already living in those parts of Poland transferred to Russia, dating back to [[medieval]] and later migrations. Many Germans in Congress Poland migrated further east into Russia between then and [[World War I]], particularly in the aftermath of the [[November Uprising|Polish insurrection of 1830]]. The [[January Uprising|Polish insurrection in 1863]] added a new wave of German emigration from Poland to those who had already moved east, and led to the founding of extensive German colonies in [[Volhynia]]. When Poland reclaimed its independence in 1918 after [[World War I]], it ceased to be a source of German emigration to Russia, but by then many hundreds of thousands of Germans had already settled in enclaves across the Russian Empire.\n\nGermans settled in the [[Caucasus|Caucasus area]] from the beginning of the 19th century and in the 1850s expanded into the [[Crimea]]. In the 1890s new German colonies opened in the [[Altay Mountains|Altay mountain]] area in Russian Asia (see [[Mennonite settlements of Altai]]). German colonial areas continued to expand in [[Ukraine]] as late as the beginning of [[World War I]].\n\n[[File:German language in the Russian Empire (1897).svg|thumb|260px|Geographic distribution of German language in the [[Russian Empire]] according to 1897 census]]\nAccording to the [[Russian Empire Census|first census of the Russian Empire]] in 1897, about 1.8 million respondents reported German as their [[mother tongue]].\n\n===Black Sea Germans (Moldova and Ukraine)===\n\n{{main article|Black Sea Germans|Russian Mennonites|South Ukraine}}\n\nThe Black Sea Germans - including the [[Bessarabian Germans]] and the [[Dobrujan Germans]] - settled the territories of the northern bank of the [[Black Sea]] in present-day Ukraine in the late 18th and 19th centuries. [[Catherine the Great]] had gained this land for Russia through her two wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1768\u20131774) and from the annexation of the [[Crimean Khanate]]s (1783). \n\nThe area of settlement did not develop as compact as that of the [[Volga]] territory, and a chain of ethnic German colonies resulted. The first German settlers arrived in 1787, first from [[West Prussia]], followed by immigrants from [[Western Germany|Western]] and Southwestern Germany (including Roman Catholics), and from the [[Warsaw]] area. Also many Germans, beginning in 1803, immigrated from the northeastern area of [[Alsace]] west of the [[Rhine River]]. They settled roughly 30 miles northeast of Odessa (city) in Ukraine, forming several enclaves that quickly expanded, resulting in daughter colonies springing up nearby.<ref>Karl Stumpp, \"The Emigration From Germany to Russia in the Years 1763-1862\"</ref>\n\n;Crimea\n{{main article|Crimea Germans|Crimean Goths}}\n\nFrom 1783 onward the Crown initiated a systematic settlement of [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], and Germans in the [[Crimean Peninsula]] (in what was then the [[Crimean Khanate]]) in order to dilute the native population of the [[Crimean Tatars]].\n\nIn 1939, around 60,000 of the 1.1 million inhabitants of Crimea were ethnic German. Two years later, following the end of the alliance and the Nazi German invasion of the Soviet Union, the government [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] ethnic Germans from the Crimea to [[Central Asia]] in the Soviet Union's program of population transfers. Conditions were harsh and many of the deportees died. It was not until the period of [[perestroika]] in the late 1980s that the government granted surviving ethnic Germans and their descendants the right to return from Central Asia to the peninsula.\n\n===Volhynian Germans (Poland and Ukraine)===\n[[File:Deutsche Siedlungsgebiete in Osteuropa 1925.jpg|thumb|250px|Germans in Ukraine, 1925]]\nThe migration of Germans into [[Volhynia]] ({{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} covering northwestern [[Ukraine]] from a short distance west of Kiev to the border with Poland) occurred under significantly different conditions than those described above. By the end of the 19th century, Volhynia had more than 200,000 German settlers.<ref>[https://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Volhynians.htm The Germans from Volhynia and Russian Poland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305173610/http://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Volhynians.htm |date=2012-03-05 }}, University of Alberta, Canada</ref> Their migration began as encouraged by local noblemen, often Polish landlords, who wanted to develop their significant land-holdings in the area for agricultural use. Probably 75% or more of the Germans came from Congress Poland, with the balance coming directly from other regions such as East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Posen, W\u00fcrttemberg, and [[Galician Germans|Galicia]], among others. Although the noblemen offered certain incentives for the relocations, the Germans of Volhynia received none of the government's special tax and military service freedoms granted to Germans in other areas.\n\nShortly after 1800, the first German families started moving into the area. A surge occurred after the first [[November Uprising|Polish rebellion of 1831]] but by 1850, Germans still numbered only about 5000. The largest migration came after the second [[January Uprising|Polish rebellion of 1863]], and Germans began to flood into the area by the thousands. By 1900 they numbered about 200,000. The vast majority of these Germans were Protestant [[Lutheran Church|Lutherans]] (in Europe they were referred to as Evangelicals). Limited numbers of [[Mennonites]] from the lower Vistula River region settled in the south part of Volhynia. [[Baptists]] and [[Moravian Brethren]] settled mostly northwest of [[Zhitomir]]. Another major difference between the Germans here and in other parts of Russia is that the other Germans tended to settle in larger communities. The Germans in Volhynia were scattered about in over 1400 villages. Though the population peaked in 1900, many Germans had already begun leaving Volhynia in the late 1880s for North and South America.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1915, a small group of Volhynian German farmers (36 families - more than 200 people) chose to move to Eastern Siberia, making use of the resettlement subsidies of the government's [[Stolypin reform]] of 1906\u20131911. They settled in three villages (Pikhtinsk, Sredne-Pikhtinsk, and Dagnik) in what is today [[Zalarinsky District]] of [[Irkutsk Oblast]], where they became known as the \"Bug Hollanders\". They apparently were not using the German language any more, but rather spoke Ukrainian and Polish. They used [[Lutheran]] [[Bible]]s that had been printed in [[East Prussia]], in the [[Polish language|Polish]] form known as [[fraktur]]. Their descendants, many with German surnames, continue to live in the district into the 21st century.<ref>Olga Solovyova (\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430) [http://www.strana-oz.ru/?numid=27&article=1189 \"Bug 'Hollanders'\" (\u0411\u0423\u0416\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0415 \u0413\u041e\u041b\u0415\u041d\u0414\u0420\u042b)] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n===Caucasus Germans===\n{{main article|Caucasus Germans}}\nA German minority of about 100,000 people existed in the [[Caucasus]] region, in areas such as the [[North Caucasus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan]]. In 1941 [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered all inhabitants with a German father to be deported, mostly to [[Siberia]] or [[Kazakhstan]].\n\n==Decline of the Russian Germans==\n{{see also|Soviet\u2013German relations before 1941#Volksdeutsche in the Soviet Union}}\nThe decline of the Russian German community started with the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. In 1871, he repealed the open-door immigration policy of his ancestors, effectively ending any new German immigration into the Empire. Although the German colonies continued to expand, they were driven by natural growth and by the immigration of Germans from Poland.\n\nThe Russian nationalism that took root under Alexander II served as a justification for eliminating in 1871 the bulk of the tax privileges enjoyed by Russian Germans, and after 1874 they were subjected to military service. Only after long negotiations, Mennonites, traditionally a pacifist denomination, were allowed to serve alternative service in the form of work in [[Forestry service (Russia)|forestry]] and the medical corps. The resulting disaffection motivated many Russian Germans, especially members of traditionally dissenting churches, to migrate to the United States and Canada, while many Catholics chose Brazil and Argentina. They moved primarily to the American [[Great Plains]] and western Canada, especially [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], and [[Colorado]]; to Canada [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Alberta]]; to Brazil, especially [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]; and to Argentina, especially South of [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Entre R\u00edos Province]] and [[La Pampa Province]]. North Dakota and South Dakota attracted primarily Odessa (Black Sea area) Germans from Russia while Nebraska and Kansas attracted mainly Volga Germans from Russia. The majority of Volhynia Germans chose Canada as their destination with significant numbers later migrating to the United States. Smaller settlement pockets also occurred in other regions such as Volga and Volhynian Germans in southwestern Michigan, Volhynian Germans in Wisconsin, and Congress Poland and Volhynian Germans in Connecticut.\n\nAfter 1881, Russian Germans were required to study [[Russian language|Russian]] in school and lost all their remaining special privileges. Many Germans remained in Russia, particularly those who had done well as Russia began to industrialise in the late 19th century. Russian Germans were disproportionately represented among Russia's engineers, technical tradesmen, industrialists, financiers and large land owners.\n\n[[World War I]] was the first time Russia went to war against Germany since the [[Napoleonic era]], and Russian Germans were quickly suspected of having enemy sympathies. The Germans living in the [[Volhynia]] area were deported to the German colonies in the lower [[Volga river]] in 1915 when Russia started losing the war. Many Russian Germans were exiled to [[Siberia]] by the Tsar's government as enemies of the state - generally without trial or evidence. In 1916, an order was issued to deport the Volga Germans to the east as well, but the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] prevented this from being carried out.\n\nThe loyalties of Russian Germans during the revolution varied. While many supported the royalist forces and joined the [[White Army]], others were committed to [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], to the [[Bolshevik]]s, and even to smaller forces like [[Nestor Makhno]]'s. Russian Germans - including Mennonites and [[Evangelical Christians|Evangelicals]] - fought on all sides in the Russian Revolution and [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. Although some Russian Germans were very wealthy, others were quite poor and sympathised strongly with their Slavic neighbours. Educated Russian Germans were just as likely to have leftist and revolutionary sympathies as the ethnically Russian intelligentsia.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-037542, Westpreu\u00dfen, Russlanddeutsche Fl\u00fcchtlinge.jpg|thumb|1920, a German peasant couple from the Volga region in the refugee camp [[Schneidem\u00fchl]], [[Posen-West Prussia]] (now [[Pi\u0142a]], Poland).]]\nIn the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the civil war that followed it, many ethnic Germans were displaced within Russia or emigrated from Russia altogether. The chaos surrounding the Russian Civil War was devastating to many German communities, particularly to religious dissenters like the Mennonites. Many Mennonites hold the forces of Nestor Makhno in Ukraine particularly responsible for large-scale violence against their community.\n\nThis period was also one of regular food shortages, caused by famine and the lack of long-distance transportation of food during the fighting. Coupled with the [[typhus]] epidemic and [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]] of the early 1920s,<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/131043 The Volga Germans and the Famine of 1921]</ref> as many as a third of Russia's Germans may have perished. Russian German organisations in the Americas, particularly the [[Mennonite Central Committee]], organised famine relief in Russia in the late 1920s. As the chaos faded and the [[Soviet Union]]'s position became more secure, many Russian Germans simply took advantage of the end of the fighting to emigrate to the Americas. Emigration from the Soviet Union came to a halt in 1929 by Stalin's decree, leaving roughly one million Russian Germans within Soviet borders.\n\nThe Soviet Union seized the farms and businesses of Russian Germans, along with all other farms and businesses, when Stalin ended [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] in 1929 and began the forced [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization of agriculture]] and liquidation of large land holdings.\n\n[[File:Volga German03.png|thumb|250px|left|Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, 1924-1941]]\nNonetheless, [[Korenizatsiya|Soviet nationalities policy]] had, to some degree, restored the institutions of Russian Germans in some areas. In July 1924, the [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was founded, giving the [[Volga Germans]] some autonomous German language institutions. The [[Lutheran church]], like nearly all religious affiliations in Russia, was ruthlessly suppressed under Stalin. But, for the 600,000-odd Germans living in the Volga German ASSR, German was the language of local officials for the first time since 1881.\n\nAs a result of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, Stalin decided to deport\nthe German Russians to internal exile and forced labor in Siberia and Central Asia. It is evident \nthat, at this point, the regime considered national minorities with ethnic ties to foreign states, \nsuch as Germans, potential fifth columnists. On August 12, 1941, the Central Committee of the \nCommunist Party decreed the expulsion of the Volga Germans, allegedly for treasonous activity, \nfrom their autonomous republic on the lower Volga. On September 7, 1941, the Volga German \nAutonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was abolished and about 438,000 Volga Germans were \ndeported. In subsequent months, an additional 400,000 ethnic Germans were deported to Siberia\nfrom their other traditional settlements such as Ukraine and the Crimea.\n\nThe Soviets were not successful in expelling all German settlers living in the Western and \nSouthern Ukraine, however, due to the rapid advance of the Wehrmacht (German Army). The \nsecret police, the NKVD, was able to deport only 35% of the ethnic Germans from Ukraine. \nThus in 1943, the Nazi German census registered 313,000 ethnic Germans living in the occupied \nterritories of the Soviet Union. With the Soviet re-conquest, the Wehrmacht evacuated about \n300,000 German Russians and brought them back to the Reich. Because of the provisions of the \nYalta Agreement, all former Soviet citizens living in Germany at war's end had to be repatriated, \nmost by force. More than 200,000 German Russians were deported, against their will, by the \nAllies and sent to the Gulag . Thus, shortly after the end of the war, more than one million ethnic\nGermans from Russia were in special settlements and labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia. It \nis estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 died of starvation, lack of shelter, over-work, and disease \nduring the 1940s.<ref>Ulrich Merten, Voices from the Gulag, the Oppression of the German Minority in the Soviet Union, (American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, Lincoln, Nebraska,2015){{ISBN|978-0-692-60337-6}}, pp 2,3,166</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 1948, Stalin made the banishment permanent, declaring that Russia's Germans were permanently forbidden from returning to Europe, but this was rescinded after his death in 1953. Many Russian Germans returned to European Russia, but quite a few remained in Soviet Asia.\n\nAlthough the post-Stalin Soviet state no longer persecuted ethnic Germans as a group, their Soviet republic was not re-founded. Many Germans in Russia largely assimilated and integrated into Russian society. There were some 2 million ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union in 1989.<ref>[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/order/german_language/stricker.html Germans from Russia Heritage Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705164825/http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/order/german_language/stricker.html |date=2008-07-05 }}</ref> [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet Union census]] revealed in 1989 that 49% of the German minority named German their mother tongue.

Baltic Germans were also the target of Estonian and Latvian nationalist movements.\n\nIn late 1939 (''after'' the start of the Second World War), the entire remaining Baltic German community was repatriated by [[Adolf Hitler]] to areas Nazi Germany had invaded in western Poland (especially in the [[Warthegau]]). The \"legal\" basis for this was agreed in the August 1939 [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and the subsequent [[Nazi\u2013Soviet population transfers]] which had given the [[Soviet Union]] a green light to invade and annex Latvia and Estonia in 1940.\n\nOnly a handful of Baltic Germans remained under Soviet rule after 1945 mainly among those few who refused Germany's call to leave the Baltics.\n\n==Famous Russian-Germans==\n[[File:Kress Interfax.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Viktor Kress]] was the governor (1991\u20132012) of [[Tomsk Oblast]], Russia]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 2 January 2008-2.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Gazprom]] chairman [[Alexei Miller]] with Russian President Putin]]\n\n* [[Catherine the Great]] \u2013 Empress of Russia\n* [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)]] \u2013 Empress Consort of Russia\n* [[Peter Wittgenstein]], field marshal\n* [[Karl Nesselrode]] \u2013 count and diplomat (1780\u20131862)\n* [[Pavel Pestel]], one of Decembrist leaders  \n* [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]] (''Vyacheslav Pleve'') \u2013 Minister of the Interior (1846\u20131904)\n* [[Vladimir Pachmann]] \u2013 pianist (1848\u20131933)\n* [[Sergei Yulyevich Witte]] \u2013 Ministry of Ways and Communications + Finance, chairman of the Committee of Ministers (1849\u20131915)\n* [[Pyotr Schmidt]] \u2013 Russian naval officer and 1905 revolutionary (1867\u20131906)\n* [[Olga Knipper]]-Chekhova \u2013 actress, wife of [[Anton Chekhov]] (1868\u20131959)\n* [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] (Karl Kasimir Theodor Meyerhold) \u2013 actor and theatre director (1874\u20131940)\n* [[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re]] (Reinhold Ernst Glier) \u2013 composer (1875\u20131956)\n* [[Gustav Klinger]] \u2013 communist politician (1876\u20131937)\n* [[Max Vasmer]] \u2013 linguist, author of the Etymological dictionary of the Russian language (1886\u20131962)\n* [[Immanuel Winkler]] (1886\u20131932) \u2013 Pastor, official representative of Black Seas Germans\n* [[Otto Schmidt]] \u2013 geophysicist and statesman (1891\u20131956)\n* [[Vasiliy Ulrikh]] (Vasiliy Ulrich) \u2013 Soviet political judge (1889\u20131951)\n* [[Nikolai Erdmann]] \u2013 dramatist (1900\u20131970)\n* [[Vilyam Genrikhovich Fischer]] [[Rudolf Abel]] \u2013 Soviet intelligence officer (1903\u20131971)\n* [[Tatjana Iwanowna Peltzer]] \u2013 actress (1904\u20131992)\n* [[Boris Rauschenbach]] \u2013 physicist and engineer (1915\u20132001)\n* [[Sviatoslav Richter]] \u2013 pianist (1915\u20131997)\n* [[Patriarch Alexy II]] (Alexey Ridiger) \u2013 primate of the Russian Orthodox Church (1929\u20132008)\n* [[Alfred Schnittke]] \u2013 composer (1934\u20131998)\n* [[Anna German]] (Anna H\u00f6rmann) \u2013 singer (1936\u20131982)\n* [[Jeanna Friske]] / born Jeanna Vladimirovna Kopylova (\u0416\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435) \u2013 singer, model, actress, socialite (1974\u20132015)\n* [[Alisa Freindlich]] \u2013 actress\n* [[Eduard Rossel]] \u2013 governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast\n* [[Viktor Kress]] \u2013 governor of Tomsk Oblast\n* [[German Gref]] (Hermann Gr\u00e4f) \u2013 Minister of Economics and Trade\n* [[Alexei Miller]] \u2013 Gazprom CEO\n* [[Edgar Gess]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Peter Neust\u00e4dter]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Andreas Wolf]] \u2013 football player (born 1982)\n* [[Alexander Merkel]] \u2013 football player (born 1992)\n* [[Georgy Boos]] \u2013 governor of Kaliningrad Oblast\n* [[Julia Neigel]] \u2013 singer and songwriter\n* [[Angelina Gr\u00fcn]] \u2013 volleyball player\n* [[Wladimir K\u00f6ppen]] \u2013 meteorologist\n* [[Irina Mikitenko]] \u2013 long-distance runner\n* [[Dennis Siver]] \u2013 mixed martial arts fighter\n* [[Brad Wall]] \u2013 Premier of Saskatchewan\n*[[Dennis Wolf]] -

In addition, they made up numerous large land owners, military officers, and the upper echelons of the imperial service, engineers, scientists, artists, physicians, and the [[bourgeoisie]] in general, because there was strong education among some of the German peoples. The Germans of Russia did not necessarily speak Russian; many spoke German, while French was often used as the language of the high aristocracy. Depending on geography and other circumstances, many Russian-Germans spoke Russian as their first or second language. During the 19th century, many of the early immigrants began to identify primarily as Russians, and particularly during and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  The large numbers of farmers and village tradesmen who arrived following Catherine the Great's invitation were allowed to settle in German-only villages and keep their German language, religion, and culture until the 1920s. She was seeking to repopulate some areas devastated by the Ottoman invasion and disease. \n\nToday's Russian Germans speak mostly [[Russian language|Russian]] as they are in the gradual process of assimilation. As such, many may not necessarily be fluent in German. Consequently, Germany has recently strictly limited their immigration to that nation. A decline in the number of Germans in the Russian Federation has moderated as they are no longer emigrating to Germany. In addition, [[Kazakh Germans]] from [[Kazakhstan]] are moving to Russia rather than Germany. As conditions for the Germans in Russia generally deteriorated in the late 19th century and early 20th century during the period of unrest and revolution, many ethnic Germans migrated from Russia to the Americas and elsewhere. They are collectively known as [[Germans from Russia]].\n\n==Germans in Imperial Russia (partitioned Poland and Caucasus)==\n[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the [[Hanseatic League]]]]\nGerman merchants established a trading post at [[Novgorod]], which they called Peterhof.  In 1229, German merchants at Novgorod were granted certain privileges that made their positions more secure.<ref>Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229 |publisher=Fordham.edu }}</ref>\n\nThe earliest German settlement in [[Moscow]] dates to the reign of [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]], Grand Prince of Moscow, from 1505 to 1533. A handful of German and Dutch craftsmen and traders were allowed to settle in Moscow's [[German Quarter]] (''\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430'', or Nemetskaya ''[[sloboda]]''), as they provided essential technical skills in the capital. Gradually, this policy extended to a few other major cities. In 1682, Moscow had about 200,000 citizens; some 18,000 were classified as ''Nemtsy'', which means either \"German\" or \"western foreigner\".\n\nThe international community located in the German Quarter greatly influenced [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682-1725). His efforts to transform Russia into a more modern European state are believed to have derived in large part from his experiences among Russia's established Germans.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By the late 17th-century, foreigners were no longer so rare in Russian cities, and Moscow's German Quarter had lost its ethnic character by the end of that century.\n\n===Vistula Germans (Poland)===\n{{main article|Vistula Germans}}\n{{see also|Ol\u0119drzy}}\nThrough wars and the partitions of Poland, [[Prussia]] acquired an increasing amount of northern, western, and central Polish territory. The [[Vistula River]] flows south to north, with its mouth on the [[Baltic Sea]] near [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (now [[Gda\u0144sk]]). Germans and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settled its valley beginning at the sea coast and gradually moving further south to the interior. Eventually, Prussia acquired most of the Vistula's watershed, and the central portion of then-Poland became [[South Prussia]]. Its existence was brief - 1793 to 1806, but by its end many German settlers had established [[Protestant]] agricultural settlements within its earlier borders. By contrast, most Polish were Roman Catholics. Some German [[Roman Catholics]] also entered the region from the southwest, especially the area of Prussian [[Silesia]]. The [http://www.upstreamvistula.org/History/Breyer_Map.htm 1935 \"Breyer Map\"] shows the distribution of German settlements in what became central Poland.\n\n[[Napoleon]]'s victories ended the short existence of South Prussia. The French Emperor incorporated that and other territories into the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. After Napoleon's defeat in 1815, however, the Duchy was divided. Prussia annexed the western [[Grand Duchy of Posen|Posen]] region, and what is now central Poland became the Russian client-state known as [[Congress Poland]]. Many Germans continued to live in this central region, maintaining their middle-German Prussian dialect, similar to the Silesian dialect, and their Protestant and Catholic religions. (The Russian population was primarily [[Russian Orthodox]], which was the established national church.) \n\nDuring World Wars I and II, the eastern front was fought over in this area. The Soviet government increased conscription of young men. The rate of Vistula Germans' migrations to this area from Congress Poland increased. Some became [[German minority in Poland|Polonized]], however, and their descendants remain in Poland. \n\nDuring the last year and after World War II, many ethnic Germans fled or were forcibly [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|expelled by the Russians and the Poles]] from Eastern Europe, particularly those who had maintained their German language and separate religions. The Russians and Poles blamed them for being allies of the Nazis and the reason that Nazi Germany had invaded the East in its program of ''[[lebensraum]].'' The Germans were also held to have abused the native populations in internal warfare, allied with the Germans during their occupation. Under the [[Potsdam Agreement]], major population transfers were agreed to by the allies. The deportees generally lost all their property and were often attacked during their deportations. Those who survived joined millions of other [[displaced peoples]] on the road after the war.\n\n===Volga Germans (Russia)===\n{{Main article|Volga Germans}}\n[[File:Catherine II in youth by A.R. Lisiewska (de Gasc), 1742, Russian Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Catherine the Great]] - the most famous Russian Empress of German descent]]<!--She was known as very attractive woman, and a younger image should be found!-->\nTsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] was German, born in [[Stettin]] in Pomerania (now [[Szczecin]] in Poland). After gaining her power, she proclaimed open immigration for foreigners wishing to live in the Russian Empire on July 22, 1763, marking the beginning of a wave of German migration to the Empire. She wanted German farmers to redevelop farmland that had been fallow after conflict with the Ottomans. German [[colony (Russia)|colonies]] were founded in the lower [[Volga river]] area almost immediately afterward. These early colonies were attacked during the [[Yemelyan Pugachev|Pugachev uprising]], which was centred on the Volga area, but they survived the rebellion.\n\nGerman immigration was motivated in part by religious intolerance and warfare in central Europe, as well as by frequently difficult economic conditions, particularly among the southern principalities. Catherine II's declaration freed German immigrants from requirements for military service (which was imposed on native Russians) and from most taxes. It placed the new arrivals outside of Russia's feudal hierarchy and granted them considerable internal autonomy. Moving to Russia gave German immigrants political rights that they would not have possessed in their own lands. Religious minorities found these terms very agreeable, particularly [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] from the [[Vistula River]] valley. Their unwillingness to participate in military service, and their long tradition of dissent from mainstream [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]], made life under the Prussians very difficult for them. Nearly all of the Prussian Mennonites emigrated to Russia over the following century, leaving no more than a handful in Prussia.\n\nOther German minority churches took advantage of Catherine II's offer as well, particularly [[Evangelical Christians]] such as the [[Baptists]]. Although Catherine's declaration forbade them from proselytising among members of the [[Orthodox church]], they could evangelize Russia's [[Muslim]] and other non-Christian minorities.\n\nGerman colonization was most intense in the [[Lower Volga]], but other areas also received immigrants. Many settled in the area around the [[Black Sea]], and the Mennonites favoured the lower [[Dnieper river]] area, around Ekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipro]]) and Aleksandrovsk (now [[Zaporizhia]]).\n\nIn 1803 Catherine II's grandson, [[Tsar Alexander I]], reissued her proclamation. In the chaos of the [[Napoleonic wars]], Germans responded in great number, fleeing their wartorn land. The Tsar's administration eventually imposed minimum financial requirements on new immigrants, requiring them to have either 300 [[South German gulden|gulden]] in cash or special skills in order to be accepted for entry to Russia.\n\nThe abolition of [[serfdom]] in the Russian Empire in 1863 created a shortage of labour in agriculture. The need for workers attracted new German immigration, particularly from the increasingly crowded central European states. There was no longer enough fertile land there for full employment in agriculture.\n\nFurthermore, a sizable portion of Russia's ethnic Germans migrated into Russia from its Polish possessions. The 18th-century [[partitions of Poland]] (1772\u20131795) dismantled the Polish-Lithuanian state, dividing it between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Many Germans already living in those parts of Poland transferred to Russia, dating back to [[medieval]] and later migrations. Many Germans in Congress Poland migrated further east into Russia between then and [[World War I]], particularly in the aftermath of the [[November Uprising|Polish insurrection of 1830]]. The [[January Uprising|Polish insurrection in 1863]] added a new wave of German emigration from Poland to those who had already moved east, and led to the founding of extensive German colonies in [[Volhynia]]. When Poland reclaimed its independence in 1918 after [[World War I]], it ceased to be a source of German emigration to Russia, but by then many hundreds of thousands of Germans had already settled in enclaves across the Russian Empire.\n\nGermans settled in the [[Caucasus|Caucasus area]] from the beginning of the 19th century and in the 1850s expanded into the [[Crimea]]. In the 1890s new German colonies opened in the [[Altay Mountains|Altay mountain]] area in Russian Asia (see [[Mennonite settlements of Altai]]). German colonial areas continued to expand in [[Ukraine]] as late as the beginning of [[World War I]].\n\n[[File:German language in the Russian Empire (1897).svg|thumb|260px|Geographic distribution of German language in the [[Russian Empire]] according to 1897 census]]\nAccording to the [[Russian Empire Census|first census of the Russian Empire]] in 1897, about 1.8 million respondents reported German as their [[mother tongue]].\n\n===Black Sea Germans (Moldova and Ukraine)===\n\n{{main article|Black Sea Germans|Russian Mennonites|South Ukraine}}\n\nThe Black Sea Germans - including the [[Bessarabian Germans]] and the [[Dobrujan Germans]] - settled the territories of the northern bank of the [[Black Sea]] in present-day Ukraine in the late 18th and 19th centuries. [[Catherine the Great]] had gained this land for Russia through her two wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1768\u20131774) and from the annexation of the [[Crimean Khanate]]s (1783). \n\nThe area of settlement did not develop as compact as that of the [[Volga]] territory, and a chain of ethnic German colonies resulted. The first German settlers arrived in 1787, first from [[West Prussia]], followed by immigrants from [[Western Germany|Western]] and Southwestern Germany (including Roman Catholics), and from the [[Warsaw]] area. Also many Germans, beginning in 1803, immigrated from the northeastern area of [[Alsace]] west of the [[Rhine River]]. They settled roughly 30 miles northeast of Odessa (city) in Ukraine, forming several enclaves that quickly expanded, resulting in daughter colonies springing up nearby.<ref>Karl Stumpp, \"The Emigration From Germany to Russia in the Years 1763-1862\"</ref>\n\n;Crimea\n{{main article|Crimea Germans|Crimean Goths}}\n\nFrom 1783 onward the Crown initiated a systematic settlement of [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], and Germans in the [[Crimean Peninsula]] (in what was then the [[Crimean Khanate]]) in order to dilute the native population of the [[Crimean Tatars]].\n\nIn 1939, around 60,000 of the 1.1 million inhabitants of Crimea were ethnic German. Two years later, following the end of the alliance and the Nazi German invasion of the Soviet Union, the government [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] ethnic Germans from the Crimea to [[Central Asia]] in the Soviet Union's program of population transfers. Conditions were harsh and many of the deportees died. It was not until the period of [[perestroika]] in the late 1980s that the government granted surviving ethnic Germans and their descendants the right to return from Central Asia to the peninsula.\n\n===Volhynian Germans (Poland and Ukraine)===\n[[File:Deutsche Siedlungsgebiete in Osteuropa 1925.jpg|thumb|250px|Germans in Ukraine, 1925]]\nThe migration of Germans into [[Volhynia]] ({{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} covering northwestern [[Ukraine]] from a short distance west of Kiev to the border with Poland) occurred under significantly different conditions than those described above. By the end of the 19th century, Volhynia had more than 200,000 German settlers.<ref>[https://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Volhynians.htm The Germans from Volhynia and Russian Poland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305173610/http://www.ualberta.ca/~german/PAA/Volhynians.htm |date=2012-03-05 }}, University of Alberta, Canada</ref> Their migration began as encouraged by local noblemen, often Polish landlords, who wanted to develop their significant land-holdings in the area for agricultural use. Probably 75% or more of the Germans came from Congress Poland, with the balance coming directly from other regions such as East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Posen, W\u00fcrttemberg, and [[Galician Germans|Galicia]], among others. Although the noblemen offered certain incentives for the relocations, the Germans of Volhynia received none of the government's special tax and military service freedoms granted to Germans in other areas.\n\nShortly after 1800, the first German families started moving into the area. A surge occurred after the first [[November Uprising|Polish rebellion of 1831]] but by 1850, Germans still numbered only about 5000. The largest migration came after the second [[January Uprising|Polish rebellion of 1863]], and Germans began to flood into the area by the thousands. By 1900 they numbered about 200,000. The vast majority of these Germans were Protestant [[Lutheran Church|Lutherans]] (in Europe they were referred to as Evangelicals). Limited numbers of [[Mennonites]] from the lower Vistula River region settled in the south part of Volhynia. [[Baptists]] and [[Moravian Brethren]] settled mostly northwest of [[Zhitomir]]. Another major difference between the Germans here and in other parts of Russia is that the other Germans tended to settle in larger communities. The Germans in Volhynia were scattered about in over 1400 villages. Though the population peaked in 1900, many Germans had already begun leaving Volhynia in the late 1880s for North and South America.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1915, a small group of Volhynian German farmers (36 families - more than 200 people) chose to move to Eastern Siberia, making use of the resettlement subsidies of the government's [[Stolypin reform]] of 1906-1911. They settled in three villages (Pikhtinsk, Sredne-Pikhtinsk, and Dagnik) in what is today [[Zalarinsky District]] of [[Irkutsk Oblast]], where they became known as the \"Bug Hollanders\".

In 1941 [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered all inhabitants with a German father to be deported, mostly to [[Siberia]] or [[Kazakhstan]].\n\n==Decline of the Russian Germans==\n{{see also|Soviet\u2013German relations before 1941#Volksdeutsche in the Soviet Union}}\nThe decline of the Russian German community started with the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. In 1871, he repealed the open-door immigration policy of his ancestors, effectively ending any new German immigration into the Empire. Although the German colonies continued to expand, they were driven by natural growth and by the immigration of Germans from Poland.\n\nThe Russian nationalism that took root under Alexander II served as a justification for eliminating in 1871 the bulk of the tax privileges enjoyed by Russian Germans, and after 1874 they were subjected to military service. Only after long negotiations, Mennonites, traditionally a pacifist denomination, were allowed to serve alternative service in the form of work in [[Forestry service (Russia)|forestry]] and the medical corps. The resulting disaffection motivated many Russian Germans, especially members of traditionally dissenting churches, to migrate to the United States and Canada, while many Catholics chose Brazil and Argentina. They moved primarily to the American [[Great Plains]] and western Canada, especially [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], and [[Colorado]]; to Canada [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Alberta]]; to Brazil, especially [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]; and to Argentina, especially South of [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Entre R\u00edos Province]] and [[La Pampa Province]]. North Dakota and South Dakota attracted primarily Odessa (Black Sea area) Germans from Russia while Nebraska and Kansas attracted mainly Volga Germans from Russia. The majority of Volhynia Germans chose Canada as their destination with significant numbers later migrating to the United States. Smaller settlement pockets also occurred in other regions such as Volga and Volhynian Germans in southwestern Michigan, Volhynian Germans in Wisconsin, and Congress Poland and Volhynian Germans in Connecticut.\n\nAfter 1881, Russian Germans were required to study [[Russian language|Russian]] in school and lost all their remaining special privileges. Many Germans remained in Russia, particularly those who had done well as Russia began to industrialise in the late 19th century. Russian Germans were disproportionately represented among Russia's engineers, technical tradesmen, industrialists, financiers and large land owners.\n\n[[World War I]] was the first time Russia went to war against Germany since the [[Napoleonic era]], and Russian Germans were quickly suspected of having enemy sympathies. The Germans living in the [[Volhynia]] area were deported to the German colonies in the lower [[Volga river]] in 1915 when Russia started losing the war. Many Russian Germans were exiled to [[Siberia]] by the Tsar's government as enemies of the state - generally without trial or evidence. In 1916, an order was issued to deport the Volga Germans to the east as well, but the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] prevented this from being carried out.\n\nThe loyalties of Russian Germans during the revolution varied. While many supported the royalist forces and joined the [[White Army]], others were committed to [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], to the [[Bolshevik]]s, and even to smaller forces like [[Nestor Makhno]]'s. Russian Germans - including Mennonites and [[Evangelical Christians|Evangelicals]] - fought on all sides in the Russian Revolution and [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. Although some Russian Germans were very wealthy, others were quite poor and sympathised strongly with their Slavic neighbours. Educated Russian Germans were just as likely to have leftist and revolutionary sympathies as the ethnically Russian intelligentsia.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-037542, Westpreu\u00dfen, Russlanddeutsche Fl\u00fcchtlinge.jpg|thumb|1920, a German peasant couple from the Volga region in the refugee camp [[Schneidem\u00fchl]], [[Posen-West Prussia]] (now [[Pi\u0142a]], Poland).]]\nIn the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the civil war that followed it, many ethnic Germans were displaced within Russia or emigrated from Russia altogether. The chaos surrounding the Russian Civil War was devastating to many German communities, particularly to religious dissenters like the Mennonites. Many Mennonites hold the forces of Nestor Makhno in Ukraine particularly responsible for large-scale violence against their community.\n\nThis period was also one of regular food shortages, caused by famine and the lack of long distance transportation of food during the fighting. Coupled with the [[typhus]] epidemic and [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]] of the early 1920s,<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/131043 The Volga Germans and the Famine of 1921]</ref> as many as a third of Russia's Germans may have perished. Russian German organisations in the Americas, particularly the [[Mennonite Central Committee]], organised famine relief in Russia in the late 1920s. As the chaos faded and the [[Soviet Union]]'s position became more secure, many Russian Germans simply took advantage of the end of the fighting to emigrate to the Americas. Emigration from the Soviet Union came to a halt in 1929 by Stalin's decree, leaving roughly one million Russian Germans within Soviet borders.\n\nThe Soviet Union seized the farms and businesses of Russian Germans, along with all other farms and businesses, when Stalin ended [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] in 1929 and began the forced [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization of agriculture]] and liquidation of large land holdings.\n\n[[File:Volga German03.png|thumb|250px|left|Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, 1924-1941]]\nNonetheless, [[Korenizatsiya|Soviet nationalities policy]] had, to some degree, restored the institutions of Russian Germans in some areas. In July 1924, the [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was founded, giving the [[Volga Germans]] some autonomous German language institutions. The [[Lutheran church]], like nearly all religious affiliations in Russia, was ruthlessly suppressed under Stalin. But, for the 600,000-odd Germans living in the Volga German ASSR, German was the language of local officials for the first time since 1881.\n\nAs a result of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, Stalin decided to deport\nthe German Russians to internal exile and forced labor in Siberia and Central Asia. It is evident \nthat, at this point, the regime considered national minorities with ethnic ties to foreign states, \nsuch as Germans, potential fifth columnists. On August 12, 1941, the Central Committee of the \nCommunist Party decreed the expulsion of the Volga Germans, allegedly for treasonous activity, \nfrom their autonomous republic on the lower Volga. On September 7, 1941, the Volga German \nAutonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was abolished and about 438,000 Volga Germans were \ndeported. In subsequent months, an additional 400,000 ethnic Germans were deported to Siberia\nfrom their other traditional settlements such as Ukraine and the Crimea.\n\nThe Soviets were not successful in expelling all German settlers living in the Western and \nSouthern Ukraine, however, due to the rapid advance of the Wehrmacht (German Army). The \nsecret police, the NKVD, was able to deport only 35% of the ethnic Germans from Ukraine. \nThus in 1943, the Nazi German census registered 313,000 ethnic Germans living in the occupied \nterritories of the Soviet Union. With the Soviet re-conquest, the Wehrmacht evacuated about \n300,000 German Russians and brought them back to the Reich. Because of the provisions of the \nYalta Agreement, all former Soviet citizens living in Germany at war\u2019s end had to be repatriated, \nmost by force. More than 200,000 German Russians were deported, against their will, by the \nAllies and sent to the Gulag . Thus, shortly after the end of the war, more than one million ethnic\nGermans from Russia were in special settlements and labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia. It \nis estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 died of starvation, lack of shelter, over-work, and disease \nduring the 1940s.<ref>Ulrich Merten, Voices from the Gulag, the Oppression of the German Minority in the Soviet Union, (American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, Lincoln, Nebraska,2015){{ISBN|978-0-692-60337-6}}, pp 2,3,166</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 1948, Stalin made the banishment permanent, declaring that Russia's Germans were permanently forbidden from returning to Europe, but this was rescinded after his death in 1953. Many Russian Germans returned to European Russia, but quite a few remained in Soviet Asia.\n\nAlthough the post-Stalin Soviet state no longer persecuted ethnic Germans as a group, their Soviet republic was not re-founded. Many Germans in Russia largely assimilated and integrated into Russian society. There were some 2 million ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union in 1989.<ref>[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/order/german_language/stricker.html Germans from Russia Heritage Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705164825/http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/order/german_language/stricker.html |date=2008-07-05 }}</ref> [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet Union census]] revealed in 1989 that 49% of the German minority named German their mother tongue.

In 1990, approximately 45,000 Russian Germans, or 6% of the population, lived in the former German Volga Republic.<ref>Kluter, 425.</ref> During the late twentieth century, three-quarters of Russian Germans were living in Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tadzhikistan and Uzbekistan), South-West Siberia and Southern Urals.<ref name=\"Kluter, 421\">Kluter, 421.</ref>\n \nStarting in the 1970s, a push-pull effect began that would influence where Russian Germans would eventually live.

The \"legal\" basis for this was agreed in the August 1939 [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and the subsequent [[Nazi\u2013Soviet population transfers]] which had given the [[Soviet Union]] a green light to invade and annex Latvia and Estonia in 1940.\n\nOnly a handful of Baltic Germans remained under Soviet rule after 1945 mainly among those few who refused Germany's call to leave the Baltics.\n\n==Famous Russian-Germans==\n[[File:Kress Interfax.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Viktor Kress]] was the governor (1991\u20132012) of [[Tomsk Oblast]], Russia]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 2 January 2008-2.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Gazprom]] chairman [[Alexei Miller]] with Russian President Putin]]\n\n* [[Catherine the Great]] \u2013 Empress of Russia\n* [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)]] \u2013 Empress Consort of Russia\n* [[Peter Wittgenstein]], field marshal\n* [[Karl Nesselrode]] \u2013 count and diplomat (1780\u20131862)\n* [[Pavel Pestel]], one of Decembrist leaders  \n* [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]] (''Vyacheslav Pleve'') \u2013 Minister of the Interior (1846\u20131904)\n* [[Vladimir Pachmann]] \u2013 pianist (1848\u20131933)\n* [[Sergei Yulyevich Witte]] \u2013 Ministry of Ways and Communications + Finance, chairman of the Committee of Ministers (1849\u20131915)\n* [[Pyotr Schmidt]] \u2013 Russian naval officer and 1905 revolutionary (1867\u20131906)\n* [[Olga Knipper]]-Chekhova \u2013 actress, wife of [[Anton Chekhov]] (1868\u20131959)\n* [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] (Karl Kasimir Theodor Meyerhold) \u2013 actor and theatre director (1874\u20131940)\n* [[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re]] (Reinhold Ernst Glier) \u2013 composer (1875\u20131956)\n* [[Gustav Klinger]] \u2013 communist politician (1876\u20131937)\n* [[Max Vasmer]] \u2013 linguist, author of the Etymological dictionary of the Russian language (1886\u20131962)\n* [[Immanuel Winkler]] (1886\u20131932) \u2013 Pastor, official representative of Black Seas Germans\n* [[Otto Schmidt]] \u2013 geophysicist and statesman (1891\u20131956)\n* [[Vasiliy Ulrikh]] (Vasiliy Ulrich) \u2013 Soviet political judge (1889\u20131951)\n* [[Nikolai Erdmann]] \u2013 dramatist (1900\u20131970)\n* [[Vilyam Genrikhovich Fischer]] [[Rudolf Abel]] \u2013 Soviet intelligence officer (1903\u20131971)\n* [[Tatjana Iwanowna Peltzer]] \u2013 actress (1904\u20131992)\n* [[Boris Rauschenbach]] \u2013 physicist and engineer (1915\u20132001)\n* [[Sviatoslav Richter]] \u2013 pianist (1915\u20131997)\n* [[Patriarch Alexy II]] (Alexey Ridiger) \u2013 primate of the Russian Orthodox Church (1929\u20132008)\n* [[Alfred Schnittke]] \u2013 composer (1934\u20131998)\n* [[Anna German]] (Anna H\u00f6rmann) \u2013 singer (1936\u20131982)\n* [[Jeanna Friske]] / born Jeanna Vladimirovna Kopylova (\u0416\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435) \u2013 singer, model, actress, socialite (1974\u20132015)\n* [[Alisa Freindlich]] \u2013 actress\n* [[Eduard Rossel]] \u2013 governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast\n* [[Viktor Kress]] \u2013 governor of Tomsk Oblast\n* [[German Gref]] (Hermann Gr\u00e4f) \u2013 Minister of Economics and Trade\n* [[Alexei Miller]] \u2013 Gazprom CEO\n* [[Edgar Gess]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Peter Neust\u00e4dter]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Andreas Wolf]] \u2013 football player (born 1982)\n* [[Alexander Merkel]] \u2013 football player (born 1992)\n* [[Georgy Boos]] \u2013 governor of Kaliningrad Oblast\n* [[Julia Neigel]] \u2013 singer and songwriter\n* [[Angelina Gr\u00fcn]] \u2013 volleyball player\n* [[Wladimir K\u00f6ppen]] \u2013 meteorologist\n* [[Irina Mikitenko]] \u2013 long-distance runner\n* [[Dennis Siver]] \u2013 mixed martial arts fighter\n* [[Brad Wall]] \u2013 Premier of Saskatchewan\n*[[Dennis Wolf]] -
