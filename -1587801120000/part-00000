Ideologically a Nazbol and [[Khmer nationalism|Khmer nationalist]], he was a leading member of Cambodia's [[Communism|\"communist\"]] movement, the [[Khmer Rouge]], from 1963 until 1997 and served as the [[General Secretary of the \"Communist\" Party of Kampuchea|General Secretary]] of the [[\"Communist\" Party of Kampuchea]] from 1963 to 1981. Under his administration, Cambodia was converted into a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[\"communist\" state]] governed according to Pol Pot's \"interpretation\" of Marxism\u2013Leninism.\n\nBorn to a prosperous farmer in [[Prek Sbauv]], [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French Cambodia]], Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's elite schools. While in [[Paris]] during the 1940s, he joined the [[French Communist Party]]. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] organisation and its guerrilla war against King [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s newly independent government. Following the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled [[North Vietnam]], Pol Pot returned to [[Phnom Penh]], working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the \"Communist\" Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he [[Cambodian Civil War|relaunched the war]] against Sihanouk's government. After [[Lon Nol]] deposed Sihanouk in a [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]], Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against [[Khmer Republic|Lon Nol's government]], which was bolstered by the United States military. Aided by the [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] militia and North Vietnamese troops, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces advanced and controlled all of Cambodia by 1975.\n\nPol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an [[agrarian \"socialist\"]] society that he believed would evolve into a [[\"communist\" society]], Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on [[Collective farming|collective farms]]. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the [[Cambodian genocide]]. Repeated purges of the CPK generated growing discontent; by 1978 Cambodian soldiers were mounting a rebellion in the east. After several years of border clashes, [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|the newly unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia]] in December 1978, toppling Pol Pot and installing a [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation|rival Marxist\u2013Leninist government]] in 1979. The Khmer Rouge retreated to the jungles near the Thai border, from where they continued to fight. In declining health, Pol Pot stepped back from many of his roles in the movement. In 1998 the Khmer Rouge commander [[Ta Mok]] placed Pol Pot under house arrest, shortly after which he died.\n\nTaking power in Cambodia at the height of Marxism\u2013Leninism's global impact, Pol Pot proved divisive among the international communist movement. Many knew he deviated from orthodox Marxism\u2013Leninism, but China backed his government as a bulwark against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in Southeast Asia. To his supporters, he was a champion of Cambodian sovereignty in the face of Vietnamese imperialism and stood against the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|Marxist revisionism]] of the Soviet Union. Conversely, he has been internationally denounced for his role in the Cambodian genocide, regarded as a [[totalitarian]] [[dictator]] guilty of [[crimes against humanity]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Childhood: 1925\u20131941 ===\nPol Pot was born in the village of [[Prek Sbauv]], outside the city of [[Kampong Thom city|Kampong Thom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=7|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15}} He was named Saloth S\u00e2r ({{lang-km|\u179f\u17b6\u17a1\u17bb\u178f \u179f}} {{IPA-km|sa\u02d0.\u02c8lot s\u0251\u02d0|pron}}), the word ''s\u00e2r'' (\"white, pale\") referencing his comparatively light skin complexion.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} French colonial records placed his birth date on 25 May 1928,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=7}} but biographer [[Philip Short]] argues he was born in March 1925.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Prek Sbauv.JPG|thumb|left|[[Prek Sbauv]], the village where Pol Pot was born and spent his early years]]\nHis family was of mixed [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese]] and [[Khmer people|ethnic Khmer]] heritage, but did not speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and lived as though they were fully Khmer.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} His father Loth, who later took the name Saloth Phem, was a prosperous farmer who owned nine hectares of rice land and several draft cattle.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15, 18}} Loth's house was one of the largest in the village and at transplanting and harvest time he hired poorer neighbors to carry out much of the agricultural labour.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}} S\u00e2r's mother, Sok Nem, was locally respected as a pious Buddhist.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} S\u00e2r was the eighth of nine children (two girls and seven boys),{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} three of whom died young.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=16}} They were raised as [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravada Buddhists]], and on festivals travelled to the Kampong Thom monastery.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=20}}\n\n[[List of monarchs of Cambodia|Cambodia was a monarchy]], but the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French colonial regime]], not the king, was in political control.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=14}} S\u00e2r's family had connections to the Cambodian royalty: his cousin Meak was a consort of King [[Sisowath Monivong]] and later worked as a [[ballet]] teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=16\u201317}} When S\u00e2r was six years old, he and an older brother were sent to live with Meak in [[Phnom Penh]]; informal adoptions by wealthier relatives were then common in Cambodia.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} In Phnom Penh, he spent 18 months as a novice monk in the city's Vat Botum Vaddei monastery, learning [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings and to read and write the [[Khmer language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=9|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=20\u201321}}\n\nIn summer 1935, S\u00e2r went to live with his brother Suong and the latter's wife and child.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=23}} That year he began an education at a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] primary school, the \u00c9cole Miche,{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=17|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=23}} with Meak paying the tuition fees.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} Most of his classmates were the children of French bureaucrats and Catholic [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Vietnamese]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} He became literate in French and familiar with [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} S\u00e2r was not academically gifted and was held back two years, receiving his Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Compl\u00e9mentaires in 1941 at the age of 16.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=28}} He had continued to visit Meak at the king's palace and it was there that he had some of his earliest sexual experiences with some of the king's concubines.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=27}}\n\n=== Later education: 1942\u20131948 ===\nWhile S\u00e2r was at the school, the [[King of Cambodia]] died.

Sun, who was backed by the Vietnamese, refused to acknowledge defeat.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=431}} Sihanouk negotiated the formation of a coalition government between the two parties, introducing a system whereby Cambodia would have two prime ministers, Ranariddh and Sen.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=431}} The new Cambodian National Army then launched an offensive against the Khmer Rouge. By August, it had captured Phnom Chhat, with Pol Pot fleeing back into Thailand.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=432}} The Khmer Rouge launched a counter-offensive, having regained much of the territory they recently lost by May 1994.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=432}} Pol Pot moved to [[Anlong Veng]], but as that was overrun in 1994 he relocated to [[Kbal Ansoang]], on the crest of the [[Dangrek Mountains]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=434}} The Khmer Rouge nevertheless faced growing levels of desertion over the first half of the 1990s.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=433}}\n\nPol Pot placed renewed emphasis on those living in Khmer Rouge territory imitating the lives of the poorest peasants and in 1994 ordered the confiscation of private transport and an end to cross-border trade with Thailand.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=433}} In September he ordered the execution of a Briton, a Frenchman, and an Australian who had been captured in a Khmer Rouge attack on a train.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=436}} In July 1996, a mutiny broke out among the Khmer Rouge and in August it was announced that Ieng Sary, [[Y Chhean]], and [[Sok Pheap]] were breaking away from the movement, taking with troops loyal to them. This meant that around 4000 soldiers left, almost halving the troop forces that the Khmer Rouge then commanded.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=437}} By the end of 1996, the Khmer Rouge had lost almost all the territory they held in the interior of Cambodia, being restricted to a few hundred miles along the northern border.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=437}} Pol Pot commented to his aides: \"We are like a fish in a trap.

He would never blame you or scold you to your face.\"{{sfn|Short|2004|p=338}}\n\nHe suffered from [[insomnia]],{{sfn|Short|2004|p=210}} as well as from malaria and intestinal ailments, which left him ill several times a year whilst he was in power.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=106}} During his childhood, Pol Pot developed a love of [[music]] and romantic [[French poetry]], with the work of [[Paul Verlaine]] being among his favorites.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=31}} He was a fan of traditional Khmer music.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=433}}\n\nChandler suggested that the seven years that Pol Pot primarily spent in jungle encampments among his fellow Marxists had a significant effect on his world-view, and they \"probably reinforced his sense of destiny and self-importance\".{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=69}} Pol Pot had a nationalistic attitude and displayed little interest in events outside Cambodia.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=6}} \nShort related that \"Pol did believe he was acting for the common good and that sooner or later everyone would recognise that.\"{{sfn|Short|2004|p=296}}\nShort suggested that Pol Pot, along with other senior members of the Khmer Rouge, engaged in the \"glorification of violence\" and saw bloodshed as a \"cause for exultation\". This, Short suggested, marked the Khmer Rouge's leadership out as being different from those who led the Chinese and Vietnamese Marxist movements, who tended to see violence as a necessary evil rather than something to embrace joyfully.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=248}}\n\nPol Pot wanted his followers to develop a \"revolutionary consciousness\" that would allow them to act without his guidance and was often disappointed when they failed to display this.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=339}} Partly because he did not fully trust subordinates he micro-managed events, scrutinising things such as menus for state receptions or the programming schedules for radio broadcasts.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=339\u2013340}}\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nIn its obituary for Pol Pot, ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to him as the creator of \"one of the 20th century's most brutal and radical regimes\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Mydans |first=Seth |title=Death of Pol Pot; Pol Pot, Brutal Dictator Who Forced Cambodians to Killing Fields, Dies at 73 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/17/world/death-pol-pot-pol-pot-brutal-dictator-who-forced-cambodians-killing-fields-dies.html |website=The New York Times |date=17 April 1998 |accessdate=4 February 2020 }}</ref> \nBoth [[BBC News]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine blamed his government for \"one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century\".<ref>{{cite article |title=Khmer Rouge: Cambodia's years of brutality |date=16 November 2018 |website=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10684399 |accessdate=4 February 2020}}; {{cite article |first=Casey |last=Quackenbush |date=7 January 2019 |title=40 Years After the Fall of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia Still Grapples With Pol Pot's Brutal Legacy |url=https://time.com/5486460/pol-pot-cambodia-1979/ |website=Time |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref> In 2009, [[Deutsche Welle]] described Pol Pot's government as having initiated one of the \"world's most infamous political experiments\",<ref>{{cite article |last=de Launey |first=Guy |title=30 Years Since Fall of Pol Pot |date=7 January 2009 |website=Deutsche Welle |url=https://www.dw.com/en/30-years-since-fall-of-pol-pot/a-5213109 |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref> while Short referred to the Khmer Rouge as \"the most radical revolutionary movement of modern times\".{{sfn|Short|2004|p=433}} Writing for the U.S. socialist magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' in 2019, the Dutch socialist Alex de Jong characterised Pol Pot's government as a \"genocidal regime\" and noted that the name of the Khmer Rouge had become \"synonymous with murder and repression\".<ref>{{cite article |last=de Jong |first=Alex |date=April 2019 |title=Inside the Khmer Rouge's Killing Fields |website=Jacobin |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/04/khmer-rouge-james-tyner-cambodia-violence |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref> Many Cambodians who lived through his administration later referred to it as ''samai a-Pot'' (\"the era of the contemptible Pot\".){{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=119}}\n\nThe idea that the deaths which occurred under Pol Pot's government should be considered [[genocide]] was first put forward by the Vietnamese government in 1979 after the revelations of the killings at the Tuol Sleng prison.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=446}} Short argued that while Pot Pot's administration was clearly responsible for [[crimes against humanity]], it was misleading to accuse it of genocide given that it never sought to eradicate an entire population.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=446}}\n\nVarious Marxist\u2013Leninist groups abroad endorsed Pol Pot's government while it was in power.

of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] between 1975 and 1979. Ideologically a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] and [[Khmer nationalism|Khmer nationalist]], he was a leading member of Cambodia's [[Communism|communist]] movement, the [[Khmer Rouge]], from 1963 until 1997 and served as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] from 1963 to 1981. Under his administration, Cambodia was converted into a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[communist state]] governed according to Pol Pot's interpretation of Marxism\u2013Leninism.\n\nBorn to a prosperous farmer in [[Prek Sbauv]], [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French Cambodia]], Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's elite schools. While in [[Paris]] during the 1940s, he joined the [[French Communist Party]]. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] organisation and its guerrilla war against King [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s newly independent government. Following the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled [[North Vietnam]], Pol Pot returned to [[Phnom Penh]], working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he [[Cambodian Civil War|relaunched the war]] against Sihanouk's government. After [[Lon Nol]] deposed Sihanouk in a [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]], Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against [[Khmer Republic|Lon Nol's government]], which was bolstered by the United States military. Aided by the [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] militia and North Vietnamese troops, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces advanced and controlled all of Cambodia by 1975.\n\nPol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an [[agrarian socialist]] society that he believed would evolve into a [[communist society]], Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on [[Collective farming|collective farms]]. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the [[Cambodian genocide]]. Repeated purges of the CPK generated growing discontent; by 1978 Cambodian soldiers were mounting a rebellion in the east. After several years of border clashes, [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|the newly unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia]] in December 1978, toppling Pol Pot and installing a [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation|rival Marxist\u2013Leninist government]] in 1979. The Khmer Rouge retreated to the jungles near the Thai border, from where they continued to fight. In declining health, Pol Pot stepped back from many of his roles in the movement. In 1998 the Khmer Rouge commander [[Ta Mok]] placed Pol Pot under house arrest, shortly after which he died.\n\nTaking power in Cambodia at the height of Marxism\u2013Leninism's global impact, Pol Pot proved divisive among the international communist movement.

At the same time, he believed that his main Marxist backers, the Chinese, were themselves restoring capitalism with Deng's reforms.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=417}} Reflecting the ideological shift, among the Khmer Rouge, collective eating was ended, the ban on individual possessions was lifted, and children were again allowed to live with their parents.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=418}} Pol Pot commented that his previous administration had been too left-wing and claimed that it had made mistakes because he had placed too much trust in treacherous individuals around him.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=418}}\n\nIn June 1982, at an event in Kuala Lumpur, the Khmer Rouge were among the factions declaring the formation of a [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] (CGDK) as an alternative to the administration in Phnom Penh.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=419}} On the ground in Cambodia there nevertheless remained little military collaboration between these factions, which included the Khmer Rouge as well as the Sihanoukist National Army and Son Senn's [[National Front for the Liberation of the Khmer People]].{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=420\u2013421}} In 1983, Pol Pot travelled to Bangkok for a medical check-up; there he was diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's disease]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=421}} In mid-1984, Office 131 was moved to a new base further into Cambodia, near the O'Suosaday river.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=421}} In December, the Vietnamese Army launched a major offensive, overrunning the Khmer Rouge's Cambodian basis and pushing Pol Pot back into Thailand.

By August, it had captured Phnom Chhat, with Pol Pot fleeing back into Thailand.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=432}} The Khmer Rouge launched a counter-offensive, having regained much of the territory they recently lost by May 1994.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=432}} Pol Pot moved to [[Anlong Veng]], but as that was overrun in 1994 he relocated to [[Kbal Ansoang]], on the crest of the [[Dangrek Mountains]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=434}} The Khmer Rouge nevertheless faced growing levels of desertion over the first half of the 1990s.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=433}}\n\nPol Pot placed renewed emphasis on those living in Khmer Rouge territory imitating the lives of the poorest peasants and in 1994 ordered the confiscation of private transport and an end to cross-border trade with Thailand.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=433}} In September he ordered the execution of a Briton, a Frenchman, and an Australian who had been captured in a Khmer Rouge attack on a train.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=436}} In July 1996, a mutiny broke out among the Khmer Rouge and in August it was announced that Ieng Sary, [[Y Chhean]], and [[Sok Pheap]] were breaking away from the movement, taking with troops loyal to them. This meant that around 4000 soldiers left, almost halving the troop forces that the Khmer Rouge then commanded.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=437}} By the end of 1996, the Khmer Rouge had lost almost all the territory they held in the interior of Cambodia, being restricted to a few hundred miles along the northern border.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=437}} Pol Pot commented to his aides: \"We are like a fish in a trap.

The independent houses of the early 1970s that stood far from each other in Gulshan area have vanished because of the commercial boom, to the point of old residents claiming it is not a residential area any more.\n\n[[File:Gulshan Avenue, Dhaka (27766703491).jpg|thumb|Gulshan Avenue]]\nThough Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara, as well as Uttara and other satellite towns like Bashundhara are relatively on higher lands, substantial part the Gulshan Thana area remained under water for a prolonged duration during the [[1998 Bangladesh floods]]. Dhaka [[Water Supply and Sewerage Authority]] (DWASA) conducted a survey to investigate the causes of and remedial measures in 1998 with particular focus on the Gulshan Lake and the Gulshan and Banani canals. Flood water runoff flows into these water bodies practically turning these into buffer flood control reservoirs, except some pockets of transient water-logging.<ref>[http://www.iwmbd.org/html/proj_6218.htm Flood Study for Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara], [[Institute of Water Modelling]] (IWM), Bangladesh; ''Retrieved: 2007-12-14''</ref><ref>Prof Mustafizur Rahman Tarafdar, [http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=3883 Floods, rains and Dhaka city drainage], The Daily Star, 2007-12-14, Environment; ''Retrieved: 2007-12-14''</ref> Drains and sewerage pipes dumping wastes in the Gulshan lake has been identified as major pollution problem by DWASA.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = City Correspondent\n  | title = Relocating Gulshan drains to reduce lake pollution\n  | publisher = Daily Star\n  | date = 13 October 2003\n  | url = http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/10/13/d310132504110.htm\n  | accessdate = 2007-12-16}}</ref> The malodorous wastes tend to spill over when the roads are flooded.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Rahman\n  | first = Avik Sanwar\n  | title = Wading through sewage in a posh area\n  | publisher = Daily Star\n  | date = 20 October 2003\n  | url = http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/10/20/d310202506112.htm\n  | accessdate = 2007-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nAs per 1991 Bangladesh census,<ref name=\"census\" /> Gulshan had a population of 281,337.<ref>Male 55.22%; female 44.78%</ref> Many of Dhaka's richest reside here. 21.59% of residents are occupied with commerce, while 40.92% are service professionals.
