return to '''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]''' of their former player [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] as manager. Graham had been appointed just after the end of the previous season as successor to [[Don Howe]] who had resigned in late March. He had been a member of Arsenal's double winning team in 1971, but Arsenal had gone since 1979 without winning a major trophy, finishing seventh in the two seasons leading up to Graham's arrival and finishing as low as 10th in 1983.\n\nArsenal started the season well and were top of the league by Christmas, but a 10-match winless run went against their title hopes in the second half of the season and they eventually finished fourth, with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] finishing champions for the second time in three seasons. Compensation for the failed title bid came in the form of the club's first ever [[Football League Cup]] victory, which came with a 2-1 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final. [[Charlie Nicholas]] scored both of Arsenal's goals.\n\n[[Tony Adams]], the 20-year-old centre-half who played in every single game for Arsenal this season, was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]]. Striker [[Niall Quinn]] and wingers [[David Rocastle]] and [[Martin Hayes (footballer)|Martin Hayes]] both became regular members of the first team this season, with Hayes finishing as Arsenal's top scorer with 24 goals.\n\n==Squad==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=[[John Lukic]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=[[Viv Anderson]]}}\n{{Fs

It is a [[surface of revolution]] obtained by revolving a [[parabola]] around its axis. \n\nObviously, a circular paraboloid contains circles. This is also true in the general case (see [[Circular section]]).\n\nFrom the point of view of [[projective geometry]], an elliptic paraboloid is an [[ellipsoid]] that is [[tangent space|tangent]] to the [[plane at infinity]]. \n\n; Plane sections\nThe plane sections of an elliptic paraboloid can be:\n* a ''parabola'', if the plane is parallel to the axis,\n* a ''point'', if the plane is a [[tangent plane]].\n* an ''ellipse'' or ''empty'', otherwise.\n\n====Parabolic reflector====\n{{main|Parabolic reflector|parabolic antenna}}\nOn the axis of a circular paraboloid, there is a point called the [[Focus (optics)|''focus'']] (or ''focal point''), such that, if the paraboloid is a mirror, light (or other waves) from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel beam, parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. This also works the other way around: a parallel beam of light that is parallel to the axis of the paraboloid is concentrated at the focal point. For a proof, see {{slink|Parabola|Proof of the reflective property}}.\n\nTherefore, the shape of a circular paraboloid is widely used in [[astronomy]] for parabolic reflectors and parabolic antennas.\n\nThe surface of a rotating liquid is also a circular paraboloid. This is used in [[liquid-mirror telescope]]s and in making solid telescope mirrors (see [[rotating furnace]]).\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"180px\">\nParabola with focus and arbitrary line.svg|Parallel rays coming into a circular paraboloidal mirror are reflected to the focal point, {{math|F}}, or ''vice versa''\nErdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|Parabolic reflector\nCentrifugal 0.PNG|Rotating water in a glass\n</gallery>\n\n=== Hyperbolic paraboloid ===\n[[file:Hyperbolic-paraboloid.svg|thumb|A hyperbolic paraboloid with lines contained in it]]\n[[file:Pringles chips.JPG|thumb|[[Pringles]] potato chips are in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid.]]\n\nThe hyperbolic paraboloid is a [[doubly ruled surface]]: it contains two families of mutually [[skew lines]]. The lines in each family are parallel to a common plane, but not to each other. Hence the hyperbolic paraboloid is a [[conoid]].\n\nThese properties characterize hyperbolic paraboloids and are used in one of the oldest definitions of hyperbolic paraboloids: ''a hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is parallel to a fixed plane and crosses two fixed [[skew lines]]''. \n\nThis property makes it simple to manufacture a hyperbolic paraboloid from a variety of materials and for a variety of purposes, from concrete roofs to snack foods. In particular, [[Pringles]] potato chips resemble a truncated hyperbolic paraboloid.<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals|first1=Dennis G.|last1=Zill|first2=Warren S.|last2=Wright|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781449644482|page=649|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHYH_B__ybgC&pg=PA649}}.</ref> \n\nA hyperbolic paraboloid is a [[saddle surface]], as its [[Gauss curvature]] is negative at every point.

They must all be in the same [[unit of length]]. If two of these three lengths are known, this equation can be used to calculate the third.\n\nA more complex calculation is needed to find the diameter of the dish ''measured along its surface''. This is sometimes called the \"linear diameter\", and equals the diameter of a flat, circular sheet of material, usually metal, which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish. Two intermediate results are useful in the calculation: {{math|''P'' {{=}} 2''F''}} (or the equivalent: {{math|''P'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''R''{{sup|2}}|2''D''}}}}) and {{math|''Q'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''P''{{sup|2}} + ''R''{{sup|2}}}}}}, where {{math|''F''}}, {{math|''D''}}, and {{math|''R''}} are defined as above. The diameter of the dish, measured along the surface, is then given by\n:<math>\\frac{RQ}{P} + P \\ln\\left(\\frac{R+Q}{P}\\right),</math>\nwhere {{math|ln ''x''}} means the [[natural logarithm]] of {{math|''x''}}, i.e. its logarithm to base {{math|''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''}}.\n\nThe volume of the dish, the amount of liquid it could hold if the rim were horizontal and the vertex at the bottom (e.g. the capacity of a paraboloidal [[wok]]), is given by\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{2} R^2 D,</math>\nwhere the symbols are defined as above. This can be compared with the formulae for the volumes of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] ({{math|\u03c0''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}), a [[sphere|hemisphere]] ({{math|{{sfrac|2\u03c0|3}}''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}, where {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''R''}}), and a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] ({{math|{{sfrac|\u03c0|3}}''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}). {{math|\u03c0''R''{{sup|2}}}} is the aperture area of the dish, the area enclosed by the rim, which is proportional to the amount of sunlight a reflector dish can intercept. The surface area of a parabolic dish can be found using the area formula for a [[surface of revolution#Area formula|surface of revolution]] which gives\n:<math>A=\\frac{\\pi R\\left(\\sqrt{(R^2+4D^2)^3}-R^3\\right)}{6D^2}.</math>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Ellipsoid]]\n* [[Holophones]]\n* [[Hyperboloid structure]]\n* [[Parabolic arch]]\n* [[Parabolic reflector#Focus-balanced reflector]], paraboloid with focus at centre of mass\n* [[Quadratic form]]\n* [[Rotation of axes]]\n* [[Saddle point]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Geometric shapes]]\n[[Category:Surfaces]]\n[[Category:Quadrics]]\n[[Category:Parabolas]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Paraboloid of Revolution.svg|thumb|right|Paraboloid of revolution]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''paraboloid''' is a [[quadric surface]] that has exactly one [[axial symmetry|axis of symmetry]] and no [[central symmetry|center of symmetry]].

It is a [[surface of revolution]] obtained by revolving a [[parabola]] around its axis. \n\nObviously, a circular paraboloid contains circles. This is also true in the general case (see [[Circular section]]).\n\nFrom the point of view of [[projective geometry]], an elliptic paraboloid is an [[ellipsoid]] that is [[tangent space|tangent]] to the [[plane at infinity]]. \n\n; Plane sections\nThe plane sections of an elliptic paraboloid can be:\n* a ''parabola'', if the plane is parallel to the axis,\n* a ''point'', if the plane is a [[tangent plane]].\n* an ''ellipse'' or ''empty'', otherwise.\n\n====Parabolic reflector====\n{{main|Parabolic reflector|parabolic antenna}}\nOn the axis of a circular paraboloid, there is a point called the [[Focus (optics)|''focus'']] (or ''focal point''), such that, if the paraboloid is a mirror, light (or other waves) from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel beam, parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. This also works the other way around: a parallel beam of light that is parallel to the axis of the paraboloid is concentrated at the focal point. For a proof, see {{slink|Parabola|Proof of the reflective property}}.\n\nTherefore, the shape of a circular paraboloid is widely used in [[astronomy]] for parabolic reflectors and parabolic antennas.\n\nThe surface of a rotating liquid is also a circular paraboloid. This is used in [[liquid-mirror telescope]]s and in making solid telescope mirrors (see [[rotating furnace]]).\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"180px\">\nParabola with focus and arbitrary line.svg|Parallel rays coming into a circular paraboloidal mirror are reflected to the focal point, {{math|F}}, or ''vice versa''\nErdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|Parabolic reflector\nCentrifugal 0.PNG|Rotating water in a glass\n</gallery>\n\n=== Hyperbolic paraboloid ===\n[[file:Hyperbolic-paraboloid.svg|thumb|A hyperbolic paraboloid with lines contained in it]]\n[[file:Pringles chips.JPG|thumb|[[Pringles]] potato chips are in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid.]]\n\nThe hyperbolic paraboloid is a [[doubly ruled surface]]: it contains two families of mutually [[skew lines]]. The lines in each family are parallel to a common plane, but not to each other. Hence the hyperbolic paraboloid is a [[conoid]].\n\nThese properties characterize hyperbolic paraboloids and are used in one of the oldest definitions of hyperbolic paraboloids: ''a hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is parallel to a fixed plane and crosses two fixed [[skew lines]]''. \n\nThis property makes it simple to manufacture a hyperbolic paraboloid from a variety of materials and for a variety of purposes, from concrete roofs to snack foods. In particular, [[Pringles]] potato chips resemble a truncated hyperbolic paraboloid.<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals|first1=Dennis G.|last1=Zill|first2=Warren S.|last2=Wright|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781449644482|page=649|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHYH_B__ybgC&pg=PA649}}.</ref> \n\nA hyperbolic paraboloid is a [[saddle surface]], as its [[Gauss curvature]] is negative at every point. Therefore, although it is a ruled surface, it is not [[Developable surface|developable]].\n\nFrom the point of view of [[projective geometry]], a hyperbolic paraboloid is [[one-sheet hyperboloid]] that is [[tangent space|tangent]] to the [[plane at infinity]].\n\nA hyperbolic paraboloid of equation <math>z=axy</math> or <math>z=\\tfrac a 2(x^2-y^2)</math> (this is the same [[up to]] a rotation of the axes) may be called a ''rectangular hyperbolic paraboloid'', by analogy with [[rectangular hyperbola]]s.\n\n;Plane sections\n[[File:ParabHyper.png|thumb|hyperbolic paraboloid with hyperbolas and parabolas]]\nA plane section of a hyperbolic paraboloid with equation \n:<math>z = \\frac{x^2}{a^2} -

\\frac{y^2}{b^2}</math>\nis rotated by an angle of {{math|{{sfrac|\u03c0|4}}}} in the {{math|+''z''}} direction (according to the [[right hand rule]]), the result is the surface\n:<math>z = \\left(\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2}\\right) + xy \\left(\\frac{1}{a^2}+\\frac{1}{b^2}\\right)</math>\nand if {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}} then this simplifies to\n:<math>z = \\frac{2xy}{a^2}</math>.\nFinally, letting {{math|''a'' {{=}} {{sqrt|2}}}}, we see that the hyperbolic paraboloid\n:<math>z = \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{2}.</math>\nis congruent to the surface\n:<math>z = xy</math>\nwhich can be thought of as the geometric representation (a three-dimensional [[nomogram|nomograph]], as it were) of a [[multiplication table]].\n\nThe two paraboloidal {{math|\u211d{{sup|2}} \u2192 \u211d}} functions\n:<math>z_1 (x,y) = \\frac{x^2 -

They must all be in the same [[unit of length]]. If two of these three lengths are known, this equation can be used to calculate the third.\n\nA more complex calculation is needed to find the diameter of the dish ''measured along its surface''. This is sometimes called the \"linear diameter\", and equals the diameter of a flat, circular sheet of material, usually metal, which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish. Two intermediate results are useful in the calculation: {{math|''P'' {{=}} 2''F''}} (or the equivalent: {{math|''P'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''R''{{sup|2}}|2''D''}}}}) and {{math|''Q'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''P''{{sup|2}} + ''R''{{sup|2}}}}}}, where {{math|''F''}}, {{math|''D''}}, and {{math|''R''}} are defined as above. The diameter of the dish, measured along the surface, is then given by\n:<math>\\frac{RQ}{P} + P \\ln\\left(\\frac{R+Q}{P}\\right),</math>\nwhere {{math|ln ''x''}} means the [[natural logarithm]] of {{math|''x''}}, i.e. its logarithm to base {{math|''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''}}.\n\nThe volume of the dish, the amount of liquid it could hold if the rim were horizontal and the vertex at the bottom (e.g. the capacity of a paraboloidal [[wok]]), is given by\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{2} R^2 D,</math>\nwhere the symbols are defined as above. This can be compared with the formulae for the volumes of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] ({{math|\u03c0''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}), a [[sphere|hemisphere]] ({{math|{{sfrac|2\u03c0|3}}''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}, where {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''R''}}), and a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] ({{math|{{sfrac|\u03c0|3}}''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}). {{math|\u03c0''R''{{sup|2}}}} is the aperture area of the dish, the area enclosed by the rim, which is proportional to the amount of sunlight a reflector dish can intercept. The surface area of a parabolic dish can be found using the area formula for a [[surface of revolution#Area formula|surface of revolution]] which gives\n:<math>A=\\frac{\\pi R\\left(\\sqrt{(R^2+4D^2)^3}-R^3\\right)}{6D^2}.</math>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Ellipsoid]]\n* [[Holophones]]\n* [[Hyperboloid structure]]\n* [[Parabolic arch]]\n* [[Parabolic reflector#Focus-balanced reflector]], paraboloid with focus at centre of mass\n* [[Quadratic form]]\n* [[Rotation of axes]]\n* [[Saddle point]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Geometric shapes]]\n[[Category:Surfaces]]\n[[Category:Quadrics]]\n[[Category:Parabolas]]\n", "name_user": "Ravenpuff", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHyperbolic paraboloid", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid"}

English football|last season of the original]] [[Football League First Division]] before the creation of the [[FA Premier League]], Liverpool had collected their fifth [[FA Cup]] but finished sixth in the league \u2013 the first time since 1981 that they hadn't finished champions or runners-up. They had returned to European competition in the [[UEFA Cup]] and reached the quarter-finals. Their disappointment in the league could largely be put down to the fact that key players [[Ian Rush]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] had missed many games through injury. However, Rush and Barnes were back to full fitness for the 1992\u201393 season, accompanied by new signing [[Paul Stewart (footballer born 1964)|Paul Stewart]] from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], who could double as a midfielder or attacker, and 21-year-old [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] goalkeeper [[David James (footballer)|David James]] who was already an [[England national football team|England]] under-21 international and widely tipped to be a full international over the next few years.\n\nThe season began on 8 August, when Liverpool faced league champions [[Leeds United A.F.C|Leeds United]] in the [[FA Charity Shield]], and an action packed game at [[Wembley Stadium]] ended in a 4\u20133 defeat. Eight days later, Liverpool travelled to the [[City Ground]] to take on [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in their very first Premier League game, but came away 1\u20130 losers after a [[Teddy Sheringham]] goal. Three days later, the Reds recorded their first win, goals and points at [[Anfield]] in a 2\u20131 win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], with [[Mark Walters]] opening the goalscoring followed by Paul Stewart in the second half. However, the visit of Arsenal to Anfield four days after that brought major disappointment as the [[North London]]ers ran out 2\u20130 winners. The next two games (away visits to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and Leeds) both ended in 2\u20132 draws, with 70th minute penalties from [[Jan Molby]] in both of these games.\n\nLiverpool's first month of the new Premier League had been a major disappointment, with one win, two draws and two defeats, leaving them a lowly 16th out of 22 clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===September===\nThe second month of Liverpool's season was similar to the first \u2013 bringing one draw (at home to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]), one win (at home to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]) and three defeats (at the hands of Sheffield United, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]). They were now 19th in the league, with only goal difference keeping them out of relegation places at the end of the second month of a season in a league where they had been expected to challenge for the title, which was currently being contested by some of the most unlikely sides including [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queen's Park Rangers]] as well as big spending [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nLiverpool's European adventure began on 16 September, with a 6\u20131 home demolition of [[Apollon Limassol]] (the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] cup winners) in which [[Ian Rush]] scored four goals and [[Paul Stewart (footballer born 1964)|Paul Stewart]] was on target twice in the first round first leg of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. The return leg in Cyprus two weeks later saw Liverpool progress to the next stage with a 2\u20131 win thanks to another goal from Rush as well as another from [[Don Hutchison]].\n\nThe [[Football League Cup]] quest began on 22 September, when Division Three [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] gave the Reds a scare by drawing 4\u20134 with them at Anfield.\n\n===October===\nLiverpool's terrible start to the season gave way to a slight improvement in October. The month began well with a 1\u20130 home win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in which Don Hutchison scored the only goal, and two weeks later only a late equaliser from [[Mark Hughes]] denied them an away win over Manchester United, forcing a 2\u20132 draw. The following Saturday saw an impressive 4\u20131 home win over surprise title challengers Norwich, but the month ended with a return to Liverpool's losing ways as they were beaten 2\u20130 by Tottenham at [[White Hart Lane]], where Spurs' first goal came from a spectacular volley by [[Nayim]].\n\nThey ended the month in 14th place in the league \u2013 an improvement on the previous month but still well short of top spot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\nAny hopes that Chesterfield might have had of achieving a giant killing feat over the Reds ended at [[Saltergate]] on 6 October, when Graeme Souness's men achieved a 4\u20131 win to put them through to the third round. They were drawn with Sheffield United, who held them to a goalless draw at [[Bramall Lane]] on 28 October,.\n\nOn the European scene, Liverpool's chances of glory in the Cup Winners' Cup took a severe blow when they were beaten 4\u20132 in Russia by [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]].\n\n===November===\nLiverpool saw league action just three times in London \u2013 and won on each occasions. [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] visited Anfield on 7 November, and were on the receiving end on a 4\u20131 defeat in which [[Ronny Rosenthal]] scored twice. Rosenthal was the only man on the scoresheet 16 days later as the Reds beat QPR 1\u20130 at [[Loftus Road]]. Five days later, Liverpool's surge continued when they demolished [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 5\u20130 at Anfield. They had now climbed to eighth place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nThe League Cup third round replay against Sheffield United at Anfield saw them run out 3\u20130 victors thanks to a [[Steve McManaman]] brace and a [[Mike Marsh (footballer)|Mike Marsh]] penalty. However, any remaining hopes of European glory were ended on 4 November, when they suffered a 2\u20130 home defeat to Spartak Moscow in the second leg of the second round.\n\n===December===\nLiverpool's league revival stalled in November as they won just one league matches out of four. They lost 2\u20131 to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Merseyside derby]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 7 December, though two goals from [[Mark Walters]] six days later gave them a 2\u20131 home win over Blackburn Rovers. Six days before Christmas, however, the Reds were on the receiving end of one of the biggest league shocks of the season as they were crushed 5\u20131 by Coventry at [[Highfield Road]]. Their final action of 1992 came on 28 December, when they drew 1\u20131 at home to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. They had now slipped to 11th place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nDecember also saw the end of Liverpool's attempt to win a record fifth League Cup, as they were beaten 2\u20131 by Crystal Palace in the fourth round replay after a 1\u20131 draw in the first match.\n\n===January===\n1993 began with a 2\u20132 draw with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[FA Cup]] third round at [[Burnden Park]], with the replay at Anfield 10 days later sparking arguably the biggest cup upset of the season as the Reds lost 2\u20130 at home to the Division Two promotion chasers.\n\nLiverpool fared little better in the league this month, beginning with a 2\u20131 home defeat to title chasers Aston Villa, followed by a 2\u20130 defeat at Wimbledon, before a John Barnes penalty against Arsenal at [[Highbury]] on 31 January, ensured that the month would not end winless for the Reds, who were still only 12th in the league.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===February===\nLiverpool's dismal form continued into February as they failed to win a single game all month, and speculation was mounting that manager Graeme Souness would soon be forced out of the club. The month began with goalless draws against Forest and Chelsea, before the Reds lost 2\u20131 at Southampton. A goalless draw followed at home to Ipswich, whose recent surge in form had seen them look like outsiders for the league title a season after promotion. A 1\u20131 draw at Sheffield Wednesday ensured that Liverpool had gone a whole month with five games but no wins. They had managed just two goals all month, both from Don Hutchison.\n\n===March===\nLiverpool's action for March kicked off with a 2\u20131 home defeat by a Manchester United side who went top on their way to their first top division title since 1967, with left Liverpool a lowly 15th in the league and just five places and three points clear of the relegation zone. The game also saw Ian Rush score his first league goal of 1993 and only his fourth of the whole season in the league, and marked the start of a turnaround in fortunes for both player and club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nFour days later, QPR were the visitors at Anfield as Rush was the only man on the scoresheet in a 1\u20130 win for the hosts. Three days later, Rush was joined by Don Hutchison on the scoresheet as the Reds won 2\u20131 at Middlesbrough \u2013 a result which pushed the [[Ayresome Park]] club deeper into relegation trouble. 20 March, was the day of the second Merseyside derby of the season, in which Liverpool ran out 1\u20130 winners and Ronny Rosenthal scored the only goal of the game. The resurgence was put on hold when Liverpool's last game of the month saw the held to a 1\u20131 draw at relegation-threatened Crystal Palace, but Rush was on target for the fourth time in five games and his team had now lifted themselves to 10th place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===April===\nApril began badly for the Reds as a 4\u20131 defeat at Blackburn (managed by former Liverpool player and boss [[Kenny Dalglish]]) suggested that another decline was setting in and that the Reds could be sucked back into the unthinkable relegation battle. However, a week later their resurgence was resumed with Ian Rush once again the inspiration as they defeated Oldham 1\u20130 at Anfield. Rush was on the scoresheet yet again in the next game as they were held to a 1\u20131 draw by Manchester City at [[Maine Road]]. Undoubtedly the best game of the month came on 17 April, when the Reds demolished Coventry 4\u20130 at Anfield, with Mark Walters scoring a hat-trick and defender [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]] scoring the other goal. The month ended with a 2\u20130 home win over Leeds that completed Liverpool's impressive rise from 15th place to fifth within the space of a few weeks. The relegation fear was now long gone, though it was too late for Liverpool to make a challenge for one of the two [[UEFA Cup]] places.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===May===\nWith the pressure off the Reds as the end of the season loomed, they lost 1\u20130 to third placed Norwich at the beginning of the month before being beaten 3\u20132 by an Oldham side who were on the way to completing a survival act which was little short of miraculous. The campaign ended on 8 May, with an impressive 6\u20132 demolition of Tottenham with goals from Ian Rush (twice), John Barnes (twice), a penalty from [[Mark Walters]] and an own goal from Tottenham's [[Stuart Nethercott]], to secure a sixth-place finish for the second season running.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199293|title=Liverpool Results 1992-93|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113064300/http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199293|archive-date=13 November 2007|url-status=usurped}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes|colwidth=30em}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lfchistory.net/seasongames.asp?Season_id=33 LFC History 1992\u201393 Season]\n\n{{Liverpool F.C. seasons}}\n{{1992\u201393 in English football}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1992-93 Liverpool F.C. season}}\n[[Category:Liverpool F.C. seasons]]\n[[Category:1992\u201393 FA Premier League by team|Liverpool F.C.]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=February 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox football club season\n| club               = [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]\n| season             = 1992\u201393\n| manager            = {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Graeme Souness]]\n| chairman           = {{flagicon|ENG}} [[David Moores]]\n| league             = [[FA Premier League|Premier League]]\n| league result      = [[1992-93 FA Premier League|6th]]\n| cup1               = [[FA Cup]]\n| cup1 result        = [[1992-93 FA Cup#Third round proper|Third round]]\n| cup2               = [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]\n| cup2 result        = [[1992\u201393 Football League Cup|Fourth round]]\n| cup3               = [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]\n| cup3 result        = [[1992\u201393 European Cup Winners' Cup#Second round|Second round]]\n| league topscorer   = [[Ian Rush]] (14)\n| season topscorer   = [[Ian Rush]] (22)\n| highest attendance = 44,619 (vs. [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], League, 20 March)\n| lowest attendance  = 12,533 (vs. [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], League Cup, 22 September)\n| average attendance = 34,741\n| pattern_la1        = _three_white_left_shoulder_stripes\n| pattern_ra1        =\n| pattern_b1         = _three_white_left_shoulder_stripes_2\n| pattern_sh1        = _three_adidas_white_right_legr_stripes_2\n| leftarm1           = dd0000\n| body1              = dd0000\n| rightarm1          = dd0000\n| shorts1            = dd0000\n| socks1             = dd0000\n| pattern_la2        = _three_white_left_shoulder_stripes\n| pattern_ra2        =\n| pattern_b2         = _three_white_left_shoulder_stripes_2\n| pattern_sh2        = _three_adidas_white_right_legr_stripes_2\n| leftarm2           = 00633a\n| body2              = 00633a\n| rightarm2          = 00633a\n| shorts2            = FFFFFF\n| socks2             = 00633a\n| prevseason         = [[1991\u201392 Liverpool F.C. season|1991\u201392]]\n| nextseason         = [[1993\u201394 Liverpool F.C. season|1993\u201394]]\n}}\nThe '''1992\u201393 season''' was the 101st season in [[Liverpool F.C.]]'s existence, and their 31st consecutive year in the top-flight.

The close season had seen the departure of defender [[Barry Venison]] and winger [[Ray Houghton]]. A few weeks into the season, striker [[Dean Saunders]] also headed out of [[Anfield]] to sign for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].\n\nAs founders members of the new [[FA Premier League]], Liverpool finished sixth \u2013 a repeat of their performance in the previous season.

English football|last season of the original]] [[Football League First Division]] before the creation of the [[FA Premier League]], Liverpool had collected their fifth [[FA Cup]] but finished sixth in the league \u2013 the first time since 1981 that they hadn't finished champions or runners-up. They had returned to European competition in the [[UEFA Cup]] and reached the quarter-finals. Their disappointment in the league could largely be put down to the fact that key players [[Ian Rush]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] had missed many games through injury. However, Rush and Barnes were back to full fitness for the 1992\u201393 season, accompanied by new signing [[Paul Stewart (footballer born 1964)|Paul Stewart]] from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], who could double as a midfielder or attacker, and 21-year-old [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] goalkeeper [[David James (footballer)|David James]] who was already an [[England national football team|England]] under-21 international and widely tipped to be a full international over the next few years.\n\nThe season began on 8 August, when Liverpool faced league champions [[Leeds United A.F.C|Leeds United]] in the [[FA Charity Shield]], and an action packed game at [[Wembley Stadium]] ended in a 4\u20133 defeat. Eight days later, Liverpool travelled to the [[City Ground]] to take on [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in their very first Premier League game, but came away 1\u20130 losers after a [[Teddy Sheringham]] goal. Three days later, the Reds recorded their first win, goals and points at [[Anfield]] in a 2\u20131 win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], with [[Mark Walters]] opening the goalscoring followed by Paul Stewart in the second half. However, the visit of Arsenal to Anfield four days after that brought major disappointment as the [[North London]]ers ran out 2\u20130 winners. The next two games (away visits to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and Leeds) both ended in 2\u20132 draws, with 70th minute penalties from [[Jan Molby]] in both of these games.\n\nLiverpool's first month of the new Premier League had been a major disappointment, with one win, two draws and two defeats, leaving them a lowly 16th out of 22 clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===September===\nThe second month of Liverpool's season was similar to the first \u2013 bringing one draw (at home to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]), one win (at home to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]) and three defeats (at the hands of Sheffield United, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]). They were now 19th in the league, with only goal difference keeping them out of relegation places at the end of the second month of a season in a league where they had been expected to challenge for the title, which was currently being contested by some of the most unlikely sides including [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queen's Park Rangers]] as well as big spending [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nLiverpool's European adventure began on 16 September, with a 6\u20131 home demolition of [[Apollon Limassol]] (the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] cup winners) in which [[Ian Rush]] scored four goals and [[Paul Stewart (footballer born 1964)|Paul Stewart]] was on target twice in the first round first leg of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. The return leg in Cyprus two weeks later saw Liverpool progress to the next stage with a 2\u20131 win thanks to another goal from Rush as well as another from [[Don Hutchison]].\n\nThe [[Football League Cup]] quest began on 22 September, when Division Three [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] gave the Reds a scare by drawing 4\u20134 with them at Anfield.\n\n===October===\nLiverpool's terrible start to the season gave way to a slight improvement in October. The month began well with a 1\u20130 home win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in which Don Hutchison scored the only goal, and two weeks later only a late equaliser from [[Mark Hughes]] denied them an away win over Manchester United, forcing a 2\u20132 draw. The following Saturday saw an impressive 4\u20131 home win over surprise title challengers Norwich, but the month ended with a return to Liverpool's losing ways as they were beaten 2\u20130 by Tottenham at [[White Hart Lane]], where Spurs' first goal came from a spectacular volley by [[Nayim]].\n\nThey ended the month in 14th place in the league \u2013 an improvement on the previous month but still well short of top spot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\nAny hopes that Chesterfield might have had of achieving a giant killing feat over the Reds ended at [[Saltergate]] on 6 October, when Graeme Souness's men achieved a 4\u20131 win to put them through to the third round. They were drawn with Sheffield United, who held them to a goalless draw at [[Bramall Lane]] on 28 October,.\n\nOn the European scene, Liverpool's chances of glory in the Cup Winners' Cup took a severe blow when they were beaten 4\u20132 in Russia by [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]].\n\n===November===\nLiverpool saw league action just three times in London \u2013 and won on each occasions. [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] visited Anfield on 7 November, and were on the receiving end on a 4\u20131 defeat in which [[Ronny Rosenthal]] scored twice. Rosenthal was the only man on the scoresheet 16 days later as the Reds beat QPR 1\u20130 at [[Loftus Road]]. Five days later, Liverpool's surge continued when they demolished [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 5\u20130 at Anfield. They had now climbed to eighth place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nThe League Cup third round replay against Sheffield United at Anfield saw them run out 3\u20130 victors thanks to a [[Steve McManaman]] brace and a [[Mike Marsh (footballer)|Mike Marsh]] penalty. However, any remaining hopes of European glory were ended on 4 November, when they suffered a 2\u20130 home defeat to Spartak Moscow in the second leg of the second round.\n\n===December===\nLiverpool's league revival stalled in November as they won just one league matches out of four. They lost 2\u20131 to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Merseyside derby]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 7 December, though two goals from [[Mark Walters]] six days later gave them a 2\u20131 home win over Blackburn Rovers. Six days before Christmas, however, the Reds were on the receiving end of one of the biggest league shocks of the season as they were crushed 5\u20131 by Coventry at [[Highfield Road]]. Their final action of 1992 came on 28 December, when they drew 1\u20131 at home to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. They had now slipped to 11th place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nDecember also saw the end of Liverpool's attempt to win a record fifth League Cup, as they were beaten 2\u20131 by Crystal Palace in the fourth round replay after a 1\u20131 draw in the first match.\n\n===January===\n1993 began with a 2\u20132 draw with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[FA Cup]] third round at [[Burnden Park]], with the replay at Anfield 10 days later sparking arguably the biggest cup upset of the season as the Reds lost 2\u20130 at home to the Division Two promotion chasers.\n\nLiverpool fared little better in the league this month, beginning with a 2\u20131 home defeat to title chasers Aston Villa, followed by a 2\u20130 defeat at Wimbledon, before a John Barnes penalty against Arsenal at [[Highbury]] on 31 January, ensured that the month would not end winless for the Reds, who were still only 12th in the league.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===February===\nLiverpool's dismal form continued into February as they failed to win a single game all month, and speculation was mounting that manager Graeme Souness would soon be forced out of the club. The month began with goalless draws against Forest and Chelsea, before the Reds lost 2\u20131 at Southampton. A goalless draw followed at home to Ipswich, whose recent surge in form had seen them look like outsiders for the league title a season after promotion. A 1\u20131 draw at Sheffield Wednesday ensured that Liverpool had gone a whole month with five games but no wins. They had managed just two goals all month, both from Don Hutchison.\n\n===March===\nLiverpool's action for March kicked off with a 2\u20131 home defeat by a Manchester United side who went top on their way to their first top division title since 1967, with left Liverpool a lowly 15th in the league and just five places and three points clear of the relegation zone. The game also saw Ian Rush score his first league goal of 1993 and only his fourth of the whole season in the league, and marked the start of a turnaround in fortunes for both player and club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nFour days later, QPR were the visitors at Anfield as Rush was the only man on the scoresheet in a 1\u20130 win for the hosts. Three days later, Rush was joined by Don Hutchison on the scoresheet as the Reds won 2\u20131 at Middlesbrough \u2013 a result which pushed the [[Ayresome Park]] club deeper into relegation trouble. 20 March, was the day of the second Merseyside derby of the season, in which Liverpool ran out 1\u20130 winners and Ronny Rosenthal scored the only goal of the game. The resurgence was put on hold when Liverpool's last game of the month saw the held to a 1\u20131 draw at relegation-threatened Crystal Palace, but Rush was on target for the fourth time in five games and his team had now lifted themselves to 10th place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===April===\nApril began badly for the Reds as a 4\u20131 defeat at Blackburn (managed by former Liverpool player and boss [[Kenny Dalglish]]) suggested that another decline was setting in and that the Reds could be sucked back into the unthinkable relegation battle. However, a week later their resurgence was resumed with Ian Rush once again the inspiration as they defeated Oldham 1\u20130 at Anfield. Rush was on the scoresheet yet again in the next game as they were held to a 1\u20131 draw by Manchester City at [[Maine Road]]. Undoubtedly the best game of the month came on 17 April, when the Reds demolished Coventry 4\u20130 at Anfield, with Mark Walters scoring a hat-trick and defender [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]] scoring the other goal. The month ended with a 2\u20130 home win over Leeds that completed Liverpool's impressive rise from 15th place to fifth within the space of a few weeks. The relegation fear was now long gone, though it was too late for Liverpool to make a challenge for one of the two [[UEFA Cup]] places.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n===May===\nWith the pressure off the Reds as the end of the season loomed, they lost 1\u20130 to third placed Norwich at the beginning of the month before being beaten 3\u20132 by an Oldham side who were on the way to completing a survival act which was little short of miraculous. The campaign ended on 8 May, with an impressive 6\u20132 demolition of Tottenham with goals from Ian Rush (twice), John Barnes (twice), a penalty from [[Mark Walters]] and an own goal from Tottenham's [[Stuart Nethercott]], to secure a sixth-place finish for the second season running.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199293|title=Liverpool Results 1992-93|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113064300/http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199293|archive-date=13 November 2007|url-status=usurped}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/|title=Liverpool News - LFC Online|website=www.lfconline.co.uk|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes|colwidth=30em}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lfchistory.net/seasongames.asp?Season_id=33 LFC History 1992\u201393 Season]\n\n{{Liverpool F.C. seasons}}\n{{1992\u201393 in English football}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1992-93 Liverpool F.C. season}}\n[[Category:Liverpool F.C. seasons]]\n[[Category:1992\u201393 FA Premier League by team|Liverpool F.C.]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toJohn Barnes(link changed toJohn Barnes (footballer)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992%E2%80%9393_Liverpool_F.C._season"}
{"title_page": "Septimania", "text_new": "{{short description|Historical region in France}}\n[[Image:Map of Septimania in 537 AD.svg|thumb|300px|right|Septimania in 537]] \n'''Septimania''' ({{lang-fr|Septimanie}}, {{IPA-fr|s\u025bptimani|IPA}}; {{lang-oc|Septim\u00e0nia}}, {{IPA-oc|septi\u02c8manj\u0254|IPA}}; {{lang-ca|Septim\u00e0nia}}, {{IPA-ca|s\u0259pti\u02c8mani\u0259|IPA}}) is a [[historical region]] in modern-day southern [[France]]. It referred to the western part of the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] that passed to the control of the [[Visigoths]] in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, [[Theodoric II]]. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply '''Gallia''' or '''Narbonensis'''. Septimania territory roughly corresponds with the former administrative region of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] that merged into the new administrative region of [[Occitanie]]. Septimania was conquered by the [[Muslim]]s and was part of the [[Al-Andalus]]. It passed briefly to the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]], which had been expanding from the south during the eighth century before its subsequent conquest by the [[Franks]], who by the end of the ninth century termed it '''Gothia''' or the '''Gothic March''' (''Marca Gothica'').\n\nSeptimania became a [[March (territorial entity)|march]] of the [[Carolingian Empire]] and then [[West Francia]] down to the thirteenth century, though it was culturally and politically autonomous from northern France-based central royal government. The region was under the influence of the people from the count territories of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]], [[Provence]], and ancient [[County of Barcelona]]. It was part of the wider cultural and linguistic region comprising the southern third of France known as [[Occitania]]. This area was finally brought under effective control of the French kings in the early 13th century as a result of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] after which it was assigned governors. From the end of the thirteenth century Septimania evolved into the royal province of [[Languedoc]].\n\nThe name \"Septimania\" may derive from part of the Roman name of the city of [[B\u00e9ziers]], ''Colonia Julia Septimanorum Beaterrae'', which in turn alludes to the settlement of veterans of the [[Legio VII Claudia|Roman VII Legion]] in the city. Another possible derivation of the name is in reference to the seven cities (''civitates'') of the territory: B\u00e9ziers, [[Elne]], [[Agde]], [[Narbonne]], [[Lod\u00e8ve]], [[Maguelonne]], and [[N\u00eemes]]. Septimania extended to a line halfway between the Mediterranean and the [[Garonne River]] in the northwest; in the east the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] separated it from [[Provence]]; and to the south its boundary was formed by the [[Pyrenees]].\n\n==Visigothic Narbonensis==\n\n===Gothic acquisition===\nUnder Theodoric II, the Visigoths settled in [[Aquitaine]] as ''[[foederati]]'' of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (450s). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] refers to Septimania as \"theirs\" during the reign of [[Avitus]] (455\u2013456), but Sidonius is probably considering Visigothic settlement of and around [[Toulouse]].<ref name=\"James, 223\">{{harvp|James|1980|p=223}}</ref> The Visigoths were then holding the Toulousain against the legal claims of the Empire, though they had more than once offered to exchange it for the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]].<ref name=\"James, 223\"/>\n\nIn 462 the Empire, controlled by [[Ricimer]] in the name of [[Libius Severus]], granted the Visigoths the western half of the province of Gallia Narbonensis to settle. The Visigoths occupied [[Provence]] (eastern Narbonensis) as well and only in 475 did the Visigothic king, [[Euric]], cede it to the Empire by a treaty whereby the emperor [[Julius Nepos]] recognised the Visigoths' full independence.\n\n===Kingdom of Narbonne===\nThe Visigoths, perhaps because they were [[Arianism|Arians]], met with the opposition of the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Franks]] in Gaul.<ref>{{harvp|Bachrach|1971|p=7}}</ref> The Franks allied with the ''[[Armorica|Armorici]]'', whose land was under constant threat from the Goths south of the [[Loire]], and in 507 [[Clovis I]], the Frankish king, invaded the Visigothic kingdom, whose capital lay in Toulouse, with the consent of the leading men of the tribe.<ref>{{harvp|Bachrach|1971|pp=10\u201311}}</ref> Clovis defeated the Goths in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] and the child-king [[Amalaric]] was carried for safety into Iberia while [[Gesalec]] was elected to replace him and rule from [[Narbonne]].\n\nClovis, his son [[Theuderic I]], and his [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] allies proceeded to conquer most of Visigothic Gaul, including the [[Rouergue]] (507) and Toulouse (508). The attempt to take [[Carcassonne]], a fortified site guarding the Septimanian coast, was defeated by the [[Ostrogoths]] (508) and Septimania thereafter remained in Visigothic hands, though the Burgundians managed to hold Narbonne for a time and drive Gesalec into exile. Border warfare between Gallo-Roman magnates, including bishops, had existed with the Visigoths during the last phase of the Empire and it continued under the Franks.<ref>{{harvp|Bachrach|1971|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe Ostrogothic king [[Theodoric the Great]] reconquered Narbonne from the Burgundians and retained it as the provincial capital. [[Theudis]] was appointed regent at Narbonne by Theodoric while Amalaric was still a minor in Iberia. When Theodoric died in 526, Amalaric was elected king in his own right and he immediately made his capital in Narbonne. He ceded Provence, which had at some point passed back into Visigothic control, to the Ostrogothic king [[Athalaric]]. The Frankish king of Paris, [[Childebert I]], invaded Septimania in 531 and chased Amalaric to [[Barcelona]] in response to pleas from his sister, [[Clotilde_(died_531)| Chrotilda]], that her husband, Amalaric, had been mistreating her. The Franks however, did not try to hold the province and under Amalaric's successor, the centre of gravity of the kingdom crossed the Pyrenees and Theudis made his capital in Barcelona.\n\n===Gothic province of Gallia===\nIn the Visigothic kingdom, which became centred on [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] by the end of the reign of [[Leovigild]], the province of Gallia Narbonensis, usually shortened to just Gallia or Narbonensis and never called Septimania,<ref name=\"James, 223\"/> was both an administrative province of the central royal government and an ecclesiastical province whose [[metropolitan (religion)|metropolitan]] was the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]]. Originally, the Goths may have maintained their hold on the [[Albigeois]], but if so it was conquered by the time of [[Chilperic I]].<ref name=\"James236\">{{harvp|James|1980|p=236}}</ref> There is archaeological evidence that some enclaves of Visigothic population remained in Frankish Gaul, near the Septimanian border, after 507.<ref name=\"James236\"/>\n\nThe province of Gallia held a unique place in the Visigothic kingdom, as it was the only province outside of Iberia, north of the Pyrenees, and bordering a strong foreign nation, in this case the [[Franks]]. The kings after Alaric II favoured Narbonne as a capital, but twice (611 and 531) were defeated and forced back to [[Barcelona]] by the Franks before Theudis moved the capital there permanently. Under Theodoric Septimania had been safe from Frankish assault, but was raided by [[Childebert I]] twice (531 and 541). When [[Liuva I]] succeeded the throne in 568, Septimania was a dangerous frontier province and Iberia was wracked by revolts.<ref name=\"Thompson19\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=19}}</ref> Liuva granted Iberia to his son Leovigild and took Septimania to himself.<ref name=\"Thompson19\"/>\n\nDuring the revolt of [[Hermenegild]] (583\u2013585) against his father Leovigild, Septimania was invaded by [[Guntram]], [[King of Burgundy]], possible in support of Hermenegild's revolt, since the latter was married to his niece [[Ingund (wife of Hermenegild)|Ingundis]]. The Frankish attack of 585 was repulsed by Hermenegild's brother [[Reccared]], who was ruling Narbonensis as a sub-king. Hermenegild died at [[Tarragona]] that year and it is possible that he had escaped confinement in [[Valencia]] and was seeking to join up with his Frankish allies.<ref name=\"Collins60\">{{harvp|Collins|2004|p=60}}</ref> Alternatively, the invasion may have occurred in response to Hermenegild's death.<ref name=\"Thompson, 75\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=75}}</ref> Reccared meanwhile took [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]] (Ugernum) on the [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rh\u00f4ne]] near [[Tarascon]] and [[Cabaret]] (a fort called Ram's Head), both of which lay in Guntram's kingdom.<ref name=\"Collins60\"/><ref name=\"Thompson, 75\"/> Guntram ignored two pleas for a peace in 586 and Reccared undertook the only Visigothic invasion of Francia in response.<ref name=\"Thompson, 75\"/> However, Guntram was not motivated solely by religious alliance with the fellow Catholic Hermenegild, for he invaded Septimania again in 589 and was roundly defeated near Carcassonne by [[Claudius, Duke of Lusitania]].<ref name=\"Thompson, 95\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=95}}</ref> It is clear that the Franks, throughout the sixth century, had coveted Septimania, but were unable to take it and the invasion of 589 was the last attempt.\n\nIn the seventh century, Gallia often had its own governors or ''duces'' (dukes), who were typically Visigoths. Most public offices were also held by Goths, far out of proportion to their part of the population.<ref name=\"Thompson227\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=227}}</ref>\n\n===Culture of Gothic Septimania===\nThe native population of Gallia was referred to by Visigothic and Iberian writers as the \"Gauls\" and there is a well-attested hatred between the Goths and the Gaul which was atypical for the kingdom as a whole.<ref name=\"Thompson227\"/> The Gauls commonly insulted the Goths by comparing the strength of their men to that of Gaulish women, though the Spaniards regarded themselves as the defenders and protectors of the Gauls. It is only in the time of [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]] (reigned 672-680) and [[Julian of Toledo]], however, that a large Jewish population becomes evident in Septimania: Julian referred to it as a \"brothel of blaspheming Jews.\"<ref name=\"Thompson228\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=228}}</ref>\n\nThanks to the preserved canons of the [[Council of Narbonne]] of 590, a good deal can be known about surviving pagan practices in Visigothic Septimania. The Council may have been responding in part to the orders of the [[Third Council of Toledo]], which found \"the sacrilege of idolatry [to be] firmly implanted throughout almost the whole of Iberia and Septimania.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=54}}</ref> The Roman pagan practice of not working Thursdays in honour of [[Jove|Jupiter]] was still prevalent.<ref name=\"McKenna1178\">{{harvp|McKenna|1938|pp=117\u2013118}}</ref> The council set down penance to be done for not working on Thursday save for church festivals and commanded the practice of [[Martin of Braga]], rest from rural work on Sundays, to be adopted.<ref name=\"McKenna1178\"/> Also punished by the council were fortunetellers, who were publicly lashed and sold into slavery.\n\nDifferent theories exist concerning the nature of the frontier between Septimania and Frankish Gaul. On the one hand, cultural exchange is generally reputed to have been minimal,<ref>{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=23}}</ref> but the level of trading activity has been disputed. There have been few to no objects of [[Neustria]]n, [[Austrasia]]n, or [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] provenance discovered in Septimania.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref> However, a series of [[sarcophagi]] of a unique regional style, variously labelled Visigothic, Aquitainian, or south-west Gallic, are prevalent on both sides of the Septimania border.<ref name=\"James229\">{{harvp|James|1980|p=229}}</ref> These sarcophagi are made of locally quarried marble from [[Saint-B\u00e9at]] and are of varied design, but with generally flat relief which distinguishes them from Roman sarcophagi.<ref name=\"James229\"/> Their production has been dated to either the 5th, 6th, or 7th century, with the second of these being considered the most likely today.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|p=230}}</ref> However, if they were made in the 5th century, while both Aquitaine and Septimani were in Visigothic hands, their existence provides no evidence for a cultural osmosis across the Gothic-Frankish frontier. A unique style of orange pottery was common in the 4th and 5th centuries in southern Gaul, but the later (6th century) examples culled from Septimania are more orange than their cousins from Aquitaine and Provence and are not found commonly outside of Septimania, a strong indicator that there was little commerce over the frontier or at its ports.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|p=238}}</ref> In fact, Septimania helped to isolate both Aquitaine and Iberia from the rest of the Mediterranean world.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|pp=240\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nCoinage of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic kingdom of Hispania]] did not circulate in Gaul outside of Septimania and Frankish coinage did not circulate in the Visigothic kingdom, including Septimania. If there had been a significant amount of commerce over the frontier, the monies paid had to have been melted down immediately and re-minted as foreign coins have not been preserved across the frontier.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|p=239}}</ref>\n\n==Muslim Septimania==\nThe [[Arabs]], under [[Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani|Al-Samh ibn Malik]], the governor-general of [[al-Andalus]], sweeping up the Iberian peninsula, by 719 overran Septimania; al-Samh set up his capital from 720 at [[Narbonne]], which the Moors called \"Arbuna\", offering the still largely [[Arianism|Arianist Christian]] inhabitants generous terms and quickly pacifying the other cities. Following the conquest, [[al-Andalus]] was divided into five administrative areas, roughly corresponding to present [[Andalusia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Lusitania]], [[Castile and L\u00e9on]], [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], and the ancient province of Septimania.<ref>{{harvp|O'Callaghan|1983|p=142}}</ref> With Narbonne secure, and equally important, its port, for the Arab mariners were masters now of the Western Mediterranean, al-Samh swiftly subdued the largely unresisting cities, still controlled by their Visigoth counts: taking [[Alet]] and [[B\u00e9ziers]], [[Agde]], [[Lod\u00e8ve]], [[Maguelonne]] and [[N\u00eemes]]. \n[[File:Vasconia wide 740 3 - 80.jpg|thumb|300px|Military campaigns around the Pyrenees and Septimania]]\nBy 721 he was reinforced and ready to lay siege to [[Toulouse]], a possession that would open up bordering [[Aquitaine]] to him on the same terms as Septimania. But his plans were thwarted in the disastrous [[Battle of Toulouse (721)]], with immense losses, in which al-Samh was so seriously wounded that he soon died at Narbonne. Arab forces, soundly based in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea, struck in the 720s, conquering [[Carcassonne]] on the north-western fringes of Septimania (725) and penetrating eastwards as far as [[Autun]] (725).\n\nIn 731, the [[Berber people|Berber]] lord of the region of [[Cerdagne]] [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], called \"Munuza\" by the Franks, was an ally of the Duke of Aquitaine [[Odo the Great]] after he revolted against Cordova, but the rebel lord was defeated and killed by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], so opening Aquitaine to the Umayyads.\n\nAfter capturing [[Bordeaux]] on the wake of [[Hunald I of Aquitaine|duke Hunald]]'s detachment attempt, [[Charles Martel]] directed his attention to Septimania and [[Provence]]. While his reasons for leading a military expedition south remain unclear, it seems that he wanted to seal his newly secured grip on Burgundy, now threatened by Umayyad occupation of several cities lying in the lower Rhone, or maybe it provided the excuse he needed to intervene in this territory ruled by [[Visigothic Code|Gothic]] and [[Roman law|Roman]] law, far off from the Frankish centre in the north of Gaul. In 737 the Frankish leader went on to [[Battle of Narbonne (737)|attack Narbonne]], but the city held firm, defended by its Goths and Jews under the command of its governor Yusuf, 'Abd er-Rahman's heir. Charles had to go back north without subduing Narbonne, leaving behind a trail of destroyed cities, i.e. Avignon, N\u00eemes and other Septimanian fortresses.\n\n[[File:Septimania 752-759.jpg|thumb|450px|Septimania during Pepin\u00b4s expedition (752-759)]]\nAround 747 the government of the Septimania region (and the [[Upper March]], from Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es to Ebro River) was given to [[Umar ibn Umar]]. In 752 Pippin headed south to Septimania. [[Goths|Gothic]] counts of [[N\u00eemes]], [[Melguelh]], [[Agde]] and [[B\u00e9ziers]] refused allegiance to the emir at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordova]] and declared their loyalty to the Frankish king&mdash;the count of N\u00eemes, [[Ansemund]], having some authority over the remaining counts. The Gothic counts and the Franks then began to besiege [[Narbonne]], where [[Mil\u00f3 of Narbonne|Mil\u00f3]] was probably the count (as successor of the count [[Gilbert of Narbonne|Gilbert]]). However, the strongly Gothic Narbonne under Muslim rule resisted to the Carolingian thrust. Moreover, attacks on the rearguard by a Basque army under the Aquitanian duke Waifer didn't make things easy to Pippin.\n\nIn 754 an anti-Frank reaction, led by Ermeniard, killed Ansemund, but the uprising was without success and [[Radulf of Narbonne|Radulf]] was designated new count by the Frankish court. About 755 [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Uqba]] replaced Umar ibn Umar. [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|Narbonne capitulated in 759]] only after Pippin promised the defenders of the city to uphold the Gothic law, and the county was granted to Mil\u00f3, the Gothic count in Muslim times, thus earning the loyalty of Septimania's Goths against Waifer.\n\nIslamic burials have been found in N\u00eemes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Netburn|first1=Deborah|title=Earliest Known Medieval Muslim Graves are Discovered in France|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-muslim-graves-france-20160222-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Newitz|first1=Annalee|title=Medieval Muslim Graves in France Reveal a Previously Unseen History|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/medieval-muslim-graves-in-france-reveal-a-previously-unseen-history/|website=Ars Technica|date=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=France's Earliest 'Muslim Burials' Found|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35660488|work=BBC News|date=25 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Gleize, Yves|author2=Mendisco, Fanny|author3=Pemonge, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne|author4=Hubert, Christophe|author5=Groppi, Alexis|author6=Houix, Bertrand|author7=Deguilloux, Marie-France|author8=Breuil, Jean-Yves|title=Early Medieval Muslim Graves in France: First Archaeological, Anthropological and Palaeogenomic Evidence|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=2|pages=e0148583|date=24 February 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0148583|pmid=26910855|pmc=4765927}}</ref>\n\n==Gothia in Carolingian times==\n[[File:Eastern Pyrenees under the Carolingians.jpg|thumb|Gothia and Marca Hispanica]]\nThe region of [[Roussillon]] was taken by the Franks in 760. Pepin then diverted northwest to Aquitaine, so triggering the war against [[Waifer of Aquitaine]]. [[Albi]], [[Rouergue]], [[G\u00e9vaudan]] and the city of Toulouse were conquered. In 777 the wali of [[Barcelona]], [[Sulayman al-Arabi]], and the wali of [[Huesca]] [[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Taur]], offered their submission to [[Charlemagne]] and also the submission of [[Husayn of Zaragoza|Husayn]], wali of Zaragoza. When Charlemagne invaded the Upper March in 778, Husayn refused allegiance and he had to retire. In the Pyrenees, the Basques [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass|defeated his forces in Roncesvalles]] (August 15, 778).\n\nThe Frankish king found Septimania and the borderlands so devastated and depopulated by warfare, with the inhabitants hiding among the mountains, that he made grants of land that were some of the earliest identifiable [[fief]]s to Visigothic and other refugees. Charlemagne also founded several monasteries in Septimania, around which the people gathered for protection. Beyond Septimania to the south Charlemagne established the [[Marca Hispanica|Spanish Marches]] in the borderlands of his empire.\n\nThe territory passed to Louis, king in Aquitaine, but it was governed by Frankish margraves and then dukes (from 817) of Septimania.\n\nThe Frankish noble [[Bernat of Septimania]] was the ruler of these lands from 826 to 832. His career (he was beheaded in 844) characterized the turbulent 9th century in Septimania. His appointment as [[List of Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]] in 826 occasioned a general uprising of the Catalan lords ([[Bellonids]]) at this intrusion of Frankish power over the lands of ''Gothia''. For suppressing [[Berenguer of Toulouse]] and the Catalans, [[Louis the Pious]] rewarded Bernat with a series of counties, which roughly delimit 9th century Septimania: Narbonne, B\u00e9ziers, Agde, Magalona, N\u00eemes and Uz\u00e9s. Rising against Charles the Bald in 843, Bernat was apprehended at Toulouse and beheaded. Bernat's son, known as [[Bernat of Gothia]], also served as Count of Barcelona and [[Count of Girona|Girona]], and as [[Margrave of Gothia]] and Septimania from 865 to 878.\n\nSeptimania became known as ''Gothia'' after the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. It retained these two names while it was ruled by the [[Count of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] during early part of the [[Middle Ages]], but other names became regionally more prominent such as, [[Roussillon]], [[County of Conflent|Conflent]], [[County of Raz\u00e8s|Raz\u00e8s]] or [[Foix]], and the name ''Gothia'' (along with the older name ''Septimania'') faded away during the 10th century, as the region fractured into smaller feudal entities, which sometimes retained Carolingian titles, but lost their Carolingian character, as the culture of Septimania evolved into the culture of [[Languedoc]]. This fragmentation in small feudal entities and the resulting fading and the gradual shifting of the name ''Gothia'' are the most probable origins of the ancient geographical area known as ''Gathalania'' or ''Cathalania'' which has reached our days as the present region of [[Catalonia]].\n\nThe name was used because the area was populated by a higher concentration of Goths than in surrounding regions. The rulers of this area, when joined with several counties, were titled the [[Marquis|Marquesses]] of Gothia (and, also, the [[Duke]]s of Septimania).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Septimania timeline]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|21em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bachrach |first=Bernard S. |authorlink=Bernard Bachrach |year=1971 |title=Merovingian Military Organization, 481\u2013751 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Roger |year=1989 |title=The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710\u201397 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Roger |year=2004 |title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=James |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward James (historian) |year=1980 |chapter=Septimania and its frontier: an archaeological approach |title=Visigothic Spain: New Approaches |editor=Edward James |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin, TX |url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/index.htm |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Stephen |year=1938 |title=Paganism and Pagan Survivals in Spain up to the Fall of the Visigothic Kingdom |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/index.htm |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |year=1983 |title=A History of Medieval Spain |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=E.&nbsp;A. |year=1969 |title=The Goths in Spain |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Zuckerman |first=Arthur J. |year=1972 |origyear=1965 |title=A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France 768\u2013900 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-03298-8 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{coord|43.6|3.2|dim:200000_region:FR|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Medieval France]]\n[[Category:Visigothic Kingdom]]\n[[Category:History of Occitanie]]\n[[Category:Carolingian Empire]]\n[[Category:Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[Category:Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Historical region in France}}\n[[Image:Map of Septimania in 537 AD.svg|thumb|300px|right|Septimania in 537]] \n'''Septimania''' ({{lang-fr|Septimanie}}, {{IPA-fr|s\u025bptimani|IPA}}; {{lang-oc|Septim\u00e0nia}}, {{IPA-oc|septi\u02c8manj\u0254|IPA}}; {{lang-ca|Septim\u00e0nia}}, {{IPA-ca|s\u0259pti\u02c8mani\u0259|IPA}}) is a [[historical region]] in modern-day southern [[France]]. It referred to the western part of the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] that passed to the control of the [[Visigoths]] in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, [[Theodoric II]]. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply '''Gallia''' or '''Narbonensis'''. Septimania territory roughly corresponds with the former administrative region of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] that merged into the new administrative region of [[Occitanie]]. Septimania was conquered by the [[Muslim]]s and was part of the [[Al-Andalus]]. It passed briefly to the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]], which had been expanding from the south during the eighth century before its subsequent conquest by the [[Franks]], who by the end of the ninth century termed it '''Gothia''' or the '''Gothic March''' (''Marca Gothica'').\n\nSeptimania became a [[March (territorial entity)|march]] of the [[Carolingian Empire]] and then [[West Francia]] down to the thirteenth century, though it was culturally and politically autonomous from northern France based central royal government. The region was under the influence of the people from the count territories of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]], [[Provence]], and ancient [[County of Barcelona]]. It was part of the wider cultural and linguistic region comprising the southern third of France known as [[Occitania]]. This area was finally brought under effective control of the French kings in the early 13th century as a result of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] after which it was assigned governors. From the end of the thirteenth century Septimania evolved into the royal province of [[Languedoc]].\n\nThe name \"Septimania\" may derive from part of the Roman name of the city of [[B\u00e9ziers]], ''Colonia Julia Septimanorum Beaterrae'', which in turn alludes to the settlement of veterans of the [[Legio VII Claudia|Roman VII Legion]] in the city. Another possible derivation of the name is in reference to the seven cities (''civitates'') of the territory: B\u00e9ziers, [[Elne]], [[Agde]], [[Narbonne]], [[Lod\u00e8ve]], [[Maguelonne]], and [[N\u00eemes]]. Septimania extended to a line halfway between the Mediterranean and the [[Garonne River]] in the northwest; in the east the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] separated it from [[Provence]]; and to the south its boundary was formed by the [[Pyrenees]].\n\n==Visigothic Narbonensis==\n\n===Gothic acquisition===\nUnder Theodoric II, the Visigoths settled in [[Aquitaine]] as ''[[foederati]]'' of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (450s). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] refers to Septimania as \"theirs\" during the reign of [[Avitus]] (455\u2013456), but Sidonius is probably considering Visigothic settlement of and around [[Toulouse]].<ref name=\"James, 223\">{{harvp|James|1980|p=223}}</ref> The Visigoths were then holding the Toulousain against the legal claims of the Empire, though they had more than once offered to exchange it for the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]].<ref name=\"James, 223\"/>\n\nIn 462 the Empire, controlled by [[Ricimer]] in the name of [[Libius Severus]], granted the Visigoths the western half of the province of Gallia Narbonensis to settle. The Visigoths occupied [[Provence]] (eastern Narbonensis) as well and only in 475 did the Visigothic king, [[Euric]], cede it to the Empire by a treaty whereby the emperor [[Julius Nepos]] recognised the Visigoths' full independence.\n\n===Kingdom of Narbonne===\nThe Visigoths, perhaps because they were [[Arianism|Arians]], met with the opposition of the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Franks]] in Gaul.<ref>{{harvp|Bachrach|1971|p=7}}</ref> The Franks allied with the ''[[Armorica|Armorici]]'', whose land was under constant threat from the Goths south of the [[Loire]], and in 507 [[Clovis I]], the Frankish king, invaded the Visigothic kingdom, whose capital lay in Toulouse, with the consent of the leading men of the tribe.<ref>{{harvp|Bachrach|1971|pp=10\u201311}}</ref> Clovis defeated the Goths in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] and the child-king [[Amalaric]] was carried for safety into Iberia while [[Gesalec]] was elected to replace him and rule from [[Narbonne]].\n\nClovis, his son [[Theuderic I]], and his [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] allies proceeded to conquer most of Visigothic Gaul, including the [[Rouergue]] (507) and Toulouse (508). The attempt to take [[Carcassonne]], a fortified site guarding the Septimanian coast, was defeated by the [[Ostrogoths]] (508) and Septimania thereafter remained in Visigothic hands, though the Burgundians managed to hold Narbonne for a time and drive Gesalec into exile. Border warfare between Gallo-Roman magnates, including bishops, had existed with the Visigoths during the last phase of the Empire and it continued under the Franks.<ref>{{harvp|Bachrach|1971|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe Ostrogothic king [[Theodoric the Great]] reconquered Narbonne from the Burgundians and retained it as the provincial capital. [[Theudis]] was appointed regent at Narbonne by Theodoric while Amalaric was still a minor in Iberia. When Theodoric died in 526, Amalaric was elected king in his own right and he immediately made his capital in Narbonne. He ceded Provence, which had at some point passed back into Visigothic control, to the Ostrogothic king [[Athalaric]]. The Frankish king of Paris, [[Childebert I]], invaded Septimania in 531 and chased Amalaric to [[Barcelona]] in response to pleas from his sister, [[Clotilde_(died_531)| Chrotilda]], that her husband, Amalaric, had been mistreating her. The Franks however, did not try to hold the province and under Amalaric's successor, the centre of gravity of the kingdom crossed the Pyrenees and Theudis made his capital in Barcelona.\n\n===Gothic province of Gallia===\nIn the Visigothic kingdom, which became centred on [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] by the end of the reign of [[Leovigild]], the province of Gallia Narbonensis, usually shortened to just Gallia or Narbonensis and never called Septimania,<ref name=\"James, 223\"/> was both an administrative province of the central royal government and an ecclesiastical province whose [[metropolitan (religion)|metropolitan]] was the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]]. Originally, the Goths may have maintained their hold on the [[Albigeois]], but if so it was conquered by the time of [[Chilperic I]].<ref name=\"James236\">{{harvp|James|1980|p=236}}</ref> There is archaeological evidence that some enclaves of Visigothic population remained in Frankish Gaul, near the Septimanian border, after 507.<ref name=\"James236\"/>\n\nThe province of Gallia held a unique place in the Visigothic kingdom, as it was the only province outside of Iberia, north of the Pyrenees, and bordering a strong foreign nation, in this case the [[Franks]]. The kings after Alaric II favoured Narbonne as a capital, but twice (611 and 531) were defeated and forced back to [[Barcelona]] by the Franks before Theudis moved the capital there permanently. Under Theodoric Septimania had been safe from Frankish assault, but was raided by [[Childebert I]] twice (531 and 541). When [[Liuva I]] succeeded the throne in 568, Septimania was a dangerous frontier province and Iberia was wracked by revolts.<ref name=\"Thompson19\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=19}}</ref> Liuva granted Iberia to his son Leovigild and took Septimania to himself.<ref name=\"Thompson19\"/>\n\nDuring the revolt of [[Hermenegild]] (583\u2013585) against his father Leovigild, Septimania was invaded by [[Guntram]], [[King of Burgundy]], possible in support of Hermenegild's revolt, since the latter was married to his niece [[Ingund (wife of Hermenegild)|Ingundis]]. The Frankish attack of 585 was repulsed by Hermenegild's brother [[Reccared]], who was ruling Narbonensis as a sub-king. Hermenegild died at [[Tarragona]] that year and it is possible that he had escaped confinement in [[Valencia]] and was seeking to join up with his Frankish allies.<ref name=\"Collins60\">{{harvp|Collins|2004|p=60}}</ref> Alternatively, the invasion may have occurred in response to Hermenegild's death.<ref name=\"Thompson, 75\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=75}}</ref> Reccared meanwhile took [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]] (Ugernum) on the [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rh\u00f4ne]] near [[Tarascon]] and [[Cabaret]] (a fort called Ram's Head), both of which lay in Guntram's kingdom.<ref name=\"Collins60\"/><ref name=\"Thompson, 75\"/> Guntram ignored two pleas for a peace in 586 and Reccared undertook the only Visigothic invasion of Francia in response.<ref name=\"Thompson, 75\"/> However, Guntram was not motivated solely by religious alliance with the fellow Catholic Hermenegild, for he invaded Septimania again in 589 and was roundly defeated near Carcassonne by [[Claudius, Duke of Lusitania]].<ref name=\"Thompson, 95\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=95}}</ref> It is clear that the Franks, throughout the sixth century, had coveted Septimania, but were unable to take it and the invasion of 589 was the last attempt.\n\nIn the seventh century, Gallia often had its own governors or ''duces'' (dukes), who were typically Visigoths. Most public offices were also held by Goths, far out of proportion to their part of the population.<ref name=\"Thompson227\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=227}}</ref>\n\n===Culture of Gothic Septimania===\nThe native population of Gallia was referred to by Visigothic and Iberian writers as the \"Gauls\" and there is a well-attested hatred between the Goths and the Gaul which was atypical for the kingdom as a whole.<ref name=\"Thompson227\"/> The Gauls commonly insulted the Goths by comparing the strength of their men to that of Gaulish women, though the Spaniards regarded themselves as the defenders and protectors of the Gauls. It is only in the time of [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]] (reigned 672-680) and [[Julian of Toledo]], however, that a large Jewish population becomes evident in Septimania: Julian referred to it as a \"brothel of blaspheming Jews.\"<ref name=\"Thompson228\">{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=228}}</ref>\n\nThanks to the preserved canons of the [[Council of Narbonne]] of 590, a good deal can be known about surviving pagan practices in Visigothic Septimania. The Council may have been responding in part to the orders of the [[Third Council of Toledo]], which found \"the sacrilege of idolatry [to be] firmly implanted throughout almost the whole of Iberia and Septimania.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=54}}</ref> The Roman pagan practice of not working Thursdays in honour of [[Jove|Jupiter]] was still prevalent.<ref name=\"McKenna1178\">{{harvp|McKenna|1938|pp=117\u2013118}}</ref> The council set down penance to be done for not working on Thursday save for church festivals and commanded the practice of [[Martin of Braga]], rest from rural work on Sundays, to be adopted.<ref name=\"McKenna1178\"/> Also punished by the council were fortunetellers, who were publicly lashed and sold into slavery.\n\nDifferent theories exist concerning the nature of the frontier between Septimania and Frankish Gaul. On the one hand, cultural exchange is generally reputed to have been minimal,<ref>{{harvp|Thompson|1969|p=23}}</ref> but the level of trading activity has been disputed. There have been few to no objects of [[Neustria]]n, [[Austrasia]]n, or [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] provenance discovered in Septimania.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref> However, a series of [[sarcophagi]] of a unique regional style, variously labelled Visigothic, Aquitainian, or south-west Gallic, are prevalent on both sides of the Septimania border.<ref name=\"James229\">{{harvp|James|1980|p=229}}</ref> These sarcophagi are made of locally quarried marble from [[Saint-B\u00e9at]] and are of varied design, but with generally flat relief which distinguishes them from Roman sarcophagi.<ref name=\"James229\"/> Their production has been dated to either the 5th, 6th, or 7th century, with the second of these being considered the most likely today.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|p=230}}</ref> However, if they were made in the 5th century, while both Aquitaine and Septimani were in Visigothic hands, their existence provides no evidence for a cultural osmosis across the Gothic-Frankish frontier. A unique style of orange pottery was common in the 4th and 5th centuries in southern Gaul, but the later (6th century) examples culled from Septimania are more orange than their cousins from Aquitaine and Provence and are not found commonly outside of Septimania, a strong indicator that there was little commerce over the frontier or at its ports.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|p=238}}</ref> In fact, Septimania helped to isolate both Aquitaine and Iberia from the rest of the Mediterranean world.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|pp=240\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nCoinage of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic kingdom of Hispania]] did not circulate in Gaul outside of Septimania and Frankish coinage did not circulate in the Visigothic kingdom, including Septimania. If there had been a significant amount of commerce over the frontier, the monies paid had to have been melted down immediately and re-minted as foreign coins have not been preserved across the frontier.<ref>{{harvp|James|1980|p=239}}</ref>\n\n==Muslim Septimania==\nThe [[Arabs]], under [[Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani|Al-Samh ibn Malik]], the governor-general of [[al-Andalus]], sweeping up the Iberian peninsula, by 719 overran Septimania; al-Samh set up his capital from 720 at [[Narbonne]], which the Moors called \"Arbuna\", offering the still largely [[Arianism|Arianist Christian]] inhabitants generous terms and quickly pacifying the other cities. Following the conquest, [[al-Andalus]] was divided into five administrative areas, roughly corresponding to present [[Andalusia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Lusitania]], [[Castile and L\u00e9on]], [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], and the ancient province of Septimania.<ref>{{harvp|O'Callaghan|1983|p=142}}</ref> With Narbonne secure, and equally important, its port, for the Arab mariners were masters now of the Western Mediterranean, al-Samh swiftly subdued the largely unresisting cities, still controlled by their Visigoth counts: taking [[Alet]] and [[B\u00e9ziers]], [[Agde]], [[Lod\u00e8ve]], [[Maguelonne]] and [[N\u00eemes]]. \n[[File:Vasconia wide 740 3 - 80.jpg|thumb|300px|Military campaigns around the Pyrenees and Septimania]]\nBy 721 he was reinforced and ready to lay siege to [[Toulouse]], a possession that would open up bordering [[Aquitaine]] to him on the same terms as Septimania. But his plans were thwarted in the disastrous [[Battle of Toulouse (721)]], with immense losses, in which al-Samh was so seriously wounded that he soon died at Narbonne. Arab forces, soundly based in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea, struck in the 720s, conquering [[Carcassonne]] on the north-western fringes of Septimania (725) and penetrating eastwards as far as [[Autun]] (725).\n\nIn 731, the [[Berber people|Berber]] lord of the region of [[Cerdagne]] [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], called \"Munuza\" by the Franks, was an ally of the Duke of Aquitaine [[Odo the Great]] after he revolted against Cordova, but the rebel lord was defeated and killed by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], so opening Aquitaine to the Umayyads.\n\nAfter capturing [[Bordeaux]] on the wake of [[Hunald I of Aquitaine|duke Hunald]]'s detachment attempt, [[Charles Martel]] directed his attention to Septimania and [[Provence]]. While his reasons for leading a military expedition south remain unclear, it seems that he wanted to seal his newly secured grip on Burgundy, now threatened by Umayyad occupation of several cities lying in the lower Rhone, or maybe it provided the excuse he needed to intervene in this territory ruled by [[Visigothic Code|Gothic]] and [[Roman law|Roman]] law, far off from the Frankish centre in the north of Gaul. In 737 the Frankish leader went on to [[Battle of Narbonne (737)|attack Narbonne]], but the city held firm, defended by its Goths and Jews under the command of its governor Yusuf, 'Abd er-Rahman's heir. Charles had to go back north without subduing Narbonne, leaving behind a trail of destroyed cities, i.e. Avignon, N\u00eemes and other Septimanian fortresses.\n\n[[File:Septimania 752-759.jpg|thumb|450px|Septimania during Pepin\u00b4s expedition (752-759)]]\nAround 747 the government of the Septimania region (and the [[Upper March]], from Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es to Ebro River) was given to [[Umar ibn Umar]]. In 752 Pippin headed south to Septimania. [[Goths|Gothic]] counts of [[N\u00eemes]], [[Melguelh]], [[Agde]] and [[B\u00e9ziers]] refused allegiance to the emir at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordova]] and declared their loyalty to the Frankish king&mdash;the count of N\u00eemes, [[Ansemund]], having some authority over the remaining counts. The Gothic counts and the Franks then began to besiege [[Narbonne]], where [[Mil\u00f3 of Narbonne|Mil\u00f3]] was probably the count (as successor of the count [[Gilbert of Narbonne|Gilbert]]). However, the strongly Gothic Narbonne under Muslim rule resisted to the Carolingian thrust. Moreover, attacks on the rearguard by a Basque army under the Aquitanian duke Waifer didn't make things easy to Pippin.\n\nIn 754 an anti-Frank reaction, led by Ermeniard, killed Ansemund, but the uprising was without success and [[Radulf of Narbonne|Radulf]] was designated new count by the Frankish court. About 755 [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Uqba]] replaced Umar ibn Umar. [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|Narbonne capitulated in 759]] only after Pippin promised the defenders of the city to uphold the Gothic law, and the county was granted to Mil\u00f3, the Gothic count in Muslim times, thus earning the loyalty of Septimania's Goths against Waifer.\n\nIslamic burials have been found in N\u00eemes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Netburn|first1=Deborah|title=Earliest Known Medieval Muslim Graves are Discovered in France|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-muslim-graves-france-20160222-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Newitz|first1=Annalee|title=Medieval Muslim Graves in France Reveal a Previously Unseen History|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/medieval-muslim-graves-in-france-reveal-a-previously-unseen-history/|website=Ars Technica|date=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=France's Earliest 'Muslim Burials' Found|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35660488|work=BBC News|date=25 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Gleize, Yves|author2=Mendisco, Fanny|author3=Pemonge, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne|author4=Hubert, Christophe|author5=Groppi, Alexis|author6=Houix, Bertrand|author7=Deguilloux, Marie-France|author8=Breuil, Jean-Yves|title=Early Medieval Muslim Graves in France: First Archaeological, Anthropological and Palaeogenomic Evidence|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=2|pages=e0148583|date=24 February 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0148583|pmid=26910855|pmc=4765927}}</ref>\n\n==Gothia in Carolingian times==\n[[File:Eastern Pyrenees under the Carolingians.jpg|thumb|Gothia and Marca Hispanica]]\nThe region of [[Roussillon]] was taken by the Franks in 760. Pepin then diverted northwest to Aquitaine, so triggering the war against [[Waifer of Aquitaine]]. [[Albi]], [[Rouergue]], [[G\u00e9vaudan]] and the city of Toulouse were conquered. In 777 the wali of [[Barcelona]], [[Sulayman al-Arabi]], and the wali of [[Huesca]] [[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Taur]], offered their submission to [[Charlemagne]] and also the submission of [[Husayn of Zaragoza|Husayn]], wali of Zaragoza. When Charlemagne invaded the Upper March in 778, Husayn refused allegiance and he had to retire. In the Pyrenees, the Basques [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass|defeated his forces in Roncesvalles]] (August 15, 778).\n\nThe Frankish king found Septimania and the borderlands so devastated and depopulated by warfare, with the inhabitants hiding among the mountains, that he made grants of land that were some of the earliest identifiable [[fief]]s to Visigothic and other refugees. Charlemagne also founded several monasteries in Septimania, around which the people gathered for protection. Beyond Septimania to the south Charlemagne established the [[Marca Hispanica|Spanish Marches]] in the borderlands of his empire.\n\nThe territory passed to Louis, king in Aquitaine, but it was governed by Frankish margraves and then dukes (from 817) of Septimania.\n\nThe Frankish noble [[Bernat of Septimania]] was the ruler of these lands from 826 to 832. His career (he was beheaded in 844) characterized the turbulent 9th century in Septimania. His appointment as [[List of Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]] in 826 occasioned a general uprising of the Catalan lords ([[Bellonids]]) at this intrusion of Frankish power over the lands of ''Gothia''. For suppressing [[Berenguer of Toulouse]] and the Catalans, [[Louis the Pious]] rewarded Bernat with a series of counties, which roughly delimit 9th century Septimania: Narbonne, B\u00e9ziers, Agde, Magalona, N\u00eemes and Uz\u00e9s. Rising against Charles the Bald in 843, Bernat was apprehended at Toulouse and beheaded. Bernat's son, known as [[Bernat of Gothia]], also served as Count of Barcelona and [[Count of Girona|Girona]], and as [[Margrave of Gothia]] and Septimania from 865 to 878.\n\nSeptimania became known as ''Gothia'' after the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. It retained these two names while it was ruled by the [[Count of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] during early part of the [[Middle Ages]], but other names became regionally more prominent such as, [[Roussillon]], [[County of Conflent|Conflent]], [[County of Raz\u00e8s|Raz\u00e8s]] or [[Foix]], and the name ''Gothia'' (along with the older name ''Septimania'') faded away during the 10th century, as the region fractured into smaller feudal entities, which sometimes retained Carolingian titles, but lost their Carolingian character, as the culture of Septimania evolved into the culture of [[Languedoc]]. This fragmentation in small feudal entities and the resulting fading and the gradual shifting of the name ''Gothia'' are the most probable origins of the ancient geographical area known as ''Gathalania'' or ''Cathalania'' which has reached our days as the present region of [[Catalonia]].\n\nThe name was used because the area was populated by a higher concentration of Goths than in surrounding regions. The rulers of this area, when joined with several counties, were titled the [[Marquis|Marquesses]] of Gothia (and, also, the [[Duke]]s of Septimania).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Septimania timeline]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|21em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bachrach |first=Bernard S. |authorlink=Bernard Bachrach |year=1971 |title=Merovingian Military Organization, 481\u2013751 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Roger |year=1989 |title=The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710\u201397 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Roger |year=2004 |title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=James |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward James (historian) |year=1980 |chapter=Septimania and its frontier: an archaeological approach |title=Visigothic Spain: New Approaches |editor=Edward James |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin, TX |url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/index.htm |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Stephen |year=1938 |title=Paganism and Pagan Survivals in Spain up to the Fall of the Visigothic Kingdom |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/index.htm |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |year=1983 |title=A History of Medieval Spain |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=E.&nbsp;A. |year=1969 |title=The Goths in Spain |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Zuckerman |first=Arthur J. |year=1972 |origyear=1965 |title=A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France 768\u2013900 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-03298-8 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{coord|43.6|3.2|dim:200000_region:FR|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Medieval France]]\n[[Category:Visigothic Kingdom]]\n[[Category:History of Occitanie]]\n[[Category:Carolingian Empire]]\n[[Category:Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[Category:Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n", "name_user": "Compassionate727", "label": "safe", "comment": "Clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimania"}
