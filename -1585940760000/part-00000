They are a subrange of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and form part of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Physiographic Province]].  The range is sometimes called the '''Smoky Mountains''' and the name is commonly shortened to the '''Smokies'''.  The Great Smokies are best known as the home of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], which protects most of the range.  The park was established in 1934, and, with over 11 million visits per year, it is the most visited national park in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Smokies Parkway Top List of Visitors|url=http://www.smliv.com/blog/great-smokies-parkway-top-list-of-visitors/|website=SMLiv.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Smokies are part of an [[International Biosphere Reserve]].  The range is home to an estimated {{convert|187000|acre|ha}} of [[old growth]] forest, constituting the largest such stand east of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Rose Houk, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park: A Natural History Guide'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1993),  198.</ref><ref name = \"OldGrowthEastNC\" />  The [[cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove]] hardwood forests in the range's lower elevations are among the most diverse ecosystems in North America, and the [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest]] that coats the range's upper elevations is the largest of its kind.<ref>Houk, 50.</ref> The Great Smokies are also home to the densest [[American black bear|black bear]] population in the Eastern United States and the most diverse [[salamander]] population outside of the tropics.<ref>Houk, 112, 119.</ref>\n\nAlong with the Biosphere reserve, the Great Smokies have been designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].  The U.S. [[National Park Service]] preserves and maintains [[List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park|78 structures within the national park]] that were once part of the numerous small [[Appalachia]]n communities scattered throughout the range's river valleys and coves.  The park contains five historic districts and nine individual listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe name \"Smoky\" comes from the natural fog that often hangs over the range and presents as large smoke plumes from a distance.  This fog is caused by the vegetation exhaling [[volatile organic compounds]], chemicals that have a high vapor pressure and easily form vapors at normal temperature and pressure.<ref>Laura Naranjo, \"[http://earthdata.nasa.gov/featured-stories/featured-research/volatile-trees Volatile Trees],\" NASA.gov, 20 November 2011.

The northwestern half of the range gives way to a series of elongate ridges known as the \"Foothills,\" the outermost of which include [[Chilhowee Mountain]] and [[English Mountain]].  The range is roughly bounded on the south by the [[Tuckasegee River]] and to the southeast by Soco Creek and Jonathan Creek.  The Great Smokies comprise parts of [[Blount County, Tennessee|Blount County]], [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]], and [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]] in Tennessee and [[Swain County, North Carolina|Swain County]] and [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood County]] in North Carolina.\n\nThe sources of several rivers are located in the Smokies, including the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]], the [[Oconaluftee River]], and [[Little River (Tennessee)|Little River]].  Streams in the Smokies are part of the [[Tennessee River]] watershed and are thus entirely west of the [[Eastern Continental Divide]].  The largest stream wholly within the park is [[Abrams Creek (Tennessee)|Abrams Creek]], which rises in Cades Cove and empties into the Chilhowee Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River near [[Chilhowee Dam]].  \n\nOther major streams include Hazel Creek and Eagle Creek in the southwest, Raven Fork near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]], Cosby Creek near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and [[Roaring Fork (Great Smoky Mountains)|Roaring Fork]] near [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]].  The Little Tennessee River passes through five impoundments along the range's southwestern boundary, namely [[Tellico Lake]], [[Chilhowee Dam|Chilhowee Lake]], [[Calderwood Dam|Calderwood Lake]], [[Cheoah Dam|Cheoah Lake]], and [[Fontana Lake]].\n\n===Notable peaks===\nThe highest point in the Smokies is [[Clingmans Dome]], which rises to an elevation of {{convert|6643|ft|m}}.  The mountain is the highest in Tennessee and the third highest in the Appalachian range.  Clingmans Dome also has the range's highest [[topographical prominence]] at {{convert|4503|ft|m}}.  [[Mount Le Conte (Tennessee)|Mount Le Conte]] is the ''tallest'' (i.e., from immediate base to summit) mountain in the range, rising {{convert|5301|ft|m}} from its base in Gatlinburg to its {{convert|6593|ft|m|sing=on}} summit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

The Ocoee Supergroup consists primarily of slightly metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate.  Early Precambrian rocks, which include the oldest rocks in the Smokies, comprise the dominant rock type in the Raven Fork Valley (near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]]) and lower Tuckasegee River between [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] and [[Bryson City, North Carolina|Bryson City]].  They consist primarily of metamorphic [[gneiss]], [[granite]], and [[schist]].  Cambrian sedimentary rocks are found among the outer reaches of the Foothills to the northwest and in limestone coves such as [[Cades Cove]].<ref>Harry Moore, ''A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32.</ref>\n\nThe Precambrian gneiss and schists\u2014the oldest rocks in the Smokies\u2014formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock in a primordial ocean.  In the Late Precambrian period, this ocean expanded, and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from accumulations of the eroding land mass onto the ocean's continental shelf.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\">Houk, 10\u201317.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[Paleozoic]] era, the ancient ocean had deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rocks such as limestone.  During the Ordovician period, the North American and African plates collided, destroying the ancient ocean and initiating the [[Alleghenian orogeny]]\u2014the mountain-building epoch that created the Appalachian range.  The Mesozoic era saw the rapid erosion of the softer sedimentary rocks from the new mountains, re-exposing the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\" />\n\nAround 20,000 years ago, subarctic glaciers advanced southward across North America, and although they never reached the Smokies, the advancing glaciers led to colder mean annual temperatures and an increase in precipitation throughout the range.  Trees were unable to survive at the higher elevations, and were replaced by [[tundra]] vegetation.  Spruce-fir forests occupied the valleys and slopes below approximately {{convert|4950|ft|m}}.  The persistent freezing and thawing during this period created the large blockfields that are often found at the base of large mountain slopes.<ref name=\"moore_40-44\">Moore, 40-44.</ref> \n\nBetween 16,500 and 12,500 years ago, the glaciers to the north retreated and mean annual temperatures rose.  The tundra vegetation disappeared, and the spruce-fir forests retreated to the highest elevations.  Hardwood trees moved into the region from the coastal plains, replacing the spruce-fir forests in the lower elevations.  The temperatures continued warming until around 6,000 years ago, when they began to gradually grow cooler.<ref name=\"moore_40-44\" />\n\n==Flora==\n{{see also|Appalachian temperate rainforest}}\n\nHeavy logging in the late 19th century and early 20th century devastated much of the forests of the Smokies, but the National Park Service estimates {{convert|187000|acre|km2}} of old growth forest remains,<ref name=\"OldGrowthEastNC\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/nc.pdf \n |title=Old Growth in the East: A Survey.

[[Tilia heterophylla|White basswood]] (''Tilia heterophylla''), [[Acer spicatum|mountain maple]] (''Acer spicatum'') and [[Acer pensylvanicum|striped maple]] (''Acer pensylvanicum''), and [[Aesculus flava|yellow buckeye]] (''Aesculus flava'') are also present.  The northern hardwood understory is home to diverse species such as coneflower, skunk goldenrod, [[Rugelia nudicaulis|Rugels ragwort]], [[bloodroot]], hydrangea, and several species of grasses and ferns.<ref>28-29.</ref>\n\nOne unique community in the northern hardwoods of the Smokies is the beech gap, or beech orchard.  Beech gaps consist of high mountain gaps that have been monopolized by beech trees.  The beech trees are often twisted and contorted by the high winds that occur in these gaps.  Why other tree types such as the red spruce fail to encroach into the beech gaps is unknown.<ref>Houk, 30.</ref>\n\n===Spruce-fir forest===\n[[File:Clingmans Dome-27527-1.jpg|thumb|[[Spruce fir]] stand near the summit of Clingmans Dome]]\n\nThe spruce-fir forest\u2014also called the \"boreal\" or \"Canadian\" forest\u2014is a relict of the [[ice ages]], when mean annual temperatures in the Smokies were too cold to support a hardwood forest.  While the rise in temperatures between 12,500 and 6,000 years ago allowed the hardwoods to return, the spruce-fir forest has managed to survive on the harsh mountain tops, typically above {{convert|5500|ft|m}}.  About {{convert|10600|acre|km2}} of the spruce-fir forest are old-growth.<ref name = \"OldGrowthEastNC\"/>\n\nThe spruce-fir forest consists primarily of two [[conifer]] species\u2014[[Picea rubens|red spruce]] (''Picea rubens'') and [[Abies fraseri|Fraser fir]] (''Abies fraseri'').   The Fraser Firs, which are native to Southern Appalachia, once dominated elevations above {{convert|6200|ft|m}} in the Great Smokies.  Most of these firs were killed, however, by an infestation of the [[balsam wooly adelgid]], which arrived in the Smokies in the early 1960s.  Thus, red spruce is now the dominant species in the range's spruce-fir forest.  Large stands of dead Fraser Firs remain atop Clingmans Dome and on the northwestern slopes of Old Black.  While much of the red spruce stands in the Smokies were logged during [[World War I]], the tree is still common throughout the range above {{convert|5500|ft|m}}.  Some of the red spruce trees in the Smokies are believed to be 300 years old, and the tallest rise to over {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>Houk, 50-53.</ref>\n\nThe main difference between the spruce-fir forests of Southern Appalachia and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former.  The spruce-fir understories of the Smokies are home to [[Rhododendron catawbiense|catawba rhododendron]], [[Sorbus americana|mountain ash]], [[Prunus pensylvanica|pin cherry]], thornless blackberry, and [[Viburnum lantanoides|hobblebush]].  The herbaceous and litter layers of the spruce-fir forests are poorly lit year-round, and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as ferns, namely [[Dryopteris campyloptera|mountain wood fern]] and [[Athyrium filix-femina|northern lady fern]], and over 280 species of mosses.<ref>Houk, 50, 54-55.</ref>\n\n===Wildflowers===\n{{Main|Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains}}\n\n[[File:Ben-parton-mtn-laurel-tn1.jpg|thumb|[[Rhododendron]] atop the Ben Parton Lookout]]\n\nMany [[wildflower]]s grow in mountains and valleys of the Great Smokies, including [[bee balm]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[Dutchman's breeches]], various [[trillium]]s, the Dragon's Advocate and even hardy [[orchid]]s.  There are two native species of rhododendron in the area.  The [[Catawba rhododendron]] has purple flowers in May and June, while the [[rhododendron|rosebay rhododendron]] has longer leaves and blooms white or a light pink in June and July.  \n\nThe orange- to sometimes red-flowered and deciduous [[Rhododendron calendulaceum|flame azalea]] closely follows along with the Catawbas.  The closely related [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] blooms in between the two, and all of the blooms progress from lower to higher elevations.  The reverse is true in [[autumn]], when nearly bare mountaintops covered in [[Rime (frost)|rime ice]] (frozen fog) can be separated from green [[valley]]s by very bright and varied leaf colors.  The rhododendrons are [[Broadleaf tree|broadleaf]]s, whose leaves droop in order to shed wet and heavy [[snow]]s that come through the region during winter.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Bear-great-smoky-mtns-nps1.jpg|thumb|A black bear in the Great Smokies]]\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains are home to 66 species of mammals, over 240 species of birds, 43 species of amphibians, 60 species of fish, and 40 species of reptiles.

The larger rainbow and brown trout outcompete the native brook trout for food and habitat at lower elevations. As such, most of the brook trout found in the park today are in streams above 3,000 feet in elevation.

One Cherokee legend tells of a magical lake hidden deep within the range, but inaccessible to humans.<ref>James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972).</ref>  Another tells of a captured [[Shawnee]] medicine man named Aganunitsi who, in exchange for his freedom, travels to the remote sections of the range in search of the [[Uktena]].<ref>Mooney, 299.</ref> The Cherokee called Gregory Bald ''Tsitsuyi'', or \"rabbit place,\" and believed the mountain to be the domain of the Great Rabbit.<ref>Mooney, 407.</ref> Other Cherokee place names in the Smokies included ''Duniskwalgunyi'', or \"forked antlers\", which referred to the Chimney Tops, and ''kuwahi'', or \"mulberry place\", which referred to Clingmans Dome.<ref>Mooney, 516.</ref>\n\nMost Cherokee settlements were located in the river valleys on the outer fringe of the Great Smokies range.  The Smokies, along with the Unicois, provided the main bulwark dividing the [[Overhill Cherokee]] villages in modern Tennessee from the Cherokee Middle towns in modern North Carolina.  The Overhill town of [[Chilhowee (Cherokee town)|Chilhowee]] was situated at the confluence of Abrams Creek and the Little Tennessee, and the Overhill town of [[Tallassee (Cherokee town)|Tallassee]] was located just a few miles upstream near modern [[Calderwood, Tennessee|Calderwood]] (both village sites are now under Chilhowee Lake).  A string of Overhill villages, including [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]] and [[Tanasi]], dotted the Little Tennessee valley north of Chilhowee.<ref>Gerald Schroedl, \"[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1026 Overhill Cherokees].\"  ''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2002.

The village of Oconaluftee, which was situated along the [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]] River near the modern Oconaluftee Visitor Center, was the only known permanent Cherokee village located within the national park's boundaries.  Sporadic or seasonal settlements were located in [[Cades Cove]] and the [[Hazel Creek (Great Smoky Mountains)|Hazel Creek]] valley.<ref>Duane Oliver, ''Hazel Creek From Then Till Now'' (Maryville, Tenn.: Stinnett Printing, 1989), 2-3.</ref>\n\n===European settlement===\n[[File:Great-smoky-mountains-places-tn1.gif|thumb|upright=1.75|Communities past and present of the Great Smoky Mountains. The green areas denote the modern national park.]]\n\nEuropean explorers and settlers began arriving in Western North Carolina and East Tennessee in the mid-18th century.  The influx of settlers at the end of the [[French and Indian War]] brought conflict with the Cherokee, who still held legal title to much of the land.  When the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] in 1776, American forces launched an invasion of Cherokee territory.<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\">Vicki Rozema, ''Footsteps of the Cherokees'' (Winston-Salem: John F. Blair Publisher, 1995), 58\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe Middle towns, including Kittuwa, were burned by General [[Griffith Rutherford]], and several of the Overhill towns were burned by [[John Sevier]].  By 1805, the Cherokee had ceded control of the Great Smokies to the U.S. government.  Although much of the tribe was forced west along the [[Trail of Tears]] in 1838, a few\u2014largely through the efforts of [[William Holland Thomas]]\u2014managed to retain their land on the [[Qualla Boundary]] and today comprise the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\" />\n\nIn the 1780s, several frontier outposts had been established along the outskirts of the Smokies, namely Whitson's Fort in what is now [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]] and Wear's Fort in what is now [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]].  Permanent settlers began arriving in these areas in the 1790s.  In 1801, the Whaley brothers, [[William Whaley|William]] and John, moved from North Carolina to become the first settlers in what is now the [[Greenbrier (Great Smoky Mountains)|Greenbrier]] section of the park.<ref>Carson Brewer, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Portland, Ore.: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 18.</ref>  \n\nIn 1802, [[Edgefield, South Carolina]] resident William Ogle (1751\u20131803) arrived in [[White Oak Flats]] where he cut and prepared logs for cabin construction.  Although Ogle died shortly after returning to Edgefield, his wife, [[Martha Jane Huskey]], eventually returned with her family and several other families to White Oak Flats, becoming the first permanent settlers in what would eventually become [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]].  Their children and grandchildren spread out southward into the [[Sugarlands]] and [[Roaring Fork (Great Smoky Mountains)|Roaring Fork]] areas.<ref>Brewer, 18.</ref>  \n\nCades Cove was settled largely by families who had purchased lots from land speculator William \"Fighting Billy\" Tipton. The first of these settlers, John and Lucretia Oliver, arrived in 1818.<ref>Durwood Dunn, ''Cades Cove: The Life and Death of An Appalachian Community'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 1-9.</ref>  Two Cades Cove settlers, Moses and Patience Proctor, crossed over to the North Carolina side of the Smokies in 1836 to become the first Euro-American settlers in the [[Hazel Creek (Great Smoky Mountains)|Hazel Creek]] area.<ref>Oliver, 8-9.</ref> The [[Cataloochee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Cataloochee]] area was first settled by the Caldwell family, who migrated to the valley in 1834.<ref>Hattie Caldwell Davis, ''Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains'' (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 17-32.</ref> \n    \nLike most of Southern Appalachia, the early 19th-century economy of the Smokies relied on [[subsistence agriculture]]. The average farm consisted of roughly {{convert|50|acre|km2}}, part of which was cultivated and part of which was woodland. Early settlers lived in {{convert|16|ft|m}} x {{convert|20|ft|m}} log cabins, although these were replaced by more elaborate log houses and eventually, as lumber became available, by modern frame houses. Most farms included at least one barn, a [[springhouse]] (used for refrigeration), a [[smokehouse]] (used for curing meat), a [[chicken coop]] (protected chickens from predators), and a [[corn crib]] (kept corn dry and protected it from rodents). Some of the more industrious farmers operated [[gristmill]]s, [[general store]]<nowiki/>s, and [[sorghum]] presses.<ref>Jerry Wear, ''Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County'' (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 5\u20136.</ref> Religion was a central theme in the lives of the early residents of the Smokies, and community life was typically centered on churches. Christian [[Protestantism]]\u2014especially [[Primitive Baptists]], [[Missionary Baptists]], [[Methodists]], and [[Presbyterians]]; dominated the religious culture of the region.\n\n===American Civil War===\nWhile both Tennessee and North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sentiment in the Great Smoky Mountains was much stronger relative to other regions in these two states.  Generally, the communities on the Tennessee side of the Smokies supported the Union, while communities on the North Carolina side supported the Confederates.  On the Tennessee side, 74% of Cocke Countians, 80% of Blount Countians, and 96% of Sevier Countians voted against secession.<ref>Eric Lacy, ''Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 217-233.</ref>  In the North Carolina Smokies\u2014[[Cherokee County, North Carolina|Cherokee]], [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood]], [[Jackson County, North Carolina|Jackson]], and [[Macon County, North Carolina|Macon]] counties\u2014about 46% of the population favored secession.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/historyculture/civil-war-1.htm Civil War Journal: Divided Loyalties], Great Smoky Mountains National Park website. Retrieved: 23 June 2015.</ref>\n\nWhile no major engagements took place in the Smokies, minor skirmishes were fairly common. Cherokee chief [[William Holland Thomas]] formed a Confederate legion made up mostly of Cherokee soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Thomas' Legion crossed the Smokies in 1862 and occupied Gatlinburg for several months to protect [[salt peter]] mines atop Mount Le Conte. Residents of predominantly Union Cades Cove and predominantly Confederate Hazel Creek routinely crossed the mountains to steal one another's livestock.<ref>Oliver, 44-45.</ref> Residents of Cosby and Cataloochee did likewise.  One notable Civil War incident in the Smokies was the murder of long-time Cades Cove resident [[Russell Gregory]] (for whom [[Gregory Bald]] is named), which was carried out by [[bushwhacker]]s in 1864 shortly after Gregory had led an ambush that routed a band of Confederates seeking to wreak havoc in the cove.<ref>Dunn, 135-136.</ref> Another incident was George Kirk's raid on Cataloochee, in which Kirk killed or wounded 15 Union soldiers recovering at a makeshift hospital.<ref>Davis, ''Cataloochee Valley'', 72.</ref>\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Champion-fibre-plant-canton-nc1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The Champion Fibre Company plant in [[Canton, North Carolina]], 1910]]\n\nWhile selective logging occurred in the Great Smoky Mountains throughout the 19th century, the general inaccessibility of the range's forests prevented major logging operations, and lumber firms relied on the lowland forests in the northeastern United States and the [[Mississippi Delta]] in the southeast.  As timber resources in these regions became exhausted, and as the demand for lumber skyrocketed after the Civil War, entrepreneurs began looking for ways to reach the virgin forests of Southern Appalachia.  The first logging operations in the Smokies, which began in the 1880s, used [[splash dam]]s or [[log boom|boom]]s to float logs down rivers to lumber mills in nearby cities.  Notable splash dam and boom operations included the [[English Lumber Company]] on Little River, the Taylor and Crate operations along Hazel Creek, and the ambitious operations of [[Alexander Arthur]] on the Pigeon River.  All three of these operations failed within their first few years, however, after their dams and boom systems were destroyed by floods.<ref>Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 167-174.</ref><ref>Vic Weals, ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville: Olden Press, 1993), 1-3.</ref><ref>Oliver, 55-56.</ref>\n\nInnovations in logging railroads and band saw technology in the late 19th century made large-scale logging possible in the mountainous areas of Southern Appalachia.  The largest logging operation in the Smokies was the [[Little River Lumber Company]], which logged the Little River watershed between 1901 and 1939.  The company also established company towns at Townsend (named for the company's chief owner and manager, [[Wilson Townsend|Wilson B. Townsend]]), [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]], and [[Tremont, Tennessee|Tremont]].<ref>Weals, 24-28.</ref>  \n\nThe second-largest operation was the Ritter Lumber Company, which logged the Hazel Creek watershed between 1907 and 1928.  Ruins of Ritter's lumbering operations are still visible along the Hazel Creek Trail.<ref>Oliver, 58-64.</ref> Other lumbering operations included [[Three M Lumber]] and [[Champion Fibre]], both of which logged the Oconaluftee watershed.<ref>Michal Strutin, ''History Hikes of the Smokies'' (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 125, 325.</ref>  By the time all operations ceased in the 1930s, logging firms had removed two-thirds of the virgin forests of the Smokies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===The National Park===\n{{main|Great Smoky Mountains National Park}}\n\nWilson B. Townsend, the head of Little River Lumber, began advertising [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]] as a tourist destination in 1909.  Within a few years, the [[Wonderland Hotel]] and the [[Appalachian Club]] had been established to cater to elite Knoxvillians seeking summer mountain getaways.<ref>Weals, 27.</ref> In the early 1920s, several Appalachian Club members, among them Knoxville businessman Colonel [[David C. Chapman|David Chapman]], began seriously considering a movement to establish a national park in the Great Smokies.  As head of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, Chapman was largely responsible for raising funds for land purchases and coordinating park efforts between local, state, and federal entities.<ref>Campbell, 13-18, 32.</ref>\n\nThe creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved much more complex than the creation of its predecessors, such as [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] and [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], which were already federally owned.  Along with convincing logging firms to sell lucrative lumber rights, the Park Commission had to negotiate the purchase of thousands of small farms and remove entire communities.  The commission also had to deal with the Tennessee and North Carolina legislatures, which at times were opposed to spending taxpayer money on park efforts.<ref>Daniel Pierce, ''The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 111-120.</ref>  In spite of these difficulties, the Park Commission had completed most major land purchases by 1932.  The national park officially opened in 1934, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] presiding over the opening ceremony at [[Newfound Gap]].\n\n==Culture and tourism==\n[[File:SmokyMountainFallLeaves.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in autumn]]\n\nThe [[culture]] of the area is that of [[Appalachia|Southern Appalachia]], and previously the [[Cherokee]] people.

The range is sometimes called the '''Smoky Mountains''' and the name is commonly shortened to the '''Smokies'''.  The Great Smokies are best known as the home of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], which protects most of the range.

The northwestern half of the range gives way to a series of elongate ridges known as the \"Foothills,\" the outermost of which include [[Chilhowee Mountain]] and [[English Mountain]].  The range is roughly bounded on the south by the [[Tuckasegee River]] and to the southeast by Soco Creek and Jonathan Creek.  The Great Smokies comprise parts of [[Blount County, Tennessee|Blount County]], [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]], and [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]] in Tennessee and [[Swain County, North Carolina|Swain County]] and [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood County]] in North Carolina.\n\nThe sources of several rivers are located in the Smokies, including the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]], the [[Oconaluftee River]], and [[Little River (Tennessee)|Little River]].  Streams in the Smokies are part of the [[Tennessee River]] watershed and are thus entirely west of the [[Eastern Continental Divide]].  The largest stream wholly within the park is [[Abrams Creek (Tennessee)|Abrams Creek]], which rises in Cades Cove and empties into the Chilhowee Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River near [[Chilhowee Dam]].  \n\nOther major streams include Hazel Creek and Eagle Creek in the southwest, Raven Fork near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]], Cosby Creek near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and [[Roaring Fork (Great Smoky Mountains)|Roaring Fork]] near [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]].  The Little Tennessee River passes through five impoundments along the range's southwestern boundary, namely [[Tellico Lake]], [[Chilhowee Dam|Chilhowee Lake]], [[Calderwood Dam|Calderwood Lake]], [[Cheoah Dam|Cheoah Lake]], and [[Fontana Lake]].\n\n===Notable peaks===\nThe highest point in the Smokies is [[Clingmans Dome]], which rises to an elevation of {{convert|6643|ft|m}}.  The mountain is the highest in Tennessee and the third highest in the Appalachian range.  Clingmans Dome also has the range's highest [[topographical prominence]] at {{convert|4503|ft|m}}.  [[Mount Le Conte (Tennessee)|Mount Le Conte]] is the ''tallest'' (i.e., from immediate base to summit) mountain in the range, rising {{convert|5301|ft|m}} from its base in Gatlinburg to its {{convert|6593|ft|m|sing=on}} summit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

The Ocoee Supergroup consists primarily of slightly metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate.  Early Precambrian rocks, which include the oldest rocks in the Smokies, comprise the dominant rock type in the Raven Fork Valley (near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]]) and lower Tuckasegee River between [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] and [[Bryson City, North Carolina|Bryson City]].  They consist primarily of metamorphic [[gneiss]], [[granite]], and [[schist]].  Cambrian sedimentary rocks are found among the outer reaches of the Foothills to the northwest and in limestone coves such as [[Cades Cove]].<ref>Harry Moore, ''A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32.</ref>\n\nThe Precambrian gneiss and schists\u2014the oldest rocks in the Smokies\u2014formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock in a primordial ocean.  In the Late Precambrian period, this ocean expanded, and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from accumulations of the eroding land mass onto the ocean's continental shelf.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\">Houk, 10\u201317.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[Paleozoic]] era, the ancient ocean had deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rocks such as limestone.  During the Ordovician period, the North American and African plates collided, destroying the ancient ocean and initiating the [[Alleghenian orogeny]]\u2014the mountain-building epoch that created the Appalachian range.  The Mesozoic era saw the rapid erosion of the softer sedimentary rocks from the new mountains, re-exposing the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\" />\n\nAround 20,000 years ago, subarctic glaciers advanced southward across North America, and although they never reached the Smokies, the advancing glaciers led to colder mean annual temperatures and an increase in precipitation throughout the range.  Trees were unable to survive at the higher elevations, and were replaced by [[tundra]] vegetation.  Spruce-fir forests occupied the valleys and slopes below approximately {{convert|4950|ft|m}}.  The persistent freezing and thawing during this period created the large blockfields that are often found at the base of large mountain slopes.<ref name=\"moore_40-44\">Moore, 40-44.</ref> \n\nBetween 16,500 and 12,500 years ago, the glaciers to the north retreated and mean annual temperatures rose.  The tundra vegetation disappeared, and the spruce-fir forests retreated to the highest elevations.  Hardwood trees moved into the region from the coastal plains, replacing the spruce-fir forests in the lower elevations.  The temperatures continued warming until around 6,000 years ago, when they began to gradually grow cooler.<ref name=\"moore_40-44\" />\n\n==Flora==\n{{see also|Appalachian temperate rainforest}}\n\nHeavy logging in the late 19th century and early 20th century devastated much of the forests of the Smokies, but the National Park Service estimates {{convert|187000|acre|km2}} of old growth forest remains,<ref name=\"OldGrowthEastNC\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/nc.pdf \n |title=Old Growth in the East: A Survey.

[[Tilia heterophylla|White basswood]] (''Tilia heterophylla''), [[Acer spicatum|mountain maple]] (''Acer spicatum'') and [[Acer pensylvanicum|striped maple]] (''Acer pensylvanicum''), and [[Aesculus flava|yellow buckeye]] (''Aesculus flava'') are also present.  The northern hardwood understory is home to diverse species such as coneflower, skunk goldenrod, [[Rugelia nudicaulis|Rugels ragwort]], [[bloodroot]], hydrangea, and several species of grasses and ferns.<ref>28-29.</ref>\n\nOne unique community in the northern hardwoods of the Smokies is the beech gap, or beech orchard.  Beech gaps consist of high mountain gaps that have been monopolized by beech trees.  The beech trees are often twisted and contorted by the high winds that occur in these gaps.  Why other tree types such as the red spruce fail to encroach into the beech gaps is unknown.<ref>Houk, 30.</ref>\n\n===Spruce-fir forest===\n[[File:Clingmans Dome-27527-1.jpg|thumb|[[Spruce fir]] stand near the summit of Clingmans Dome]]\n\nThe spruce-fir forest\u2014also called the \"boreal\" or \"Canadian\" forest\u2014is a relict of the [[ice ages]], when mean annual temperatures in the Smokies were too cold to support a hardwood forest.  While the rise in temperatures between 12,500 and 6,000 years ago allowed the hardwoods to return, the spruce-fir forest has managed to survive on the harsh mountain tops, typically above {{convert|5500|ft|m}}.  About {{convert|10600|acre|km2}} of the spruce-fir forest are old-growth.<ref name = \"OldGrowthEastNC\"/>\n\nThe spruce-fir forest consists primarily of two [[conifer]] species\u2014[[Picea rubens|red spruce]] (''Picea rubens'') and [[Abies fraseri|Fraser fir]] (''Abies fraseri'').   The Fraser Firs, which are native to Southern Appalachia, once dominated elevations above {{convert|6200|ft|m}} in the Great Smokies.  Most of these firs were killed, however, by an infestation of the [[balsam wooly adelgid]], which arrived in the Smokies in the early 1960s.  Thus, red spruce is now the dominant species in the range's spruce-fir forest.  Large stands of dead Fraser Firs remain atop Clingmans Dome and on the northwestern slopes of Old Black.  While much of the red spruce stands in the Smokies were logged during [[World War I]], the tree is still common throughout the range above {{convert|5500|ft|m}}.  Some of the red spruce trees in the Smokies are believed to be 300 years old, and the tallest rise to over {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>Houk, 50-53.</ref>\n\nThe main difference between the spruce-fir forests of Southern Appalachia and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former.  The spruce-fir understories of the Smokies are home to [[Rhododendron catawbiense|catawba rhododendron]], [[Sorbus americana|mountain ash]], [[Prunus pensylvanica|pin cherry]], thornless blackberry, and [[Viburnum lantanoides|hobblebush]].  The herbaceous and litter layers of the spruce-fir forests are poorly lit year-round, and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as ferns, namely [[Dryopteris campyloptera|mountain wood fern]] and [[Athyrium filix-femina|northern lady fern]], and over 280 species of mosses.<ref>Houk, 50, 54-55.</ref>\n\n===Wildflowers===\n{{Main|Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains}}\n\n[[File:Ben-parton-mtn-laurel-tn1.jpg|thumb|[[Rhododendron]] atop the Ben Parton Lookout]]\n\nMany [[wildflower]]s grow in mountains and valleys of the Great Smokies, including [[bee balm]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[Dutchman's breeches]], various [[trillium]]s, the Dragon's Advocate and even hardy [[orchid]]s.  There are two native species of rhododendron in the area.  The [[Catawba rhododendron]] has purple flowers in May and June, while the [[rhododendron|rosebay rhododendron]] has longer leaves and blooms white or a light pink in June and July.  \n\nThe orange- to sometimes red-flowered and deciduous [[Rhododendron calendulaceum|flame azalea]] closely follows along with the Catawbas.  The closely related [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] blooms in between the two, and all of the blooms progress from lower to higher elevations.  The reverse is true in [[autumn]], when nearly bare mountaintops covered in [[Rime (frost)|rime ice]] (frozen fog) can be separated from green [[valley]]s by very bright and varied leaf colors.  The rhododendrons are [[Broadleaf tree|broadleaf]]s, whose leaves droop in order to shed wet and heavy [[snow]]s that come through the region during winter.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Bear-great-smoky-mtns-nps1.jpg|thumb|A black bear in the Great Smokies]]\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains are home to 66 species of mammals, over 240 species of birds, 43 species of amphibians, 60 species of fish, and 40 species of reptiles.

The Smokies, along with the Unicois, provided the main bulwark dividing the [[Overhill Cherokee]] villages in modern Tennessee from the Cherokee Middle towns in modern North Carolina.  The Overhill town of [[Chilhowee (Cherokee town)|Chilhowee]] was situated at the confluence of Abrams Creek and the Little Tennessee, and the Overhill town of [[Tallassee (Cherokee town)|Tallassee]] was located just a few miles upstream near modern [[Calderwood, Tennessee|Calderwood]] (both village sites are now under Chilhowee Lake).  A string of Overhill villages, including [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]] and [[Tanasi]], dotted the Little Tennessee valley north of Chilhowee.<ref>Gerald Schroedl, \"[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1026 Overhill Cherokees].\"  ''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2002.

The village of Oconaluftee, which was situated along the [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]] River near the modern Oconaluftee Visitor Center, was the only known permanent Cherokee village located within the national park's boundaries.

The green areas denote the modern national park.]]\n\nEuropean explorers and settlers began arriving in Western North Carolina and East Tennessee in the mid-18th century.  The influx of settlers at the end of the [[French and Indian War]] brought conflict with the Cherokee, who still held legal title to much of the land.  When the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] in 1776, American forces launched an invasion of Cherokee territory.<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\">Vicki Rozema, ''Footsteps of the Cherokees'' (Winston-Salem: John F. Blair Publisher, 1995), 58\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe Middle towns, including Kittuwa, were burned by General [[Griffith Rutherford]], and several of the Overhill towns were burned by [[John Sevier]].  By 1805, the Cherokee had ceded control of the Great Smokies to the U.S. government.  Although much of the tribe was forced west along the [[Trail of Tears]] in 1838, a few\u2014largely through the efforts of [[William Holland Thomas]]\u2014managed to retain their land on the [[Qualla Boundary]] and today comprise the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\" />\n\nIn the 1780s, several frontier outposts had been established along the outskirts of the Smokies, namely Whitson's Fort in what is now [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]] and Wear's Fort in what is now [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]].  Permanent settlers began arriving in these areas in the 1790s.  In 1801, the Whaley brothers, [[William Whaley|William]] and John, moved from North Carolina to become the first settlers in what is now the [[Greenbrier (Great Smoky Mountains)|Greenbrier]] section of the park.<ref>Carson Brewer, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Portland, Ore.: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 18.</ref>  \n\nIn 1802, [[Edgefield, South Carolina]] resident William Ogle (1751\u20131803) arrived in [[White Oak Flats]] where he cut and prepared logs for cabin construction.  Although Ogle died shortly after returning to Edgefield, his wife, [[Martha Jane Huskey]], eventually returned with her family and several other families to White Oak Flats, becoming the first permanent settlers in what would eventually become [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]].  Their children and grandchildren spread out southward into the [[Sugarlands]] and [[Roaring Fork (Great Smoky Mountains)|Roaring Fork]] areas.<ref>Brewer, 18.</ref>  \n\nCades Cove was settled largely by families who had purchased lots from land speculator William \"Fighting Billy\" Tipton.

The average farm consisted of roughly {{convert|50|acre|km2}}, part of which was cultivated and part of which was woodland. Early settlers lived in {{convert|16|ft|m}} x {{convert|20|ft|m}} log cabins, although these were replaced by more elaborate log houses and eventually, as lumber became available, by modern frame houses. Most farms included at least one barn, a [[springhouse]] (used for refrigeration), a [[smokehouse]] (used for curing meat), a [[chicken coop]] (protected chickens from predators), and a [[corn crib]] (kept corn dry and protected it from rodents). Some of the more industrious farmers operated [[gristmill]]s, [[general store]]<nowiki/>s, and [[sorghum]] presses.<ref>Jerry Wear, ''Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County'' (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 5\u20136.</ref> Religion was a central theme in the lives of the early residents of the Smokies, and community life was typically centered on churches. Christian [[Protestantism]]\u2014especially [[Primitive Baptists]], [[Missionary Baptists]], [[Methodists]], and [[Presbyterians]]; dominated the religious culture of the region.\n\n===American Civil War===\nWhile both Tennessee and North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sentiment in the Great Smoky Mountains was much stronger relative to other regions in these two states.  Generally, the communities on the Tennessee side of the Smokies supported the Union, while communities on the North Carolina side supported the Confederates.  On the Tennessee side, 74% of Cocke Countians, 80% of Blount Countians, and 96% of Sevier Countians voted against secession.<ref>Eric Lacy, ''Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 217-233.</ref>  In the North Carolina Smokies\u2014[[Cherokee County, North Carolina|Cherokee]], [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood]], [[Jackson County, North Carolina|Jackson]], and [[Macon County, North Carolina|Macon]] counties\u2014about 46% of the population favored secession.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/historyculture/civil-war-1.htm Civil War Journal: Divided Loyalties], Great Smoky Mountains National Park website. Retrieved: 23 June 2015.</ref>\n\nWhile no major engagements took place in the Smokies, minor skirmishes were fairly common. Cherokee chief [[William Holland Thomas]] formed a Confederate legion made up mostly of Cherokee soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Thomas' Legion crossed the Smokies in 1862 and occupied Gatlinburg for several months to protect [[salt peter]] mines atop Mount Le Conte. Residents of predominantly Union Cades Cove and predominantly Confederate Hazel Creek routinely crossed the mountains to steal one another's livestock.<ref>Oliver, 44-45.</ref> Residents of Cosby and Cataloochee did likewise.  One notable Civil War incident in the Smokies was the murder of long-time Cades Cove resident [[Russell Gregory]] (for whom [[Gregory Bald]] is named), which was carried out by [[bushwhacker]]s in 1864 shortly after Gregory had led an ambush that routed a band of Confederates seeking to wreak havoc in the cove.<ref>Dunn, 135-136.</ref> Another incident was George Kirk's raid on Cataloochee, in which Kirk killed or wounded 15 Union soldiers recovering at a makeshift hospital.<ref>Davis, ''Cataloochee Valley'', 72.</ref>\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Champion-fibre-plant-canton-nc1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The Champion Fibre Company plant in [[Canton, North Carolina]], 1910]]\n\nWhile selective logging occurred in the Great Smoky Mountains throughout the 19th century, the general inaccessibility of the range's forests prevented major logging operations, and lumber firms relied on the lowland forests in the northeastern United States and the [[Mississippi Delta]] in the southeast.  As timber resources in these regions became exhausted, and as the demand for lumber skyrocketed after the Civil War, entrepreneurs began looking for ways to reach the virgin forests of Southern Appalachia.  The first logging operations in the Smokies, which began in the 1880s, used [[splash dam]]s or [[log boom|boom]]s to float logs down rivers to lumber mills in nearby cities.  Notable splash dam and boom operations included the [[English Lumber Company]] on Little River, the Taylor and Crate operations along Hazel Creek, and the ambitious operations of [[Alexander Arthur]] on the Pigeon River.  All three of these operations failed within their first few years, however, after their dams and boom systems were destroyed by floods.<ref>Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 167-174.</ref><ref>Vic Weals, ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville: Olden Press, 1993), 1-3.</ref><ref>Oliver, 55-56.</ref>\n\nInnovations in logging railroads and band saw technology in the late 19th century made large-scale logging possible in the mountainous areas of Southern Appalachia.  The largest logging operation in the Smokies was the [[Little River Lumber Company]], which logged the Little River watershed between 1901 and 1939.  The company also established company towns at Townsend (named for the company's chief owner and manager, [[Wilson Townsend|Wilson B. Townsend]]), [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]], and [[Tremont, Tennessee|Tremont]].<ref>Weals, 24-28.</ref>  \n\nThe second-largest operation was the Ritter Lumber Company, which logged the Hazel Creek watershed between 1907 and 1928.  Ruins of Ritter's lumbering operations are still visible along the Hazel Creek Trail.<ref>Oliver, 58-64.</ref> Other lumbering operations included [[Three M Lumber]] and [[Champion Fibre]], both of which logged the Oconaluftee watershed.<ref>Michal Strutin, ''History Hikes of the Smokies'' (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 125, 325.</ref>  By the time all operations ceased in the 1930s, logging firms had removed two-thirds of the virgin forests of the Smokies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===The National Park===\n{{main|Great Smoky Mountains National Park}}\n\nWilson B. Townsend, the head of Little River Lumber, began advertising [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]] as a tourist destination in 1909.  Within a few years, the [[Wonderland Hotel]] and the [[Appalachian Club]] had been established to cater to elite Knoxvillians seeking summer mountain getaways.<ref>Weals, 27.</ref> In the early 1920s, several Appalachian Club members, among them Knoxville businessman Colonel [[David C. Chapman|David Chapman]], began seriously considering a movement to establish a national park in the Great Smokies.  As head of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, Chapman was largely responsible for raising funds for land purchases and coordinating park efforts between local, state, and federal entities.<ref>Campbell, 13-18, 32.</ref>\n\nThe creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved much more complex than the creation of its predecessors, such as [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] and [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], which were already federally owned.  Along with convincing logging firms to sell lucrative lumber rights, the Park Commission had to negotiate the purchase of thousands of small farms and remove entire communities.  The commission also had to deal with the Tennessee and North Carolina legislatures, which at times were opposed to spending taxpayer money on park efforts.<ref>Daniel Pierce, ''The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 111-120.</ref>  In spite of these difficulties, the Park Commission had completed most major land purchases by 1932.  The national park officially opened in 1934, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] presiding over the opening ceremony at [[Newfound Gap]].\n\n==Culture and tourism==\n[[File:SmokyMountainFallLeaves.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in autumn]]\n\nThe [[culture]] of the area is that of [[Appalachia|Southern Appalachia]], and previously the [[Cherokee]] people.

Throughout the [[Single-player video game|single-player mode]], players control [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]], a former detective. Nine years after the events of the second game, Max becomes employed as a private security contractor in [[Brazil]], but becomes entangled in a quest filled with death and betrayal. An [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay in re-creations of multiple single-player settings.\n\nAs part of their research for the game's setting, the developers conducted field research around [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. At release, ''Max Payne 3'' received highly positive reactions from critics, with praise particularly directed at its narrative, atmosphere, attention to detail and action, though some criticism was aimed at the change in style from its predecessors, its linear design, and depiction of S\u00e3o Paulo. ''Max Payne 3'' achieved high sales, shipping approximately three million units in the first week of release. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications, winning a variety of them.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Max Payne 3 screenshot.png|thumb|left|Players may take cover behind objects during firefights, using it as a tactical advantage and to avoid taking damage from enemies.

Should players take damage, [[Analgesic|painkillers]] can be used to regenerate health. Players use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies.

When this feature is utilized, it does deplete all of the players remaining \"bullet time\". Also new to the series is that after using the shoot-dodge mechanic, which enables players to dodge enemies by diving, players may shoot at any angle while remaining grounded.<ref name=Destructoid_review/>\n\nUnlike the previous games in the series, the player character can only hold three weapons at a time. There are two slots for pistols and one for a two-handed weapon. If the player chooses to equip both pistols at the same time, the two-handed weapon must be dropped.

When a street gang kidnaps Rodrigo's wife, Fabiana, Max is pulled into a conspiracy of shadowy, warring factions threading every aspect of S\u00e3o Paulo society in a deadly web that threatens to engulf everyone and everything around him.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|Max Payne (series)#Characters}}\nNine years after the events of the [[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|second game]], [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]] ([[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]) has retired from the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] and spends his days nursing his alcoholism and addiction to painkillers. After an incident in a bar in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] forces him to leave New York, Max takes up an offer from Raul Passos ([[Juli\u00e1n Rebolledo|Julian Dean]]), whom he met during the incident, to become a [[private security contractor]] in South America. Max finds himself working for the Branco family, whose members include: Rodrigo Branco (Frank Rodriguez), a wealthy real-estate mogul; Fabiana Branco ([[Benedita Pereira]]), Rodrigo's [[trophy wife]]; Giovanna (Shirley Rumierk), Fabiana's sister;  Victor Branco ([[Robert Montano]]), a local politician; and Marcelo Branco (Dillon Porter), a hard-partying socialite. Operating in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] a few months later, Max thwarts a kidnapping attempt on the Brancos by the Comando Sombra, a [[favela]] street gang, during a private party. A week later, the gang manage to kidnap Fabiana at nightclub while Max is overseeing her protection alongside Marcelo and Giovanna.\n\nInstructed to pay $3 million for her release, Rodrigo allows Max and Passos to handle the exchange at a local football stadium. However, the meeting between them and Comando Sombra is ambushed by the Crach\u00e1 Preto, an outlaw paramilitary unit, who steal the money. Although the pair learn where Comando Sombra took Fabiana, their attempt to rescue her is thwarted by the gang's leader Serrano ([[Babs Olusanmokun]]). Meeting with the Branco men at Rodrigo's office, alongside Armando Becker (Ubirajara de Castro), head of [[SWAT|special police unit]] Unidade de For\u00e7as Especiais (UFE), Victor recommends the police handle Fabiana's recovery. Shortly after Victor, Becker, Marcelo and Passos leave, Crach\u00e1 Preto attack the office in order to kill Max. While he survives, Rodrigo is assassinated in the chaos. Blaming himself for the situation, Max swears off alcohol, shaves his head, and proceeds to seek out Serrano and Fabianna within the Nova Esperan\u00e7a [[favela]], based on information from a dying Crach\u00e1 Preto operative.\n\nDuring his search of the [[favela]], Max runs into Detective Wilson Da Silva (Stephen Girasuolo), who offers assistance in exchange for help in investigating Crach\u00e1 Preto, who he suspects have ties to Victor and the UFE. Max eventually reaches Serrano's hideout, only to witness Comando Sombra murder Fabiana. As the UFE raid the fevala, Max finds himself forced to rescue Marcelo and Giovanna, whom he encountered in the hideout before they were taken away. During his search for the pair, he finds the UFE to be corrupt upon witnessing them selling prisoners to Crach\u00e1 Preto. Moments after the exchange, Max finds Marcelo being executed by the paramilitaries, forcing him to rescue Giovanna. After a shootout at a bus station while trying to hide from Crach\u00e1 Preto, Passos arrives to help, but flees with Giovanna, who is pregnant with his child. Angered at being abandoned, Max is picked up by Da Silva, and learns that Passos works for Victor.\n\nQuestioned about an attack on Marcelo's [[Luxury yacht|private yacht]] in the [[Panama Canal]] a few weeks earlier, Max recalls that Marcelo and Passos tried to drive away with cargo that the attackers sought to steal. Da Silva reveals the cargo was money that Victor needed laundered in Panama, and that Max was recruited to be the [[fall guy]] for his illegal activities. Asked by Da Silva to investigate a rundown hotel used by Crach\u00e1 Preto, Max agrees. He soon discovers it to be the base for a black market [[Organ trade|organ theft ring]] that the UFE supplied with their prisoners, and decides to destroy it. After releasing a number of detainees, including Serrano \u2013 captured in the UFE raid \u2013 Max uses the paramilitaries' supply of explosives to rig the building for demolition. Before the paramilitaries' leader can kill him, Passos arrives to rescue him before the hotel is demolished. Although angered at Passos' involvement in Victor's affairs, Max forgives him for coming back for him, and allows him to leave the city with Giovanna.\n\nTo expose the involvement of Victor, Becker and the UFE with the organ thefts, Da Silva persuades Max to get arrested at the UFE's headquarters in order to search it for incriminating evidence. His search culminates in him learning that Victor arranged for Rodrigo's murder to acquire his wealth, and that the sales of stolen organs were to fund his campaign in the upcoming mayoral elections. After a confrontation with Victor and Becker leads to them escaping, Max pursues them to the airport, leading to an intense fight with the UFE. Max eventually catches up to both, mortally maiming Becker in a shootout, before being aided by Da Silva in disabling Victor's private jet. While Max leaves him to be arrested by Da Silva and regular police units, he opts to break Victor's leg to make him suffer. A week later in [[Bahia]], Max overhears news in a bar that the UFE was disbanded, while Victor died in prison. Choosing to move on with his life, Max takes a walk along the beach as the sun sets.\n\n==Development==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=We've been blessed with being able to actually see the game and give some feedback.

published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It was released on May 15, 2012 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]; a [[Microsoft Windows]] port was released on May 29, 2012, followed by an [[OS X]] port on June 20, 2013.<ref name=\"Mac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/50701/max-payne-3-now-available-for-mac.html |title=Max Payne 3 Now Available for Mac |author=R* Q |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=June 21, 2013 |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> The game is the third entry in the [[Max Payne (series)|''Max Payne'' series]] and the sequel to ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne]]'', developed by [[Remedy Entertainment]].\n\nThe game is played from a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Throughout the [[Single-player video game|single-player mode]], players control [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]], a former detective. Nine years after the events of the second game, Max becomes employed as a private security contractor in [[Brazil]], but becomes entangled in a quest filled with death and betrayal. An [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay in re-creations of multiple single-player settings.\n\nAs part of their research for the game's setting, the developers conducted field research around [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. At release, ''Max Payne 3'' received highly positive reactions from critics, with praise particularly directed at its narrative, atmosphere, attention to detail and action, though some criticism was aimed at the change in style from its predecessors, its linear design, and depiction of S\u00e3o Paulo. ''Max Payne 3'' achieved high sales, shipping approximately three million units in the first week of release. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications, winning a variety of them.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Max Payne 3 screenshot.png|thumb|left|Players may take cover behind objects during firefights, using it as a tactical advantage and to avoid taking damage from enemies. This feature was not present in earlier games in the series.|alt=The player character positioned in cover behind a pillar, inside a building, while enemies hunt him down.]]\n''Max Payne 3'' is a [[third-person shooter]] in which the player assumes the role of its titular character, [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]]. A new feature to the series, introduced in ''Max Payne 3'', is the [[cover system]], which allows players to gain a [[Positional advantage|tactical advantage]], and avoid taking damage from enemies.<ref name=Destructoid_review>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-max-payne-3-227387.phtml |title=Review: Max Payne 3 |website=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref> To progress through the linear story, players take on enemies throughout levels.

Should players take damage, [[Analgesic|painkillers]] can be used to regenerate health. Players use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. In action sequences, [[bullet time]] can be used; using this feature, it is possible to see every bullet strike an enemy in detail.<ref name=EGMP3>{{cite web|last=Purchese |first=Robert |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-24-rockstar-adds-cover-zoom-aiming-to-max-payne-3 |title=Rockstar adds cover, zoom-aiming to Max Payne 3 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=November 24, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2011 }}</ref> The game also introduces a \"Last Stand\" mechanic, granting players a grace period when health is fully depleted that allows the player to kill the enemy that last wounded them in order to remain alive, so long as the player has at least one recovery item. When this feature is utilized, it does deplete all of the players remaining \"bullet time\". Also new to the series is that after using the shoot-dodge mechanic, which enables players to dodge enemies by diving, players may shoot at any angle while remaining grounded.<ref name=Destructoid_review/>\n\nUnlike the previous games in the series, the player character can only hold three weapons at a time. There are two slots for pistols and one for a two-handed weapon. If the player chooses to equip both pistols at the same time, the two-handed weapon must be dropped. Otherwise, the player character holds the two-handed weapon under their arm.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nThe online multiplayer mode features maps and modes that dynamically change within a match.<ref name=hashtag>{{cite web |last=Langshaw |first=Mark |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a356529/max-payne-3-competition-winners-to-appear-in-game.html |title='Max Payne 3' competition winners to appear in game - Gaming News |website=[[Digital Spy]] |date=December 18, 2011 |accessdate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref> Up to 16 players engage in [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] or competitive gameplay in re-creations of multiple single-player settings.

When a street gang kidnaps Rodrigo's wife, Fabiana, Max is pulled into a conspiracy of shadowy, warring factions threading every aspect of S\u00e3o Paulo society in a deadly web that threatens to engulf everyone and everything around him.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|Max Payne (series)#Characters}}\nNine years after the events of the [[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|second game]], [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]] ([[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]) has retired from the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] and spends his days nursing his alcoholism and addiction to painkillers. After an incident in a bar in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] forces him to leave New York, Max takes up an offer from Raul Passos ([[Juli\u00e1n Rebolledo|Julian Dean]]), whom he met during the incident, to become a [[private security contractor]] in South America. Max finds himself working for the Branco family, whose members include: Rodrigo Branco (Frank Rodriguez), a wealthy real-estate mogul; Fabiana Branco ([[Benedita Pereira]]), Rodrigo's [[trophy wife]]; Giovanna (Shirley Rumierk), Fabiana's sister;  Victor Branco ([[Robert Montano]]), a local politician; and Marcelo Branco (Dillon Porter), a hard-partying socialite. Operating in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] a few months later, Max thwarts a kidnapping attempt on the Brancos by the Comando Sombra, a [[favela]] street gang, during a private party. A week later, the gang manage to kidnap Fabiana at nightclub while Max is overseeing her protection alongside Marcelo and Giovanna.\n\nInstructed to pay $3 million for her release, Rodrigo allows Max and Passos to handle the exchange at a local football stadium. However, the meeting between them and Comando Sombra is ambushed by the Crach\u00e1 Preto, an outlaw paramilitary unit, who steal the money. Although the pair learn where Comando Sombra took Fabiana, their attempt to rescue her is thwarted by the gang's leader Serrano ([[Babs Olusanmokun]]). Meeting with the Branco men at Rodrigo's office, alongside Armando Becker (Ubirajara de Castro), head of [[SWAT|special police unit]] Unidade de For\u00e7as Especiais (UFE), Victor recommends the police handle Fabiana's recovery. Shortly after Victor, Becker, Marcelo and Passos leave, Crach\u00e1 Preto attack the office in order to kill Max. While he survives, Rodrigo is assassinated in the chaos. Blaming himself for the situation, Max swears off alcohol, shaves his head, and proceeds to seek out Serrano and Fabianna within the Nova Esperan\u00e7a [[favela]], based on information from a dying Crach\u00e1 Preto operative.\n\nDuring his search of the [[favela]], Max runs into Detective Wilson Da Silva (Stephen Girasuolo), who offers assistance in exchange for help in investigating Crach\u00e1 Preto, who he suspects have ties to Victor and the UFE. Max eventually reaches Serrano's hideout, only to witness Comando Sombra murder Fabiana. As the UFE raid the fevala, Max finds himself forced to rescue Marcelo and Giovanna, whom he encountered in the hideout before they were taken away. During his search for the pair, he finds the UFE to be corrupt upon witnessing them selling prisoners to Crach\u00e1 Preto. Moments after the exchange, Max finds Marcelo being executed by the paramilitaries, forcing him to rescue Giovanna. After a shootout at a bus station while trying to hide from Crach\u00e1 Preto, Passos arrives to help, but flees with Giovanna, who is pregnant with his child. Angered at being abandoned, Max is picked up by Da Silva, and learns that Passos works for Victor.\n\nQuestioned about an attack on Marcelo's [[Luxury yacht|private yacht]] in the [[Panama Canal]] a few weeks earlier, Max recalls that Marcelo and Passos tried to drive away with cargo that the attackers sought to steal. Da Silva reveals the cargo was money that Victor needed laundered in Panama, and that Max was recruited to be the [[fall guy]] for his illegal activities. Asked by Da Silva to investigate a rundown hotel used by Crach\u00e1 Preto, Max agrees. He soon discovers it to be the base for a black market [[Organ trade|organ theft ring]] that the UFE supplied with their prisoners, and decides to destroy it. After releasing a number of detainees, including Serrano \u2013 captured in the UFE raid \u2013 Max uses the paramilitaries' supply of explosives to rig the building for demolition. Before the paramilitaries' leader can kill him, Passos arrives to rescue him before the hotel is demolished. Although angered at Passos' involvement in Victor's affairs, Max forgives him for coming back for him, and allows him to leave the city with Giovanna.\n\nTo expose the involvement of Victor, Becker and the UFE with the organ thefts, Da Silva persuades Max to get arrested at the UFE's headquarters in order to search it for incriminating evidence. His search culminates in him learning that Victor arranged for Rodrigo's murder to acquire his wealth, and that the sales of stolen organs were to fund his campaign in the upcoming mayoral elections. After a confrontation with Victor and Becker leads to them escaping, Max pursues them to the airport, leading to an intense fight with the UFE. Max eventually catches up to both, mortally maiming Becker in a shootout, before being aided by Da Silva in disabling Victor's private jet. While Max leaves him to be arrested by Da Silva and regular police units, he opts to break Victor's leg to make him suffer. A week later in [[Bahia]], Max overhears news in a bar that the UFE was disbanded, while Victor died in prison. Choosing to move on with his life, Max takes a walk along the beach as the sun sets.\n\n==Development==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=We've been blessed with being able to actually see the game and give some feedback.
