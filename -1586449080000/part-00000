The competition causes many small grocers to go out of business. This makes the task of getting nutritious, whole ingredients much more difficult for citizens who live far away from large supermarket stores.<ref name=\"smithmorton\" />\n\nIn most cases, people who live in rural food deserts are more likely to lack a high school degree or GED, experience increased poverty rates, and have lower median family income. People who live in rural food deserts also tend to be older. This is due to an exodus of young people (ages 20\u201329) who were born in these areas and decided to leave once they are able. States with numerous rural food deserts have a lower overall level of income as a result. This creates a negative feedback loop. Areas caught in these loops often struggle to repair the damages done, and typically remain as isolated communities that consist of uneducated and poor citizens.<ref name=\"Rural\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ruralsociology.org/assets/docs/rural-realities/rural-realities-1-4.pdf|title=Rural Realities|last=Morton|first=Lois|date=2007|website=Rural Realities|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBased on the 2013 ''County Health Ratings'' data, residents who live in rural U.S. food deserts are more likely to have poorer health than those who live in urban food deserts. People who live in rural communities have significantly lower scores in the areas of health behavior, morbidity factors, clinical care, and the physical environment. Research attributes these discrepancies to a variety of factors including limitations in infrastructure, socioeconomic differences, insurance coverage deficiencies, and a higher rate of traffic fatalities and accidents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Timothy J.|last2=Saman|first2=Daniel M.|last3=Lipsky|first3=Martin S.|last4=Lutfiyya|first4=M.

Comparatively, only 29.8% of those polled lacked access to adequate protein. This lack of access to fruits and vegetables often results in vitamin deficiencies. This eventually causes health problems for those who live within these areas.<ref name=\"Rural\" /> When tasked with finding a solution to this problem, research has shown that it will take individual and community actions, as well as public policy improvements, to maintain and increase the capacity of rural grocery stores to provide nutritious, high quality, affordable foods while being profitable enough to stay in business.<ref name=\"Rural\" />\n\nAlthough personal factors do impact eating behavior for rural people, it is the physical and social environments that place constraints on food access, even in civically engaged communities. Food access may be improved in communities where civic engagement is strong, and where local organizations join in providing solutions to help decrease barriers of food access. Some ways communities can do this is by increasing access to the normal and food safety net systems and by creating informal alternatives.

It has taken time for researchers to understand Africa's urban food deserts because the conventional understanding of the term must be reevaluated to fit Africa's unconventional supermarkets.<ref name=\":13\" /> There are three categories for food deserts: ability-related, assets-related, and attitude-related.<ref name=\":13\" /> Ability-related food deserts are \u201canything that physically prevents access to food which a consumer otherwise has the financial resources to purchase and the mental desire to buy\u201d.<ref name=\":13\" /> An asset-related food desert involves the absence of financial assets, thus preventing consumption of desirable food that is otherwise available.<ref name=\":13\" /> Lastly there are attitude-related food deserts any state of mind that prevents the consumer from accessing foods they can otherwise physically bring into their home and have the necessary assets to procure.<ref name=\":13\" /> In Cape Town, South Africa  supermarkets take up a large portion of retail space.<ref name=\":13\" /> While supermarkets are expanding in poor neighborhoods in Cape Town, their food insecurity is growing at an alarming rate.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is one of the biggest road blocks when understanding food deserts. Based on the European or American understanding of food deserts the fact that there is access to supermarkets by definition would mean that Cape Town does not suffer from food deserts.<ref name=\":13\" /> Not only does Africa suffer from food deserts, but there is a direct link between climate change and the rapid growth of food deserts.<ref name=\":13\" /> While supermarkets are expanding to areas that once did not have supermarkets there is still a disparity when it comes to physical access.<ref name=\":13\" /> In the city of Cape Town asset-related urban food deserts are the main reason for the food insecurity.<ref name=\":13\" /> People in this area unable to afford the food that they would prefer to eat.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nClimate change plays an important role in urban food deserts because it directly affects accessibility. The main way that climate change affects food security and food deserts is that it reduces the production of food.<ref name=\":13\" /> With limited availability of a product the prices rise making it unavailable to those that cannot the rising prices.<ref name=\":13\" /> In Cape Town specifically supermarkets rely directly on fresh produce from the nearby farm area.<ref name=\":13\" /> Not only does climate change affect the production of food, but it can also damage capital assets that affect accessibility and utilization.<ref name=\":13\" /> Specifically in Cape Town the access to food deserts does not change the severity of food deserts.<ref name=\":13\" /> With limited diversity in their diets those that live in Cape Town are highly dependent on foods of low nutritional value and high calorific value.<ref name=\":13\" /> Utilizing the European or American definition of food deserts does not take into account the dynamic market of other cultures and countries.\n\n== Beyond physical access ==\nThe primary criterion for a food desert is its proximity to a healthy food market. When such a market is in reach for its residents, a food desert ceases to exist. But this does not mean that residents will now choose to eat healthy. A longitudinal study of food deserts in ''JAMA Internal Medicine'' shows that supermarket availability is generally unrelated to fruit and vegetable recommendations and overall diet quality.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The availability of unhealthy foods at supermarkets may affect this relationship because they tempt customers to purchase precooked foods which tend to contain more preservatives. Supermarkets may have such an adverse effect because they put independently owned grocery stores out of business. Independently owned grocery stores have the benefit of being made of the community so they can be more responsive to community needs.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, simply providing healthier food access, according to Janne Boone-Heinonen et al., cannot completely eliminate food deserts, this access must be paired with education.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Boone-Heinonen|first1=Janne|last2=Gordon-Larsen|first2=P|last3=Kiefe|first3=C.

Corner stores often only carry processed food, eliminating the choice of eating fresh. Processed food encompasses any type of food that has been modified from its original state whether from washing, cooking, or adding preservative or other additives.

Similarly, with meats that are dried, there is salt added to help in preservation but results in the meat has a higher sodium content.<ref name=\":132\" /> The ultra-processed foods were not made to be nutrient-rich, but rather to satisfy cravings with high amounts of salts or sugars, so they result in people eating more than they should of food that has no nutritional value.<ref name=\":15\" /> Processed foods may also be made rich with nutrients that many people are lacking in their diets, making up for the lack of fresh food.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nutrition.org/the-debate-over-the-health-effects-of-food-processing/|title=The Debate Over the Health Effects of Food Processing {{!}} American Society for Nutrition|date=2017-09-11|work=American Society for Nutrition|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> Some nutritionists may recommend eliminating processed foods from diets, while others see it as a way to reduce food scarcity and malnutrition.<ref name=\":132\" /> In 1990 the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act required nutrition labels on food, making it so people could see what and how much of something they were consuming.

Some studies show that moderating one's alcohol consumption can reduce one's chance of getting cardiovascular disease and even extend one's mental stability into old age.<ref name=\":142\" />\n\n== Implications for self care ==\n[[Self-care]] is an essential component in the management of chronic conditions and for those who are healthy. Self-care is greatly influenced by food choices and dietary intake.<ref name=\":142\" /> Limited access to nutritious foods in food deserts can greatly impact one's ability to engage in healthy practices. Access, affordability, and health literacy are all [[social determinants of health]], which are accentuated by living in a food desert.<ref name=\"Walker, R.E. 2010\" /> There are two main health implications for those living in food deserts: [[overnutrition]] or [[undernutrition]].<ref name=\":142\" /> The community may be undernourished, due to no access to food stores. The community may be over-nourished due to a lack of affordable supermarkets with whole foods and a higher concentration of convenience stores and fast-food restaurants that offer prepackaged foods often high in sugar, fat, and salt.<ref name=\":142\" /> [[Food security|Food-insecurity]] remains a problem for many low-income families, but the greatest challenge to living in a food desert is poor diet quality. Living in a food desert contributes to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases associated with being overweight.<ref name=\":142\" /> Persons living in a food desert often face barriers to self-care, particularly in accessing resources needed to change their dietary habits.\n\n=== Transportation and geography ===\nPeople tend to make food choices based on what is available in their neighborhood. In food deserts there is often a high density of [[Fast food restaurant|fast-food restaurants]] and corner stores that offer prepared and processed foods.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/>\n\nIn rural areas, [[food security]] is a major issue. Food security can imply either a complete lack of food, which contributes to [[Malnutrition|undernourishment]], or a lack of nutritious food, which contributes to over-nourishment.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/|title=USDA|website=www.usda.gov|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> community food security \"concerns the underlying social, economic, and institutional factors within a community that affect the quantity and quality of available food and its affordability or price relative to the sufficiency of financial resources available to acquire it.\"<ref name=\"ruralhealthinfo.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/food-and-hunger|title=Rural Hunger and Access to Healthy Food Introduction - Rural Health Information Hub|website=www.ruralhealthinfo.org|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> Rural areas tend have higher food insecurity than urban areas. This insecurity occurs because food choices in rural areas are often restricted because transportation is needed to access a major [[supermarket]] or a food supply that offers a wide, healthy variety of foods, versus smaller [[convenience store]]s that do not offer as much produce.<ref name=\"ruralhealthinfo.org\"/>\n\nIt is critical to look at car ownership in relation to the distance and number of stores in the area. Distance from shops influences the quality of food eaten.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/> A vehicle or access to [[public transport]]ation is often needed to go to a grocery store. When neither a car nor public transportation is available, diets are rarely healthy. This is because fast food and convenience stores are easier to access and do not cost much money or time. Further, those who walk to food shops typically have poorer diets, which has been attributed to having to carry shopping bags home.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/>\n\n=== Adherence ===\nLong-term adherence to a healthful, balanced [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is essential to promote the well-being of individuals and society. Many approaches to helping people eat a healthy, balanced diet are ineffective because of \"adherence problems\" with behavior changes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1559827613488867 |pmid=27547170 |pmc=4988401 |title=Long-Term Adherence to Health Behavior Change |journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=395\u2013404 |year=2013 |last1=Middleton |first1=Kathryn R |last2=Anton |first2=Stephen D |last3=Perri |first3=Michal G }}</ref> Dietary adherence is influenced by habits that develop over a lifetime.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIt is especially difficult to \"adhere\" to a prescribed diet and lifestyle (ex. [[Low sodium diet|low-salt diet]], [[low-fat diet]], [[Low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate diet]], low-sugar diet) when living in a food desert without enough access to items needed. When high-sugar, high-fat, and high-salt items are the only foods available to people living in a food desert, dietary adherence requires (a) shift in lifestyle/eating habits and (b) access to fresh, healthy, affordable foods.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Decision-making ===\nDecision-making is an important component of self-care that is affected by food deserts. People employ both rational and naturalistic decision-making processes on a routine basis. Naturalistic decisions occur in situations where time is limited, stakes are high, needed information is missing, the situation is ambiguous and the decision-maker is uncertain. Rational decisions are more likely when people have time to weigh options and consider the consequences.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08870440008400300 |title=Processes of patient decision making: Theoretical and methodological issues |journal=Psychology & Health |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=191\u2013204 |year=2000 |last1=Broadstock |first1=Marita |last2=Michie |first2=Susan }}</ref>\n\nThe way individuals living in a food desert make decisions about healthy eating is influenced by a variety of factors. Communities with higher than state average poverty statistics often report low access to affordable food, thus limiting their ability to maintain a healthy diet.<ref name=\"Hendrickson2006\"/> For these families living in poverty, many people work multiple jobs with rotating or evening shifts that make it difficult to find time to shop for food.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Anna Lena|title=Making Better Maps of Food Deserts|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/making-better-maps-of-food-deserts|journal=American Scientist|volume=99|issue=3|doi=10.1511/2011.90.209|year=2011|page=209}}</ref> Time constraints affect decision-making and people often choose to go to a closer convenience store rather than travel farther for fresh food.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Michael|date=2010|title=Getting Fat on Government Cheese: The Connection Between Social Welfare Participation, Gender, and Obesity in America|url=https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Food-Stamps-and-Obesity.pdf|journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law & Policy|volume=18|pages=45\u201377|via=}}</ref> Families in urban food deserts may lack access to a car, which adds to the time needed to shop for groceries.<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, convenience stores and corner stores are typically open later hours than traditional grocery stores, making them more accessible.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10834-010-9190-7 |title=Working for Peanuts: Nonstandard Work and Food Insecurity Across Household Structure |journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues |volume=32 |pages=84\u201397 |year=2010 |last1=Coleman-Jensen |first1=Alisha J }}</ref>\n\nAnother factor that impacts those living in a food desert is safety. High rates of crime are a barrier for those living in food deserts.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book |date=October 2011 |title=Food Deserts in Chicago |publisher=Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/IL-FoodDeserts-2011.pdf }}{{page needed|date=June 2018}}</ref> If people feel unsafe traveling farther to a grocery store, they are more likely to decide to purchase less healthy options at a closer location. In this way, people prioritize their safety over fresh, healthy foods.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nProximity to fast-food restaurants also influences decisions made when choosing meals. How close an individual is to a fast food restaurant is correlated to having a higher BMI, while proximity to a grocery store is associated with a lower BMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=42729|title=USDA ERS - Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food-Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: Report to Congress|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> One study found that people living in the poorest areas of the country have more than twice the exposure to fast-food restaurants compared to people living in wealthy areas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cities and the health of the public|date=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|others=Freudenberg, Nicholas., Galea, Sandro., Vlahov, David.|isbn=978-0826515124|edition=1st|location=Nashville [Tenn.]|oclc=558991544}}</ref> Another study used 15 years of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to examine the fast-food consumption of more than 5,000 young American adults aged 18\u201330 years in different geographic areas of the US.<ref name=\":2\" /> Proximity to fast food or a supermarket/grocery store was used to predict the type of food consumed.<ref name=\":2\" /> In low-income study participants, the type of food consumed was directly related to the proximity of fast food restaurants.<ref name=\":2\" /> These results suggest that low-income persons living in a food desert make decisions to consume fast-food based on proximity to fast-food restaurants versus distances to a grocery store.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Health literacy ===\nWhile access poses a major barrier to the practice of [[self-care]] in food deserts, [[health literacy]] remains a common barrier to nutritional behavioral choices. Health literacy and food deserts can affect all sectors of the population, but it is known that they both disproportionately affect underserved, low-income individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2010.11.009 |pmid=21185958 |title=Serving the Public: Health Literacy and Food Deserts |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=111 |issue=1 |page=14 |year=2011 |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Judith C }}</ref> Health literacy is the ability to obtain, read, understand, and use [[Healthcare|health]] information in order to make appropriate [[health]] decisions and follow instructions for treatment.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Facilitating state health exchange communication through the use of health literate practices : workshop summary|date=2012|publisher=National Academies Press|others=Hewitt, Maria Elizabeth., Institute of Medicine (U.S.).

Gaining access to fresh and affordable food is essential to improving health and decreasing social disparities in those living in food deserts. Increasing health education and resources to improve health literacy are also vital for individuals to engage in healthy behaviors, adhere to dietary recommendations, and practice self-care.\n\n==Impact==\nAll of the aforementioned limitations to nutritional foods have serious consequences for marginalized groups, as they are disproportionately represented in food deserts. Subsequently, dietary-related diseases continue to have a proportionately large impact in these communities. This can be seen in studies examining diabetes and lactose intolerance. 4.9 million non-Hispanic African Americans aged 20 years or older have diagnosed diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) national survey data. In the United States, some degree of lactose indigestion occurs in an estimated 15% (6% to 19%) of Caucasians, 53% of Mexican Americans, 62% to 100% of Native Americans, 75-80% of African Americans, and 90% of Asian Americans.<ref>Miller, Gregory D., et al. \u201cDairy Foods and Hypertension.\u201d ''Handbook of Dairy Foods and Nutrition, Second Edition'', 1999, p. 327., doi:10.1201/9781420050189.ch3.</ref> Additionally, racial and ethnic minorities have a higher prevalence of diabetes as compared to whites, and have a higher rate of complication post-diabetes diagnosis.<ref>Edward A.

On the larger scale, there have been national public policy initiatives.\n\n=== Federal and state policy initiatives ===\nThe United States government responded to food insecurity with several programs, one of which being the Domestic Nutrition Assistance Programs (DNAPs). Other programs include the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)]], the Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and food pantries and emergency kitchens. However, there is still a significant lack of legislation on local and state levels to adequately address the problem efficiently. As food insecurity has reached drastic levels, significant pressure for the government to qualify the problem as a\u00a0human rights issue, which has proven futile.<ref>Elsheikh, Elsadig. \u201cStructural Racialization and Food Insecurity in the United States.\u201d ''Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society'', 2013, p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] announced their partnership in the development of the [[Healthy Food Financing Initiative]] (HFFI). Intending to expand access to healthy food options in both urban and rural communities across the country, HFFI has helped expand and develop grocery stores, corner stores, and [[farmers' market]]s, by providing financial and technical assistance to communities.

[[Farmers' market]]s provide residents with fresh fruits and vegetables. Usually, in public and central areas of a community, such as a park, farmers' markets are most effective when they are easily accessible. Farmers' markets tend to be more successful in urban than rural areas due to large geographic distances in rural areas that make the markets difficult to access.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc291f.pdf|title=Do Farmers' Markets Ameliorate Food Deserts?|last=McCracken|first=Vicki|date=|website=University of Wisconsin|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> The expansion of  SNAP  to farmers' markets also helps make nutritious foods increasingly affordable.

These distinct national [[List of nutrition guides|nutrition guides]] add to the controversy surrounding the definition of food deserts. Since a food desert is defined as an area with limited access to nutritious foods, a universal identification of them cannot be created without a global consensus on nutrition.\n\n=== Income and food prices ===\nOther criteria include affordability and income level. According to the USDA, researchers should \"consider ... [the] prices of foods faced by individuals and areas\" and how \"prices affect the shopping and consumption behaviors of consumers.\"<ref name=\":9\">Access to affordable and nutritious food: Measuring and understanding food deserts and their consequences: Report to Congress.

The competition causes many small grocers to go out of business. This makes the task of getting nutritious, whole ingredients much more difficult for citizens who live far away from large supermarket stores.<ref name=\"smithmorton\" />\n\nIn most cases, people who live in rural food deserts are more likely to lack a high school degree or GED, experience increased poverty rates, and have lower median family income. People who live in rural food deserts also tend to be older. This is due to an exodus of young people (ages 20\u201329) who were born in these areas and decided to leave once they are able. States with numerous rural food deserts have a lower overall level of income as a result. This creates a negative feedback loop. Areas caught in these loops often struggle to repair the damages done, and typically remain as isolated communities that consist of uneducated and poor citizens.<ref name=\"Rural\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ruralsociology.org/assets/docs/rural-realities/rural-realities-1-4.pdf|title=Rural Realities|last=Morton|first=Lois|date=2007|website=Rural Realities|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBased on the 2013 ''County Health Ratings'' data, residents who live in rural U.S. food deserts are more likely to have poorer health than those who live in urban food deserts. People who live in rural communities have significantly lower scores in the areas of health behavior, morbidity factors, clinical care, and the physical environment. Research attributes these discrepancies to a variety of factors including limitations in infrastructure, socioeconomic differences, insurance coverage deficiencies, and a higher rate of traffic fatalities and accidents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Timothy J.|last2=Saman|first2=Daniel M.|last3=Lipsky|first3=Martin S.|last4=Lutfiyya|first4=M.

Comparatively, only 29.8% of those polled lacked access to adequate protein. This lack of access to fruits and vegetables often results in vitamin deficiencies. This eventually causes health problems for those who live within these areas.<ref name=\"Rural\" /> When tasked with finding a solution to this problem, research has shown that it will take individual and community actions, as well as public policy improvements, to maintain and increase the capacity of rural grocery stores to provide nutritious, high quality, affordable foods while being profitable enough to stay in business.<ref name=\"Rural\" />\n\nAlthough personal factors do impact eating behavior for rural people, it is the physical and social environments that place constraints on food access, even in civically engaged communities. Food access may be improved in communities where civic engagement is strong, and where local organizations join in providing solutions to help decrease barriers of food access. Some ways communities can do this is by increasing access to the normal and food safety net systems and by creating informal alternatives. Some informal, communal alternatives could be community food gardens and informal transportation networks. Further, existing federal programs could be boosted through greater volunteer involvement.<ref name=\"smithmorton\" />\n\nA 2009 study of rural food deserts found key differences in overall health, access to food, and the social environment of rural residents compared to urban dwellers.<ref name=\"smithmorton\">{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Chery|last2=Morton|first2=Lois W.|year=2009|title=Rural Food Deserts: Low-income Perspectives on Food Access in Minnesota and Iowa|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=41|issue=3|pages=176\u201387|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2008.06.008|pmid=19411051}}</ref> Rural residents report overall poorer health and more physical limitations, with 12% rating their health as fair or poor compared to 9% of urban residents.<ref name=\"smithmorton\" /> They believed their current health conditions were shaped by their eating behaviors when the future chronic disease risk was affected by the history of dietary intake.<ref name=\"smithmorton\" /> Moreover, the 57 recruited rural residents from Minnesota and Iowa in one study perceived that food quality and variety in their area were poor at times.<ref name=\"smithmorton\" /> The researchers reached the conclusion that, for a community of people, while food choice which bound by family and household socioeconomic status remained as a personal challenge, social and physical environments played a significant role in stressing and shaping their dietary behaviors.<ref name=\"smithmorton\" />\n\n== Urban food deserts ==\n\nFood deserts occur in poor urban areas when there is limited or no access to healthful, affordable food options.<ref name=\"Caspi 1254\u20131262\">{{Cite journal|last=Caspi|first=Caitlin E.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichiro|last3=Subramanian|first3=S.

It has taken time for researchers to understand Africa's urban food deserts because the conventional understanding of the term must be reevaluated to fit Africa's unconventional supermarkets.<ref name=\":13\" /> There are three categories for food deserts: ability-related, assets-related, and attitude-related.<ref name=\":13\" /> Ability-related food deserts are \u201canything that physically prevents access to food which a consumer otherwise has the financial resources to purchase and the mental desire to buy\u201d.<ref name=\":13\" /> An asset-related food desert involves the absence of financial assets, thus preventing consumption of desirable food that is otherwise available.<ref name=\":13\" /> Lastly there are attitude-related food deserts any state of mind that prevents the consumer from accessing foods they can otherwise physically bring into their home and have the necessary assets to procure.<ref name=\":13\" /> In Cape Town, South Africa  supermarkets take up a large portion of retail space.<ref name=\":13\" /> While supermarkets are expanding in poor neighborhoods in Cape Town, their food insecurity is growing at an alarming rate.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is one of the biggest road blocks when understanding food deserts. Based on the European or American understanding of food deserts the fact that there is access to supermarkets by definition would mean that Cape Town does not suffer from food deserts.<ref name=\":13\" /> Not only does Africa suffer from food deserts, but there is a direct link between climate change and the rapid growth of food deserts.<ref name=\":13\" /> While supermarkets are expanding to areas that once did not have supermarkets there is still a disparity when it comes to physical access.<ref name=\":13\" /> In the city of Cape Town asset-related urban food deserts are the main reason for the food insecurity.<ref name=\":13\" /> People in this area unable to afford the food that they would prefer to eat.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nClimate change plays an important role in urban food deserts because it directly affects accessibility. The main way that climate change affects food security and food deserts is that it reduces the production of food.<ref name=\":13\" /> With limited availability of a product the prices rise making it unavailable to those that cannot the rising prices.<ref name=\":13\" /> In Cape Town specifically supermarkets rely directly on fresh produce from the nearby farm area.<ref name=\":13\" /> Not only does climate change affect the production of food, but it can also damage capital assets that affect accessibility and utilization.<ref name=\":13\" /> Specifically in Cape Town the access to food deserts does not change the severity of food deserts.<ref name=\":13\" /> With limited diversity in their diets those that live in Cape Town are highly dependent on foods of low nutritional value and high calorific value.<ref name=\":13\" /> Utilizing the European or American definition of food deserts does not take into account the dynamic market of other cultures and countries.\n\n== Beyond physical access ==\nThe primary criterion for a food desert is its proximity to a healthy food market. When such a market is in reach for its residents, a food desert ceases to exist. But this does not mean that residents will now choose to eat healthy. A longitudinal study of food deserts in ''JAMA Internal Medicine'' shows that supermarket availability is generally unrelated to fruit and vegetable recommendations and overall diet quality.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The availability of unhealthy foods at supermarkets may affect this relationship because they tempt customers to purchase precooked foods which tend to contain more preservatives. Supermarkets may have such an adverse effect because they put independently owned grocery stores out of business. Independently owned grocery stores have the benefit of being made of the community so they can be more responsive to community needs.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, simply providing healthier food access, according to Janne Boone-Heinonen et al., cannot completely eliminate food deserts, this access must be paired with education.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Boone-Heinonen|first1=Janne|last2=Gordon-Larsen|first2=P|last3=Kiefe|first3=C.

Similarly, with meats that are dried, there is salt added to help in preservation but results in the meat has a higher sodium content.<ref name=\":132\" /> The ultra-processed foods were not made to be nutrient-rich, but rather to satisfy cravings with high amounts of salts or sugars, so they result in people eating more than they should of food that has no nutritional value.<ref name=\":15\" /> Processed foods may also be made rich with nutrients that many people are lacking in their diets, making up for the lack of fresh food.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nutrition.org/the-debate-over-the-health-effects-of-food-processing/|title=The Debate Over the Health Effects of Food Processing {{!}} American Society for Nutrition|date=2017-09-11|work=American Society for Nutrition|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> Some nutritionists may recommend eliminating processed foods from diets, while others see it as a way to reduce food scarcity and malnutrition.<ref name=\":132\" /> In 1990 the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act required nutrition labels on food, making it so people could see what and how much of something they were consuming. With that labeling what some companies did was list things that weren't added on the front, but rarely did they add information about nutrients they added.<ref name=\":132\" /> Scientists and nutritionists are looking into ways to create affordably, processed food that is high in essential nutrients and vitamins that also taste good so the consumer is inclined to buy them.<ref name=\":132\" />\n\n=== Alcohol ===\nMany areas that are food deserts have disproportionately high numbers of liquor stores. For example, [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]] has 4 supermarkets and 40 liquor stores in their community.<ref name=\":92\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.04.021 |title=Foodways of the urban poor |journal=Geoforum |volume=48 |pages=126\u201335 |year=2013 |last1=Alkon |first1=Alison Hope |last2=Block |first2=Daniel |last3=Moore |first3=Kelly |last4=Gillis |first4=Catherine |last5=Dinuccio |first5=Nicole |last6=Chavez |first6=Noel }}</ref> These communities are also often predominantly populated by ethnic minorities. Both Latinos and African Americans are predisposed to disease resulting from alcohol consumption. Some alcohol-related illnesses include stroke, hypertension, diabetes, colon and GI cancer, and obesity. Some studies show that moderating one's alcohol consumption can reduce one's chance of getting cardiovascular disease and even extend one's mental stability into old age.<ref name=\":142\" />\n\n== Implications for self care ==\n[[Self-care]] is an essential component in the management of chronic conditions and for those who are healthy. Self-care is greatly influenced by food choices and dietary intake.<ref name=\":142\" /> Limited access to nutritious foods in food deserts can greatly impact one's ability to engage in healthy practices. Access, affordability, and health literacy are all [[social determinants of health]], which are accentuated by living in a food desert.<ref name=\"Walker, R.E. 2010\" /> There are two main health implications for those living in food deserts: [[overnutrition]] or [[undernutrition]].<ref name=\":142\" /> The community may be undernourished, due to no access to food stores. The community may be over-nourished due to a lack of affordable supermarkets with whole foods and a higher concentration of convenience stores and fast-food restaurants that offer prepackaged foods often high in sugar, fat, and salt.<ref name=\":142\" /> [[Food security|Food-insecurity]] remains a problem for many low-income families, but the greatest challenge to living in a food desert is poor diet quality. Living in a food desert contributes to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases associated with being overweight.<ref name=\":142\" /> Persons living in a food desert often face barriers to self-care, particularly in accessing resources needed to change their dietary habits.\n\n=== Transportation and geography ===\nPeople tend to make food choices based on what is available in their neighborhood. In food deserts there is often a high density of [[Fast food restaurant|fast-food restaurants]] and corner stores that offer prepared and processed foods.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/>\n\nIn rural areas, [[food security]] is a major issue. Food security can imply either a complete lack of food, which contributes to [[Malnutrition|undernourishment]], or a lack of nutritious food, which contributes to over-nourishment.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/|title=USDA|website=www.usda.gov|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> community food security \"concerns the underlying social, economic, and institutional factors within a community that affect the quantity and quality of available food and its affordability or price relative to the sufficiency of financial resources available to acquire it.\"<ref name=\"ruralhealthinfo.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/food-and-hunger|title=Rural Hunger and Access to Healthy Food Introduction - Rural Health Information Hub|website=www.ruralhealthinfo.org|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref> Rural areas tend have higher food insecurity than urban areas. This insecurity occurs because food choices in rural areas are often restricted because transportation is needed to access a major [[supermarket]] or a food supply that offers a wide, healthy variety of foods, versus smaller [[convenience store]]s that do not offer as much produce.<ref name=\"ruralhealthinfo.org\"/>\n\nIt is critical to look at car ownership in relation to the distance and number of stores in the area. Distance from shops influences the quality of food eaten.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/> A vehicle or access to [[public transport]]ation is often needed to go to a grocery store. When neither a car nor public transportation is available, diets are rarely healthy. This is because fast food and convenience stores are easier to access and do not cost much money or time. Further, those who walk to food shops typically have poorer diets, which has been attributed to having to carry shopping bags home.<ref name=\"Coveney & O'Dwyer 2009\"/>\n\n=== Adherence ===\nLong-term adherence to a healthful, balanced [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is essential to promote the well-being of individuals and society. Many approaches to helping people eat a healthy, balanced diet are ineffective because of \"adherence problems\" with behavior changes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1559827613488867 |pmid=27547170 |pmc=4988401 |title=Long-Term Adherence to Health Behavior Change |journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=395\u2013404 |year=2013 |last1=Middleton |first1=Kathryn R |last2=Anton |first2=Stephen D |last3=Perri |first3=Michal G }}</ref> Dietary adherence is influenced by habits that develop over a lifetime.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIt is especially difficult to \"adhere\" to a prescribed diet and lifestyle (ex. [[Low sodium diet|low-salt diet]], [[low-fat diet]], [[Low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate diet]], low-sugar diet) when living in a food desert without enough access to items needed. When high-sugar, high-fat, and high-salt items are the only foods available to people living in a food desert, dietary adherence requires (a) shift in lifestyle/eating habits and (b) access to fresh, healthy, affordable foods.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Decision-making ===\nDecision-making is an important component of self-care that is affected by food deserts. People employ both rational and naturalistic decision-making processes on a routine basis. Naturalistic decisions occur in situations where time is limited, stakes are high, needed information is missing, the situation is ambiguous and the decision-maker is uncertain. Rational decisions are more likely when people have time to weigh options and consider the consequences.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08870440008400300 |title=Processes of patient decision making: Theoretical and methodological issues |journal=Psychology & Health |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=191\u2013204 |year=2000 |last1=Broadstock |first1=Marita |last2=Michie |first2=Susan }}</ref>\n\nThe way individuals living in a food desert make decisions about healthy eating is influenced by a variety of factors. Communities with higher than state average poverty statistics often report low access to affordable food, thus limiting their ability to maintain a healthy diet.<ref name=\"Hendrickson2006\"/> For these families living in poverty, many people work multiple jobs with rotating or evening shifts that make it difficult to find time to shop for food.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Anna Lena|title=Making Better Maps of Food Deserts|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/making-better-maps-of-food-deserts|journal=American Scientist|volume=99|issue=3|doi=10.1511/2011.90.209|year=2011|page=209}}</ref> Time constraints affect decision-making and people often choose to go to a closer convenience store rather than travel farther for fresh food.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Michael|date=2010|title=Getting Fat on Government Cheese: The Connection Between Social Welfare Participation, Gender, and Obesity in America|url=https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Food-Stamps-and-Obesity.pdf|journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law & Policy|volume=18|pages=45\u201377|via=}}</ref> Families in urban food deserts may lack access to a car, which adds to the time needed to shop for groceries.<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, convenience stores and corner stores are typically open later hours than traditional grocery stores, making them more accessible.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10834-010-9190-7 |title=Working for Peanuts: Nonstandard Work and Food Insecurity Across Household Structure |journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues |volume=32 |pages=84\u201397 |year=2010 |last1=Coleman-Jensen |first1=Alisha J }}</ref>\n\nAnother factor that impacts those living in a food desert is safety. High rates of crime are a barrier for those living in food deserts.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book |date=October 2011 |title=Food Deserts in Chicago |publisher=Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/IL-FoodDeserts-2011.pdf }}{{page needed|date=June 2018}}</ref> If people feel unsafe traveling farther to a grocery store, they are more likely to decide to purchase less healthy options at a closer location. In this way, people prioritize their safety over fresh, healthy foods.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nProximity to fast-food restaurants also influences decisions made when choosing meals. How close an individual is to a fast food restaurant is correlated to having a higher BMI, while proximity to a grocery store is associated with a lower BMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=42729|title=USDA ERS - Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food-Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: Report to Congress|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> One study found that people living in the poorest areas of the country have more than twice the exposure to fast-food restaurants compared to people living in wealthy areas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cities and the health of the public|date=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|others=Freudenberg, Nicholas., Galea, Sandro., Vlahov, David.|isbn=978-0826515124|edition=1st|location=Nashville [Tenn.]|oclc=558991544}}</ref> Another study used 15 years of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to examine the fast-food consumption of more than 5,000 young American adults aged 18\u201330 years in different geographic areas of the US.<ref name=\":2\" /> Proximity to fast food or a supermarket/grocery store was used to predict the type of food consumed.<ref name=\":2\" /> In low-income study participants, the type of food consumed was directly related to the proximity of fast food restaurants.<ref name=\":2\" /> These results suggest that low-income persons living in a food desert make decisions to consume fast-food based on proximity to fast-food restaurants versus distances to a grocery store.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Health literacy ===\nWhile access poses a major barrier to the practice of [[self-care]] in food deserts, [[health literacy]] remains a common barrier to nutritional behavioral choices. Health literacy and food deserts can affect all sectors of the population, but it is known that they both disproportionately affect underserved, low-income individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2010.11.009 |pmid=21185958 |title=Serving the Public: Health Literacy and Food Deserts |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=111 |issue=1 |page=14 |year=2011 |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Judith C }}</ref> Health literacy is the ability to obtain, read, understand, and use [[Healthcare|health]] information in order to make appropriate [[health]] decisions and follow instructions for treatment.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Facilitating state health exchange communication through the use of health literate practices : workshop summary|date=2012|publisher=National Academies Press|others=Hewitt, Maria Elizabeth., Institute of Medicine (U.S.).

Increasing health education and resources to improve health literacy are also vital for individuals to engage in healthy behaviors, adhere to dietary recommendations, and practice self-care.\n\n==Impact==\nAll of the aforementioned limitations to nutritional foods have serious consequences for marginalized groups, as they are disproportionately represented in food deserts. Subsequently, dietary-related diseases continue to have a proportionately large impact in these communities. This can be seen in studies examining diabetes and lactose intolerance. 4.9 million non-Hispanic African Americans aged 20 years or older have diagnosed diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) national survey data. In the United States, some degree of lactose indigestion occurs in an estimated 15% (6% to 19%) of Caucasians, 53% of Mexican Americans, 62% to 100% of Native Americans, 75-80% of African Americans, and 90% of Asian Americans.<ref>Miller, Gregory D., et al. \u201cDairy Foods and Hypertension.\u201d ''Handbook of Dairy Foods and Nutrition, Second Edition'', 1999, p. 327., doi:10.1201/9781420050189.ch3.</ref> Additionally, racial and ethnic minorities have a higher prevalence of diabetes as compared to whites, and have a higher rate of complication post-diabetes diagnosis.<ref>Edward A.

On the larger scale, there have been national public policy initiatives.\n\n=== Federal and state policy initiatives ===\nThe United States government responded to food insecurity with several programs, one of which being the Domestic Nutrition Assistance Programs (DNAPs). Other programs include the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)]], the Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and food pantries and emergency kitchens. However, there is still a significant lack of legislation on local and state levels to adequately address the problem efficiently. As food insecurity has reached drastic levels, significant pressure for the government to qualify the problem as a\u00a0human rights issue, which has proven futile.<ref>Elsheikh, Elsadig. \u201cStructural Racialization and Food Insecurity in the United States.\u201d ''Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society'', 2013, p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] announced their partnership in the development of the [[Healthy Food Financing Initiative]] (HFFI). Intending to expand access to healthy food options in both urban and rural communities across the country, HFFI has helped expand and develop grocery stores, corner stores, and [[farmers' market]]s, by providing financial and technical assistance to communities. The creation of these resources provides nutritious food options to those living in food deserts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/community-economic-development/healthy-food-financing|title=Healthy Food Financing Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=US Department of Health & Human Services|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> The HFFI has awarded $195&nbsp;million to community development organizations in 35 states.

[[Farmers' market]]s provide residents with fresh fruits and vegetables. Usually, in public and central areas of a community, such as a park, farmers' markets are most effective when they are easily accessible. Farmers' markets tend to be more successful in urban than rural areas due to large geographic distances in rural areas that make the markets difficult to access.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc291f.pdf|title=Do Farmers' Markets Ameliorate Food Deserts?|last=McCracken|first=Vicki|date=|website=University of Wisconsin|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> The expansion of  SNAP  to farmers' markets also helps make nutritious foods increasingly affordable.

The [[bagel and cream cheese]] is sometimes consumed as a breakfast sandwich.\n* [[English muffin]]: Generally contains egg and cheese with either breakfast sausage or ham. Often served in U.S. fast food outlets such as McDonald's and Starbucks.\n* [[Toast]]: Toasted bread is one of the oldest forms of breakfast sandwich in America, and the closest to the original [[sandwich]] in form.

In [[New Jersey]], a common breakfast sandwich is the Jersey Breakfast which consists of [[pork roll]], egg, and cheese on a hard (Kaiser) roll.<ref name=\"Breakfast of Champions: Why New Jersey is Crazy for Pork Roll\">{{cite web|last1=Lazor|first1=Drew|title=Breakfast of Champions: Why New Jersey is Crazy for Pork Roll|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/pork-roll-taylor-ham-breakfast-meat-new-jersey.html|website=Serious Eats|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Biscuit (bread)|Biscuit]]: Consists of a large, or cat-head biscuit, sliced, on which meat, cheese, or eggs are served.  Popular biscuits include: Sausage biscuit,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mauro|first1=Jeff|title=Sausage and Gravy Biscuit Sandwiches|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jeff-mauro/sausage-and-gravy-biscuit-sandwiches-recipe.html|website=Food Network|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref> [[bacon]], [[tomato]], and [[country ham]]. Fast food restaurants have put smaller versions of fried [[Fillet (cut)#Chicken|chicken fillet]]s on biscuits to create chicken biscuits.  [[Scrambled eggs]] and/or [[American cheese]] are often added.\n* [[Bagel]] sandwiches: Due to their [[Jewish]] connection, bagels generally do not contain [[pork]], but other foods associated with the community, such as deli meats, [[lox]] or other [[smoked fish]], and [[cream cheese]] are used. The [[bagel and cream cheese]] is sometimes consumed as a breakfast sandwich.\n* [[English muffin]]: Generally contains egg and cheese with either breakfast sausage or ham. Often served in U.S. fast food outlets such as McDonald's and Starbucks.\n* [[Toast]]: Toasted bread is one of the oldest forms of breakfast sandwich in America, and the closest to the original [[sandwich]] in form. While any number of items might be served on toast, eggs and bacon are the ones most associated with breakfast.\n*Specialty breads: Mostly served by restaurant chains,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} there are other breakfast sandwiches that do not use one of the common breakfast breads used in the United States. [[Burger King]] uses a [[croissant]] to make a breakfast sandwich called the [[Croissan'Wich]], or croissant sandwich, depending on the market. McDonald's offers its traditional biscuit fillings on a sandwich made from maple flavored pancakes called a [[McGriddles]]. [[Dunkin' Donuts]] has a [[waffle]] sandwich that is similar to the McGriddles. These can be found at American fast food [[Chain store|franchises]] worldwide. [[Kangaroo Brands]] makes a variety of breakfast sandwiches made with [[pita]] bread.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Sandwhich}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breakfast Sandwich}}\n[[Category:Cheese sandwiches]]\n[[Category:Egg sandwiches]]\n[[Category:American sandwiches]]\n[[Category:Breakfast sandwiches| ]]\n", "name_user": "WhenDatCellphoneBling", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_sandwich"}

Or is it something cruel?\u201d\n\nIt might be a question too difficult for young girls to answer yet. The title track \u2018Sonatine (\uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ubc00)\u2019 takes the encounters of love away towards the adolescence of the girls. While \u2018Love&Live (\uc9c0\uae08, \uc88b\uc544\ud574)\u2019 was a typical K-pop girl group track with lovely emotions, \u2018Sonatine (\uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ubc00)\u2019 mesmerizes the audience with mystical melodies unexpected for a K-pop girl group.\n\nThe intro track \u2018Love & Evil\u2019 produced by SWEETCH materializes a girl who is lost alone in a dark forest. With the piano played in Accelerando, the girl runs away deeper into the forest.\n\nThe album continues with a newly released track, \u2018Rain 51db (\ube44\uc758 \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac 51db)\u2019 which is an homage to the first generation K-pop girl groups, [[S.E.S. (band)|S.E.S]] and [[Fin.K.L]]. It also shows their love towards themselves, trying to revitalize the sentiments of the golden era. Like ViVi\u2019s previous attempt in \u2018[[Everyday I Love You (Vivi song)|Everyday I Love You]]\u2019, LOO\u03a0\u0394 1/3 time-travels back to the 90\u2019s, with the question of \u201cwhat if LOO\u03a0\u0394 was created in the 90\u2019s?\u201d. They then raise their innocent and pure voices up as if \u2018Rain 51db\u2019 is the original soundtrack to an animation film with a storytelling, singing that they have \u201cdreams that they do not wake up from.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Arrangement\n\n| title1          = Into the New Heart \n| note1           = guitar by

Or is it something cruel?\u201d\n\nIt might be a question too difficult for young girls to answer yet. The title track \u2018Sonatine (\uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ubc00)\u2019 takes the encounters of love away towards the adolescence of the girls. While \u2018Love&Live (\uc9c0\uae08, \uc88b\uc544\ud574)\u2019 was a typical K-pop girl group track with lovely emotions, \u2018Sonatine (\uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ubc00)\u2019 mesmerizes the audience with mystical melodies unexpected for a K-pop girl group.\n\nThe intro track \u2018Love & Evil\u2019 produced by SWEETCH materializes a girl who is lost alone in a dark forest. With the piano played in Accelerando, the girl runs away deeper into the forest.\n\nThe album continues with a newly released track, \u2018Rain 51db (\ube44\uc758 \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac 51db)\u2019 which is an homage to the first generation K-pop girl groups, [[S.E.S. (band)|S.E.S]] and [[Fin.K.L]]. It also shows their love towards themselves, trying to revitalize the sentiments of the golden era. Like ViVi\u2019s previous attempt in \u2018[[Everyday I Love You (Vivi song)|Everyday I Love You]]\u2019, LOO\u03a0\u0394 1/3 time-travels back to the 90\u2019s, with the question of \u201cwhat if LOO\u03a0\u0394 was created in the 90\u2019s?\u201d. They then raise their innocent and pure voices up as if \u2018Rain 51db\u2019 is the original soundtrack to an animation film with a storytelling, singing that they have \u201cdreams that they do not wake up from.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Arrangement\n\n| title1          = Into the New Heart \n| note1           = guitar by

({{lang-ru|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e-\u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430}})\n* In French historiography, it is known as the '''Austrian campaign of 1805''' ({{lang-fr|Campagne d'Autriche de 1805}}) or the '''German campaign of 1805''' ({{lang-fr|Campagne d'Allemagne de 1805}})}} was a European conflict spanning the years 1803 to 1806. During the war, [[First French Empire|France]] and [[French client republic|its client states]] under [[Napoleon I]] defeated an alliance, the Third Coalition, made up of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (actually [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]), [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and others. [[Prussia]] remained neutral during the war.\n\nBritain had already been at war with France following the resumption of hostilities resulting from the breakdown of the [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]] and remained the only country still at war with France after the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]].  From 1803\u201305, Britain stood under constant threat of a [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|French invasion]].  The [[Royal Navy]], however, secured mastery of the seas and decisively destroyed a Franco-Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in October 1805.\n\nThe Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804\u201305 as Napoleon's actions in Italy (crowning himself with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien|Duc d'Enghien]]) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the [[Ulm Campaign]], a large wheeling manoeuvre by the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Russo-Austrian force under [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in early December.  Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Campo Tenese]].\n\nOn 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties between the two powers of [[Campo Formio]] and of [[Lun\u00e9ville]].  The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy and [[Bavaria]] to France and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also permitted the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and central Europe. As a direct consequence of these events, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ceased to exist when, in 1806, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis&nbsp;II]] abdicated the Imperial throne, emerging as Francis I, Emperor of Austria. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Austerlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose armies protected Sicily from a French invasion, to settle. Meanwhile, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] worries about growing French influence in [[Central Europe]] sparked the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] in 1806.\n\n== Periodisation ==\nHistoriographers differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance and only thereafter Austria and Naples\u2013Sicily completed the fully-fledged coalition. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain occurred until the September 1805 Ulm Campaign. Likewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historiographers conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosenberg |first=Chaim M. |date=2017 |title=Losing America, Conquering India: Lord Cornwallis and the Remaking of the British Empire |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a34yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA168 |location= |publisher=McFarland |page=168 |isbn= 9781476668123|accessdate=18 October 2018 }}</ref> and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".<ref>''Encarta Encyclopaedia Winkler Prins'' (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Pressburg, Vrede van\".

Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the [[War of the Second Coalition]], and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar Campaign.<ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/180781/pdf Pagedas, Constantine A., 'Counterpoint to Trafalgar: The Anglo-Russian Invasion of Naples, 1805-1806 (review)'] in ''Mediterranean Quarterly'', Volume 16, Number 1, Winter 2005, pp. 120-122.</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nEurope had been embroiled in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] since 1792.  After five years of war, the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] subdued the armies of the [[First Coalition]] in 1797. A [[Second Coalition]] was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the only opponent of the new [[French Consulate]].<ref>For the diplomatic history see Paul W. Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763\u20131848''  (1996). pp 210\u201386</ref>\n\n===From Amiens to the Third Coalition===\nIn March 1802, France and Britain agreed to cease hostilities under the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. For the first time in ten years all of Europe was at peace. However, many problems persisted between the two sides making implementation of the treaty increasingly difficult. Bonaparte was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of [[Malta]].<ref name=\"amiens\">[[#chandler|Chandler]] p. 304.</ref> The tension only worsened when Bonaparte sent an expeditionary force to [[Haitian Revolution|re-establish control over Haiti]].<ref name=\"force\">Chandler p. 320.</ref> Prolonged intransigence on these issues led Britain to declare war on France on 18 May 1803 despite the fact that Bonaparte finally accepted the occupation of Malta by the British.\n\nBonaparte's expeditionary army was destroyed by disease in Haiti, and subsequently swayed the First Consul to abandon his plans to rebuild France's New World empire. Without sufficient revenues from sugar colonies in the Caribbean, the vast [[Louisiana (New France)|territory of Louisiana]] in North America had little value to him. Though Spain had not yet completed the transfer of Louisiana to France per the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]], war between France and Britain was imminent. Out of anger against Spain and having the unique opportunity to sell something that was useless and not truly his yet, Bonaparte decided to sell the entire territory to the United States for a sum total 68 million francs ($15 million).<ref>Herring, p. 101.</ref> The [[Louisiana Purchase]] Treaty was signed on 30 April 1803.\n\nDespite issuing orders that the over 60 million francs were to be spent on the construction of five new canals in France, Bonaparte spent the whole amount on his [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|planned invasion of England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas J.

The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien]], a [[House of Bourbon|royalist]] \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Bonaparte.<ref>Either [[Antoine Jacques Claude Joseph, comte Boulay de la Meurthe|Antoine Boulay de la Meurthe]] (The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations), deputy from [[Meurthe Department|Meurthe]] in the [[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]], or Bonaparte's chief of police, [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]] (John Bartlett, ''Familiar Quotations'', 10th ed. (1919), said about his execution ''\"C'est pire qu'un crime, c'est une faute\"'', a statement often rendered in English as \"It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder.\" The statement is also sometimes attributed to French diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]]. Sometimes the quote is given as, \"It was worse than a crime; it was a mistake.\"</ref>\n\nFanning the flames of the outcry resulting from d'Enghien's death and the growing fear over increasing French power, British Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France. Pitt scored a significant coup by securing a burgeoning rival as an ally. The [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was dominated by Russia, something Britain had been uncomfortable with since the area provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to its [[Royal Navy]]. Additionally, Britain had supported the [[Ottoman Empire]] in resisting Russian incursions towards the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and on 11 April 1805 the two signed a treaty of alliance in Saint Petersburg.<ref name=\"suspicion&mistakes\">Chandler p. 328.</ref> The stated goal of the Anglo-Russian alliance was to reduce France to its 1792 borders. Austria, Sweden and Naples would eventually join this alliance, whilst Prussia again remained neutral.\n\nMeantime, the lull in participating in active military campaigning from 1801\u201304 permitted Bonaparte to consolidate his political powerbase in France. 1802 saw him proclaimed Consul for Life (his reward for having made peace with Britain, albeit briefly), as well as the establishment of a meritorious order, the [[Legion of Honour]]. Then, in May 1804, Bonaparte was proclaimed Napoleon, Emperor of the French and crowned in [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] on 2 December 1804. He also created eighteen ''[[Marshal of France|Marshals of the Empire]]'' from among his top generals, securing the allegiance of the army. Napoleon added the crown of [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|(Northern) Italy]] to his mantle in May 1805, thereby placing a traditional Austrian sphere of influence under his rule (eventually through a viceroy, his stepson [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]]). Keen on revenge and having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria joined the Third Coalition a few months later.\n\n===''La Grande Arm\u00e9e'' at Boulogne===\n{{See also|Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Inspecting the Troops at Boulogne, 15 August 1804.png|thumb|Inspecting the troops at Boulogne, 15 August 1804]]\n\nPrior to the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled the ''Army of England'', an invasion force meant to strike at England, from around six camps at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in Northern France. Although they never set foot on British soil, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost the morale of the soldiers.<ref name=\"morale\">Chandler p. 323.</ref>\n\nThe men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call ''[[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' (''The Great Army''). At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven [[corps]], each capable of independent action or in concert with other corps.  Corps were large combined arms field units typically containing 2-4 infantry divisions, a cavalry division, and about 36 to 40 [[cannon]] <ref name=\"Chandler 332\">Chandler p. 332.</ref> On top of these forces, Napoleon created a [[cavalry]] reserve of 22,000 organized into two [[cuirassier]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], four mounted [[dragoon]] divisions, and two divisions of dismounted dragoons and light cavalry, all supported by 24 [[artillery]] pieces.<ref name=\"Chandler 332\"/> By 1805, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had grown to a force of 350,000,<ref name=\"grown\">Chandler p. 333.</ref> was well equipped, adequately trained, and possessed a skilled officer class.\n\n===Russian and Austrian armies===\nThe Russian army in 1805 had many characteristics of [[ancien r\u00e9gime]] military organization: there was no permanent formation above the regimental level, senior officers were largely recruited from aristocratic circles (including foreigners), and the Russian soldier, in line with 18th-century practice, was regularly beaten and punished to instill discipline. Furthermore, many lower-level officers were poorly trained and had difficulty getting their men to perform the sometimes complex manoeuvres required in a battle. Nevertheless, the Russians did have a fine artillery arm manned by soldiers who regularly fought hard to prevent their pieces from falling into enemy hands.<ref name=\"russianarmy\">[[#fisher|Fisher & Fremont-Barnes]] p. 33.</ref>\n\n[[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the [[Hofkriegsrat]], the military-political council responsible for decision-making in the Austrian armed forces.<ref name=\"hofkriegsrat\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 31.</ref> Charles was Austria's best field commander,<ref name=\"best\">[[#uffindell|Uffindell]] p. 155.</ref> but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France. [[Karl Mack]] became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the infantry on the eve of war that called for a regiment to be composed of four [[battalion]]s of four [[company (military unit)|companies]] rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training, and as a result these new units were not led as well as they could have been.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 32\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 32.</ref> Austrian cavalry forces were regarded as the best in Europe, but the detachment of many cavalry units to various infantry formations precluded the hitting power of their massed French counterparts.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 32\"/>\n\nFinally, a significant divergence between these two nominal allies is often cited as a cause for disastrous consequences. The Russians were still using the old style [[Julian calendar]], while the Austrians had adopted the new style [[Gregorian calendar]], and by 1805 a difference of 12 days existed between the two systems. Confusion is purported to have ensued from the differing timetables regarding when the Allied forces should combine, leading to an inevitable breakdown in mutual coordination.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=David G |authorlink=David G.

The War of the Third Coalition began with the [[Ulm Campaign]], a series of French and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] military manoeuvres and battles designed to outflank an Austrian army under General Mack.\n\n===Austrian plans and preparations===\nGeneral Mack thought that Austrian security relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous [[Black Forest]] area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack believed that there would be no action in Central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centrepiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.<ref name=\"attack\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 36.</ref>\n\nFatally, the [[Aulic Council]] decided to make Northern Italy the main theatre of operations for the [[Habsburg]]s. [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the [[Adige River]] with [[Mantua]], [[Peschiera del Garda|Peschiera]], and [[Milan]] as the initial objectives.<ref name=\"initial\">Chandler p. 382.</ref> [[Archduke Johann of Austria|Archduke John]] was given 23,000 troops and commanded to secure [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] while serving as a link between his brother, Charles, and his cousin, [[Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este|Ferdinand]]; the latter's force of 72,000, which was to invade Bavaria and hold the defensive line at Ulm, was effectively controlled by Mack.<ref name=\"initial\" /> The Austrians also detached individual corps to serve with the Swedish in [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]] and the British in [[Naples]], though these were designed to obfuscate the French and divert their resources.\n\n===French plans and preparations===\n[[File:Ulm campaign - Invasion of Bavaria and French assembly on the Rhine, 2-25 September 1805.jpg|260px|thumb|The French concentrated around the [[Rhine]] from early to mid-September. 210,000 troops of the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] prepared to cross into Germany and encircle the Austrians.]]\nIn both the campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theatre as the central focus of French efforts, but in both instances the Italian theatre became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest.<ref name=\"frtroops\">Chandler p. 384.</ref> Meanwhile, [[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theatres: [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na|Mass\u00e9na]] would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men, [[Laurent, marquis de Gouvion Saint-Cyr|St. Cyr]] would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and [[Guillaume Marie Anne Brune|Brune]] would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.<ref name=\"invasion\">Chandler p. 385.</ref>\n\nMurat and [[Henri Gratien, Comte Bertrand|Bertrand]] conducted reconnaissance between the area bordering the Tyrol and the [[Main (river)|Main]] as [[Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary|Savary]], chief of the planning staff, drew up detailed road surveys of the areas between the Rhine and the Danube.<ref name=\"invasion\" /> The left wing of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would move from [[Hanover]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] to fall on [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]; the right and centre, troops from the Channel coast, would concentrate along the [[Middle Rhine]] around cities like [[Mannheim]] and [[Strasbourg]].<ref name=\"invasion\" /> While Murat was making demonstrations across the Black Forest, other French forces would then invade the German heartland and swing towards the southeast by capturing [[Augsburg]], a move that was supposed to isolate Mack and interrupt the Austrian lines of communication.<ref name=\"invasion\" />\n\n===The French invasion===\n[[File:Ulm campaign - French strategic envelopment, 26 September-9 October 1805.jpg|thumb|260px|The French invasion in late September and early October caught the Austrians unprepared and severed their lines of communication.]]\nOn 22 September, Mack decided to hold the [[Iller]] line anchored on Ulm. In the last three days of September, the French began the furious marches that would find them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]'s I Corps had marched through Prussian [[Ansbach]], he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces.<ref name=\"forces\">[[#kagan|Kagan]] p. 389.</ref> Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or manoeuvres; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to [[Ingolstadt]] east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size.<ref name=\"size\">Kagan p. 393.</ref> On 5 October, Napoleon ordered [[Michel Ney|Ney]] to join [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Soult]], and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at [[Battle of Donauw\u00f6rth|Donauw\u00f6rth]].<ref name=\"crossing\">Kagan p. 395.</ref> The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place \u2013 they instead deployed on a long west-east axis \u2013 and the early arrival of Soult and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] at Donauw\u00f6rth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion.<ref name=\"crossing\" /> Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauw\u00f6rth; on 6 October, three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauw\u00f6rth to seal off Mack's escape route.<ref name=\"route\">Kagan p. 397.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Wertingen===\n[[File:Central Europe, 7-9 October 1805.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The strategic situation from 7 to 9 October. With [[Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov|Kutuzov]] too far away to offer significant aid, the Austrians found themselves in a precarious position.]]\n{{main|Battle of Wertingen}}\nRealizing the danger of his position, Mack decided to go on the offensive. On 8 October, he commanded the army to concentrate around G\u00fcnzburg and hoped to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication. Mack instructed Kienmayer to draw Napoleon further east towards [[Munich]] and Augsburg. Napoleon did not seriously consider the possibility that Mack would cross the Danube and move away from his central base, but he did realize that seizing the bridges at G\u00fcnzburg would yield a large strategic advantage.<ref>Kagan p. 400.</ref> To accomplish this objective, Napoleon sent Ney's Corps to G\u00fcnzburg, completely unaware that the bulk of the Austrian army was heading to the same destination. On 8 October, however, the campaign witnessed its first serious battle at [[Wertingen]] between Auffenburg's troops and those of Murat and Lannes.\n\nFor reasons not entirely clear, Mack ordered Auffenburg on 7 October to take his division of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from G\u00fcnzburg to Wertingen in preparation for the main Austrian advance out of Ulm.<ref>Kagan p. 402.</ref> Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions \u2013 Klein's 1st Dragoons, Beaumont 3rd Dragoons, and Nansouty's [[cuirassier]]s. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by [[Nicolas Oudinot|Oudinot]]'s grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the north and west. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians were decimated, losing nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were prisoners.<ref name=\"prisoners\">Kagan p. 404.</ref> The [[Battle of Wertingen]] had been an easy French victory.\n\nThe actions at Wertingen convinced Mack to operate on the left bank of the Danube instead of making a direct eastwards retreat on the right bank. This would require the Austrian army to cross at G\u00fcnzburg. On 8 October, Ney was operating under [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]]'s directions that called for a direct attack on Ulm the following day. Ney sent in Malher's 3rd Division to capture the G\u00fcnzburg bridges over the Danube. A column of this division ran into some Tyrolean jaegers and captured 200 of them, including their commander General d'Apsr\u00e9, along with two cannons.<ref name=\"cannons\">Kagan p. 408.</ref> The Austrians noticed these developments and reinforced their positions around G\u00fcnzburg with three infantry battalions and 20 cannons.<ref name=\"cannons\" /> Malher's division conducted several heroic attacks against the Austrian positions, but all failed. Mack then sent in Gyulai with seven infantry battalions and fourteen cavalry squadrons to repair the destroyed bridges, but this force was charged and swept away by the delayed French 59th Infantry Regiment.<ref name=\"delayed\">Kagan p. 409.</ref> Fierce fighting ensued and the French finally managed to establish a foothold on the right bank of the Danube. While the Battle of G\u00fcnzburg was being fought, Ney sent General Loison's 2nd Division to capture the Danube bridges at [[Elchingen]], which were lightly defended by the Austrians. Having lost most of the Danube bridges, Mack marched his army back to Ulm. By 10 October, Ney's corps had made significant progress: Malher's division had crossed to the right bank, Loison's division held Elchingen, and [[Pierre Dupont de l'\u00c9tang|Dupont]]'s division was heading towards Ulm.\n\n===Haslach-Jungingen and Elchingen===\n{{main|Battle of Haslach-Jungingen|Battle of Elchingen}}\n[[File:Ulm campaign - Engagements around Ulm, 11-14 October 1805.jpg|thumb|260px|The strategic situation from 11 to 14 October. The French hurl themselves westwards to capture the Austrian army.]]\n\nThe demoralized Austrian army arrived at Ulm in the early hours of 10 October. Mack was deliberating about a course of action to pursue and the Austrian army remained inactive at Ulm until the 11th. Meanwhile, Napoleon was operating under flawed assumptions: he believed the Austrians were moving to the east or southeast and that Ulm was lightly guarded. Ney sensed this misapprehension and wrote to Berthier that Ulm was, in fact, more heavily defended than the French originally thought.<ref>Kagan p. 412.</ref> During this time, the Russian threat to the east began to preoccupy Napoleon so much that Murat was given command of the right wing of the army, consisting of Ney's and Lannes's corps.<ref>Kagan p. 414.</ref> The French were separated in two massive rings at this point: the forces of Ney, Lannes and Murat to the west were containing Mack, while those of Soult, Davout, Bernadotte and [[Auguste Marmont|Marmont]] to the east were charged with guarding against any possible Russian and Austrian incursions. On 11 October, Ney made a renewed push on Ulm; the 2nd and 3rd divisions were to march to the city along the right bank of the Danube while Dupont's division, supported by one dragoons division, was to march directly for Ulm and seize the entire city. The orders were hopeless because Ney still did not know that the entire Austrian army was stationed at Ulm.\n\nThe 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont's division marched from [[Haslach an der M\u00fchl|Haslach]] towards Ulm and ran into four Austrian regiments holding Bolfingen. The 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks, but the Austrians held firm and repulsed every single one of them. The Austrians flooded the battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to [[Jungingen]] hoping to score a knockout blow against Ney's corps by enveloping Dupont's force. Dupont sensed what was happening and preempted the Austrians by launching a surprise attack on Jungingen that captured at least 1,000 prisoners.<ref>Kagan p. 415.</ref> Renewed Austrian attacks drove these forces back to Haslach, which the French managed to hold. Dupont was eventually forced to fall back on Albeck, where he joined d'Hilliers's troops. The effects of the [[Battle of Haslach-Jungingen]] on Napoleon's plans are not fully clear, but the Emperor may have finally ascertained that the majority of the Austrian army was concentrated at Ulm.<ref name=\"ulm\">Kagan p. 417.</ref> Accordingly, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were still guarding the region around Munich.<ref name=\"ulm\" /> Napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture the important bridges around Ulm. He also began shifting his forces to the north of Ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of the city itself.<ref name=\"itself\">Kagan p. 420.</ref> These dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at Elchingen on the 14th as Ney's forces advanced on Albeck.\n\nAt this point in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, charging that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth.<ref name=\"forth\">Kagan p. 421.</ref> On 13 October, Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under General Reisch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery.<ref name=\"artillery\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont. Ney led his troops to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube and began the attack. The field to the side was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 40.</ref> The French cleared the Austrian pickets and a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point. The Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Riesch's infantry fled; Ney was given the title \"Duke of Elchingen\" for his impressive victory.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Ulm===\n{{main|Battle of Ulm}}\n[[File:Murat2.jpg|thumb|[[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] proved instrumental during the Ulm Campaign.]]\n[[File:Charles Th\u00e9venin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|General Mack surrenders his army at [[Ulm]]. Napoleon's strategic encirclement of the Austrians, in conjunction with the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] six weeks later, sealed the fate of the Third Coalition.]]\n\nOther actions took place on the 14th. Murat's forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; together Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of Heidenheim. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed in the vicinity of the Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm.<ref name=\"encampents\">Chandler p. 399.</ref> Mack was now in a dangerous situation: there was no longer any hope of escaping along the north bank, Marmont and the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving from [[Memmingen]] to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol.<ref name=\"encampents\" /> Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers.<ref name=\"troopers\">Chandler p. 400.</ref> Murat's pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim.<ref name=\"troopers\" /> Murat continued his harassment of Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at Trochtelfingten on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards [[Titisee-Neustadt|Neustadt]] and captured 12,000 Austrians.<ref name=\"troopers\" />\n\nEvents at Ulm were now reaching a conclusion. On 15 October, Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments and on the 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack began to realize that there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October, Napoleon's emissary, [[Philippe Paul, comte de S\u00e9gur|S\u00e9gur]], signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date.<ref name=\"troopers\" /> Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and [[Neresheim]] and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. 10,000 troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, but the vast majority of the Austrian force marched out on the 21st and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Arm\u00e9e drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation.<ref name=\"troopers\" />\n\n==Battle of Trafalgar==\n{{Main|Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar Campaign}}\n{{duplication|date=October 2013}}\n\nWhen the [[Third Coalition]] declared war on France after the short-lived [[Peace of Amiens]], Napoleon Bonaparte was determined to invade Britain. To do so, he had to ensure that the Royal Navy would be unable to disrupt the invasion [[flotilla]], which would require control of the English Channel.\n\nThe main French [[Naval fleet|fleets]] were at [[Brest, France|Brest]] in Brittany and at [[Toulon]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast. Other ports on the French Atlantic coast contained smaller [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]]. In addition, France and Spain were allied, so the Spanish fleet based in [[C\u00e1diz]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] was also available.\n\nThe British possessed an experienced and well-trained corps of naval officers. By contrast, most of the best officers in the French navy had either been executed or dismissed from the service during the early part of the [[French Revolution]]. As a result, Vice-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] was the most competent senior officer available to command Napoleon's Mediterranean fleet. However, Villeneuve had shown a distinct lack of enthusiasm to face Nelson and the Royal Navy after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Nile]].\n\nNapoleon's naval plan in 1805 was for the French and Spanish fleets in the Mediterranean and [[C\u00e1diz]] to break through the blockade and combine in the [[West Indies]]. They would then return, assist the fleet in Brest to emerge from blockade, and in combination clear the [[English Channel]] of Royal Navy ships, ensuring a safe passage for the invasion barges. The plan seemed good on paper but as the war wore on, Napoleon's unfamiliarity with naval strategy and ill-advised naval commanders continued to haunt the French.\n\n===West Indies===\nEarly in 1804, Admiral Lord Nelson commanded the British fleet blockading Toulon. Unlike [[William Cornwallis]], who maintained a tight blockade of Brest with the Channel Fleet, Nelson adopted a loose blockade in hopes of luring the French out for a major battle. However, Villeneuve's fleet successfully evaded Nelson's when his forces were blown off station by storms. While Nelson was searching the Mediterranean for him, Villeneuve passed through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], rendezvoused with the Spanish fleet, and sailed as planned to the [[West Indies]]. Once Nelson realized that the French had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, he set off in pursuit. Admirals of the time, due to the slowness of communications, were given considerable autonomy to make [[Naval strategy|strategic]] as well as [[Naval tactics|tactical]] decisions.\n\n===C\u00e1diz===\nVilleneuve returned from the West Indies to Europe, intending to break the blockade at Brest, but after two of his Spanish ships were captured during the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]] by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir [[Robert Calder]], Villeneuve abandoned this plan and sailed back to Ferrol.\n\nNapoleon's invasion plans for England depended entirely on having a sufficiently large number of ships of the line before [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], France. This would require Villeneuve's force of 32 ships to join Vice-Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s force of 21 ships at Brest, along with a squadron of five ships under Captain Allemand, which would have given him a combined force of 58 ships of the line.\n\nWhen Villeneuve set sail from Ferrol on 10 August, he was under strict orders from Napoleon to sail northward toward Brest. Instead, he worried that the British were observing his manoeuvres, so on 11 August he sailed southward towards [[C\u00e1diz]] on the southwestern coast of Spain. With no sign of Villeneuve's fleet by 26 August, the three French army corps invasion force near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] broke camp and marched to Germany, where it would become fully engaged.\n\nThe same month, Nelson returned home to England after two years of duty at sea, for some well-earned rest. He remained ashore for 25 busy days, and was warmly received by his countrymen, who were understandably nervous about a possible French invasion. Word reached England on 2 September about the combined French and Spanish fleet in the harbour of C\u00e1diz. Nelson had to wait until 15 September before his ship [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] was ready to sail.\n\nOn 15 August, Cornwallis made the fateful decision to detach 20 ships of the line from the fleet guarding the channel and to have them sail southward to engage the enemy forces in Spain. This left the channel somewhat denuded of ships, with only eleven ships of the line present. However, this detached force formed the nucleus of the British fleet that would fight at Trafalgar. Initially this fleet was placed under the command of Vice-Admiral Calder, reaching C\u00e1diz on 15 September. Nelson joined the fleet on 29 September to take command.\n\nThe British fleet used [[frigate]]s to keep a constant watch on the harbour, while the main force remained out of sight {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> west of the shore. Nelson's hope was to lure the combined Franco-Spanish force out and engage them in a \"pell-mell battle\". The force watching the harbour was led by Captain Blackwood, commanding [[HMS Euryalus (1803)|HMS ''Euryalus'']]. He was brought up to a strength of seven ships (five frigates and two schooners) on 8 October.\n\n===Supply situation===\nAt this point, Nelson's fleet badly needed provisioning. On 2 October, five ships of the line, [[HMS Queen (1769)|''Queen'']], [[HMS Canopus (1798)|''Canopus'']], [[HMS Spencer (1800)|''Spencer'']], [[HMS Zealous (1785)|''Zealous'']], [[HMS Tigre|''Tigre'']], and the frigate [[HMS Endymion (1797)|''Endymion'']] were dispatched to [[Gibraltar]] under Rear-Admiral Louis for supplies. These ships were later diverted for convoy duty in the Mediterranean, whereas Nelson had expected them to return. Other British ships continued to arrive, and by 15 October the fleet was up to full strength for the battle. Although it was a significant loss; once the first-rate ''Royal Sovereign'' had arrived, Nelson allowed Calder to sail for home in his flagship, the 98-gun [[HMS Prince of Wales (1794)|''Prince of Wales'']]. Calder's apparent lack of aggression during the engagement off Cape Finisterre on 22 July, had caused the Admiralty to recall him for a court martial and he would normally have been sent back to Britain in a smaller ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Villeneuve's fleet in C\u00e1diz was also suffering from a serious supply shortage that could not be readily rectified by the cash-strapped French. The blockades maintained by the British fleet had made it difficult for the allies to obtain stores and their ships were ill fitted. Villeneuve's ships were also more than two thousand men short of the force needed to sail. These were not the only problems faced by the Franco-Spanish fleet. The main French ships of the line had been kept in harbour for years by the British blockades with only brief sorties. The hasty voyage across the Atlantic and back used up vital supplies and was no match for the British fleet's years of experience at sea and training. The French crews contained few experienced sailors, and as most of the crew had to be taught the elements of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, gunnery was neglected. Villeneuve's supply situation began to improve in October, but news of Nelson's arrival made Villeneuve reluctant to leave port. Indeed, his captains had held a vote on the matter and decided to stay in the harbour.\n\nOn 14 September, Napoleon gave orders for the French and Spanish ships at Cadiz to put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join seven Spanish ships of the line then at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], go to [[Naples]], and land the soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops there, and fight a decisive action if they met a British fleet of inferior numbers.\n\nOn 18 October, [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] received a letter informing him that Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Rosily-Mesros|Fran\u00e7ois Rosily]] had arrived in [[Madrid]] with orders to take command. At the same time, he received intelligence that a detachment of six British ships had docked at [[Gibraltar]] (this was Admiral Louis's squadron). Stung by the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, Villeneuve resolved to go to sea before his successor could reach Cadiz. Following a gale on 18 October, the fleet began a rapid scramble to set sail.\n\n===Departure===\nThe weather, however, suddenly turned calm following a week of gales. This slowed the progress of the fleet departing the harbour, giving the British plenty of warning. Villeneuve had drawn up plans to form a force of four squadrons, each containing both French and Spanish ships. Following their earlier vote to stay put, the captains were reluctant to leave C\u00e1diz and as a result they failed to follow closely Villeneuve's orders (Villeneuve had reportedly become despised by many of the fleet's officers and crew). As a result, the fleet straggled out of the harbour in no particular formation.\n\nIt took most of 20 October for Villeneuve to get his fleet organised, and it set sail in three columns for the Straits of Gibraltar to the south-east. That same evening, the ship ''[[French ship Achille (1803)|Achille]]'' spotted a force of 18 British ships of the line in pursuit. The fleet began to prepare for battle and during the night they were ordered into a single line. The following day Nelson's fleet of 27 ships of the line and four frigates was spotted in pursuit from the north-west with the wind behind it. Villeneuve again ordered his fleet into three columns, but soon changed his mind and ordered a single line. The result was a sprawling, uneven formation.\n\nThe British fleet was sailing, as they would fight, under [[signal 72]] hoisted on Nelson's flagship. At 5:40&nbsp;a.m., the British were about {{convert|21|mi|km|0}} <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> to the north-west of Cape Trafalgar, with the Franco-Spanish fleet between the British and the Cape. At 6 a.m. that morning, Nelson gave the order to prepare for battle.\n\nAt 8 a.m., Villeneuve ordered the fleet to ''wear together'' and turn back for C\u00e1diz. This reversed the order of the Allied line, placing the rear division under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in the vanguard, or \"van.\" The wind became contrary at this point, often shifting direction. The very light wind rendered manoeuvering all but impossible for the most expert crews. The inexperienced crews had difficulty with the changing conditions, and it took nearly an hour and a half for Villeneuve's order to be completed. The French and Spanish fleet now formed an uneven, angular crescent, with the slower ships generally leeward and closer to the shore.\nVilleneuve was painfully aware that the British fleet would not be content to attack him in the old-fashioned way, coming down in a parallel line and engaging from van to rear. He knew that they would endeavour to concentrate on a part of his line. But he was too conscious of the inexperience of his officers and men to consider making counter movements.\n\nBy 11 a.m. Nelson's entire fleet was visible to Villeneuve, drawn up in two parallel columns. The two fleets would be within range of each other within an hour. Villeneuve was concerned at this point about forming up a line, as his ships were unevenly spaced and in an irregular formation. The Franco-Spanish fleet was drawn out nearly {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> long as Nelson's fleet approached.\n\nAs the British drew closer, they could see that the enemy was not sailing in a tight order, but rather in irregular groups. Nelson could not immediately make out the French flagship as the French and Spanish were not flying command pennants.\n\nThe six British ships dispatched earlier to Gibraltar had not returned, so Nelson would have to fight without them. He was outnumbered and outgunned, nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 guns to his 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There was no way for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being \"doubled on\" or even \"trebled on\".\n\n===Engagement===\n[[File:England Expects Signal.svg|thumb|250px|Nelson's famous signal]]\nThe battle progressed largely according to Nelson's plan. At 11:45, Nelson sent the famous [[flag]] signal, \"[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]\" He had instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant [[John Pasco]], to signal to the fleet the message \"England confides [i.e. is confident] that every man will do his duty.\" Pasco suggested to Nelson that ''expects'' be substituted for ''confides'', since the former word was in the signal book, whereas ''confides'' would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter; Nelson agreed to the change.<ref name=\"HMS\">{{cite web |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 England or Nelson? |url=http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavyee.htm |publisher=Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=12 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928143122/http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavyee.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=28 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe term \"England\" was widely used at the time to refer to the United Kingdom, though the British fleet included significant contingents from Ireland, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] as well as England. Unlike the photographic depiction, this signal would have been shown on the mizzen mast only and would have required 12 'lifts'. The fleet was approaching the French line in two columns. Leading the windward column in [[HMS Victory|''Victory'']] was Nelson, while [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Collingwood]] in [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|''Royal Sovereign'']] led the second, leeward, column.\n\nAs the battle opened, the French and Spanish were in a ragged line headed north as the two British columns approached from the west at almost a right angle. The northern, windward column of the British fleet was headed up by Nelson's 100-gun flagship ''Victory''. The leeward column was led by the 100-gun ''Royal Sovereign'', the flagship of Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. Nelson led his line into a feint toward the van of the Franco-Spanish fleet and then turned toward the actual point of attack. Collingwood altered the course of his column slightly so that the two lines converged at the line of attack.\n\nJust before his column engaged the allied forces, Collingwood said to his officers, \"Now, gentlemen, let us do something today which the world may talk of hereafter\". Because the winds were very light during the battle, all the ships were moving extremely slowly, and the lead British ships were under fire from several of the enemy for almost an hour before their own guns could bear.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar 1200hr.svg|right|thumb|200px|Situation at 1200 hours as the Royal Sovereign was breaking into the Franco-Spanish line]]\nAt noon, Villeneuve sent the signal \"engage the enemy\", and [[French ship Fougueux (1785)|''Fougueux'']] fired her first trial shot at ''Royal Sovereign''. ''Royal Sovereign'' had all sails out and, having recently had her bottom cleaned, outran the rest of the British fleet. As she approached the allied line, she came under fire from ''Fougueux'', [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], ''San Justo'' and ''San Leandro'', before breaking the line just astern of Admiral Alava's flagship ''Santa Ana'', into which she fired a devastating double-shotted [[raking fire|raking]] [[broadside]].\n\nThe second ship in the British lee column, [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Belleisle'']], was engaged by [[French ship Aigle (1794)|''Aigle'']], [[French ship Achille (1803)|''Achille'']], [[French ship Neptune (1803)|''Neptune'']] and ''Fougeux''; she was soon completely dismasted, unable to manoeuvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45 minutes until the following British ships came to her rescue.\n\nFor 40 minutes, ''Victory'' was under fire from [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1795)|''H\u00e9ros'']], [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']], [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']] and [[French ship Neptune|''Neptune'']]; although many shots went astray others killed and wounded a number of her crew and shot away her wheel, so that she had to be steered from her tiller belowdecks. ''Victory'' could not yet respond. At 12:45, ''Victory'' cut the enemy line between Villeneuve's flagship [[French ship Bucentaure (1804)|''Bucentaure'']] and ''Redoutable''. ''Victory'' came close to the ''Bucentaure'', firing a devastating [[raking fire|raking]] broadside through her stern which killed and wounded many on her gundecks. Villeneuve thought that boarding would take place, and with the Eagle of his ship in hand, told his men: \"I will throw it onto the enemy ship and we will take it back there!\" However, Admiral Nelson of ''Victory'' engaged the 74 gun ''Redoutable''. ''Bucentaure'' was left to be dealt with by the next three ships of the British windward column [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|''Temeraire'']], [[HMS Conqueror (1801)|''Conqueror'']] and [[HMS Neptune (1797)|''Neptune'']].\n\n[[File:Trafalgar1.jpg|thumb|250px|The situation at 13h]]\nA general m\u00eal\u00e9e ensued and, during that fight, ''Victory'' locked masts with the French ''Redoutable''. The crew of the ''Redoutable'', which included a strong infantry corps (with three captains and four lieutenants), gathered for an attempt to board and seize the ''Victory''. A [[musket]] bullet fired from the mizzentop of the ''Redoutable'' struck Nelson in the left shoulder and passed through his body lodging in his spine. Nelson exclaimed, \"They finally succeeded, I am dead.\" He was carried below decks and died at about 16:30, as the battle that would make him a legend was ending in favour of the British.\n\n''Victory'' ceased fire, the gunners having been called on the deck to fight the capture but were repelled to the below decks by French grenades. As the French were preparing to board ''Victory'', the ''Temeraire'', the second ship in the British windward column, approached from the starboard bow of the ''Redoutable'' and fired on the exposed French crew with a carronade, causing many casualties.\n\nAt 13:55, [[Jean Jacques Etienne Lucas|Captain Lucas]], of the ''Redoutable'', with 99 fit men out of 643 and severely wounded himself, was forced to surrender. The French ''Bucentaure'' was isolated by the ''Victory'' and ''Temeraire'', and then engaged by ''Neptune'', [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|''Leviathan'']] and ''Conqueror''; similarly, the ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was isolated and overwhelmed without being rescued, surrendering after three hours.\n[[File:Trafalgar2.jpg|thumb|250px|The situation at 17h]]\nAs more and more British ships entered the battle, the ships of the allied centre and rear were gradually overwhelmed. The allied van, after long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration and then sailed away. The British took 22 vessels of the Franco-Spanish fleet and lost none. Among the taken French ships were the [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']], [[French ship Alg\u00e9siras|''Alg\u00e9siras'']], {{HMS|Berwick|1775|2}}, ''Bucentaure'', ''Fougueux'', [[French ship Intr\u00e9pide (1804)|''Intr\u00e9pide'']], ''Redoutable'', and [[French ship Swiftsure|''Swiftsure'']]. The Spanish ships taken were ''Argonauta'', ''Bahama'', ''Monarca'', [[Spanish ship Neptuno (1795)|''Neptuno'']], [[Spanish ship San Agust\u00edn|''San Agust\u00edn'']], ''San Ildefonso'', [[Spanish ship San Juan Nepomuceno|''San Juan Nepomuceno'']], [[Spanish ship Sant\u00edsima Trinidad|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']], and ''Santa Ana''. Of these, ''Redoutable'' sank, ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' and ''Argonauta'' were scuttled by the British and later sank, [[French ship Achille (1803)|''Achille'']] exploded, ''Intr\u00e9pide'' and ''San August\u00edn'' burned, and ''Aigle'', ''Berwick'', ''Fougueux'', and ''Monarca'' were wrecked in a gale following the battle.\n\nAs Nelson lay dying, he ordered the fleet to anchor as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the [[shoals]]. A few of them were recaptured by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews or by ships sallying from C\u00e1diz.\n\n==Battle of Austerlitz==\n[[File:Bivouac on the Eve of the Battle of Austerlitz, 1st December 1805.PNG|thumb|Napoleon with his troops on the eve of battle, questioning local peasants on the movements of the Austro-Russian Army.

Following the failure of the Austrian army at Ulm, a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army under General Mikhail Kutuzov was also withdrawing east, and reached the [[Ill (Austria)|Ill river]] on 22 October, where it joined with the retreating Corps ''Kienmayer''. On 5 November, they held a successful rearguard action in [[Battle of Amstetten|Amstetten]].  On 7 November, the Russians arrived in [[St. P\u00f6lten]], and then moved across the Danube river the next day. Late on 9 November, they destroyed the bridges across the Danube, holding the last one, at Stein, near [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]], until the late afternoon.<ref>{{in lang|de}} Rainer Egger.

This was a trap on the part of Kutuzov, laid for the sole purpose of convincing Mortier that he had retreated further toward Vienna, when he had actually crossed the Danube in force, and lay concealed behind the ridges above the village. In the ensuing [[Battle of D\u00fcrenstein]], three Russian columns circled around the First Division of the ''Corps Mortier'', and attacked Gazan from both the front and the rear.  Not until Dupont's division arrived, after dark, was Gazan able to start to evacuate his soldiers to the other side of the Danube. Gazan lost close to 40 percent of his division. In addition, 47 officers and 895 men were captured, and he lost five guns, as well as the [[French Imperial Eagle|eagles]] of the 4th Infantry Regiment, and the eagle and [[Heraldic flag|guidon]] of the 4th Dragoons. The Russians also lost around 4,000, about 16 percent of their force, and two regimental colors.<ref>Smith. ''Databook.'' p. 213.</ref> The Austrian Lt.

The French did not have a direct line of sight from one end of the battlefield to the other.]]\nAt the [[Battle of Sch\u00f6ngrabern]] (also known as the Battle of Hollabrunn) occurred a week after the battle at Duerenstein.  On 16 November 1805. near Hollabrunn in Lower Austria.  The Russian army of [[Mikhail Kutuzov|Kutuzov]] was retiring north of the [[Danube]] before the French army of [[Napoleon]].\n\nOn 13 November 1805 Marshals [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], commanding the French advance guard, had captured a bridge over the Danube at [[Vienna]] by falsely claiming that an [[armistice]] had been signed, and then rushing the bridge while the guards were distracted. Kutuzov needed to gain time in order to make contact near [[Br\u00fcnn]] with reinforcements led by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden|Buxhowden]]. He ordered his rearguard under Major-General Prince [[Pyotr Bagration]] to delay the French.\n\nAfter Hollabrun, the armies gathered on the plains to the east of Brno. Napoleon could muster some 75,000 men and 157 guns for the impending battle, but about 7,000 troops under [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] were still far to the south in the direction of Vienna.<ref name=\"napoleon\">Uffindell p. 19.</ref> The Allies had about 73,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.<ref name=\"napoleon\"/> On 1 December, both sides occupied their main positions.\n\n===Battlefield===\nThe northern part of the battlefield was dominated by the 700-foot (210-metre) Santon hill and the 850-foot (260-metre) Zuran hill, both overlooking the vital [[Olomouc|Olmutz]]-Brno road that ran across a west-east axis. To the west of these two hills was the village of Bellowitz, and between them the Bosenitz Stream went south to link up with the Goldbach Stream, the latter flowing astride the villages of Kobelnitz, Sokolnitz, and Telnitz. The centerpiece of the entire area were the Pratzen Heights, a gently sloped hill about 35 to 40 feet (11\u201312&nbsp;m) in height. An aide noted that the Emperor repeatedly told his Marshals, \"Gentlemen, examine this ground carefully, it is going to be a battlefield; you will have a part to play upon it\".<ref name=\"quote\">Chandler pp. 412\u2013413.</ref>\n\n===Allied plans and dispositions===\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz, Situation at 1800, 1 December 1805.png|300px|thumb|right|Allied (red) and French (blue) deployments at 1800 hours on 1 December 1805]]\nAn Allied council met on 1 December to discuss proposals for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making contact with the enemy and securing the southern flank that led to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was in a more cautious mood, and he was seconded by Kutuzov, the main Russian commander.<ref name=\"emperor\">Chandler p. 416.</ref> The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted Austrian Chief of Staff Weyrother's plan.<ref name=\"emperor\"/> This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The [[Russian Imperial Guard]] was held in reserve while Russian troops under [[Pyotr Bagration|Bagration]] guarded the Allied right.\n\n===French plans and dispositions===\nDays before any actual fighting, Napoleon had given an impression to the Allies that his army was in a weak state and that he desired a negotiated peace.<ref name=\"peace\">[[#mclynn|McLynn]] p. 342.</ref> In reality, he was hoping that they would attack, and to encourage them on this mission he deliberately weakened his right flank.<ref name=\"flank\">[[#brooks|Brooks]], ed. p. 109.</ref> On 28 November, Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters and they informed him of their qualms and fears about the upcoming battle, even suggesting a retreat, but he shrugged off their complaints and went to work.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 48\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 48.</ref> Napoleon's plan envisioned that the Allies would throw so many troops to envelop his right flank that their centre would be severely weakened. He then counted on a massive French thrust, to be conducted by 16,000 troops of [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Soult]]'s IV Corps, through the centre to cripple the Allied army. Meanwhile, to support his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout's [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] to force march all the way from Vienna and join General Legrand's men, who held the extreme southern flank that would bear the heavy part of the Allied attack. Davout's soldiers had 48 hours to March {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Their arrival would be extremely crucial in determining the success or failure of the French plan. The [[French Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]] and [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]'s I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]] guarded the northern sector of the battle.\n\n===Battle is joined===\nThe battle began around 8 a.m. with the first allied column attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the battlefield witnessed heavy action in the following moments as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them on the other side of the Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by [[hussar]]s and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.<ref name=\"attacks\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nAllied columns started pouring against the French right, but not at the desired speed, so the French were mostly successful in curbing the attacks. In reality, the Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank and in the process they ran into and slowed down part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 48\"/> At the time, the planners thought this was a disaster, but later on it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the lead elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the ''Tirailleurs'', French skirmishers. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful and [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|General Langeron]] ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and around the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended momentarily when [[Louis Friant|Friant]]'s division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most fought over area in the battlefield and would change hands several times as the day progressed.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 49.</ref>\n\n===\"One sharp blow and the war is over\"===\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz - Situation at 0900, 2 December 1805.gif|300px|thumb|right|The decisive attacks on the Allied centre by [[Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire]] and [[Dominique Vandamme|Vandamme]] split the Allied army in two and left the French in a golden strategic position to win the battle.]]\nAround 8:45&nbsp;a.m., finally satisfied at the weakness in the enemy centre, Napoleon asked Soult how long it would take for his men to reach the Pratzen Heights, to which the Marshal replied, \"Less than twenty minutes, sire.\" About 15 minutes later, Napoleon ordered the attack, adding, \"One sharp blow and the war is over.\"<ref name=\"over\">Uffindell p. 21.</ref>\n\nA dense fog helped to cloud the advance of St. Hilaire's division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and encouraged them forward.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\"/> Russian soldiers and commanders on top of the heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them.<ref name=\"stunned\">Chandler p. 425.</ref> Allied commanders were now able to feed some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of horrendous fighting left much of this unit decimated beyond recognition. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers game against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, finally forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, [[Dominique Vandamme|General Vandamme]]'s division attacked an area called Star\u00e9 Vinohrady and through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys broke several Allied battalions.<ref name=\"sun\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe battle had firmly turned to France's favor, but there was still much fighting ahead. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte's I Corps to support Vandamme's left and moved his own command centre from Zuran Hill to St. Anthony's Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The difficult position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the [[Russian Imperial Guard]]; [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]], Tsar Alexander's brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme's section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the loss of the only French standard in the battle (the unfortunate victim was a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry no victor was clear yet. The Russians had a numerical advantage here but fairly soon the tide swung as Drouet's Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The [[horse artillery]] of the Guard also unlimbered a deadly toll on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about a quarter of a mile.<ref name=\"broke\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 51.</ref>\n\n===Endgame===\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz - Situation at 1400, 2 December 1805.gif|300px|thumb|right|By 1400 hours, the Allied army had been dangerously separated. Napoleon now had the option to strike at one of the wings, and he chose the Allied left since other enemy sectors had already been cleared or were conducting fighting retreats.]]\nMeanwhile, the northernmost part of the battlefield was also witnessing heavy fighting. Prince Liechtenstein's heavy cavalry began to assault [[Fran\u00e7ois Etienne de Kellermann|Kellerman]]'s lighter cavalry forces after finally arriving at the correct position in the field. The fighting originally went well for the French, but Kellerman's forces took cover behind General Caffarelli's infantry division once it became clear Russian numbers were too great. Caffarelli's men halted the Russian assaults and permitted [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] to send two cuirassier divisions into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good. The ensuing melee was bitter and long, but the French ultimately prevailed. Lannes then led his V Corps against Bagration's men and after hard fighting managed to drive the skilled Russian commander off the field. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector in the battlefield, was against the idea.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 52.</ref>\n\nNapoleon's focus now shifted towards the southern end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz and persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, generals [[Kienmayer]] and Langeron, to flee as fast as they could. [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden|Buxhowden]], the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O'Reilly light cavalry, who gallantly managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\"/>\n\nGeneral panic now seized the Allied army and it abandoned the field in any and all possible directions. Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. According to popular myth, the French artillery pounded towards the men, but Napoleon redirected his gunners to fire at the ice. The men drowned in the viciously cold ponds, dozens of artillery pieces going down along with them. Estimates on how many guns were captured differ; there may have been as few as 38 or as many as over 100. Sources also differ on casualties, with figures ranging from as few as 200 to as many as 2,000 dead. Because Napoleon exaggerated this incident in his report of the battle, the low numbers may be more accurate, although doubt remains as to whether they are fully correct. Many regard this incident as one of Napoleon's cruelest acts in war.<ref name=\"ice\">Chandler p. 432.</ref> However, only a few bodies are reported to have been found in the spring of 1806, and it is most likely the incident is a myth.<ref>Spring, Laurence, \"Russian Grenadiers and Infantry, 1799-1815\", Osprey Publishing 2002</ref>\n\n== Italian Campaigns ==\n=== Venetian front or Italian campaign of 1805 ===\nMeanwhile, in Italy, The Austrian ''[[Armee von Italien]]'' under [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] fought against the French ''[[Army of Italy (France)|Arm\u00e9e d'italie]]'' under [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na|Marshal Mass\u00e9na]]. The French managed to gain a bridgehead over the [[Adige|Adige river]] at [[Battle of Verona (1805)|Verona]] on 18 October, and finally, between 29 and 31 October, the outnumbered French defeated the superior Austrian army in the [[Battle of Caldiero (1805)|battle of Caldiero]]. In November the Austrians retreated, engaging the French vanguard of [[Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne|d'Espagne]] in several rear-guard actions. Venice was blockaded by French and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian]] troops under [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr|St.Cyr]]. Charles' army finally crossed the [[Isonzo river|Isonzo]] on 14 November, preventing the French from crossing it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=NAPOLEON'S ITALIAN CAMPAIGNS 1805-1815|last=Schneid|first=Frederick|publisher=Praeger|year=2002|isbn=0-275-96875-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:Bataille de Caldiero, 30 octobre 1805.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Caldiero (1805)|Battle of Caldiero]], 1805]]\nOne 4,400-strong Habsburg army that lingered behind, was roundly defeated and captured by [[Jean Reynier]] and [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr]] at the [[Battle of Castelfranco Veneto]] on 24 November 1805.\n\n=== Anglo-Russian occupation of Naples ===\n{{Main|Anglo-Russian occupation of Naples}}\nThe French force under St. Cyr then manoeuvred on the frontier of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The French were being carefully watched by an Anglo-Russian force entrusted with defence of the kingdom. After the Battle of Austerlitz, the Russians withdrew from Italy and the British, unwilling to defend Naples alone, evacuated the mainland altogether and retreated back to [[Sicily]]. Meanwhile, the French force, now stationed in [[Bologna]], was reorganised into the Army of Naples and placed under the nominal command of Napoleon's brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. However, the de facto commander was [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], who commanded the I Corps and was entrusted with the invasion by Joseph.\n\n=== French invasion of Naples ===\n{{Main|Invasion of Naples (1806)}}\nOn 9 February 1806, Mass\u00e9na invaded the Kingdom of Naples and two days later, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king of Naples, [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] also fled to Sicily, protected by the British fleet. Naples soon fell into French hands and by the end of February, only two places in the kingdom still held out. One was the fortress city of [[Gaeta]], north of Naples, and the other was [[Calabria]] in the very south of Italy, which was where the remainder of the Royal Neapolitan Army was stationed.\n\nFerdinand had hoped for a repeat of the events of 1799, when a popular uprising in Calabria eventually caused the downfall of the [[Parthenopaean Republic]], a French client state created after the Neapolitans were defeated the first time during the [[War of the Second Coalition]]. However, no such rebellion initially occurred and on 3 March, General [[Jean Reynier]], who commanded the 10,000 strong II Corps of the Army of Naples invaded Calabria. Only a few Calabrians resisted the invading French force and the Royal Neapolitan Army was soundly defeated at the [[Battle of Campo Tenese]] on 10 March 1806. Ferdinand now had no choice but to concede the Neapolitan throne to the French. A day after Campo Tenese, Joseph was installed as the new King of Naples. By now, the last regular troops of the Neapolitan army had fled to Sicily and the French controlled the entire Italian mainland except for the fortress of Gaeta, which had been [[Siege of Gaeta (1806)|under siege]] since 26 February.<ref name=\"calabria\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1987151 |last=Finley |first=Milton C.

Supply problems meant that Reynier's II Corps in Calabria was forced to live off the land. For over a month, the peasants of the region had supported the Neapolitan army and were close to starvation. Joseph seemed unaware of the problems and the potential dangers of revolt. Consequently, no extra provisions were sent to the south of Italy. Reynier took the initiative and seized supplies from the local populace, leading predictably to a revolt by the end of March. What started as small bands of partisans eventually expanded into entire villages rising up against the French. With the fortress of Gaeta still holding out, Joseph was unable to send more troops to Calabria, forcing Reynier to reinforce his army with native troops recruited from the larger towns and cities.<ref name=\"calabria\"/>\n\nBy July, Mass\u00e9na had still failed to take Gaeta due to poor logistical management of the French artillery, slight reinforcements from the British by sea and a series of successful sorties by the Neapolitan garrison against the French sappers. With only Reynier's small force in Calabria still struggling against the revolt, the British organised an expeditionary force under [[John Stuart, Count of Maida|Sir John Stuart]] to prevent any potential invasion of Sicily and perhaps to trigger a full-scale rebellion against the French across Italy. Although there were early successes for the British, in particular at [[Battle of Maida|Maida]], the British failed to either reinforce Stuart's expedition or attempt to relieve the Siege of Gaeta. With the French artillery finally able to bombard the walls with their full potential, the Neapolitans eventually surrendered on 18 July, freeing Mass\u00e9na's I Corps.<ref name=\"massena\">[[#masskoch|Mass\u00e9na & Koch]], pp. 194\u2013251.</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Mass\u00e9na was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Mass\u00e9na had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the [[Peninsular War]].\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Napoleonic Wars War of the Third Coalition.png|thumb|340px|All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition. <span style=\"color:Blue;\">Blue</span>: The Coalition and their colonies and allies. <span style=\"color:Green;\">Green</span>: The [[First French Empire]], its protectorates, colonies and allies.]]\nAusterlitz and the preceding campaign profoundly altered the nature of European politics. In three months, the French had occupied Vienna, decimated two armies, and humbled the Austrian Empire. These events sharply contrast with the rigid power structures of the 18th century, when no major European capital was ever held by an enemy army. Austerlitz set the stage for a near-decade of French domination on the European continent, but one of its more immediate impacts was to goad Prussia into [[War of the Fourth Coalition|war in 1806]].\n\nFrance and Austria signed a truce on 4 December and the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] 22 days later took the latter out of the war. Austria agreed to recognize French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lun\u00e9ville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, [[Kingdom of Wuerttemberg|Wurttemberg]], and [[History of Baden|Baden]], which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities. [[Veneto|Venetia]] was also given to the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French encamped themselves in Southern Germany. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was also effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, [[Joachim Murat]] became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the [[Strait of Sicily]], which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n===Casualties and losses===\nThe French lost 12,000 killed, 22,200 wounded and 5,000 captured in 1805, including 5,300 killed and 22,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign against the Habsburgs and Russians, 2,100 killed and 5,300 wounded in the Italian Campaign, 4,300 killed and 3,700 wounded in the naval war, 200 killed and 400 wounded in the colonies and 100 killed and 400 wounded in coastal defense duties.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=43}}{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=128}} The 1806 Naples Campaign cost the French 1,500 killed and 5,000 wounded.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=128}} The Spanish suffered 1,200 killed and 1,600 wounded in the naval war, Bavaria sustained 300 killed and 1,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign and the Kingdom of Italy lost 100 killed and 400 wounded in the Italian Campaign and 250 killed and 1,500 wounded in the Naples Campaign.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=128}}\n\nThe Austrians lost 20,000 killed and wounded and 70,000 as prisoners.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=43}} Russian casualties were 25,000 killed and wounded and 25,000 captured.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=43}} The Neapolitan army of 22,000 was wiped out by the French in 1806, with only 2,000 evacuated to Sicily.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bodart |first=G. |title=Losses of Life in Modern Wars, Austria-Hungary; France |year=1916 |isbn=978-1371465520 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Brooks |editor-first=Richard |year=2000 |title=Atlas of World Military History |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-7607-2025-8 |ref=brooks }}\n* {{cite book |last=Chandler |first=David G. |authorlink=David G.

historiography, it is known as the '''Austrian campaign of 1805''' ({{lang-fr|Campagne d'Autriche de 1805}}) or the '''German campaign of 1805''' ({{lang-fr|Campagne d'Allemagne de 1805}})}} was a European conflict spanning the years 1803 to 1806. During the war, [[First French Empire|France]] and [[French client republic|its client states]] under [[Napoleon I]] defeated an alliance, the Third Coalition, made up of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (actually [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]), [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and others. [[Prussia]] remained neutral during the war.\n\nBritain had already been at war with France following the resumption of hostilities resulting from the breakdown of the [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]] and remained the only country still at war with France after the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]].  From 1803\u201305, Britain stood under constant threat of a [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|French invasion]].  The [[Royal Navy]], however, secured mastery of the seas and decisively destroyed a Franco-Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in October 1805.\n\nThe Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804\u201305 as Napoleon's actions in Italy (crowning himself with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien|Duc d'Enghien]]) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the [[Ulm Campaign]], a large wheeling manoeuvre by the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Russo-Austrian force under [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in early December.  Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Campo Tenese]].\n\nOn 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties between the two powers of [[Campo Formio]] and of [[Lun\u00e9ville]].  The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy and [[Bavaria]] to France and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also permitted the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and central Europe. As a direct consequence of these events, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ceased to exist when, in 1806, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis&nbsp;II]] abdicated the Imperial throne, emerging as Francis I, Emperor of Austria. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Austerlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose armies protected Sicily from a French invasion, to settle. Meanwhile, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] worries about growing French influence in [[Central Europe]] sparked the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] in 1806.\n\n== Periodisation ==\nHistoriographers differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance and only thereafter Austria and Naples\u2013Sicily completed the fully-fledged coalition. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain occurred until the September 1805 Ulm Campaign. Likewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historiographers conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosenberg |first=Chaim M. |date=2017 |title=Losing America, Conquering India: Lord Cornwallis and the Remaking of the British Empire |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a34yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA168 |location= |publisher=McFarland |page=168 |isbn= 9781476668123|accessdate=18 October 2018 }}</ref> and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".<ref>''Encarta Encyclopaedia Winkler Prins'' (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"Pressburg, Vrede van\".

Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763\u20131848''  (1996). pp 210\u201386</ref>\n\n===From Amiens to the Third Coalition===\nIn March 1802, France and Britain agreed to cease hostilities under the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. For the first time in ten years all of Europe was at peace. However, many problems persisted between the two sides making implementation of the treaty increasingly difficult. Bonaparte was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of [[Malta]].<ref name=\"amiens\">[[#chandler|Chandler]] p. 304.</ref> The tension only worsened when Bonaparte sent an expeditionary force to [[Haitian Revolution|re-establish control over Haiti]].<ref name=\"force\">Chandler p. 320.</ref> Prolonged intransigence on these issues led Britain to declare war on France on 18 May 1803 despite the fact that Bonaparte finally accepted the occupation of Malta by the British.\n\nBonaparte's expeditionary army was destroyed by disease in Haiti, and subsequently swayed the First Consul to abandon his plans to rebuild France's New World empire. Without sufficient revenues from sugar colonies in the Caribbean, the vast [[Louisiana (New France)|territory of Louisiana]] in North America had little value to him. Though Spain had not yet completed the transfer of Louisiana to France per the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]], war between France and Britain was imminent. Out of anger against Spain and having the unique opportunity to sell something that was useless and not truly his yet, Bonaparte decided to sell the entire territory to the United States for a sum total 68 million francs ($15 million).<ref>Herring, p. 101.</ref> The [[Louisiana Purchase]] Treaty was signed on 30 April 1803.\n\nDespite issuing orders that the over 60 million francs were to be spent on the construction of five new canals in France, Bonaparte spent the whole amount on his [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|planned invasion of England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas J.

The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien]], a [[House of Bourbon|royalist]] \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Bonaparte.<ref>Either [[Antoine Jacques Claude Joseph, comte Boulay de la Meurthe|Antoine Boulay de la Meurthe]] (The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations), deputy from [[Meurthe Department|Meurthe]] in the [[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]], or Bonaparte's chief of police, [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]] (John Bartlett, ''Familiar Quotations'', 10th ed. (1919), said about his execution ''\"C'est pire qu'un crime, c'est une faute\"'', a statement often rendered in English as \"It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder.\" The statement is also sometimes attributed to French diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]]. Sometimes the quote is given as, \"It was worse than a crime; it was a mistake.\"</ref>\n\nFanning the flames of the outcry resulting from d'Enghien's death and the growing fear over increasing French power, British Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France. Pitt scored a significant coup by securing a burgeoning rival as an ally. The [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was dominated by Russia, something Britain had been uncomfortable with since the area provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to its [[Royal Navy]]. Additionally, Britain had supported the [[Ottoman Empire]] in resisting Russian incursions towards the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and on 11 April 1805 the two signed a treaty of alliance in Saint Petersburg.<ref name=\"suspicion&mistakes\">Chandler p. 328.</ref> The stated goal of the Anglo-Russian alliance was to reduce France to its 1792 borders. Austria, Sweden and Naples would eventually join this alliance, whilst Prussia again remained neutral.\n\nMeantime, the lull in participating in active military campaigning from 1801\u201304 permitted Bonaparte to consolidate his political powerbase in France. 1802 saw him proclaimed Consul for Life (his reward for having made peace with Britain, albeit briefly), as well as the establishment of a meritorious order, the [[Legion of Honour]]. Then, in May 1804, Bonaparte was proclaimed Napoleon, Emperor of the French and crowned in [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] on 2 December 1804. He also created eighteen ''[[Marshal of France|Marshals of the Empire]]'' from among his top generals, securing the allegiance of the army. Napoleon added the crown of [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|(Northern) Italy]] to his mantle in May 1805, thereby placing a traditional Austrian sphere of influence under his rule (eventually through a viceroy, his stepson [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]]). Keen on revenge and having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria joined the Third Coalition a few months later.\n\n===''La Grande Arm\u00e9e'' at Boulogne===\n{{See also|Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Inspecting the Troops at Boulogne, 15 August 1804.png|thumb|Inspecting the troops at Boulogne, 15 August 1804]]\n\nPrior to the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled the ''Army of England'', an invasion force meant to strike at England, from around six camps at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in Northern France. Although they never set foot on British soil, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost the morale of the soldiers.<ref name=\"morale\">Chandler p. 323.</ref>\n\nThe men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call ''[[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' (''The Great Army''). At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven [[corps]], each capable of independent action or in concert with other corps.  Corps were large combined arms field units typically containing 2-4 infantry divisions, a cavalry division, and about 36 to 40 [[cannon]] <ref name=\"Chandler 332\">Chandler p. 332.</ref> On top of these forces, Napoleon created a [[cavalry]] reserve of 22,000 organized into two [[cuirassier]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], four mounted [[dragoon]] divisions, and two divisions of dismounted dragoons and light cavalry, all supported by 24 [[artillery]] pieces.<ref name=\"Chandler 332\"/> By 1805, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had grown to a force of 350,000,<ref name=\"grown\">Chandler p. 333.</ref> was well equipped, adequately trained, and possessed a skilled officer class.\n\n===Russian and Austrian armies===\nThe Russian army in 1805 had many characteristics of [[ancien r\u00e9gime]] military organization: there was no permanent formation above the regimental level, senior officers were largely recruited from aristocratic circles (including foreigners), and the Russian soldier, in line with 18th-century practice, was regularly beaten and punished to instill discipline. Furthermore, many lower-level officers were poorly trained and had difficulty getting their men to perform the sometimes complex manoeuvres required in a battle. Nevertheless, the Russians did have a fine artillery arm manned by soldiers who regularly fought hard to prevent their pieces from falling into enemy hands.<ref name=\"russianarmy\">[[#fisher|Fisher & Fremont-Barnes]] p. 33.</ref>\n\n[[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the [[Hofkriegsrat]], the military-political council responsible for decision-making in the Austrian armed forces.<ref name=\"hofkriegsrat\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 31.</ref> Charles was Austria's best field commander,<ref name=\"best\">[[#uffindell|Uffindell]] p. 155.</ref> but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France. [[Karl Mack]] became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the infantry on the eve of war that called for a regiment to be composed of four [[battalion]]s of four [[company (military unit)|companies]] rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training, and as a result these new units were not led as well as they could have been.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 32\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 32.</ref> Austrian cavalry forces were regarded as the best in Europe, but the detachment of many cavalry units to various infantry formations precluded the hitting power of their massed French counterparts.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 32\"/>\n\nFinally, a significant divergence between these two nominal allies is often cited as a cause for disastrous consequences. The Russians were still using the old style [[Julian calendar]], while the Austrians had adopted the new style [[Gregorian calendar]], and by 1805 a difference of 12 days existed between the two systems. Confusion is purported to have ensued from the differing timetables regarding when the Allied forces should combine, leading to an inevitable breakdown in mutual coordination.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=David G |authorlink=David G.

The War of the Third Coalition began with the [[Ulm Campaign]], a series of French and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] military manoeuvres and battles designed to outflank an Austrian army under General Mack.\n\n===Austrian plans and preparations===\nGeneral Mack thought that Austrian security relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous [[Black Forest]] area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack believed that there would be no action in Central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centrepiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.<ref name=\"attack\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 36.</ref>\n\nFatally, the [[Aulic Council]] decided to make Northern Italy the main theatre of operations for the [[Habsburg]]s. [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the [[Adige River]] with [[Mantua]], [[Peschiera del Garda|Peschiera]], and [[Milan]] as the initial objectives.<ref name=\"initial\">Chandler p. 382.</ref> [[Archduke Johann of Austria|Archduke John]] was given 23,000 troops and commanded to secure [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] while serving as a link between his brother, Charles, and his cousin, [[Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este|Ferdinand]]; the latter's force of 72,000, which was to invade Bavaria and hold the defensive line at Ulm, was effectively controlled by Mack.<ref name=\"initial\" /> The Austrians also detached individual corps to serve with the Swedish in [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]] and the British in [[Naples]], though these were designed to obfuscate the French and divert their resources.\n\n===French plans and preparations===\n[[File:Ulm campaign - Invasion of Bavaria and French assembly on the Rhine, 2-25 September 1805.jpg|260px|thumb|The French concentrated around the [[Rhine]] from early to mid-September. 210,000 troops of the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] prepared to cross into Germany and encircle the Austrians.]]\nIn both the campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theatre as the central focus of French efforts, but in both instances the Italian theatre became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest.<ref name=\"frtroops\">Chandler p. 384.</ref> Meanwhile, [[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theatres: [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na|Mass\u00e9na]] would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men, [[Laurent, marquis de Gouvion Saint-Cyr|St. Cyr]] would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and [[Guillaume Marie Anne Brune|Brune]] would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.<ref name=\"invasion\">Chandler p. 385.</ref>\n\nMurat and [[Henri Gratien, Comte Bertrand|Bertrand]] conducted reconnaissance between the area bordering the Tyrol and the [[Main (river)|Main]] as [[Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary|Savary]], chief of the planning staff, drew up detailed road surveys of the areas between the Rhine and the Danube.<ref name=\"invasion\" /> The left wing of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would move from [[Hanover]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] to fall on [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]; the right and centre, troops from the Channel coast, would concentrate along the [[Middle Rhine]] around cities like [[Mannheim]] and [[Strasbourg]].<ref name=\"invasion\" /> While Murat was making demonstrations across the Black Forest, other French forces would then invade the German heartland and swing towards the southeast by capturing [[Augsburg]], a move that was supposed to isolate Mack and interrupt the Austrian lines of communication.<ref name=\"invasion\" />\n\n===The French invasion===\n[[File:Ulm campaign - French strategic envelopment, 26 September-9 October 1805.jpg|thumb|260px|The French invasion in late September and early October caught the Austrians unprepared and severed their lines of communication.]]\nOn 22 September, Mack decided to hold the [[Iller]] line anchored on Ulm. In the last three days of September, the French began the furious marches that would find them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]'s I Corps had marched through Prussian [[Ansbach]], he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces.<ref name=\"forces\">[[#kagan|Kagan]] p. 389.</ref> Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or manoeuvres; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to [[Ingolstadt]] east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size.<ref name=\"size\">Kagan p. 393.</ref> On 5 October, Napoleon ordered [[Michel Ney|Ney]] to join [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Soult]], and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at [[Battle of Donauw\u00f6rth|Donauw\u00f6rth]].<ref name=\"crossing\">Kagan p. 395.</ref> The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place \u2013 they instead deployed on a long west-east axis \u2013 and the early arrival of Soult and [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] at Donauw\u00f6rth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion.<ref name=\"crossing\" /> Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauw\u00f6rth; on 6 October, three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauw\u00f6rth to seal off Mack's escape route.<ref name=\"route\">Kagan p. 397.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Wertingen===\n[[File:Central Europe, 7-9 October 1805.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The strategic situation from 7 to 9 October. With [[Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov|Kutuzov]] too far away to offer significant aid, the Austrians found themselves in a precarious position.]]\n{{main|Battle of Wertingen}}\nRealizing the danger of his position, Mack decided to go on the offensive. On 8 October, he commanded the army to concentrate around G\u00fcnzburg and hoped to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication. Mack instructed Kienmayer to draw Napoleon further east towards [[Munich]] and Augsburg. Napoleon did not seriously consider the possibility that Mack would cross the Danube and move away from his central base, but he did realize that seizing the bridges at G\u00fcnzburg would yield a large strategic advantage.<ref>Kagan p. 400.</ref> To accomplish this objective, Napoleon sent Ney's Corps to G\u00fcnzburg, completely unaware that the bulk of the Austrian army was heading to the same destination. On 8 October, however, the campaign witnessed its first serious battle at [[Wertingen]] between Auffenburg's troops and those of Murat and Lannes.\n\nFor reasons not entirely clear, Mack ordered Auffenburg on 7 October to take his division of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from G\u00fcnzburg to Wertingen in preparation for the main Austrian advance out of Ulm.<ref>Kagan p. 402.</ref> Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions \u2013 Klein's 1st Dragoons, Beaumont 3rd Dragoons, and Nansouty's [[cuirassier]]s. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by [[Nicolas Oudinot|Oudinot]]'s grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the north and west. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians were decimated, losing nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were prisoners.<ref name=\"prisoners\">Kagan p. 404.</ref> The [[Battle of Wertingen]] had been an easy French victory.\n\nThe actions at Wertingen convinced Mack to operate on the left bank of the Danube instead of making a direct eastwards retreat on the right bank. This would require the Austrian army to cross at G\u00fcnzburg. On 8 October, Ney was operating under [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]]'s directions that called for a direct attack on Ulm the following day. Ney sent in Malher's 3rd Division to capture the G\u00fcnzburg bridges over the Danube. A column of this division ran into some Tyrolean jaegers and captured 200 of them, including their commander General d'Apsr\u00e9, along with two cannons.<ref name=\"cannons\">Kagan p. 408.</ref> The Austrians noticed these developments and reinforced their positions around G\u00fcnzburg with three infantry battalions and 20 cannons.<ref name=\"cannons\" /> Malher's division conducted several heroic attacks against the Austrian positions, but all failed. Mack then sent in Gyulai with seven infantry battalions and fourteen cavalry squadrons to repair the destroyed bridges, but this force was charged and swept away by the delayed French 59th Infantry Regiment.<ref name=\"delayed\">Kagan p. 409.</ref> Fierce fighting ensued and the French finally managed to establish a foothold on the right bank of the Danube. While the Battle of G\u00fcnzburg was being fought, Ney sent General Loison's 2nd Division to capture the Danube bridges at [[Elchingen]], which were lightly defended by the Austrians. Having lost most of the Danube bridges, Mack marched his army back to Ulm. By 10 October, Ney's corps had made significant progress: Malher's division had crossed to the right bank, Loison's division held Elchingen, and [[Pierre Dupont de l'\u00c9tang|Dupont]]'s division was heading towards Ulm.\n\n===Haslach-Jungingen and Elchingen===\n{{main|Battle of Haslach-Jungingen|Battle of Elchingen}}\n[[File:Ulm campaign - Engagements around Ulm, 11-14 October 1805.jpg|thumb|260px|The strategic situation from 11 to 14 October. The French hurl themselves westwards to capture the Austrian army.]]\n\nThe demoralized Austrian army arrived at Ulm in the early hours of 10 October. Mack was deliberating about a course of action to pursue and the Austrian army remained inactive at Ulm until the 11th. Meanwhile, Napoleon was operating under flawed assumptions: he believed the Austrians were moving to the east or southeast and that Ulm was lightly guarded. Ney sensed this misapprehension and wrote to Berthier that Ulm was, in fact, more heavily defended than the French originally thought.<ref>Kagan p. 412.</ref> During this time, the Russian threat to the east began to preoccupy Napoleon so much that Murat was given command of the right wing of the army, consisting of Ney's and Lannes's corps.<ref>Kagan p. 414.</ref> The French were separated in two massive rings at this point: the forces of Ney, Lannes and Murat to the west were containing Mack, while those of Soult, Davout, Bernadotte and [[Auguste Marmont|Marmont]] to the east were charged with guarding against any possible Russian and Austrian incursions. On 11 October, Ney made a renewed push on Ulm; the 2nd and 3rd divisions were to march to the city along the right bank of the Danube while Dupont's division, supported by one dragoons division, was to march directly for Ulm and seize the entire city. The orders were hopeless because Ney still did not know that the entire Austrian army was stationed at Ulm.\n\nThe 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont's division marched from [[Haslach an der M\u00fchl|Haslach]] towards Ulm and ran into four Austrian regiments holding Bolfingen. The 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks, but the Austrians held firm and repulsed every single one of them. The Austrians flooded the battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to [[Jungingen]] hoping to score a knockout blow against Ney's corps by enveloping Dupont's force. Dupont sensed what was happening and preempted the Austrians by launching a surprise attack on Jungingen that captured at least 1,000 prisoners.<ref>Kagan p. 415.</ref> Renewed Austrian attacks drove these forces back to Haslach, which the French managed to hold. Dupont was eventually forced to fall back on Albeck, where he joined d'Hilliers's troops. The effects of the [[Battle of Haslach-Jungingen]] on Napoleon's plans are not fully clear, but the Emperor may have finally ascertained that the majority of the Austrian army was concentrated at Ulm.<ref name=\"ulm\">Kagan p. 417.</ref> Accordingly, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were still guarding the region around Munich.<ref name=\"ulm\" /> Napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture the important bridges around Ulm. He also began shifting his forces to the north of Ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of the city itself.<ref name=\"itself\">Kagan p. 420.</ref> These dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at Elchingen on the 14th as Ney's forces advanced on Albeck.\n\nAt this point in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, charging that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth.<ref name=\"forth\">Kagan p. 421.</ref> On 13 October, Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under General Reisch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery.<ref name=\"artillery\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont. Ney led his troops to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube and began the attack. The field to the side was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 40.</ref> The French cleared the Austrian pickets and a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point. The Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Riesch's infantry fled; Ney was given the title \"Duke of Elchingen\" for his impressive victory.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Ulm===\n{{main|Battle of Ulm}}\n[[File:Murat2.jpg|thumb|[[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] proved instrumental during the Ulm Campaign.]]\n[[File:Charles Th\u00e9venin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|General Mack surrenders his army at [[Ulm]]. Napoleon's strategic encirclement of the Austrians, in conjunction with the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] six weeks later, sealed the fate of the Third Coalition.]]\n\nOther actions took place on the 14th. Murat's forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; together Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of Heidenheim. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed in the vicinity of the Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm.<ref name=\"encampents\">Chandler p. 399.</ref> Mack was now in a dangerous situation: there was no longer any hope of escaping along the north bank, Marmont and the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving from [[Memmingen]] to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol.<ref name=\"encampents\" /> Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers.<ref name=\"troopers\">Chandler p. 400.</ref> Murat's pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim.<ref name=\"troopers\" /> Murat continued his harassment of Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at Trochtelfingten on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards [[Titisee-Neustadt|Neustadt]] and captured 12,000 Austrians.<ref name=\"troopers\" />\n\nEvents at Ulm were now reaching a conclusion. On 15 October, Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments and on the 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack began to realize that there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October, Napoleon's emissary, [[Philippe Paul, comte de S\u00e9gur|S\u00e9gur]], signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date.<ref name=\"troopers\" /> Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and [[Neresheim]] and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. 10,000 troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, but the vast majority of the Austrian force marched out on the 21st and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Arm\u00e9e drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation.<ref name=\"troopers\" />\n\n==Battle of Trafalgar==\n{{Main|Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar Campaign}}\n{{duplication|date=October 2013}}\n\nWhen the [[Third Coalition]] declared war on France after the short-lived [[Peace of Amiens]], Napoleon Bonaparte was determined to invade Britain. To do so, he had to ensure that the Royal Navy would be unable to disrupt the invasion [[flotilla]], which would require control of the English Channel.\n\nThe main French [[Naval fleet|fleets]] were at [[Brest, France|Brest]] in Brittany and at [[Toulon]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast. Other ports on the French Atlantic coast contained smaller [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]]. In addition, France and Spain were allied, so the Spanish fleet based in [[C\u00e1diz]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] was also available.\n\nThe British possessed an experienced and well-trained corps of naval officers. By contrast, most of the best officers in the French navy had either been executed or dismissed from the service during the early part of the [[French Revolution]]. As a result, Vice-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] was the most competent senior officer available to command Napoleon's Mediterranean fleet. However, Villeneuve had shown a distinct lack of enthusiasm to face Nelson and the Royal Navy after his defeat at the [[Battle of the Nile]].\n\nNapoleon's naval plan in 1805 was for the French and Spanish fleets in the Mediterranean and [[C\u00e1diz]] to break through the blockade and combine in the [[West Indies]]. They would then return, assist the fleet in Brest to emerge from blockade, and in combination clear the [[English Channel]] of Royal Navy ships, ensuring a safe passage for the invasion barges. The plan seemed good on paper but as the war wore on, Napoleon's unfamiliarity with naval strategy and ill-advised naval commanders continued to haunt the French.\n\n===West Indies===\nEarly in 1804, Admiral Lord Nelson commanded the British fleet blockading Toulon. Unlike [[William Cornwallis]], who maintained a tight blockade of Brest with the Channel Fleet, Nelson adopted a loose blockade in hopes of luring the French out for a major battle. However, Villeneuve's fleet successfully evaded Nelson's when his forces were blown off station by storms. While Nelson was searching the Mediterranean for him, Villeneuve passed through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], rendezvoused with the Spanish fleet, and sailed as planned to the [[West Indies]]. Once Nelson realized that the French had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, he set off in pursuit. Admirals of the time, due to the slowness of communications, were given considerable autonomy to make [[Naval strategy|strategic]] as well as [[Naval tactics|tactical]] decisions.\n\n===C\u00e1diz===\nVilleneuve returned from the West Indies to Europe, intending to break the blockade at Brest, but after two of his Spanish ships were captured during the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]] by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir [[Robert Calder]], Villeneuve abandoned this plan and sailed back to Ferrol.\n\nNapoleon's invasion plans for England depended entirely on having a sufficiently large number of ships of the line before [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], France. This would require Villeneuve's force of 32 ships to join Vice-Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s force of 21 ships at Brest, along with a squadron of five ships under Captain Allemand, which would have given him a combined force of 58 ships of the line.\n\nWhen Villeneuve set sail from Ferrol on 10 August, he was under strict orders from Napoleon to sail northward toward Brest. Instead, he worried that the British were observing his manoeuvres, so on 11 August he sailed southward towards [[C\u00e1diz]] on the southwestern coast of Spain. With no sign of Villeneuve's fleet by 26 August, the three French army corps invasion force near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] broke camp and marched to Germany, where it would become fully engaged.\n\nThe same month, Nelson returned home to England after two years of duty at sea, for some well-earned rest. He remained ashore for 25 busy days, and was warmly received by his countrymen, who were understandably nervous about a possible French invasion. Word reached England on 2 September about the combined French and Spanish fleet in the harbour of C\u00e1diz. Nelson had to wait until 15 September before his ship [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] was ready to sail.\n\nOn 15 August, Cornwallis made the fateful decision to detach 20 ships of the line from the fleet guarding the channel and to have them sail southward to engage the enemy forces in Spain. This left the channel somewhat denuded of ships, with only eleven ships of the line present. However, this detached force formed the nucleus of the British fleet that would fight at Trafalgar. Initially this fleet was placed under the command of Vice-Admiral Calder, reaching C\u00e1diz on 15 September. Nelson joined the fleet on 29 September to take command.\n\nThe British fleet used [[frigate]]s to keep a constant watch on the harbour, while the main force remained out of sight {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> west of the shore. Nelson's hope was to lure the combined Franco-Spanish force out and engage them in a \"pell-mell battle\". The force watching the harbour was led by Captain Blackwood, commanding [[HMS Euryalus (1803)|HMS ''Euryalus'']]. He was brought up to a strength of seven ships (five frigates and two schooners) on 8 October.\n\n===Supply situation===\nAt this point, Nelson's fleet badly needed provisioning. On 2 October, five ships of the line, [[HMS Queen (1769)|''Queen'']], [[HMS Canopus (1798)|''Canopus'']], [[HMS Spencer (1800)|''Spencer'']], [[HMS Zealous (1785)|''Zealous'']], [[HMS Tigre|''Tigre'']], and the frigate [[HMS Endymion (1797)|''Endymion'']] were dispatched to [[Gibraltar]] under Rear-Admiral Louis for supplies. These ships were later diverted for convoy duty in the Mediterranean, whereas Nelson had expected them to return. Other British ships continued to arrive, and by 15 October the fleet was up to full strength for the battle. Although it was a significant loss; once the first-rate ''Royal Sovereign'' had arrived, Nelson allowed Calder to sail for home in his flagship, the 98-gun [[HMS Prince of Wales (1794)|''Prince of Wales'']]. Calder's apparent lack of aggression during the engagement off Cape Finisterre on 22 July, had caused the Admiralty to recall him for a court martial and he would normally have been sent back to Britain in a smaller ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Villeneuve's fleet in C\u00e1diz was also suffering from a serious supply shortage that could not be readily rectified by the cash-strapped French. The blockades maintained by the British fleet had made it difficult for the allies to obtain stores and their ships were ill fitted. Villeneuve's ships were also more than two thousand men short of the force needed to sail. These were not the only problems faced by the Franco-Spanish fleet. The main French ships of the line had been kept in harbour for years by the British blockades with only brief sorties. The hasty voyage across the Atlantic and back used up vital supplies and was no match for the British fleet's years of experience at sea and training. The French crews contained few experienced sailors, and as most of the crew had to be taught the elements of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, gunnery was neglected. Villeneuve's supply situation began to improve in October, but news of Nelson's arrival made Villeneuve reluctant to leave port. Indeed, his captains had held a vote on the matter and decided to stay in the harbour.\n\nOn 14 September, Napoleon gave orders for the French and Spanish ships at Cadiz to put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join seven Spanish ships of the line then at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], go to [[Naples]], and land the soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops there, and fight a decisive action if they met a British fleet of inferior numbers.\n\nOn 18 October, [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] received a letter informing him that Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Rosily-Mesros|Fran\u00e7ois Rosily]] had arrived in [[Madrid]] with orders to take command. At the same time, he received intelligence that a detachment of six British ships had docked at [[Gibraltar]] (this was Admiral Louis's squadron). Stung by the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, Villeneuve resolved to go to sea before his successor could reach Cadiz. Following a gale on 18 October, the fleet began a rapid scramble to set sail.\n\n===Departure===\nThe weather, however, suddenly turned calm following a week of gales. This slowed the progress of the fleet departing the harbour, giving the British plenty of warning. Villeneuve had drawn up plans to form a force of four squadrons, each containing both French and Spanish ships. Following their earlier vote to stay put, the captains were reluctant to leave C\u00e1diz and as a result they failed to follow closely Villeneuve's orders (Villeneuve had reportedly become despised by many of the fleet's officers and crew). As a result, the fleet straggled out of the harbour in no particular formation.\n\nIt took most of 20 October for Villeneuve to get his fleet organised, and it set sail in three columns for the Straits of Gibraltar to the south-east. That same evening, the ship ''[[French ship Achille (1803)|Achille]]'' spotted a force of 18 British ships of the line in pursuit. The fleet began to prepare for battle and during the night they were ordered into a single line. The following day Nelson's fleet of 27 ships of the line and four frigates was spotted in pursuit from the north-west with the wind behind it. Villeneuve again ordered his fleet into three columns, but soon changed his mind and ordered a single line. The result was a sprawling, uneven formation.\n\nThe British fleet was sailing, as they would fight, under [[signal 72]] hoisted on Nelson's flagship. At 5:40&nbsp;a.m., the British were about {{convert|21|mi|km|0}} <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> to the north-west of Cape Trafalgar, with the Franco-Spanish fleet between the British and the Cape. At 6 a.m. that morning, Nelson gave the order to prepare for battle.\n\nAt 8 a.m., Villeneuve ordered the fleet to ''wear together'' and turn back for C\u00e1diz. This reversed the order of the Allied line, placing the rear division under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in the vanguard, or \"van.\" The wind became contrary at this point, often shifting direction. The very light wind rendered manoeuvering all but impossible for the most expert crews. The inexperienced crews had difficulty with the changing conditions, and it took nearly an hour and a half for Villeneuve's order to be completed. The French and Spanish fleet now formed an uneven, angular crescent, with the slower ships generally leeward and closer to the shore.\nVilleneuve was painfully aware that the British fleet would not be content to attack him in the old-fashioned way, coming down in a parallel line and engaging from van to rear. He knew that they would endeavour to concentrate on a part of his line. But he was too conscious of the inexperience of his officers and men to consider making counter movements.\n\nBy 11 a.m. Nelson's entire fleet was visible to Villeneuve, drawn up in two parallel columns. The two fleets would be within range of each other within an hour. Villeneuve was concerned at this point about forming up a line, as his ships were unevenly spaced and in an irregular formation. The Franco-Spanish fleet was drawn out nearly {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> long as Nelson's fleet approached.\n\nAs the British drew closer, they could see that the enemy was not sailing in a tight order, but rather in irregular groups. Nelson could not immediately make out the French flagship as the French and Spanish were not flying command pennants.\n\nThe six British ships dispatched earlier to Gibraltar had not returned, so Nelson would have to fight without them. He was outnumbered and outgunned, nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 guns to his 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There was no way for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being \"doubled on\" or even \"trebled on\".\n\n===Engagement===\n[[File:England Expects Signal.svg|thumb|250px|Nelson's famous signal]]\nThe battle progressed largely according to Nelson's plan. At 11:45, Nelson sent the famous [[flag]] signal, \"[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]\" He had instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant [[John Pasco]], to signal to the fleet the message \"England confides [i.e. is confident] that every man will do his duty.\" Pasco suggested to Nelson that ''expects'' be substituted for ''confides'', since the former word was in the signal book, whereas ''confides'' would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter; Nelson agreed to the change.<ref name=\"HMS\">{{cite web |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 England or Nelson? |url=http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavyee.htm |publisher=Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=12 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928143122/http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavyee.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=28 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe term \"England\" was widely used at the time to refer to the United Kingdom, though the British fleet included significant contingents from Ireland, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] as well as England. Unlike the photographic depiction, this signal would have been shown on the mizzen mast only and would have required 12 'lifts'. The fleet was approaching the French line in two columns. Leading the windward column in [[HMS Victory|''Victory'']] was Nelson, while [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Collingwood]] in [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|''Royal Sovereign'']] led the second, leeward, column.\n\nAs the battle opened, the French and Spanish were in a ragged line headed north as the two British columns approached from the west at almost a right angle. The northern, windward column of the British fleet was headed up by Nelson's 100-gun flagship ''Victory''. The leeward column was led by the 100-gun ''Royal Sovereign'', the flagship of Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. Nelson led his line into a feint toward the van of the Franco-Spanish fleet and then turned toward the actual point of attack. Collingwood altered the course of his column slightly so that the two lines converged at the line of attack.\n\nJust before his column engaged the allied forces, Collingwood said to his officers, \"Now, gentlemen, let us do something today which the world may talk of hereafter\". Because the winds were very light during the battle, all the ships were moving extremely slowly, and the lead British ships were under fire from several of the enemy for almost an hour before their own guns could bear.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar 1200hr.svg|right|thumb|200px|Situation at 1200 hours as the Royal Sovereign was breaking into the Franco-Spanish line]]\nAt noon, Villeneuve sent the signal \"engage the enemy\", and [[French ship Fougueux (1785)|''Fougueux'']] fired her first trial shot at ''Royal Sovereign''. ''Royal Sovereign'' had all sails out and, having recently had her bottom cleaned, outran the rest of the British fleet. As she approached the allied line, she came under fire from ''Fougueux'', [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], ''San Justo'' and ''San Leandro'', before breaking the line just astern of Admiral Alava's flagship ''Santa Ana'', into which she fired a devastating double-shotted [[raking fire|raking]] [[broadside]].\n\nThe second ship in the British lee column, [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Belleisle'']], was engaged by [[French ship Aigle (1794)|''Aigle'']], [[French ship Achille (1803)|''Achille'']], [[French ship Neptune (1803)|''Neptune'']] and ''Fougeux''; she was soon completely dismasted, unable to manoeuvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45 minutes until the following British ships came to her rescue.\n\nFor 40 minutes, ''Victory'' was under fire from [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1795)|''H\u00e9ros'']], [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']], [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']] and [[French ship Neptune|''Neptune'']]; although many shots went astray others killed and wounded a number of her crew and shot away her wheel, so that she had to be steered from her tiller belowdecks. ''Victory'' could not yet respond. At 12:45, ''Victory'' cut the enemy line between Villeneuve's flagship [[French ship Bucentaure (1804)|''Bucentaure'']] and ''Redoutable''. ''Victory'' came close to the ''Bucentaure'', firing a devastating [[raking fire|raking]] broadside through her stern which killed and wounded many on her gundecks. Villeneuve thought that boarding would take place, and with the Eagle of his ship in hand, told his men: \"I will throw it onto the enemy ship and we will take it back there!\" However, Admiral Nelson of ''Victory'' engaged the 74 gun ''Redoutable''. ''Bucentaure'' was left to be dealt with by the next three ships of the British windward column [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|''Temeraire'']], [[HMS Conqueror (1801)|''Conqueror'']] and [[HMS Neptune (1797)|''Neptune'']].\n\n[[File:Trafalgar1.jpg|thumb|250px|The situation at 13h]]\nA general m\u00eal\u00e9e ensued and, during that fight, ''Victory'' locked masts with the French ''Redoutable''. The crew of the ''Redoutable'', which included a strong infantry corps (with three captains and four lieutenants), gathered for an attempt to board and seize the ''Victory''. A [[musket]] bullet fired from the mizzentop of the ''Redoutable'' struck Nelson in the left shoulder and passed through his body lodging in his spine. Nelson exclaimed, \"They finally succeeded, I am dead.\" He was carried below decks and died at about 16:30, as the battle that would make him a legend was ending in favour of the British.\n\n''Victory'' ceased fire, the gunners having been called on the deck to fight the capture but were repelled to the below decks by French grenades. As the French were preparing to board ''Victory'', the ''Temeraire'', the second ship in the British windward column, approached from the starboard bow of the ''Redoutable'' and fired on the exposed French crew with a carronade, causing many casualties.\n\nAt 13:55, [[Jean Jacques Etienne Lucas|Captain Lucas]], of the ''Redoutable'', with 99 fit men out of 643 and severely wounded himself, was forced to surrender. The French ''Bucentaure'' was isolated by the ''Victory'' and ''Temeraire'', and then engaged by ''Neptune'', [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|''Leviathan'']] and ''Conqueror''; similarly, the ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was isolated and overwhelmed without being rescued, surrendering after three hours.\n[[File:Trafalgar2.jpg|thumb|250px|The situation at 17h]]\nAs more and more British ships entered the battle, the ships of the allied centre and rear were gradually overwhelmed. The allied van, after long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration and then sailed away. The British took 22 vessels of the Franco-Spanish fleet and lost none. Among the taken French ships were the [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']], [[French ship Alg\u00e9siras|''Alg\u00e9siras'']], {{HMS|Berwick|1775|2}}, ''Bucentaure'', ''Fougueux'', [[French ship Intr\u00e9pide (1804)|''Intr\u00e9pide'']], ''Redoutable'', and [[French ship Swiftsure|''Swiftsure'']]. The Spanish ships taken were ''Argonauta'', ''Bahama'', ''Monarca'', [[Spanish ship Neptuno (1795)|''Neptuno'']], [[Spanish ship San Agust\u00edn|''San Agust\u00edn'']], ''San Ildefonso'', [[Spanish ship San Juan Nepomuceno|''San Juan Nepomuceno'']], [[Spanish ship Sant\u00edsima Trinidad|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']], and ''Santa Ana''. Of these, ''Redoutable'' sank, ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' and ''Argonauta'' were scuttled by the British and later sank, [[French ship Achille (1803)|''Achille'']] exploded, ''Intr\u00e9pide'' and ''San August\u00edn'' burned, and ''Aigle'', ''Berwick'', ''Fougueux'', and ''Monarca'' were wrecked in a gale following the battle.\n\nAs Nelson lay dying, he ordered the fleet to anchor as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the [[shoals]]. A few of them were recaptured by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews or by ships sallying from C\u00e1diz.\n\n==Battle of Austerlitz==\n[[File:Bivouac on the Eve of the Battle of Austerlitz, 1st December 1805.PNG|thumb|Napoleon with his troops on the eve of battle, questioning local peasants on the movements of the Austro-Russian Army.

On 5 November, they held a successful rearguard action in [[Battle of Amstetten|Amstetten]].  On 7 November, the Russians arrived in [[St. P\u00f6lten]], and then moved across the Danube river the next day. Late on 9 November, they destroyed the bridges across the Danube, holding the last one, at Stein, near [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]], until the late afternoon.<ref>{{in lang|de}} Rainer Egger.

This was a trap on the part of Kutuzov, laid for the sole purpose of convincing Mortier that he had retreated further toward Vienna, when he had actually crossed the Danube in force, and lay concealed behind the ridges above the village. In the ensuing [[Battle of D\u00fcrenstein]], three Russian columns circled around the First Division of the ''Corps Mortier'', and attacked Gazan from both the front and the rear.  Not until Dupont's division arrived, after dark, was Gazan able to start to evacuate his soldiers to the other side of the Danube. Gazan lost close to 40 percent of his division. In addition, 47 officers and 895 men were captured, and he lost five guns, as well as the [[French Imperial Eagle|eagles]] of the 4th Infantry Regiment, and the eagle and [[Heraldic flag|guidon]] of the 4th Dragoons. The Russians also lost around 4,000, about 16 percent of their force, and two regimental colors.<ref>Smith. ''Databook.'' p. 213.</ref> The Austrian Lt.

On 16 November 1805. near Hollabrunn in Lower Austria.  The Russian army of [[Mikhail Kutuzov|Kutuzov]] was retiring north of the [[Danube]] before the French army of [[Napoleon]].\n\nOn 13 November 1805 Marshals [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] and [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]], commanding the French advance guard, had captured a bridge over the Danube at [[Vienna]] by falsely claiming that an [[armistice]] had been signed, and then rushing the bridge while the guards were distracted. Kutuzov needed to gain time in order to make contact near [[Br\u00fcnn]] with reinforcements led by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden|Buxhowden]]. He ordered his rearguard under Major-General Prince [[Pyotr Bagration]] to delay the French.\n\nAfter Hollabrun, the armies gathered on the plains to the east of Brno. Napoleon could muster some 75,000 men and 157 guns for the impending battle, but about 7,000 troops under [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Davout]] were still far to the south in the direction of Vienna.<ref name=\"napoleon\">Uffindell p. 19.</ref> The Allies had about 73,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.<ref name=\"napoleon\"/> On 1 December, both sides occupied their main positions.\n\n===Battlefield===\nThe northern part of the battlefield was dominated by the 700-foot (210-metre) Santon hill and the 850-foot (260-metre) Zuran hill, both overlooking the vital [[Olomouc|Olmutz]]-Brno road that ran across a west-east axis. To the west of these two hills was the village of Bellowitz, and between them the Bosenitz Stream went south to link up with the Goldbach Stream, the latter flowing astride the villages of Kobelnitz, Sokolnitz, and Telnitz. The centerpiece of the entire area were the Pratzen Heights, a gently sloped hill about 35 to 40 feet (11\u201312&nbsp;m) in height. An aide noted that the Emperor repeatedly told his Marshals, \"Gentlemen, examine this ground carefully, it is going to be a battlefield; you will have a part to play upon it\".<ref name=\"quote\">Chandler pp. 412\u2013413.</ref>\n\n===Allied plans and dispositions===\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz, Situation at 1800, 1 December 1805.png|300px|thumb|right|Allied (red) and French (blue) deployments at 1800 hours on 1 December 1805]]\nAn Allied council met on 1 December to discuss proposals for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making contact with the enemy and securing the southern flank that led to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was in a more cautious mood, and he was seconded by Kutuzov, the main Russian commander.<ref name=\"emperor\">Chandler p. 416.</ref> The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted Austrian Chief of Staff Weyrother's plan.<ref name=\"emperor\"/> This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The [[Russian Imperial Guard]] was held in reserve while Russian troops under [[Pyotr Bagration|Bagration]] guarded the Allied right.\n\n===French plans and dispositions===\nDays before any actual fighting, Napoleon had given an impression to the Allies that his army was in a weak state and that he desired a negotiated peace.<ref name=\"peace\">[[#mclynn|McLynn]] p. 342.</ref> In reality, he was hoping that they would attack, and to encourage them on this mission he deliberately weakened his right flank.<ref name=\"flank\">[[#brooks|Brooks]], ed. p. 109.</ref> On 28 November, Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters and they informed him of their qualms and fears about the upcoming battle, even suggesting a retreat, but he shrugged off their complaints and went to work.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 48\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 48.</ref> Napoleon's plan envisioned that the Allies would throw so many troops to envelop his right flank that their centre would be severely weakened. He then counted on a massive French thrust, to be conducted by 16,000 troops of [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Soult]]'s IV Corps, through the centre to cripple the Allied army. Meanwhile, to support his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout's [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] to force march all the way from Vienna and join General Legrand's men, who held the extreme southern flank that would bear the heavy part of the Allied attack. Davout's soldiers had 48 hours to March {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Their arrival would be extremely crucial in determining the success or failure of the French plan. The [[French Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]] and [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]'s I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]] guarded the northern sector of the battle.\n\n===Battle is joined===\nThe battle began around 8 a.m. with the first allied column attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the battlefield witnessed heavy action in the following moments as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them on the other side of the Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by [[hussar]]s and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.<ref name=\"attacks\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nAllied columns started pouring against the French right, but not at the desired speed, so the French were mostly successful in curbing the attacks. In reality, the Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank and in the process they ran into and slowed down part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 48\"/> At the time, the planners thought this was a disaster, but later on it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the lead elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the ''Tirailleurs'', French skirmishers. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful and [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|General Langeron]] ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and around the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended momentarily when [[Louis Friant|Friant]]'s division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most fought over area in the battlefield and would change hands several times as the day progressed.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 49.</ref>\n\n===\"One sharp blow and the war is over\"===\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz - Situation at 0900, 2 December 1805.gif|300px|thumb|right|The decisive attacks on the Allied centre by [[Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire]] and [[Dominique Vandamme|Vandamme]] split the Allied army in two and left the French in a golden strategic position to win the battle.]]\nAround 8:45&nbsp;a.m., finally satisfied at the weakness in the enemy centre, Napoleon asked Soult how long it would take for his men to reach the Pratzen Heights, to which the Marshal replied, \"Less than twenty minutes, sire.\" About 15 minutes later, Napoleon ordered the attack, adding, \"One sharp blow and the war is over.\"<ref name=\"over\">Uffindell p. 21.</ref>\n\nA dense fog helped to cloud the advance of St. Hilaire's division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and encouraged them forward.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\"/> Russian soldiers and commanders on top of the heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them.<ref name=\"stunned\">Chandler p. 425.</ref> Allied commanders were now able to feed some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of horrendous fighting left much of this unit decimated beyond recognition. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers game against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, finally forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, [[Dominique Vandamme|General Vandamme]]'s division attacked an area called Star\u00e9 Vinohrady and through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys broke several Allied battalions.<ref name=\"sun\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe battle had firmly turned to France's favor, but there was still much fighting ahead. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte's I Corps to support Vandamme's left and moved his own command centre from Zuran Hill to St. Anthony's Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The difficult position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the [[Russian Imperial Guard]]; [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]], Tsar Alexander's brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme's section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the loss of the only French standard in the battle (the unfortunate victim was a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry no victor was clear yet. The Russians had a numerical advantage here but fairly soon the tide swung as Drouet's Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The [[horse artillery]] of the Guard also unlimbered a deadly toll on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about a quarter of a mile.<ref name=\"broke\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 51.</ref>\n\n===Endgame===\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz - Situation at 1400, 2 December 1805.gif|300px|thumb|right|By 1400 hours, the Allied army had been dangerously separated. Napoleon now had the option to strike at one of the wings, and he chose the Allied left since other enemy sectors had already been cleared or were conducting fighting retreats.]]\nMeanwhile, the northernmost part of the battlefield was also witnessing heavy fighting. Prince Liechtenstein's heavy cavalry began to assault [[Fran\u00e7ois Etienne de Kellermann|Kellerman]]'s lighter cavalry forces after finally arriving at the correct position in the field. The fighting originally went well for the French, but Kellerman's forces took cover behind General Caffarelli's infantry division once it became clear Russian numbers were too great. Caffarelli's men halted the Russian assaults and permitted [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] to send two cuirassier divisions into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good. The ensuing melee was bitter and long, but the French ultimately prevailed. Lannes then led his V Corps against Bagration's men and after hard fighting managed to drive the skilled Russian commander off the field. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector in the battlefield, was against the idea.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 52.</ref>\n\nNapoleon's focus now shifted towards the southern end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz and persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, generals [[Kienmayer]] and Langeron, to flee as fast as they could. [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden|Buxhowden]], the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O'Reilly light cavalry, who gallantly managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\"/>\n\nGeneral panic now seized the Allied army and it abandoned the field in any and all possible directions. Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. According to popular myth, the French artillery pounded towards the men, but Napoleon redirected his gunners to fire at the ice. The men drowned in the viciously cold ponds, dozens of artillery pieces going down along with them. Estimates on how many guns were captured differ; there may have been as few as 38 or as many as over 100. Sources also differ on casualties, with figures ranging from as few as 200 to as many as 2,000 dead. Because Napoleon exaggerated this incident in his report of the battle, the low numbers may be more accurate, although doubt remains as to whether they are fully correct. Many regard this incident as one of Napoleon's cruelest acts in war.<ref name=\"ice\">Chandler p. 432.</ref> However, only a few bodies are reported to have been found in the spring of 1806, and it is most likely the incident is a myth.<ref>Spring, Laurence, \"Russian Grenadiers and Infantry, 1799-1815\", Osprey Publishing 2002</ref>\n\n== Italian Campaigns ==\n=== Venetian front or Italian campaign of 1805 ===\nMeanwhile, in Italy, The Austrian ''[[Armee von Italien]]'' under [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] fought against the French ''[[Army of Italy (France)|Arm\u00e9e d'italie]]'' under [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na|Marshal Mass\u00e9na]]. The French managed to gain a bridgehead over the [[Adige|Adige river]] at [[Battle of Verona (1805)|Verona]] on 18 October, and finally, between 29 and 31 October, the outnumbered French defeated the superior Austrian army in the [[Battle of Caldiero (1805)|battle of Caldiero]]. In November the Austrians retreated, engaging the French vanguard of [[Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne|d'Espagne]] in several rear-guard actions. Venice was blockaded by French and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian]] troops under [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr|St.Cyr]]. Charles' army finally crossed the [[Isonzo river|Isonzo]] on 14 November, preventing the French from crossing it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=NAPOLEON'S ITALIAN CAMPAIGNS 1805-1815|last=Schneid|first=Frederick|publisher=Praeger|year=2002|isbn=0-275-96875-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:Bataille de Caldiero, 30 octobre 1805.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Caldiero (1805)|Battle of Caldiero]], 1805]]\nOne 4,400-strong Habsburg army that lingered behind, was roundly defeated and captured by [[Jean Reynier]] and [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr]] at the [[Battle of Castelfranco Veneto]] on 24 November 1805.\n\n=== Anglo-Russian occupation of Naples ===\n{{Main|Anglo-Russian occupation of Naples}}\nThe French force under St. Cyr then manoeuvred on the frontier of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The French were being carefully watched by an Anglo-Russian force entrusted with defence of the kingdom. After the Battle of Austerlitz, the Russians withdrew from Italy and the British, unwilling to defend Naples alone, evacuated the mainland altogether and retreated back to [[Sicily]]. Meanwhile, the French force, now stationed in [[Bologna]], was reorganised into the Army of Naples and placed under the nominal command of Napoleon's brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. However, the de facto commander was [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], who commanded the I Corps and was entrusted with the invasion by Joseph.\n\n=== French invasion of Naples ===\n{{Main|Invasion of Naples (1806)}}\nOn 9 February 1806, Mass\u00e9na invaded the Kingdom of Naples and two days later, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king of Naples, [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] also fled to Sicily, protected by the British fleet. Naples soon fell into French hands and by the end of February, only two places in the kingdom still held out. One was the fortress city of [[Gaeta]], north of Naples, and the other was [[Calabria]] in the very south of Italy, which was where the remainder of the Royal Neapolitan Army was stationed.\n\nFerdinand had hoped for a repeat of the events of 1799, when a popular uprising in Calabria eventually caused the downfall of the [[Parthenopaean Republic]], a French client state created after the Neapolitans were defeated the first time during the [[War of the Second Coalition]]. However, no such rebellion initially occurred and on 3 March, General [[Jean Reynier]], who commanded the 10,000 strong II Corps of the Army of Naples invaded Calabria. Only a few Calabrians resisted the invading French force and the Royal Neapolitan Army was soundly defeated at the [[Battle of Campo Tenese]] on 10 March 1806. Ferdinand now had no choice but to concede the Neapolitan throne to the French. A day after Campo Tenese, Joseph was installed as the new King of Naples. By now, the last regular troops of the Neapolitan army had fled to Sicily and the French controlled the entire Italian mainland except for the fortress of Gaeta, which had been [[Siege of Gaeta (1806)|under siege]] since 26 February.<ref name=\"calabria\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1987151 |last=Finley |first=Milton C.

Supply problems meant that Reynier's II Corps in Calabria was forced to live off the land. For over a month, the peasants of the region had supported the Neapolitan army and were close to starvation. Joseph seemed unaware of the problems and the potential dangers of revolt. Consequently, no extra provisions were sent to the south of Italy. Reynier took the initiative and seized supplies from the local populace, leading predictably to a revolt by the end of March. What started as small bands of partisans eventually expanded into entire villages rising up against the French. With the fortress of Gaeta still holding out, Joseph was unable to send more troops to Calabria, forcing Reynier to reinforce his army with native troops recruited from the larger towns and cities.<ref name=\"calabria\"/>\n\nBy July, Mass\u00e9na had still failed to take Gaeta due to poor logistical management of the French artillery, slight reinforcements from the British by sea and a series of successful sorties by the Neapolitan garrison against the French sappers. With only Reynier's small force in Calabria still struggling against the revolt, the British organised an expeditionary force under [[John Stuart, Count of Maida|Sir John Stuart]] to prevent any potential invasion of Sicily and perhaps to trigger a full-scale rebellion against the French across Italy. Although there were early successes for the British, in particular at [[Battle of Maida|Maida]], the British failed to either reinforce Stuart's expedition or attempt to relieve the Siege of Gaeta. With the French artillery finally able to bombard the walls with their full potential, the Neapolitans eventually surrendered on 18 July, freeing Mass\u00e9na's I Corps.<ref name=\"massena\">[[#masskoch|Mass\u00e9na & Koch]], pp. 194\u2013251.</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Mass\u00e9na was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Mass\u00e9na had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the [[Peninsular War]].\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Napoleonic Wars War of the Third Coalition.png|thumb|340px|All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition. <span style=\"color:Blue;\">Blue</span>: The Coalition and their colonies and allies. <span style=\"color:Green;\">Green</span>: The [[First French Empire]], its protectorates, colonies and allies.]]\nAusterlitz and the preceding campaign profoundly altered the nature of European politics. In three months, the French had occupied Vienna, decimated two armies, and humbled the Austrian Empire. These events sharply contrast with the rigid power structures of the 18th century, when no major European capital was ever held by an enemy army. Austerlitz set the stage for a near-decade of French domination on the European continent, but one of its more immediate impacts was to goad Prussia into [[War of the Fourth Coalition|war in 1806]].\n\nFrance and Austria signed a truce on 4 December and the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] 22 days later took the latter out of the war. Austria agreed to recognize French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lun\u00e9ville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, [[Kingdom of Wuerttemberg|Wurttemberg]], and [[History of Baden|Baden]], which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities. [[Veneto|Venetia]] was also given to the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French encamped themselves in Southern Germany. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was also effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, [[Joachim Murat]] became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the [[Strait of Sicily]], which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n===Casualties and losses===\nThe French lost 12,000 killed, 22,200 wounded and 5,000 captured in 1805, including 5,300 killed and 22,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign against the Habsburgs and Russians, 2,100 killed and 5,300 wounded in the Italian Campaign, 4,300 killed and 3,700 wounded in the naval war, 200 killed and 400 wounded in the colonies and 100 killed and 400 wounded in coastal defense duties.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=43}}{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=128}} The 1806 Naples Campaign cost the French 1,500 killed and 5,000 wounded.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=128}} The Spanish suffered 1,200 killed and 1,600 wounded in the naval war, Bavaria sustained 300 killed and 1,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign and the Kingdom of Italy lost 100 killed and 400 wounded in the Italian Campaign and 250 killed and 1,500 wounded in the Naples Campaign.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=128}}\n\nThe Austrians lost 20,000 killed and wounded and 70,000 as prisoners.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=43}} Russian casualties were 25,000 killed and wounded and 25,000 captured.{{sfn|Bodart|1916|p=43}} The Neapolitan army of 22,000 was wiped out by the French in 1806, with only 2,000 evacuated to Sicily.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bodart |first=G. |title=Losses of Life in Modern Wars, Austria-Hungary; France |year=1916 |isbn=978-1371465520 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Brooks |editor-first=Richard |year=2000 |title=Atlas of World Military History |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-7607-2025-8 |ref=brooks }}\n* {{cite book |last=Chandler |first=David G. |authorlink=David G.
