Commissioned in 1901 by the [[Newcastle upon Tyne Electric Supply Company]], the station was the first in the world to provide electricity for purposes other than domestic and street lighting. It was also the first in the world to generate electricity using [[three-phase]] [[electrical power distribution]] at a voltage of 5,500&nbsp;[[volts]].\n\nThe station had an initial generating capacity of 2,800&nbsp;kW, which was increased to 3,000&nbsp;kW a year after the station opened, with the introduction of two 1,500&nbsp;kW [[C. A. Parsons and Company|Parsons]] turbo alternators, the largest ever built at that time. The station closed in 1915, following the completion of an extension to [[Carville Power Station]] and the opening of [[Dunston Power Station]].\n\n==History==\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the use of electricity for general purposes began to be considered, and the [[Newcastle upon Tyne Electric Supply Company]] (NESCo) realised the potential it offered for development.<ref name=NESCO_hist /> In June 1899, the Walker and Wallsend Union Gas Company (WWUGC) acquired Parliamentary powers for the supply of electricity to the area around [[Wallsend]]. In January 1900 they erected Neptune Bank power station near the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway's]] (NER) [[North Tyneside Loop]], midway between Wallsend and [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Walker]]. In October 1900, NESCo acquired the entire power station from the WWUGC, with the exception of the cables and sub-station machinery installed for the purpose of supplying the works in the area in which the WWUGC had obtained Parliamentary powers. the WWUGC continued to buy electricity in bulk from NESCo.<ref name=mining_eng1>{{cite web\n|url         = https://archive.org/stream/miningengineer07goog/miningengineer07goog_djvu.txt\n|title       = Full text of \"The Mining engineer\"\n|work        = archive.org\n|accessdate  = 9 August 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nThe station was officially opened on 18 June 1901 by [[Lord Kelvin]]. At the opening he said:\n\n<blockquote>''\"We have seen at work what many have not seen before - a system realised in which a central station generates power by steam engines and delivers electricity to consumers at distances varying, I think, from a quarter of a mile to over three and a half miles...

This project was driven by the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC), a Commonwealth [[statutory authority]] formed as a result of intergovernmental agreements entered into by the Commonwealth, States and Territories.   Ian Shepherd described the Commission and its processes in the following terms\u2014\n\n::\"The agreements commit each of the 9 jurisdictions to work together in the interests of reforming road transport for the operation of both heavy and light vehicles.  The Act which arose as a result of those agreements established the Commission and its objectives.  In broad terms, the NRTC seeks to develop national policies, procedures and laws to achieve four main things.  These are:\n::\u2022\timproved transport productivity\n::\u2022\timproved safety\n::\u2022\ta cleaner environment\n::\u2022\tlower administration costs.\n\n::An important part of the Commission\u2019s role is to establish a uniform or consistent regulatory environment for road transport across the whole nation.  As an example, the dangerous goods industry is a national one.  The NRTC was established to help it operate like one, unencumbered by differing jurisdictional requirements that stifle efficiency and productivity and potentially compromise safety and the environment.\"<ref>Ian Shepherd, ''Dangerous Goods Transport Reform in Australia: Putting the Acid on those Responsible'', National Road Transport Commission, March 1998, page 1.  Retrieved from www.ntc.gov.au 14 January 2012.</ref>\n\n=== The New Legislative Framework ===\nThe work of the NRTC and the Commonwealth and States and Territories led to major reform of the regulation of the transport of dangerous goods in Australia.  The new framework consisted of a national Act - the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995, national regulations - the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Regulations 1997 and a new version - the sixth edition - of the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail.\n\n==== The Act ====\nThe Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act provided for\u2014\n\n::\"\u2022\tthe appointment of a Competent Authority to administer and enforce the legislation;\n:: \u2022\tthe power for Regulations to be made setting out detailed matters including the identification of what \u201cdangerous goods\u201d come within the scope of the national regulatory regime;\n:: \u2022\tpowers of authorised officers (e.g. stopping and searching vehicles, searching premises, etc);\n:: \u2022\tvery serious offences such as endangering public safety and transporting on an unlicensed vehicle which can attract penalties of up to $500,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 4 years;\n:: \u2022\tthe ability to be exempted from the regulations; and\n:: \u2022\ta power for a court to exclude a person from being involved in transporting dangerous goods by road.\"<ref>Ian Shepherd, ''Dangerous Goods Transport Reform in Australia: Putting the Acid on those Responsible'', National Road Transport Commission, March 1998, page 4.

A prime difference between the 6th and 5th editions of the Code is that the new Code no longer sets out the obligations and duties of the various persons involved in the transport of dangerous goods.  Those are now set out in the Regulations.  The Code is now a purely technical document.  However, it should be read with the Regulations.  In broad terms, the Regulations establish duties of various parties while the Code sets out the technical standards and procedures.  The two documents are structurally harmonised.  Part 3 of the Regulations deals with packaging and the corresponding technical requirements to meet the duties of those Regulations in Part 3 of the Code.  An important feature of the Code is that it ensures Australia\u2019s technical requirements for the road transport of dangerous goods are generally consistent with the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.\"<ref>Ian Shepherd, ''Dangerous Goods Transport Reform in Australia: Putting the Acid on those Responsible'', National Road Transport Commission, March 1998, page 5.  Retrieved from www.ntc.gov.au 14 January 2012</ref>\n\n==== Chain of responsibility ====\nThe 1997 legislative framework was notable for introducing the [[chain of responsibility]] concept into Australian transport law.  The concept involves the design of policy and law which allocates responsibility under threat of criminal sanction to those persons who are in the best position to prevent and manage risks.  Its introduction into the dangerous goods framework was described as follows\u2014\n\n::\"A common criticism of the previous regulatory system for the transport of dangerous goods by road was that it was often unclear who was responsible for a particular aspect of a dangerous goods transport movement.  Duties were imposed on a number of people without any attempt to ascertain who was in the best position to control the aspect of the transport movement which underlay the duty.  And, as has often been the case in road transport law and practice, the old regime put too many duties on the easiest target \u2013 the driver of the truck carrying the goods.\n\n::The NRTC is a strong advocate of the concept of chain of responsibility.  Under this concept, when a law is framed and when it is enforced it should seek to target or enable the prosecution of the person who is truly responsible for the offending conduct.  In many cases, this may not be the driver of a road vehicle.\n\n::Accordingly, in framing the Regulations the Commission examined all aspects of transporting dangerous goods by road and allocated legal responsibility appropriately.  One of the major parties targeted for particular duties and associated offences is the prime contractor who is broadly responsible under the legislation for the condition of the goods consigned and the provision of appropriate information.  Drivers too are legally responsible for the control of the vehicle.  Similarly, other parties are also singled out and made accountable under the law where appropriate.  Examples of other parties given duties under the legislation are owners, importers, manufacturers, occupiers, loaders and so on.\n\n::The end result is that the prosecution net is spread much wider, certainly beyond drivers.  The ability to seek out actual wrongdoers other than truck drivers is a key feature of the Commission\u2019s work and one that we have pioneered in Australian transport law.\"<ref>Ian Shepherd, ''Dangerous Goods Transport Reform in Australia: Putting the Acid on those Responsible'', National Road Transport Commission, March 1998, pages 5-6.

There are a total of fourteen colleges that use the title of Institute of Technology, which were created from the late 1960s and were formerly known as '''Regional Technical Colleges'''. The exception to this was [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] which emerged independently of the Regional College system.\n\n== Creation ==\nThe idea of the institutions was first announced by [[Patrick Hillery]] in 1963.<ref>O'Buachalla, S. (1988). Education Policy in Twentieth Century Ireland, Wolfhound Press, Dublin</ref> A year later, a site for an institution in [[Carlow]] was identified.<ref>Mulcahy, D.G. (1981). Curriculum and Policy in Irish Post Primary Education, Institute of Public Administration, Dublin</ref>\n\nThe ''Investment in Education'' (1962) and ''Training of Technicians in Ireland'' (1964) reports greatly accelerated the trend in Ireland for education reform and development particularly in technical education, similar to that in other Western countries at the time.\n\nThe ''Training of Technicians in Ireland'' (1964) report identified significant skills gaps, including:<ref>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris</ref>\n\n:''a further serious difficulty in the task of raising the standards of technicians in Ireland is the lack of a nationally recognised technician diploma. The absence of such a diploma deters many parents from considering sub-professional technician careers for their children''\n\nThe ''Steering Committee on Technical Education'', also called ''The Mulcahy Report'' (1967), was an important milestone in framing the institutional structures and functions calling for:<ref>Steering Committee on Technical Education, Report to the Minister for Education</ref>\n\n:''we believe that the long-term function of the colleges will be to educate for trade and industry over a broad spectrum of occupations ranging from craft to professional, notably in engineering and science but also in commercial, linguistic and other specialities. They will, however, be more immediately concerned with providing courses aimed at filling gaps in the industrial manpower structure, particularly in the technician area''\n\n:''we do not foresee any final fixed pattern of courses in the colleges. If they are to make their most effective contribution to the needs of society and the economy, they must be capable of continuing adaptation to social, economic and technological changes. Initiative at local and national levels will largely determine how far this vital characteristic is developed. We are concerned that the progress of these colleges should not be deterred by any artificial limitation of either the scope or the level of their educational achievements''\n\nThe building programme commenced in 1968, with the first institutions formally opened their doors in 1970, and other colleges were added during the following decade. Some colleges developed from earlier institutions and colleges, involving amalgamation, but most were completely new institutions. A Regional Technical College for Limerick was cancelled after a ''[[National Institute for Higher Education]]'' was announced for the city. Finally, in 1993, CoACT (College of Art, Commerce and Technology) became Limerick RTC. Two additional institutions were created since then, bringing the total to thirteen, before the amalgamation of three into Ireland's first [[#Technological Universities|Technological University]], [[TU Dublin]], reducing the total to eleven.<ref name= \"TUD opening\">{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101161550/https://www.rte.ie/news/education/2019/0101/1019803-tu-dublin-merger/ |archivedate=1 January 2019 |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/education/2019/0101/1019803-tu-dublin-merger |title=TU Dublin now Ireland's largest institution as ITs merge |date=1 Jan 2019 |website=[[RT\u00c9.ie]]}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Abbreviation\n! scope=\"col\" | First Established\n! scope=\"col\" | Technological University (including proposed)<ref name= \"HEA TUs\">{{cite news |url=http://hea.ie/policy/he-reform/technological-universities/ |title=New Technological Universities will be created under the reforms set out in Ireland\u2019s National Strategy for Higher Education |website=[[Higher Education Authority]]}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Year amalgamated into TU\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Athlone\" | [[Athlone Institute of Technology]]\n| AIT\n| 1970\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Blanchardstown\" | [[Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown]]\n| ITB\n| 2000\n| TU Dublin\n| 2019\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Carlow\" | [[Institute of Technology, Carlow]]\n| ITC\n| 1970\n| TUSE\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Cork\" | [[Cork Institute of Technology]]\n| CIT\n| 1974\n| MTU\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Dublin\" | ''[[Dublin Institute of Technology]]\u2020''\n| DIT\n| 1887\n| TU Dublin\n| 2019\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Dundalk\" | [[Dundalk Institute of Technology]]\n| DkIT\n| 1970\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"D\u00fan Laoghaire\" | [[D\u00fan Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology]]\n| IADT\n| 1997\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Galway Mayo\" | [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]]\n| GMIT\n| 1972\n| CUA\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Letterkenny\" | [[Letterkenny Institute of Technology]]\n| LYIT\n| 1971\n| CUA\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Limerick\" | ''[[Limerick Institute of Technology]]*''\n| LIT\n| 1852\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Sligo\" | [[Institute of Technology, Sligo]]\n| ITS\n| 1970\n| CUA\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Tallaght\" | [[Institute of Technology, Tallaght]]\n| ITT Dublin\n| 1992\n| TU Dublin\n| 2019\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Tralee\" | [[Institute of Technology, Tralee]]\n| IT Tralee\n| 1977\n| MTU\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Waterford\" | [[Waterford Institute of Technology]]\n| WIT\n| 1970\n| TUSE\n| \n|-\n|}\n\n''\u2020With the constituent Colleges originally established in 1887, Dublin Institute of Technology was reestablished in 1992. It was the first third level college to be called an Institute of Technology and was created under separate legislation with different powers than the other thirteen colleges. This includes the awarding of its own degrees up to doctorate level.''\n\n''*LIT traces its roots back to the 1852 foundation of the School of Ornamental Art on Leamy Street. For much of the history of the institute, it was constituted as the Municipal Technical Institute, before becoming the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology (Limerick CoACT) in 1980, a Regional Technical College in 1993 and an Institute of Technology in 1997.''\n\n== Legislation ==\n\nThe institutions were run under Section 21 (2) of the ''Vocational Education Acts'' from 1970 until 1992 as special subcommittees of the [[Vocational Education Committee]]s, and placed on an independent basis thereafter by the ''Regional Technical Colleges Acts'' in 1993. In the late 1990s, all of the institutions were upgraded to ''Institute of Technology'' status. This was in recognition of the high standards, including university level research, which takes place at them. Additionally institutions have been given ''delegated authority'' to confer their own awards in some cases up to [[Doctoral degree|Doctoral]] level.<ref>[http://www.hetac.ie/validation_del.htm HETAC &raquo; Higher Education & Training Awards Council | Validation | Delegated Authority]</ref> The ''Regional Technical Colleges Acts'' still apply to all the institutions, with [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] set up under previous legislation and been quite distinct.\n\nThe Institutes of Technology Act 2006 will further amend the law with respect to the institutions.\n\n== Management ==\n\nThe individual institutions are structured similar to other universities, particularly Irish ones. Each institution has a Director, who is the chief operational officer of the institution, usually assisted by an ''ad-hoc'' senior management team; a Registrar, who is the chief academic officer of the institution; a Governing Council, which oversees operational affairs; an Academic Council, which oversees academic affairs. Each academic school has a Head of School and each academic department of a school has a Head of Department.\n\n== Programmes ==\n\nThe institutions traditional courses were [[National Certificate]] and [[National Diploma (Ireland)|National Diploma]] type courses particularly in business, engineering and science, this was very much the founding principle. During the late 1970s degrees at [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] level were introduced, later [[Master's degree|Master's]] and [[Doctoral degree|Doctoral]] levels were also allowed. In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in [[apprenticeship]] and [[nursing]] type courses.\n\n== Validation ==\nTraditionally awards were conferred by the ''National Council for Educational Awards'', this [[statutory authority]] became the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]], and other awards are conferred by the [[Further Education and Training Awards Council]]. Some specialised courses, such as [[accountancy]], are validated by [[professional bodies]] but these are nearly always the exception.\n\n==Technological Universities==\nA Technological University is

Initiative at local and national levels will largely determine how far this vital characteristic is developed. We are concerned that the progress of these colleges should not be deterred by any artificial limitation of either the scope or the level of their educational achievements''\n\nThe building programme commenced in 1968, with the first institutions formally opened their doors in 1970, and other colleges were added during the following decade. Some colleges developed from earlier institutions and colleges, involving amalgamation, but most were completely new institutions. A Regional Technical College for Limerick was cancelled after a ''[[National Institute for Higher Education]]'' was announced for the city. Finally, in 1993, CoACT (College of Art, Commerce and Technology) became Limerick RTC. Two additional institutions were created since then, bringing the total to thirteen, before the amalgamation of three into Ireland's first [[#Technological Universities|Technological University]], [[TU Dublin]], reducing the total to eleven.<ref name= \"TUD opening\">{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101161550/https://www.rte.ie/news/education/2019/0101/1019803-tu-dublin-merger/ |archivedate=1 January 2019 |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/education/2019/0101/1019803-tu-dublin-merger |title=TU Dublin now Ireland's largest institution as ITs merge |date=1 Jan 2019 |website=[[RT\u00c9.ie]]}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Abbreviation\n! scope=\"col\" | First Established\n! scope=\"col\" | Technological University (including proposed)<ref name= \"HEA TUs\">{{cite news |url=http://hea.ie/policy/he-reform/technological-universities/ |title=New Technological Universities will be created under the reforms set out in Ireland\u2019s National Strategy for Higher Education |website=[[Higher Education Authority]]}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Year amalgamated into TU\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Athlone\" | [[Athlone Institute of Technology]]\n| AIT\n| 1970\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Blanchardstown\" | [[Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown]]\n| ITB\n| 2000\n| TU Dublin\n| 2019\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Carlow\" | [[Institute of Technology, Carlow]]\n| ITC\n| 1970\n| TUSE\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Cork\" | [[Cork Institute of Technology]]\n| CIT\n| 1974\n| MTU\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Dublin\" | ''[[Dublin Institute of Technology]]\u2020''\n| DIT\n| 1887\n| TU Dublin\n| 2019\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Dundalk\" | [[Dundalk Institute of Technology]]\n| DkIT\n| 1970\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"D\u00fan Laoghaire\" | [[D\u00fan Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology]]\n| IADT\n| 1997\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Galway Mayo\" | [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]]\n| GMIT\n| 1972\n| CUA\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Letterkenny\" | [[Letterkenny Institute of Technology]]\n| LYIT\n| 1971\n| CUA\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Limerick\" | ''[[Limerick Institute of Technology]]*''\n| LIT\n| 1852\n| \n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Sligo\" | [[Institute of Technology, Sligo]]\n| ITS\n| 1970\n| CUA\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Tallaght\" | [[Institute of Technology, Tallaght]]\n| ITT Dublin\n| 1992\n| TU Dublin\n| 2019\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Tralee\" | [[Institute of Technology, Tralee]]\n| IT Tralee\n| 1977\n| MTU\n| \n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Waterford\" | [[Waterford Institute of Technology]]\n| WIT\n| 1970\n| TUSE\n| \n|-\n|}\n\n''\u2020With the constituent Colleges originally established in 1887, Dublin Institute of Technology was reestablished in 1992. It was the first third level college to be called an Institute of Technology and was created under separate legislation with different powers than the other thirteen colleges. This includes the awarding of its own degrees up to doctorate level.''\n\n''*LIT traces its roots back to the 1852 foundation of the School of Ornamental Art on Leamy Street. For much of the history of the institute, it was constituted as the Municipal Technical Institute, before becoming the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology (Limerick CoACT) in 1980, a Regional Technical College in 1993 and an Institute of Technology in 1997.''\n\n== Legislation ==\n\nThe institutions were run under Section 21 (2) of the ''Vocational Education Acts'' from 1970 until 1992 as special subcommittees of the [[Vocational Education Committee]]s, and placed on an independent basis thereafter by the ''Regional Technical Colleges Acts'' in 1993. In the late 1990s, all of the institutions were upgraded to ''Institute of Technology'' status. This was in recognition of the high standards, including university level research, which takes place at them. Additionally institutions have been given ''delegated authority'' to confer their own awards in some cases up to [[Doctoral degree|Doctoral]] level.<ref>[http://www.hetac.ie/validation_del.htm HETAC &raquo; Higher Education & Training Awards Council | Validation | Delegated Authority]</ref> The ''Regional Technical Colleges Acts'' still apply to all the institutions, with [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] set up under previous legislation and been quite distinct.\n\nThe Institutes of Technology Act 2006 will further amend the law with respect to the institutions.\n\n== Management ==\n\nThe individual institutions are structured similar to other universities, particularly Irish ones. Each institution has a Director, who is the chief operational officer of the institution, usually assisted by an ''ad-hoc'' senior management team; a Registrar, who is the chief academic officer of the institution; a Governing Council, which oversees operational affairs; an Academic Council, which oversees academic affairs. Each academic school has a Head of School and each academic department of a school has a Head of Department.\n\n== Programmes ==\n\nThe institutions traditional courses were [[National Certificate]] and [[National Diploma (Ireland)|National Diploma]] type courses particularly in business, engineering and science, this was very much the founding principle. During the late 1970s degrees at [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] level were introduced, later [[Master's degree|Master's]] and [[Doctoral degree|Doctoral]] levels were also allowed. In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in [[apprenticeship]] and [[nursing]] type courses.\n\n== Validation ==\nTraditionally awards were conferred by the ''National Council for Educational Awards'', this statutory authority became the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]], and other awards are conferred by the [[Further Education and Training Awards Council]]. Some specialised courses, such as [[accountancy]], are validated by [[professional bodies]] but these are nearly always the exception.\n\n==Technological Universities==\nA Technological University is

It is made up of a variety of different departments, including:\n*Fundraising\n*Safeguarding\n*Finance\n*Training\n*Communications\n*Events\n\n===Area level===\n[[File:Home of the Sea Cadet Corps, Fishguard - geograph.org.uk - 1511153.jpg|thumb|Sea Cadets, Fishguard]]\nThe country is divided into six areas, which are: \n* Eastern (including [[Malta]])\n* Northern (including [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Bermuda]])\n* Southern (including the [[Channel Islands]] & [[Falkland Islands]])\n* North West (including the [[Isle of Man]])\n* London \n* South West\n\nEach area is run by an Area Officer (AO) with a small team of support staff.\n\n===District level===\nEach area is subdivided into districts of between five and twelve units which are led by volunteers.\n\n===Unit level===\nEach unit is led by a Commanding Officer (CO) or Officer-in-Charge (OiC). Some units also have a Royal Marines Cadets Detachment, headed by a detachment commander (DC).\n\nVolunteers fulfil roles such as watersports instructors, fundraisers, administrative staff, etc. Sea Cadets has both uniformed adult volunteers and non-uniformed adult volunteers.<ref>https://www.sea-cadets.org/volunteer</ref>\n\n==Training==\n[[File:Sea Cadet Junior Cadet.jpg|thumb|A Cadet 1st Class in No.1 Uniform]]\n\n===Cadet Training Programme===\nCadets follow the Cadet Training Programme (CTP) which covers various water based activities and skills as well as [[first aid]] and leadership. Royal Marine Cadets also complete the CTP but have additional elements such as campcraft amongst others.\n\n===Specialisation and proficiency training===\nSkills learned in a cadet's time in the SCC usually fall into one of two categories - Specialisations and Proficiencies. Specialisations are often larger subjects than proficiencies, and so are split into three levels; Basic, Intermediate and Advanced, each level increasing in difficulty building on the knowledge gained from the prior levels. Basic specialisations are often gained at the unit during regular training, while Intermediate and Advanced awards are held on an Area or National basis. Proficiencies do not usually have a levelling system, though some subjects such as Piping do contain a Basic/Intermediate level.\n\nSome specialisations, such as Marine Engineering, are also divided into disciplines such as Electrical and Mechanical engineering.\n\nAll of the following are on offer to cadets, either at the unit or on district/area/national courses. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The BTECs are offered by [[CVQO]], and include Teamwork and Personal Development in the Community (formerly Public Service), Music, and Engineering.\n\nMany qualifications are run by the Sea Cadets but regulated by external bodies. In these cases, cadets earn independent qualifications that are recognised outside the Corps. These include Paddlesport, where they can gain PaddlePower or Star Awards through [[British Canoeing]] (formerly known as BCU), First Aid, where they can earn [[St John Ambulance (England)|St John Ambulance]] First Aid certifications, Rowing, where they can earn [[British Rowing]] (BR) qualifications and Powerboating/Sailing/Windsurfing/Navigation where they can gain [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA) qualifications. National courses are also held, often on Royal Navy bases, to teach skills such as leadership and teamwork. Specialist qualification courses include power boating in Scotland, cooking in Preston, and fire fighting in Cornwall. There are competitions at varying levels in many of the sports, proficiencies, and specializations of the SCC. Competitions start at a District level and progress through to National level.\n\n==Ranks and rates==\n{{see also|Ranks of the cadet forces of the United Kingdom}}\n\n===Cadets===\nFrom New Entry through to Able Cadet, Sea Cadets are promoted based on their completion of various task-based modules under the CTP - Cadet Training Programme. Leading Cadets and Petty Officer Cadets are required to attend and pass a promotion board (held at area or national level) before being promoted.\n\nThe ranks of Marine Cadet 2nd Class (MC2) and Marine Cadet 1st Class (MC1) were phased out at the end of 2018.\n\nAll Royal Marines Cadets are required to complete boards for each promotion. The higher the board the higher the level the board is run at. The former promotions from Marine Cadet to Marine Cadet 2nd Class and to Marine Cadet 1st Class were run at detachment level. Marine Cadet to Lance Corporal boards are at [[troop]] or [[Company (military unit)|company]] level, Lance Corporal to Corporal boards are at company level, and Corporal to Sergeant boards are at a national level. All promotions boards have multiple sections all of which must be passed individually.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Cadet ranks and insignia\n| {{Ranks and Insignia of UK/CDT/SCC/RM/ALL}}\n|}\n\nAt the discretion of the commanding officer of a unit, or district officer, a cadet may be awarded an acting rate if they have completed the majority of the modules required for promotion, or received a partial pass on their promotion board, for example ''Acting Leading Cadet'' (ALC), or ''Acting Petty Officer Cadet'' (APOC). \n[[File:Sea_Cadets_Junior_Summer_Camp.jpg|thumb|Junior sea cadets at their annual summer camp, 2016]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Junior Sea Cadets\n!(Abbr)\n|-\n|Junior Cadet\n|JC\n|-\n|Junior Cadet First Class\n|JCFC\n|-\n|Able Junior Cadet\n|AJC\n|-\n|Leading Junior Cadet\n|LJC\n|}\n\n===Adult officers===\nThe following rates and ranks can be awarded to uniformed adult volunteers, there are also Non uniformed Civilian Instructors (CIs) and Unit Assistants (UAs).

Sea Cadet voyages normally last for 1 week, with cadets gaining RYA qualifications for their voyage. Individual Sea Cadet units also have various boats including MOD motor boats such as Vikings, Champs, Dories, [[Dinghy|dinghies]] called the ASC ([[ASC (dinghy)|Admiralty Sailing Craft]]) and Bosuns, in addition to vessels designed specifically for the SCC such as the Trinity 500 rowing boat and RS ''Quest'' dinghy.

The boat has also been approved by British Rowing, to allow for the delivery of their Explore Rowing Scheme. The boat was designed by [[Jo Richards]], Olympic medallist and designer of a wide range of craft, in response to the requirement of the Sea Cadets for a modern, low maintenance, purpose-designed fixed seat rowing boat with good performance under oars and with the capacity to mount a small outboard motor. The Trinity 500 is named to mark the quincentenary of the incorporation of [[Trinity House]], the [[statutory authority]] for aids to navigation in England, Wales, The Channel Islands and Gibraltar. The Trinity House Maritime Charity, a separately funded arm of the Corporation of Trinity House generously funded the design and development costs of the boat.\n\n===RS dinghies===\nIn a partnership between [[RS Sailing]] and the Sea Cadets, a new dinghy known as the RS ''Quest'' was designed by Jo Richards, who is also responsible for formulating the design for the Trinity 500 rowing vessel. The RS ''Quest'' was designed to accommodate the need for a new sailing dinghy within the SCC that is strong and easy to maintain which is capable of comfortably accommodating an instructor and up to three cadets. The RS ''Quest'' was unveiled at the Southampton Boat Show in 2015.\n*Continuing the partnership between MSSC and RS Sailing, the single sail RS ''Zest'' dinghy was launched at the 2017 Southampton Boat Show. It is intended for a crew of two, but can be sailed single-handed. It is aimed at benefiting units with limited access to water, as RS ''Zest'' can operate in shallower water than the RS ''Quest''.\n\n== Investigation into sexual abuse ==\n \nIn 2012 payouts made to victims of sexual abuse across all Cadet Forces totaled \u00a31,475,844.

Proficiencies do not usually have a levelling system, though some subjects such as Piping do contain a Basic/Intermediate level.\n\nSome specialisations, such as Marine Engineering, are also divided into disciplines such as Electrical and Mechanical engineering.\n\nAll of the following are on offer to cadets, either at the unit or on district/area/national courses. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The BTECs are offered by [[CVQO]], and include Teamwork and Personal Development in the Community (formerly Public Service), Music, and Engineering.\n\nMany qualifications are run by the Sea Cadets but regulated by external bodies. In these cases, cadets earn independent qualifications that are recognised outside the Corps. These include Paddlesport, where they can gain PaddlePower or Star Awards through [[British Canoeing]] (formerly known as BCU), First Aid, where they can earn [[St John Ambulance (England)|St John Ambulance]] First Aid certifications, Rowing, where they can earn [[British Rowing]] (BR) qualifications and Powerboating/Sailing/Windsurfing/Navigation where they can gain [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA) qualifications. National courses are also held, often on Royal Navy bases, to teach skills such as leadership and teamwork. Specialist qualification courses include power boating in Scotland, cooking in Preston, and fire fighting in Cornwall. There are competitions at varying levels in many of the sports, proficiencies, and specializations of the SCC. Competitions start at a District level and progress through to National level.\n\n==Ranks and rates==\n{{see also|Ranks of the cadet forces of the United Kingdom}}\n\n===Cadets===\nFrom New Entry through to Able Cadet, Sea Cadets are promoted based on their completion of various task-based modules under the CTP - Cadet Training Programme. Leading Cadets and Petty Officer Cadets are required to attend and pass a promotion board (held at area or national level) before being promoted.\n\nThe ranks of Marine Cadet 2nd Class (MC2) and Marine Cadet 1st Class (MC1) were phased out at the end of 2018.\n\nAll Royal Marines Cadets are required to complete boards for each promotion. The higher the board the higher the level the board is run at. The former promotions from Marine Cadet to Marine Cadet 2nd Class and to Marine Cadet 1st Class were run at detachment level. Marine Cadet to Lance Corporal boards are at [[troop]] or [[Company (military unit)|company]] level, Lance Corporal to Corporal boards are at company level, and Corporal to Sergeant boards are at a national level. All promotions boards have multiple sections all of which must be passed individually.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Cadet ranks and insignia\n| {{Ranks and Insignia of UK/CDT/SCC/RM/ALL}}\n|}\n\nAt the discretion of the commanding officer of a unit, or district officer, a cadet may be awarded an acting rate if they have completed the majority of the modules required for promotion, or received a partial pass on their promotion board, for example ''Acting Leading Cadet'' (ALC), or ''Acting Petty Officer Cadet'' (APOC). \n[[File:Sea_Cadets_Junior_Summer_Camp.jpg|thumb|Junior sea cadets at their annual summer camp, 2016]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Junior Sea Cadets\n!(Abbr)\n|-\n|Junior Cadet\n|JC\n|-\n|Junior Cadet First Class\n|JCFC\n|-\n|Able Junior Cadet\n|AJC\n|-\n|Leading Junior Cadet\n|LJC\n|}\n\n===Adult officers===\nThe following rates and ranks can be awarded to uniformed adult volunteers, there are also Non uniformed Civilian Instructors (CIs) and Unit Assistants (UAs). From 2009 to 2019, if a person joined as a Civilian Instructor and wanted to be a uniformed member of staff, they would become an Acting Petty Officer or Sergeant, following a 6 month probationary period. From 2020, an adult can join as a uniformed member of staff as a probationary Petty Officer or Sergeant on completion of their application process.  \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Sea Cadet Unit Officers (NCOs)\n!Rank Slide\n!Royal Marine Unit Officers (NCOs)\n!Rank Slide\n|-\n|Civilian Instructor\n|[[File:CI SCC.png|alt=|left|frameless|121x121px]]\n|Civilian Instructor\n|No Rank Slide<br/>or<br/>[[File:CI SCC.png|alt=|left|frameless|121x121px]]\n|-\n|Probationary Petty Officer\n|[[File:PPO SCC.png|alt=|left|frameless|121x121px]]\n|Probationary Sergeant\n|[[File:Probationary Sgt.png|alt=|left|frameless|151x151px]]\n|-\n|Petty Officer\n|[[File:PO SCC.png|alt=|left|frameless|121x121px]]\n|Sergeant\n|[[File:Sergeant.png|alt=|left|frameless|151x151px]]\n|-\n|Chief Petty Officer\n|[[File:CPO SCC.png|alt=|left|frameless|121x121px]]\n|Colour Sergeant\n|[[File:Colour Sgt.png|alt=|left|frameless|151x151px]]\n|-\n|Warrant Officer 2\n|[[File:WO2 RNR.png|left|frameless|121x121px|link=Special:FilePath/WO2.png]]\n|Warrant Officer 2nd Class\n|[[File:WO2 RMR.png|alt=|left|frameless|152x152px]]\n|-\n|Warrant Officer 1\n||[[File:WO1 RNR.png|alt=|left|frameless|121x121px]]\n|Warrant Officer 1st Class\n|[[File:WO1 RMR.png|alt=|left|frameless|152x152px]]\n|}\n\nOfficers are commissioned under the Cadet Forces Commission.<ref>[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/758400/00149.pdf Royal Warrant for Cadet Force commission]</ref>\n[[File:Mishipman of the RNVR.png|70px|thumb|Midshipman in the Sea Cadets formerly used the insignia for Midshipman in the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Sea Cadet voyages normally last for 1 week, with cadets gaining RYA qualifications for their voyage. Individual Sea Cadet units also have various boats including MOD motor boats such as Vikings, Champs, Dories, [[Dinghy|dinghies]] called the ASC ([[ASC (dinghy)|Admiralty Sailing Craft]]) and Bosuns, in addition to vessels designed specifically for the SCC such as the Trinity 500 rowing boat and RS ''Quest'' dinghy. Also on loan from the MOD, canoes, kayaks and windsurfing equipment, units and national training centres also have RIB's.\n\n===TS ''Royalist''===\n[[File:ISON 180328 MSSC 41966.jpg|thumb|Sea Cadets on board their yachts.

They are both Rustler 42 yachts and provide nationally-recognised RYA training for those wishing to gain qualifications and experience yacht sailing.\n\n===TS ''John Jerwood'' and TS ''Jack Petchey''===\nThese two vessels are the cadets' offshore powered training-ship. They are {{convert|24|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and each cost about \u00a32.6m. [[TS Jack Petchey|TS ''Jack Petchey'']] is so named because the [[Jack Petchey]] Foundation donated \u00a31m in order for it to be built. The [[Jerwood Foundation]] donated \u00a31,216,700 for the construction of TS ''John Jerwood''. The training ships can hold between 12-16 cadets, four permanent staff and two CFAVs and provides an experience at sea focussing on deck work, navigation, bridge watchkeeping, cook/steward and marine engineering. Each vessel is fitted with twin Perkins Sabre Type M215C Turbo Diesel main engines, each giving {{convert|200|shp|abbr=on}} at 2,500 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/vessel-build-and-maintenance/ship-and-boatbuilding/new_training_ship_for_sea_cadets |title=New training ship for sea cadets |website=Maritime Journal |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=23 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Trinity 500 rowing boats===\nThe Trinity 500 is a stable fixed seat rowing boat, purpose built for the Sea Cadets to deliver the full SCC Rowing Scheme. The boat has also been approved by British Rowing, to allow for the delivery of their Explore Rowing Scheme. The boat was designed by [[Jo Richards]], Olympic medallist and designer of a wide range of craft, in response to the requirement of the Sea Cadets for a modern, low maintenance, purpose-designed fixed seat rowing boat with good performance under oars and with the capacity to mount a small outboard motor. The Trinity 500 is named to mark the quincentenary of the incorporation of [[Trinity House]], the statutory authority for aids to navigation in England, Wales, The Channel Islands and Gibraltar. The Trinity House Maritime Charity, a separately funded arm of the Corporation of Trinity House generously funded the design and development costs of the boat.\n\n===RS dinghies===\nIn a partnership between [[RS Sailing]] and the Sea Cadets, a new dinghy known as the RS ''Quest'' was designed by Jo Richards, who is also responsible for formulating the design for the Trinity 500 rowing vessel. The RS ''Quest'' was designed to accommodate the need for a new sailing dinghy within the SCC that is strong and easy to maintain which is capable of comfortably accommodating an instructor and up to three cadets. The RS ''Quest'' was unveiled at the Southampton Boat Show in 2015.\n*Continuing the partnership between MSSC and RS Sailing, the single sail RS ''Zest'' dinghy was launched at the 2017 Southampton Boat Show. It is intended for a crew of two, but can be sailed single-handed. It is aimed at benefiting units with limited access to water, as RS ''Zest'' can operate in shallower water than the RS ''Quest''.\n\n== Investigation into sexual abuse ==\n \nIn 2012 payouts made to victims of sexual abuse across all Cadet Forces totaled \u00a31,475,844.

Its eastern end is in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], near [[Newark, California|Newark]] in the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]], and its western end is in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. Bridging [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]] across the bay, it has three lanes each way and a separated bike/pedestrian lane along its south side. Like the [[San Mateo Bridge]] to the north, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s parallel the bridge.\n\n==History and engineering features==\n[[Image:DumbartonBr.jpg|thumb|right|The original vertical-lift span of the Dumbarton Bridge, shown in 1984 shortly before it was demolished]]The bridge has never been officially named, but its commonly used name comes from Dumbarton Point, named in 1876 after [[Dumbarton, Scotland]]. Built originally to provide a shortcut for traffic originating in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the bridge served industrial and residential areas on both sides. The earlier bridge opened on January 17, 1927, and was the first vehicular bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. A portion of this old drawbridge remains as a fishing pier on the east side of the Bay. The original bridge was built with private capital and then purchased by the state for $2.5 million in 1951.\n\nIts age and the two-lane undivided roadway and lift-span led to a replacement bridge being built to the north. This bridge opened in October 1982 as a four-lane, high-level structure. The structure was re-striped to accommodate six lanes on October 18, 1989, in response to the temporary closing of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]] due to the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], and the permanent widening of the approaches was completed by July 2003.<ref>\"Dumbarton Bridge\" {{cite web|url=http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221185117/http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |archivedate=2012-02-21 }}</ref> The cost of the complete replacement project was $200 million. The current bridge includes a two-way bicycle and separate pedestrian path on the south-facing side. A {{convert|340|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} center span provides {{convert|85|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of vertical clearance for shipping. The approach spans on both sides of the Bay are of pre-stressed [[lightweight concrete]] [[girder]]s supporting a lightweight concrete deck. The center spans are twin steel trapezoidal girders which also support a lightweight concrete deck.\n\nThe center span of the original bridge was demolished in a controlled explosion in September 1984.\n[[Image:Dumbarton Bridge CA from the air.JPG|thumb|right|A view from the air, above Palo Alto, looking towards Fremont]]\n\n==Roadway connections==\nThe bridge is part of [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]], and is directly connected to [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] by a [[freeway]] segment north of the Fremont end.\nThere is no freeway connection between [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] and the southwest end of the Dumbarton Bridge. Motorists must traverse one of three at-grade routes to connect from the Bayshore Freeway to the bridge. These are (from northwest to southeast):\n# the Bayfront Expressway, a [[limited-access road]] linking to U.S. 101 at Marsh Road, [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] (the official routing of SR 84)\n# Willow Road ([[California State Route 114|SR 114]]), an approximately one-mile expressway through east Menlo Park to U.S. 101\n# University Avenue ([[California State Route 109|SR 109]]), an [[arterial road]] and the main commercial street of [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]].\n\nThe Willow Road and University Avenue junctions with Bayfront Expressway are at-grade intersections controlled by traffic lights; there are two additional controlled intersections at Chilco Road and Marsh Road, and the Marsh Road interchange on U.S. 101 is a [[Partial cloverleaf interchange|parclo]]. The result is that Bayfront Expressway is frequently congested, and when not congested is often the site of high-speed car crashes. In 2007, prominent author [[David Halberstam]] was killed in one such crash at the Willow Road intersection.\n\nAccess to [[Interstate 280 in California|I-280]] is available via State Route 84 to [[Woodside Road]] (as signed) or other arterial routes. There are no cross-Peninsula freeway connections between State Routes 92 and 85. In addition, there are no direct cross-Peninsula arterial routes between State Route 84 and Page Mill Road, a five-mile gap.\n\nAlthough the present situation has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans has been unable to upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in southern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to [[Silicon Valley]]), thus increasing traffic in their neighborhoods to the south and west of U.S. 101 and even along State Routes 85 and 237.\n\nBus service across the bridge is provided by the [[Dumbarton Express]], run by a consortium of local transit agencies ([[SamTrans]], [[AC Transit]], [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] and others) which connects to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] at Union City and [[Caltrain]] at Palo Alto and California Avenue. AC Transit also runs Transbay buses U ([[Fremont (BART station)|Fremont BART]] and [[Fremont-Centerville (Amtrak station)|Amtrak]] to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]) and DA (Ardenwood to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Facebook]] headquarters) across the bridge. The free [[Stanford Marguerite Shuttle]] also runs buses AE-F and EB across the bridge.\n\n==Environmental factors==\n\nWhen the current bridge was planned in the 1970s, [[Caltrans]] conducted extensive environmental research on the [[marine biology|aquatic]] and [[landform|terrestrial]] environment. Principal concerns of the public were [[air pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] impacts, particularly in some residential areas of Menlo Park and [[East Palo Alto]]. Studies were conducted to produce contour maps of projected [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s and [[carbon monoxide]] concentrations throughout the western approaches, for each alternative connection scheme.<ref>C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Harry Seidman et al., ''Air Quality and Acoustics Analysis for the Dumbarton Bridge Replacement Project'', ESL Inc., prepared for the Bay Area Division of Toll Crossings (1973)</ref>\n\nThe area around the bridge is an important ecological area, hosting many species of birds, fish and mammals. The [[endangered species]] [[California clapper rail]] is known to be present in the western bridge terminus area.\n\nNear the bridge on the Peninsula are Menlo Park's Bayfront Park, East Palo Alto's Ravenswood Open Space Preserve, and the [[Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve]]. An accessible portion of the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife]] Refuge lies immediately north of the western bridge terminus, where the Ravenswood trail runs.<ref>''San Francisco Bay Shoreline Guide'', by California State Coastal Conservancy, University of California Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-520-08878-6}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the east end of the bridge are large salt ponds and [[levee]] trails belonging to the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]]. The headquarters and visitor center for the refuge is on a hill south of the bridge approach. North of the east end of the bridge is [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]], with its network of trails running over tall hills. North of that is the [[Alameda Creek Regional Trail]] from the Bay to [[Niles Canyon]]. East of [[Coyote Hills (Alameda County)|Coyote Hills]] is [[Ardenwood Historic Farm]], a restored working farm that preserves and displays turn-of-the-century farming methods\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the east side of the bay. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the [[FasTrak]] electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only [[HOV lane]], allowing [[carpool]] vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.\n\n===Historical toll rates===\nPrior to 1969, tolls on the Dumbarton Bridge were collected in both directions. When it opened, the original 1927 span had a toll of $0.40 per car plus $0.05 per passenger. In 1959, tolls were set to $0.35 per car. It was raised to $0.70 in 1969, then $0.75 in 1976.

Its eastern end is in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], near [[Newark, California|Newark]] in the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]], and its western end is in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. Bridging [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]] across the bay, it has three lanes each way and a separated bike/pedestrian lane along its south side. Like the [[San Mateo Bridge]] to the north, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s parallel the bridge.\n\n==History and engineering features==\n[[Image:DumbartonBr.jpg|thumb|right|The original vertical-lift span of the Dumbarton Bridge, shown in 1984 shortly before it was demolished]]The bridge has never been officially named, but its commonly used name comes from Dumbarton Point, named in 1876 after [[Dumbarton, Scotland]]. Built originally to provide a shortcut for traffic originating in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the bridge served industrial and residential areas on both sides. The earlier bridge opened on January 17, 1927, and was the first vehicular bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. A portion of this old drawbridge remains as a fishing pier on the east side of the Bay. The original bridge was built with private capital and then purchased by the state for $2.5 million in 1951.\n\nIts age and the two-lane undivided roadway and lift-span led to a replacement bridge being built to the north. This bridge opened in October 1982 as a four-lane, high-level structure. The structure was re-striped to accommodate six lanes on October 18, 1989, in response to the temporary closing of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]] due to the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], and the permanent widening of the approaches was completed by July 2003.<ref>\"Dumbarton Bridge\" {{cite web|url=http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221185117/http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |archivedate=2012-02-21 }}</ref> The cost of the complete replacement project was $200 million. The current bridge includes a two-way bicycle and separate pedestrian path on the south-facing side. A {{convert|340|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} center span provides {{convert|85|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of vertical clearance for shipping. The approach spans on both sides of the Bay are of pre-stressed [[lightweight concrete]] [[girder]]s supporting a lightweight concrete deck. The center spans are twin steel trapezoidal girders which also support a lightweight concrete deck.\n\nThe center span of the original bridge was demolished in a controlled explosion in September 1984.\n[[Image:Dumbarton Bridge CA from the air.JPG|thumb|right|A view from the air, above Palo Alto, looking towards Fremont]]\n\n==Roadway connections==\nThe bridge is part of [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]], and is directly connected to [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] by a [[freeway]] segment north of the Fremont end.\nThere is no freeway connection between [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] and the southwest end of the Dumbarton Bridge. Motorists must traverse one of three at-grade routes to connect from the Bayshore Freeway to the bridge. These are (from northwest to southeast):\n# the Bayfront Expressway, a [[limited-access road]] linking to U.S. 101 at Marsh Road, [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] (the official routing of SR 84)\n# Willow Road ([[California State Route 114|SR 114]]), an approximately one-mile expressway through east Menlo Park to U.S. 101\n# University Avenue ([[California State Route 109|SR 109]]), an [[arterial road]] and the main commercial street of [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]].\n\nThe Willow Road and University Avenue junctions with Bayfront Expressway are at-grade intersections controlled by traffic lights; there are two additional controlled intersections at Chilco Road and Marsh Road, and the Marsh Road interchange on U.S. 101 is a [[Partial cloverleaf interchange|parclo]]. The result is that Bayfront Expressway is frequently congested, and when not congested is often the site of high-speed car crashes. In 2007, prominent author [[David Halberstam]] was killed in one such crash at the Willow Road intersection.\n\nAccess to [[Interstate 280 in California|I-280]] is available via State Route 84 to [[Woodside Road]] (as signed) or other arterial routes. There are no cross-Peninsula freeway connections between State Routes 92 and 85. In addition, there are no direct cross-Peninsula arterial routes between State Route 84 and Page Mill Road, a five-mile gap.\n\nAlthough the present situation has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans has been unable to upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in southern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to [[Silicon Valley]]), thus increasing traffic in their neighborhoods to the south and west of U.S. 101 and even along State Routes 85 and 237.\n\nBus service across the bridge is provided by the [[Dumbarton Express]], run by a consortium of local transit agencies ([[SamTrans]], [[AC Transit]], [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] and others) which connects to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] at Union City and [[Caltrain]] at Palo Alto and California Avenue. AC Transit also runs Transbay buses U ([[Fremont (BART station)|Fremont BART]] and [[Fremont-Centerville (Amtrak station)|Amtrak]] to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]) and DA (Ardenwood to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Facebook]] headquarters) across the bridge. The free [[Stanford Marguerite Shuttle]] also runs buses AE-F and EB across the bridge.\n\n==Environmental factors==\n\nWhen the current bridge was planned in the 1970s, [[Caltrans]] conducted extensive environmental research on the [[marine biology|aquatic]] and [[landform|terrestrial]] environment. Principal concerns of the public were [[air pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] impacts, particularly in some residential areas of Menlo Park and [[East Palo Alto]]. Studies were conducted to produce contour maps of projected [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s and [[carbon monoxide]] concentrations throughout the western approaches, for each alternative connection scheme.<ref>C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Harry Seidman et al., ''Air Quality and Acoustics Analysis for the Dumbarton Bridge Replacement Project'', ESL Inc., prepared for the Bay Area Division of Toll Crossings (1973)</ref>\n\nThe area around the bridge is an important ecological area, hosting many species of birds, fish and mammals. The [[endangered species]] [[California clapper rail]] is known to be present in the western bridge terminus area.\n\nNear the bridge on the Peninsula are Menlo Park's Bayfront Park, East Palo Alto's Ravenswood Open Space Preserve, and the [[Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve]]. An accessible portion of the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife]] Refuge lies immediately north of the western bridge terminus, where the Ravenswood trail runs.<ref>''San Francisco Bay Shoreline Guide'', by California State Coastal Conservancy, University of California Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-520-08878-6}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the east end of the bridge are large salt ponds and [[levee]] trails belonging to the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]]. The headquarters and visitor center for the refuge is on a hill south of the bridge approach. North of the east end of the bridge is [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]], with its network of trails running over tall hills. North of that is the [[Alameda Creek Regional Trail]] from the Bay to [[Niles Canyon]]. East of [[Coyote Hills (Alameda County)|Coyote Hills]] is [[Ardenwood Historic Farm]], a restored working farm that preserves and displays turn-of-the-century farming methods\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the east side of the bay. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the [[FasTrak]] electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only [[HOV lane]], allowing [[carpool]] vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.\n\n===Historical toll rates===\nPrior to 1969, tolls on the Dumbarton Bridge were collected in both directions. When it opened, the original 1927 span had a toll of $0.40 per car plus $0.05 per passenger. In 1959, tolls were set to $0.35 per car. It was raised to $0.70 in 1969, then $0.75 in 1976. The toll per car remained at $0.75 when the replacement bridge opened in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist4/documents/tollfees.pdf | title=History of California's Bridge Tolls | publisher=[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] | accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state-owned bridges, including the Dumbarton Bridge, was raised to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988.<ref>[http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/projects/rm1.htm Regional Measure 1 Toll Bridge Program].

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'', the blade originally began as the Goddess Sword, which has a sentient female avatar named Fi integrated into it. Eventually, the Goddess Sword transforms into its current state after being infused with the Three Sacred Flames, with Fi's spirit form ceasing to be once the Master Sword absorbs Demise's remains.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/16/e3-2010-nintendo-developer-roundtable-live-blog E3 2010: Nintendo Developer Roundtable Live Blog]. [[IGN]], June 15, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe sword traditionally rests in [[wiktionary:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] locations indigenous to [[#Hyrule|Hyrule]], such as the Temple of Time or the Lost Woods. Similar to [[Arthurian legend]], the Master Sword is often obtained by [[Sword in the stone (King Arthur)|pulling it from a stone pedestal]]. The sword is often not at full power, leading it to need to be \"recharged\" in some way, or have its power increased beyond its standard level to fight Ganon. There are some situations when the blade, already at full power, can be further improved; in ''[[A Link to the Past]]'', it was tempered to the Tempered Sword. It can later be upgraded to the Golden Sword. Similarly, in ''[[Twilight Princess]]'', the sword's power is increased by the two Sols in the Palace of Twilight. ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' establishes that the sword needs the power of two sages praying to the gods to keep its powers, or else it will no longer be able to prevent an evil person from gaining the Triforce.<ref>[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]], King of Red Lions: The fact that the Master Sword lost the power to repel evil suggests to me that something has happened to the sages who infused the blade with the gods\u2019 power. The sages should be in Hyrule...  in the Wind Temple to the north and the Earth Temple to the south, praying to the gods.</ref> In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'' the Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, though if it is used too often the sword's power needs to be recharged becoming temporarily unusable. The sword is located in the Korok Forest, which Link can only access by going through the Lost Woods. Zelda moved it there to be guarded by the Great Deku Tree and to protect knowledge of its location from Calamity Ganon. Link can travel to the Korok Forest at any point after receiving the Paraglider, though he can only remove the sword after obtaining 13 or more Heart Containers, as removing it drains Link's hearts as a way to test his strength. In addition to its unbreakability, Link can also fire Sword Beams while he is at full health. The Master Sword has a base damage of 30 but its true power glows when in the presence of pools of Calamity Ganon's Malice, Cursed Enemies, and all of Calamity Ganon's various forms; its durability is greatly increased in this state. It can later be enhanced to 60 damage once completing the \"trial of the sword\" side quest.\n\nOnce removed, Link sees a vision of Zelda entrusting the Master Sword to the protection of the Great Deku Tree 100 years ago. During her conversation with him, Princess Zelda reveals that the sword spoke to her (which is implied to be Fi, whose consciousness apparently still exists within the sword though unable to manifest her spirit form) and told her that her destiny was not finished and that she still had something she must do, leading to Princess Zelda's sealing Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle for 100 years while Link slept. The weapon's in-game description reveals that the sword is delighted to be in Link's possession, echoing Fi's words at the end of ''Skyward Sword''. 100 years after Calamity Ganon was sealed in Hyrule Castle, the sword became known across Hyrule as the Sword that Seals the Darkness and is sought by several travelers Link encounters despite the fact that only the chosen hero can wield its power.\n\nThe Master Sword is a [[Arming sword|double-edged one-handed sword]]. The blade cross-section is hexagonal with no [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]]. On the flats of the blade near the [[hilt]] is a [[Triforce]] symbol, etched into the steel or emblazoned in gold. It has a blue or purple curved [[Guard (weapon)|crossguard]] in the shape of a pair of wings with a small yellow jewel where it meets the hilt. The hilt is often padded red with a non-ornate blue [[Pommel (sword)|pommel]]. Since ''The Wind Waker'', the Master Sword's blade glows white when it is revived by the [[Wise old man|sages]] in the mid-game. In ''Breath of the Wild'', this glow represents the Master Sword's true power. ''Breath of the Wild'' is the first game to depict the blade showing signs of wear and rust, when Zelda places it in its pedestal in Korok Forest, though 100 years later the Master Sword is shown to have been restored to its undamaged state.\n\n[[Nintendo Power]] listed the Master Sword as one of the best weapons in gaming: citing that it is more than just a powerful sword, but also integral to Link's adventures and development as a character.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nintendo Power 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |page=44 |title-link=Nintendo Power }}</ref>\n\n===Triforce===\n{{main|Triforce}}\n[[File:Triforce.svg|thumb|210px|The Triforce is represented as three conjoined golden triangles, with one triangle placed above the other two.]]\nThe {{nihongo|Triforce|\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Toraif\u014dsu}}, also called {{nihongo|\"Power of the Gods\"|\u795e\u306e\u529b|Kami no Chikara}} and the {{nihongo|\"Golden Triangle\"|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u5927\u4e09\u89d2|\u014cgon no Dai-Sankaku}}, is a triangular sacred [[relic]] left behind by the three [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Golden Goddesses|Golden Goddesses]] when they created Hyrule. It is made up of three smaller triangles known as the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Power]]|\u529b\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Chikara no Toraif\u014dsu}}, the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Wisdom]]|\u77e5\u6075\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Chie no Toraif\u014dsu}}, and the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Courage]]|\u52c7\u6c17\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Y\u016bki no Toraif\u014dsu}}. These embody the essences of [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|their respective goddesses]], and bestow certain boons on their bearers. In most of its appearances, the Triforce or its pieces manifest as a marking on the hands of their bearers. These markings resonate when near each other, and the Triforce pieces can emerge from their bearers as a result.\n\nWhen united, the Triforce allows one who touches it to make a wish that usually lasts until they die or the wish is fulfilled. If the one who finds it does not possess a balance of the three virtues it represents, however, the pieces split into its three components and the finder is left with the one that represents the characteristic they value most; the other two pieces do likewise with two other characters \"chosen by destiny\". Ganon makes it his goal to obtain the Triforce in various games, often having a single piece himself (the Triforce of Power) that he uses to further his goals.\n\nThe Triforce of Power, which is positioned as the topmost of the three, holds the presence of Din, the goddess of Power, and radiates the physical and magical power of its bearer. It is associated with [[Ganon]], who is power-hungry. The Triforce of Wisdom, positioned on the lower left, embodies the essence of Nayru, the goddess of Wisdom, and amplifies the wisdom and mystical powers of its bearer. It is associated with [[Princess Zelda]], whose great wisdom brings peace and prosperity to Hyrule. The Triforce of Courage, positioned on the lower right, embodies the essence of Farore, the goddess of Courage, and seems to amplify the courage and adventuring skills of its bearer. It is associated with [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], who bravely defends Hyrule from Ganon and other malevolent forces.\n\n==Other worlds==\n===Termina===\n{{nihongo|Termina|\u30bf\u30eb\u30df\u30ca|Tarumina}} is a parallel world to Hyrule that serves as the main setting of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]''. Link falls into this world from a portal deep within the Lost Woods. The land has very similar geography to that of Hyrule, and many of its citizens have identical names and appearances to (although different personalities from) people in Hyrule. The land itself is split into four distinct regions, one for every compass direction, and each guarded by four giant deities: The [[swamp]]y Woodfall, home of the Deku Scrubs, to the south; The icy Snowhead Mountains of the Gorons to the north; Great Bay, home of the Zora to the west; and the undead wastelands of Ikana Canyon to the east. Its capital, Clock Town, lies in the center.\n\n===Lorule===\n{{nihongo|Lorule|\u30ed\u30a6\u30e9\u30eb|Rouraru}} is a parallel world to Hyrule in ''A Link Between Worlds''. It is similar to Hyrule in geography, features Lorulean counterparts of many people found in Hyrule, and is ruled by Princess Zelda's Lorulean counterpart, Princess Hilda. Like Hyrule, Lorule originally had its own Triforce and was the source of various conflicts. However, the Royal Family of Lorule decided to destroy the Triforce in an attempt to put an end to conflict, only to bring calamity to their world as a result. Desperate to save the kingdom and her people, Princess Hilda conspired with her servant Yuga to steal Hyrule's Triforce, unaware that Yuga wanted the Triforce for himself. Eventually Yuga is defeated by Link, and Hilda's former servant Ravio manages to show her the error of her ways. Ultimately Link and Zelda decide to forgive Hilda for her misguided actions and use the Triforce to restore the Lorulean Triforce, which in turn restores the land of Lorule.\n\n===Others===\nSeveral other parallel worlds to Hyrule exist, such as the Twilight Realm, the World of the Ocean King, and the Dark World from ''Twilight Princess'', ''The Phantom Hourglass'', and ''A Link to the Past'', respectively. Several other lands also exist beyond the kingdom. In ''Oracle of Ages'' and ''Oracle of Seasons'', Link travels to Labrynna and Holodrum. ''Triforce Heroes'' is set in Hytopia, a kingdom connected to Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite web |quote= Hyrule and Hytopia are connected. |author=Tri Force Heroes developers |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=October 22, 2015 |url=https://www.facebook.com/NintendoHandheldGaming/photos/a.150955828309750.40686.149152295156770/953796588025666/?type=3 |title=Most games in The Legend of Zelda series have a connection to Hyrule. Does the land of Hytopia connect to Hyrule in any way? |website=Facebook}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Races==\n===Ancient Robots===\nThe {{nihongo|Ancient Robots|RS-301}} are a mechanical race from ''Skyward Sword''. They were created by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru, but their land eventually became a barren desert while they rusted away. By using a Timeshift Stone they can be revived and serve three purposes. Some of them mine for Timeshift Stones, one group protected one of the Sacred Flames, and some act as Lanayru's servants. In addition there is a band of Ancient Robot Pirates, though only two of them are seen: LD-002S Scervo on the Sandship, and LD-003D Dreadfuse in the Sky Keep. During Link's quest for Nayru's Flame, Link is aided by a robot named Skipper, who is captain of the Sandship and lost his ship to the Pirate Scervo. Skipper aids Link in traversing the Lanayru Sand Sea using his Timeshift Stone powered motorboat, which can transform the impassible sea of sand into the ancient sea of water that once existed in the past. Also, Gondo, one of the citizens of Skyloft, owns an Ancient Robot that he inherited from his grandfather; at one point in the game this robot, named Scrapper, is restored to full functionality, and assists Link by carrying items up to Skyloft from the surface. The Ancient Robots require the oil produced by Ancient Flowers to function; because these flowers can no longer be found in the present day Lanayru Desert, it is implied that the flower's disappearance resulted in the decline of the LD-301 Series Ancient Robots. Most ancient robots are part of the LD-301 Series, including LD-301S Scrapper and LD-301N Skipper, while Servo and Dreadfuse are part of the LD-002 and LD-003 series, which unlike the LD-301 Series remain functional in the present.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', similar robots exist called Guardians and Divine Beasts. The Divine Beasts consist of Vah Ruta of the Zora, Vah Rudania of the Gorons, Vah Naboris of the Gerudo, and Vah Medoh of the Rito. The Guardians are ancient mechanisms with powerful sniper blasts who were intended to be used to defeat Ganon, but Ganon used his power to turn the robots against Hyrule. Mipha, the Zora Champion, Urbosa, the Gerudo Champion, Daruk, the Goron Champion, and Revali, the Rito Champion, who once piloted the Divine Beasts, were killed by the Blight Ganons, creations of Ganon who represent the element of the Divine Beast e.g. Thunderblight Ganon for Vah Naboris.\n\n===Anouki===\n{{nihongo|Anouki|\u30e6\u30ad\u30ef\u30ed\u30b7|Yukiwaroshi}} are an Inuit-like race that appear to be a cross between a reindeer and penguins. There are different variations of them with purple, red, blue, and yellow shirts and facial hair or small or big antlers. They are found on the Isle of Frost in the World of Ocean King and in Anouki Village in New Hyrule. In ''Spirit Tracks'', the Anouki are the only race who live in the snow realm.\n\n===Bokoblin===\nBokoblins are a race of humanoid [[goblin]]-like creatures, that first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Bokoblins come in a variety of colors such as red, blue, and green. They often appear as standard enemies and wield Boko Sticks, machetes, and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In ''Twilight Princess'', they are less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by the Bulblins. In ''Skyward Sword'', Bokoblins are revealed to have been around since ancient times and are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces different varieties of Bokoblin such as Technoblins, which lived in Lanayru Desert in the distant past and wield ancient technology; and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that can curse Link. The game introduces the bow-wielding Bokoblin Archers and Bokoblin Leaders that can summon other Bokoblins using the Monster Horns they carry.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', Bokoblin are revealed to have an omnivorous diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. They also can occasionally be seen hunting wild animals for their meat, which they will consume after a successful kill. Bokoblins can wield a variety of weapons, but tend to favor their own crafted clubs, bats, spears, and bows, the strongest of which are made from Dragonbone. The game also introduces another undead variant of Bokoblin called Stalkoblin, which raise from the ground at night and will continuously regenerate unless all Stalkoblin skulls in the area are destroyed, because a single skull can reanimate its headless comrades. The game also introduces stronger Black Bokoblins and Silver Bokoblins, which are stronger and more resilient. Cursed Bokoblins return in ''Breath of the Wild,'' but are depicted as floating Stalkoblin skulls corrupted by Calamity Ganon's malice.\n\nRed Bokoblins and Stalkoblins drop Bokoblin Horns and Bokoblin Fangs, while Blue, Black, and Silver Bokoblins drop those parts along with Bokoblin Guts. These monster parts can be sold to shops and merchants for Rupees or to Kilton for ''Mon'' at the Fang and Bone shop, though Link can also cook them with bugs to make Elixirs or use them as materials by the four Great Fairies to upgrade his armor. Link can also buy a Bokoblin Mask from Kilton, which allows him to disguise himself as a Bokoblin and blend in with them.\n\n===Bulblin===\n{{nihongo|Bulblins|\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Buruburin}} are a green, horned race that resemble the [[orc]]s of classic fantasy. They are led by {{nihongo|King Bulblin|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Kingu Buruburin}},<ref name=\"BulblinTrophy\"><!--\"Creatures that serve under King Bulblin.

They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' King Bulblin appears as an obstacle in the Bridge of Eldin stage in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.\n\n===Cobble===\nThe Cobble are a race that appear in ''Phantom Hourglass''. The Cobble once inhabited a prosperous land called the Cobble Kingdom. By the time the game takes place, the only Cobble that remain are the ghosts of the soldiers and King Mutoh, who dress in ancient Egyptian-like clothes and live in pyramid-like temples. The Isle of Ruins in the Northeastern Sea is all that remains of the once-mighty kingdom, and Link must visit there to retrieve the Aquanine, a pure metal entrusted to the Cobble by the Ocean King. There, he delves beneath Mutoh's Temple and destroys a corrupt Cobble war machine that is disrupting the king's eternal rest.\n\n===Deku===\nThe {{nihongo|Deku|\u30c7\u30af\u30ca\u30c3\u30c4|Dekunattsu}} are wooden plant-like creatures introduced in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' that appear mostly in the [[overworld]] and dungeons. Deku are small creatures with leaves sprouting out from their heads. They often have red glowing eyes and tube-like mouths that can shoot Deku Nuts. Their bodies consist of wood and leaves and perish quickly if set on fire. They can fly by using large leaves to glide, and some can use the leaves on their head to fly indefinitely after taking off from a Deku Flower. There are four types of Deku depicted in the series: Deku Scrubs, Mad Scrubs, Business Scrubs, and Royal Scrubs. Deku Scrubs are the most common type, which have green leaves and often give information when caught. Mad Scrubs are violent, have red and yellow leaves, and do not talk. Business Scrubs are traders who offer to sell their wares and services. Royal Scrubs have larger heads, bigger eyes, smaller mouths, and extra leaves covering their body. In ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of an unknown deceased Deku Scrub who is  implied to be the son of the Deku King's butler. In this form, Link can temporarily fly using a Deku Flower, shoot bubbles, and hop on deep water five times before sinking.\n\n===Dragon===\n[[Dragon]]s are a recurring race that usually appear as benevolent guardians or powerful enemies. In ''Ocarina of Time'', after becoming the King of Evil, Ganondorf resurrects the evil Goron-eating dragon Volvagia, who had terrorized the Goron people in the distant past before being defeated by Darunia's ancestor, who wielded the Megaton Hammer. When Ganondorf orders his minions to capture and feed the Gorons to Volvagia as a warning to his enemies, Darunia journeys to the Fire Temple to rescue his people and defeat Volvagia, but he is defeated because he could not locate the Megaton Hammer. However, Link manages to free the Gorons, slay Volvagia, and awaken Darunia as the Sage of Fire. In ''The Wind Waker'', the Sky Spirit Valoo acts as the protector and patron deity of the Rito tribe, providing them with his scales that allow them to grow wings. When Link arrives on Dragon Roost Island, he discovers that Gohma was tormenting Valoo, and defeats Gohma to obtain Din's Pearl. Valoo and the Rito later repay their debt to Link by rescuing him and Tetra from Ganondorf during their encounter with him in Forsaken Fortress. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link encounters a species of malevolent draconic warriors called Aeralfos and the Twilit dragon Argorok, who is the boss of the City in the Sky. In ''Skyward Sword'', Link is aided by the Three Dragons that guard the three regions of the Surface. Faron the Water Dragon rules over the Parella and protector of Faron Woods, Lake Floria, and the Ancient Cistern that holds Farore's Flame. Eldin the Fire Dragon guards Eldin Volcano. Lanayru the Thunder Dragon created the Ancient Robots and protects Lanayru Desert. Each dragon was entrusted with part of the Song of the Hero, which provides clues on the location of the Triforce. During his quest for Farore's Flame, Link aids Faron, who had been injured while fighting Ghirahim; she leads him to the Ancient Cistern. During his quest for the Song of the Hero, Link encounters Eldin after he is captured and imprisoned by Bokoblins during an eruption. Link learns that the Fire Dragon had caused the eruption, and the dragon apologizes to Link for all the trouble it caused him. Unlike the other two dragons, Lanayru is shown to have died from an illness in the past, forcing Link to go back in time, cure him of his illness, and prevent his death. After Link cures him and learning his part of the song, Lanayru allows Link to take part in the Lightning Round, which allows him to face a boss battle challenge and a Silent Realm challenge for various prizes. If Link completes eight boss battles, Lanayru will reward him with the unbreakable Hylian Shield, the strongest shield in the game.\n\n===Fairy===\n{{nihongo|[[Fairy|Fairies]]|\u5996\u7cbe|[[Y\u014dsei]]}} are magical creatures associated with nature and the Goddess Farore that appear as small, winged [[humanoid]]s often obscured by light. Fairies tend to shy away from human settlements and are most often associated with the Lost Woods, but can be found hiding in many places throughout Hyrule. Fairy Fountains or Fairy Springs are special places that contain sparkling magical water and attract Fairies in large numbers. In most games in the series, fairies will heal Link if he manages to catch one and he can also put them in empty bottles to have them heal him later. If Link dies while he has a bottled fairy in his possession, the fairy will automatically resurrect him instead of receiving a [[Game Over]].\n\n{{nihongo|Great Fairies|\u5927\u5996\u7cbe|Dai-y\u014dsei}} are powerful, high ranking fairies that often watch over their smaller brethren. They use their magic to enchant Link's items into more powerful versions and in some games they can also teach Link various magic spells. In ''Ocarina of Time'', the Kokiri form a symbiotic relationship with their Guardian Fairies, who act as constant companions and mentors. One of these is [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]], who serves as Link's sidekick and aids Link in learning about the world outside Kokiri Forest. Another Guardian Fairy is Tatl from ''Majora's Mask'' who was a friend of the Skull Kid until he betrayed her and her brother Tael. In ''Phantom Hourglass'', Link's guardian fairy is Ciela, who is eventually joined by two more fairies, Leaf and Neri. In some of the games, such as ''The Minish Cap'', players will be tested of their honesty and if they are, fairies give them gifts and upgrades.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], fairies can be found around the springs of the four great fairies. There is a fifth fairy named Malayna, but she is not a Great Fairy; instead, she is known as the Horse God and can revive dead horses. Fairies can be used to cook potions and other food; if they are used in making a dish, they increase the amount of hearts the food heals before disappearing from the player's inventory.\n\n===Gerudo===\nThe {{nihongo|Gerudo|\u30b2\u30eb\u30c9}} are a tribe of humanoid [[Theft|thieves]] who mainly live in the desert. Physical Gerudo traits typically include bronzed skin, scarlet hair, aquiline noses, gold eyes and round ears; however, evil Gerudo like Ganondorf and the Twinrova Sisters possess an olive skin color. Gerudo sentries carry [[pole weapon|polearms]] reminiscent of the Japanese ''[[naginata]]''. Apart from a single Gerudo male who is born every century and is crowned king of the tribe, the race consists entirely of women.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Nabooru: \"A kid like you may not know this, but the Gerudo race consists only of women. Only one man is born every hundred years\u2026 Even though our laws say that lone male Gerudo must become King of the Gerudo, I'll never bow to such an evil man!\"</ref> [[Ganon]]dorf, the main antagonist of the series, is king of the Gerudo in ''Ocarina of Time'' and the surrogate son of the twin Gerudo witch sisters Kotake and Koume. Gerudo appear as pirates in ''Majora's Mask'', where they live in the ocean at Great Bay, and are ruled by a woman instead of a man.  These Gerudo are enemies of the Zoras. They search for treasures in the sea and assault Zora and fishermen but do not approach Clock Town. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', only women are permitted in the town, so [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] has to [[crossdress]] as a female in order to enter the town. After gaining entrance to Gerudo Town, Link has to retrieve a thunder-resistant helmet known as the Thunder Helm from a clan of thieves called the Yiga, a traitorous formation who broke away from the Sheikah tribe. The helm is used to board Vah Naboris, named after the Sage of Spirit, Nabooru, as stated by the spirit of former Gerudo Champion Urbosa.\n\n===Goron===\n[[File:Goron.JPG|thumb|A Goron, as seen in ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'']]\nThe {{nihongo|Goron|\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3}} are a race of mountain-dwelling [[giant]]s who first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''. Goron culture revolves around brotherhood and strength, usually referring to each other and those they deem strong as \"Brother\" or \"Big Brother\". Gorons show high regard for individuals who display great strength and bravery and enjoy matching their strength with others in competition such as [[sumo wrestling]]<ref><!--\"They like sumo wrestling\"-->In-game trophy description of a \"Goron\" from [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008).</ref> and [[racing]]. While not all ''Zelda'' games featuring Gorons include full tribes, the games that do depict as tribes depict them as headed by a [[patriarch]] who is aided by one or more elders who assume leadership of the tribe in the event that the patriarch cannot. {{nihongo|Darunia|\u30c0\u30eb\u30cb\u30a2}} is the patriarch in ''Ocarina of Time''. The Goron elders in ''Twilight Princess'' are {{nihongo|Gor Coron|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Don Kor\u014dne}}, {{nihongo|Gor Amoto|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30b2\u30eb|Don S\u012bgeru}} {{nihongo|Gor Ebizo|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30d3\u30fc\u30be|Don Eb\u012bzo}}, and {{nihongo|Gor Liggs|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30ec\u30b2\u30fc\u30cc|Don Reg\u0113nu}}.\n\nOne of the oldest races in Hyrule, Gorons' bodies are resistant to intense heat and lava and they consume rocks and minerals,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap'', Goron figurine: \"These rock- and iron-eaters once lived on Mount Crenel in Western Hyrule.\"</ref><ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \"You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all of your green rocks? If you don't, you won't grow up big and strong!\"</ref> which they mine from the earth. By adulthood, most Gorons gain rock-like protrusions on their backs and sometimes on their arms and head as well. These stony growths act as a natural armor and continue to grow as the Goron ages. Gorons enter the [[fetal position]] when resting, and can also assume this position for self defense or to travel at high speed by [[Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend|rolling]]. Gorons endowed with magic power can sprout metal spikes from their body while rolling.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani's memorial: \"If Gorons who possess magic power roll swiftly enough, spikes will emerge from their bodies so that they may mow down enemies.\"</ref>\n\nFor leisure, Gorons enjoy music and dance, rolling and racing,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \u201cThis wild rolling is the only way to relieve my stress!\u201d [\u2026] \u201cLet me express my joy with more wild rolling!\u201d</ref> games,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages'', Goron: \"We Gorons love games!\"</ref> sumo wrestling, and bathing in hot springs. Gorons have taken on occupations such as crafting, blacksmithing, sculpting, demolition, and merchantry. Rock sirloin, [[amber]], and metal shields are some Goron delicacies.\n\nThree Gorons appear in ''Skyward Sword:'' Gorko, Golo, and Gortram. Gorko and his assistant Golo, are shown working as archaeologists; Gorko travels the land researching ancient artifacts and ruins, while Golo excavates the Lanayru Caves. Unlike the other two, Gortram works as the proprietor of the Rickety Coaster mine cart ride at the abandoned Lanayru Shipyards. All three Gorons are encountered in the Lanayru Desert region at some point and the Lanayru Caves seems to serve as the base of operations for Gorko and Golo.\n\nGorons are large humanoids with long muscular arms, stout legs, hulking shoulders and necks, and rotund bellies. Their skin is generally beige in color and their hair is typically white. Gorons lack external hearing organs; Goron ears are instead holes on the sides of their heads. Most are as tall as a human, though some individuals such as {{nihongo|Biggoron|\u30c0\u30a4\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3|Daigoron}} can grow as large as a mountain. To date, no female Gorons have been seen in the series, but they do exist, as child and baby Gorons do appear and Darunia has a son during the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. Due to their great density, Gorons sink to the bottom of bodies of water and are thus helpless in such an environment. However, they do not need to breath to survive, as a Goron child proves by resting underwater and mentioning that he never feels the need to take a breath. Also, in ''Twilight Princess'', a Goron becomes submerged in the main pool in Zora's Domain, but enjoys the cold water rather than drowning.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani III's memorial: \"Water is disastrous for Goron heroes, for they sink like stones and are rendered motionless in the deep. Beware.\"</ref> Gorons are exceptionally resistant to heat and can walk through shallow [[lava]].\n\nIn ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of the deceased Goron hero Darmani and roll and punch as hard as the Megaton Hammer from ''Ocarina of Time.''\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the Gorons are encountered all over Hyrule, but mostly appear in the Eldin region. They live around Death Mountain, which Link must use heat-resistant armor or elixirs to enter.\n\n===Hylian===<!-- In the official game they call them \"Hylians\". They also call them this on Zelda Universe. (Nintendo's official website) -->\n{{Redirect|Hylian|the language|#Hylian language}}\n{{nihongo|Hylians|\u30cf\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u65cf|Hairia-zoku}} are an [[elf]]-like race that make up the main population of Hyrule, which they established organized civilization on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |title=Zelda Universe |publisher=Zelda.com |accessdate=2012-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207075201/http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |archive-date=2013-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They are born with magic-infused blood said to be a gift from [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|the goddesses]] that grants them psychic powers and magical skill. Their long pointed ears are said to allow them to hear messages sent by the gods. Link and Princess Zelda belong to this race in all games of the series. In some games, such as ''Twilight Princess'', Hylians are referred to as \"humans\". In ''Skyward Sword'', Hylians live on a floating island known as Skyloft and are accompanied by bird-like creatures called Loftwings.\n\n===Keaton===\n{{nihongo|Keaton|\u30ad\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3|K\u012btan}} are a three-tailed fox-like race mostly found in Termina. They normally stay hidden from sight, but reveal themselves to Link and challenge him with a quiz if he wears a Keaton Mask. No known Keaton exist in Hyrule in ''Ocarina of Time'', although at least one of them is a well-known fictional character in Hyrule Castle Town.<ref name=\"Keaton-1\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'': \"Oh, I know that character! It's Keaton! He's very hot in Hyrule Castle Town right now!\"</ref><ref name=\"Keaton-2\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Death Mountain Guard: \"Oh? Is that a \"Kee...something...\" character mask? I heard he's very popular recently? He's my boy's favorite.\"</ref> In ''The Minish Cap'', however, some thuggish Keaton roam the Hyrule countryside, walking on their hindpaws and having only one tail instead of three; if they injure Link, he loses some Rupees.\n\n===Kikwi===\nThe {{nihongo|Kikwi|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a4\u65cf|Kyui-zoku}} are a race in ''Skyward Sword'' who inhabit the Faron Woods. They have the appearance of black-and-white masked wingless birds, and can cause a plant to blossom from their backs for camouflage.\n\n===Kokiri and Koroks===\nThe {{nihongo|Kokiri|\u30b3\u30ad\u30ea\u65cf|Kokiri-zoku}} are a [[pixie]]-like race who inhabit the Kokiri Forest. They were created by the Great Deku Tree who considers them to be his children, and each receives a small fairy that is their lifelong friend, guardian, and teacher. They do not age once they grow up into kids. Cautious and secretive, the Kokiri believe that they will die if they leave the forest.<ref>'': Ocarina of Time'', Kokiri boy: \"The Great Deku Tree said that if a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or she will die!\"</ref> This belief seems to be false, as Saria leaves the forest when she becomes the Forest Sage. It is also suggested that if they wander too deep into the forest, they will turn into a Skull Kid, although this has not been proven definitively.\n\nA Kokiri named Saria is the Sage of the Forest. Another Kokiri, Fado, is the first Sage of Wind in ''The Wind Waker'', but he is killed prior to the events of the game, leaving the player to interact with his spirit and locate his successor, the Korok Makar. Link was raised as a Kokiri in ''Ocarina of Time'', but he is actually a Hylian whose mother entrusted the Great Deku Tree with his care when he was an infant. It wasn't until he traveled into the future when getting the Master Sword that Link found out he wasn't a Kokiri by aging.\n\nThe {{nihongo|Koroks|\u30b3\u30ed\u30b0|Korogu}} of ''The Wind Waker'' are said to have been transformed from the Kokiri after the Great Flood.<ref name=\"Kokiri forms\">''The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'', Great Deku Tree: \"Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks took on human forms, but when they came to live on the sea, they took these shapes.\"</ref> They are small creatures with wood-like bodies and masks made from leaves. They are very light, which allows them to travel by using sprouts as propellers. They leave their home, the \"Forest Haven\", to plant seeds from the Great Deku Tree all over the world, and return once a year to hold a ceremony and obtain more seeds.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Koroks can be found all over Hyrule. The player must solve puzzles to get Korok Seeds from them. Once the player retrieves Korok Seeds from Koroks, one can trade it with Hestu, a large Korok, for more inventory slots for swords, shields, and bows.\n\n===Light Spirits===\nThere are four {{nihongo|Light Spirits|\u5149\u306e\u7cbe\u970a|Hikari no Seirei}} throughout Hyrule in ''Twilight Princess''.\n\nThe first light spirit is {{Nihongo|Ordona|\u30e9\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30cc|Rato\u0101nu}}, who resembles an Ordon Goat. Ordona has an orb between her antlers and first appears at Ordon Spring when Link has defeated the first Shadow Beast.\n\nThe second light spirit, {{nihongo|Faron|\u30d5\u30a3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Fir\u014dne}}, resembles a monkey. He holds his golden orb with his tail over his head. He appears in Faron Spring when Link has completed the first collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe third light spirit, {{nihongo|Eldin|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|Orudin}}, resembles an eagle with his orb between his feet. He appears in the lake near the shaman's house in Kakariko Village once Link has completed the second collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe fourth and last light spirit, {{nihongo|Lanayru|\u30e9\u30cd\u30fc\u30eb|Ran\u0113ru}}, resembles a serpent with his orb inside his mouth. He appears in the cave at Lake Hylia when Link has completed the third and final collection of twilight bugs. But after Lanayru tells Link the story of the three goddesses and the three Fused Shadows, Zant appears and embeds the Shadow Crystal in Link's skull that later allows him to transform between his human and wolf form. He also exposes Midna to Lanayru's light causing her to become very ill and sends Link on the quest for the Master Sword.\n\n===Lokomo===\n{{nihongo|Lokomos|\u30ed\u30b3\u30e2|Rokomo}} are a humanoid race who first appear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]''. All but one of the encountered Lokomo are sages who reside in the New Hyrule and the Tower of Spirits. They are distinguishable by their pointed ears and short legs, the latter of which forces them to use motorized carts for transportation.  However, an exceptionally strong Lokomo named Byrne is capable of walking on his legs.\n\n===Oocca===\nThe {{nihongo|Oocca|\u5929\u7a7a\u4eba|Tenk\u016b-jin|lit. \"sky people\"}}  are a race of birds with long necks and human-like faces that appear in ''Twilight Princess''. They live in the {{nihongo|\"City in the Sky\"|\u5929\u7a7a\u90fd\u5e02|Tenk\u016b Toshi}},<ref>\"One of the Oocca, Ooccoo travels around with her son in search of a means to return to her home, the City in the Sky.\" [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008). Ooccoo & Son in-game trophy description.</ref> an airborne city that acts as the seventh [[dungeon]] in ''Twilight Princess''. A female Oocca named {{nihongo|Ooccoo|\u304a\u3070\u3061\u3083\u3093|Oba-chan}} can warp the player back to the entrance of the game's dungeons. Ooccoo's son, {{nihongo|Ooccoo Jr|\u307c\u304f\u3061\u3083\u3093|Boku-chan}}, warps the player to Ooccoo's location. In ''Twilight Princess'', these creatures are mentioned to be closer to the gods than the Hylians. It is supposed that they created Hylians and created a city in the sky for them to live in. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link reaches this city by launching himself out of an enormous cannon.\n\n===Minish===\nMinish, referred to in their native language as {{nihongo|Picori|\u30d4\u30c3\u30b3\u30eb|Pikkoru|inspired by the [[Koropokkuru]]}}, are small humanoid [[Sprite (folklore)|sprites]] no bigger than a human [[thumb]] that live in secret. They are only visible to children and tend to live in forests, but also appear inside of buildings and holes in and around various spots of Hyrule. There are three variations of the Minish, which can be distinguished by their attire: Forest Minish, Town Minish and Mountain Minish. They first appear in ''The Minish Cap''. Most Minish are helpful, and like to hide valuable objects for others to find, although one Picori, {{nihongo|Vaati|\u30b0\u30d5\u30fc|Guf\u016b}} became evil after becoming obsessed with human nature.\n\n===Mogma===\nThe {{nihongo|Mogma|\u30e2\u30b0\u30de\u65cf|Moguma-zoku}} are long-armed anthropomorphic rodents who debuted in ''Skyward Sword.'' They are demolition experts who like digging for treasure and are known to never go anywhere without their bomb bag.  Mogmas are found in Eldin Volcano and play major parts in the plot of the Volcano Summit, Eldin Volcano, the Fire Sanctuary, and the Earth Temple.\n\n===Parella===\nThe {{nihongo|Parella|\u30d1\u30e9\u30b2\u65cf|Parage-zoku}} are an aquatic squid-like race who debuted in ''Skyward Sword'' who live in the underwater spiraling caverns of Lake Floria. Conical spirals appear as their central body and the shape of their dwellings.\n\n===Rito===\nThe {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} are a race of bird-like humanoids who debuted in ''The Wind Waker''. In that game, they lived on Dragon Roost Island, an island on the Great Sea. They have a tribal elder and elaborately dressed guards. No Rito is born with wings, and instead, must visit their guardian, the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in a coming-of-age ceremony to receive one of his scales, which enables them to grow wings.\n\nRito appear to be covered by dark shaded skin or feathers. Most Rito have red eyes, but the Rito Chieftain has yellow eyes. They have pointed ears,  bird-like feet, and a beak whose shape and size varies from Rito to Rito. Unlike real-life birds, his beak appears to only be used for smelling, and cannot be used as a mouth. However, the Rito have a mouth below this beak.\n\nThroughout a young Rito's childhood, he or she is called a Fledgling and is flightless without any wings. After a child reaches a certain age they can receive their wings after they retrieve a scale from the dragon Valoo. While not in use,  Rito wings are mostly white with black colored plumage along the ends. When in flight the top of a Rito's wings are colored brown with black along the edges while the bottoms of the wings contain white plumage along the wings interior. However Medli has pure white wings, possibly suggesting that female Rito have white wings or that her wings are not fully grown yet. Most Rito can fly over a great distance and hover in place, but some have trouble flying for long periods of time, likely due to inexperience.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], the Rito reside in the Tabantha region in northwest Hyrule. The Rito cannot fly at a preferred height because the Divine Beast Vah Medoh shoots down Rito who fly at its height. The Rito warrior Teba helps Link board Vah Medoh, but is severely injured by Medoh's cannons. After Link defeats Windblight Ganon, the Rito Champion Revali regains control of Vah Medoh and prepares to blast Ganon when Link finally fights him. Notably, Revali resents Link, stating that he has many skills as an archer, and that he was only called to assist Link because Link has the Master Sword.\n\n===Sheikah===\nThe {{nihongo|Sheikah|\u30b7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc|Sh\u012bk\u0101}} are an ancient clan of mysterious [[ninja]]-like warriors distinguished by, but not limited to, red eyes, and white hair, who protect the Hylian Royal Family.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Professor Shikashi: \"Have you heard the legend of the \"Shadow Folk\"? They are the Sheikah...the shadows of the Hylians. They say they swore allegiance to the King of Hyrule and guarded the Royal Family.\"</ref> They bear some physical resemblance the to Hylians, but are a completely different species, with much more technological prowess and lifespans that can extend over many millennia. As revealed in ''Skyward Sword'', the Sheikah are servants of the goddess Hylia, whose reincarnation is Zelda. The Sheikah crying eye symbol is commonly seen in the series, even in games where the Sheikah are not present. It is alluded that the tear was added after the Hyrule Civil War, which took place some time before the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. By the events of ''Ocarina of Time'', the Sheikah are referred to as an extinct race who built the Shadow Temple, with Impa among the last few members. In ''Skyward Sword'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''Majora's Mask'', Sheikah Stones or Gossip Stones created by the Sheikah give Link information on where to go and what to do.\n\nVery few Sheikah members are met throughout the games, with the only recurring one being various incarnations of Zelda's [[nursemaid]] Impa. Others include Impa's descendant Impaz and the [[fortune-telling|fortune-teller]] Madame Fanadi, both from ''Twilight Princess'', and the Composer Brothers from ''Ocarina of Time'', who researched magical music for the Royal Family before killing themselves when Ganondorf demanded the fruits of their labour. They are met in an undead form, as Poes, in the Kakariko Graveyard.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the ancient Sheikah invented the Divine Beasts and Guardians 10,000 years before the Great Calamity to fight Ganon. The Sheikah reside primarily in Kakariko Village, but can be found elsewhere, such as the two Ancient Tech Labs or in Tarrey Town. An old painter named Pikango left Kakariko Village many years ago to search for beautiful landscapes, and uses his knowledge to help Link locate his memories. Link also possesses a Sheikah Slate, a piece of ancient technology that can be upgraded with various runes. The four primary Runes are Magnesis, which can move metallic objects; Remote Bombs, circular or cube-shaped bombs that can remotely detonate once thrown or dropped; Stasis, which can freeze objects and monsters; and Cryonis, which can create icy blocks on watery surfaces.\n\nAdditionally in ''Breath of the Wild'' is a group of rebellious, antagonistic Sheikah known as the Yiga Clan. 10,000 years ago, after the First Great Calamity, the Sheikah split due to the king of the time exiling them out of fear of their technology. Some remained loyal, and went to live as peaceful farmers in Kakariko Village. Others felt betrayed, and turned against the kingdom, becoming a militant Sheikah group  and siding with Calamity Ganon due to both now having a common enemy. They then adopted an upside-down Sheikah eye as their symbol. Just over 100 years ago, when the Calamity's return was inevitable, the militant Sheikah came out of hiding. Spearheaded by Master Kohga, whose family had lead for at least four generations, they called themselves the Yiga Clan and went on the hunt for the enemies of the Calamity, including Link and Princess Zelda, but were pushed back and forced to make a hideout in an abandoned Gerudo archaeological site. Their hideout is located in Karusa Valley in the Gerudo Highlands. They spawn throughout the world and sometimes appear as lost travelers or merchants who will attack Link if he talks to them. There are three types of Yiga Clansmen: Yiga Footsoldiers, who may ambush Link with a Duplex Bow which can fire two arrows at once, or may disguise as a Hylian, only to reveal themselves and fight with a Vicious Sickle or a Demon Carver; Yiga Blademasters, who carry around a Windcleaver, and Master Kogha, a large master of esoteric arts who waits in the Yiga Clan Hideout while his minions search for Link. He is referenced by certain disguised Yiga. One Kakariko Villager, the guard Dorian, is an ex-Yiga member. After being stationed there, he found a wife who bore two daughters with him, Koko and Cottla, all of whom made him want to change his ways; the Yiga murdered his wife when they discovered his defection.\n\nIt is also here that the Sheikah are shown as a race with diversity, with many members sporting grey, brown or blue eyes and some having varying hair colour. Only one member, Purah, the ancient researcher and older sister of Impa, is shown to have red eyes. Jerrin, wife of elderly researcher Robbie, and her son Grant\u00e9 are the only two members with blonde hair, and Rola, as well as the entire Yiga Clan, exhibit black hair. Rola and as the elderly couple Steen and Trissa have brown skin; the other members have skin ranging from pale to tan.\n\n===Subrosian===\n{{nihongo|Subrosians|\u30a6\u30fc\u30e9|\u016ara}} are a mysterious race that live in the subterranean world of Subrosia in ''Oracle of Seasons''. They have large glowing eyes and are always seen wearing either green, blue or red hooded cloaks. There are two exceptions: Rosa, who wears a yellow cloak with a ribbon, and another unnamed yellow-clothed Subrosian who gives Link a Secret to use in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are shy when around people of other races and prefer to be rarely seen. They can survive in lava and use a currency made of metal rocks found in the ground called Ore Chunks.\n\n===Tokay===\n{{nihongo|Tokay|\u30c8\u30ab\u30b2\u4eba|Tokage-jin|lit. \"lizard people\"}} are green-scaled lizards who reside on Crescent Island in Labrynna in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are known to search for valuable items and be deceitful. They are also expert gardeners which can grow scent seeds from seedlings over a course of four hundred years. They have never seen anyone from other races, so when they see Link, they think he is a Tokay without a tail and call him \"Strange Tokay\".\n\n===Twili===\n{{nihongo|Twili|\u30c8\u30ef\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u6c11|Towairaito no Tami}} are a race that come from the Twilight Realm and first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' They are the descendants of the Dark Interlopers, who were sent to the Twilight Realm by the {{nihongo|Golden Goddesses|\u4e09\u67f1\u306e\u5973\u795e|Mihashira no Megami <small>Three Goddesses</small>}} after trying to seize control of the Sacred Realm. Eventually, they abandoned their plans to rule the Sacred Realm and Hyrule and became peacefully adapted to the Twilight Realm. One member of their race is {{nihongo|[[Midna]]|\u30df\u30c9\u30ca|Midona}}. {{nihongo|Zant|\u30b6\u30f3\u30c8|Zanto}} was also part of this race. He overthrew Midna with Ganon's help and helped Ganon take over Hyrule.\n\nThe skin tone of the Twili is mostly black while their faces, necks, and chest tend to be gray. The Twili have long limbs, necks, and heads, and great variances in appearance.\n\n===Wizzrobes===\n{{nihongo|Wizzrobes|\u30a6\u30a3\u30ba\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Wizur\u014dbu}} are [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] creatures that wear [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] robes and often use fire and ice magic. In ''The Wind Waker,'' they can also summon other enemies and wear [[toucan]]-like or bird-like masks and headdresses. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda.]]''\n\n''Breath of the Wild'' introduced Electric Wizzrobes, who use Lighting or Thunderstorm Rods. They can teleport and shoot electricity. The other Wizzrobes can also teleport and shoot fire and ice respectively.\n\n===Yeti===\nYetis are creatures that resemble the 'real-life' yeti, but have large beaver-like tails and speak with poor grammar. The females are smaller than the males and wear an armless sweater, showing no arms or tail. {{nihongo|Yeta|\u30de\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3|Mat\u014dnya}} and {{nihongo|Yeto|\u30c9\u30b5\u30f3\u30b3\u30d5|Dosankofu}}, characters who live in Snowpeak Ruins in ''Twilight Princess'' were {{nihongo|[[Yeti]]s|\u96ea\u7537|yukiotoko}}.<ref><!--\"The wife of Yeto.

Brawl]] (2008) In-game trophy description of the \"Yeta\" trophy.</ref> Yeto helps Link by giving him soup that heals up to eight hearts of his health.\n\n===Zora===\nThe {{nihongo|Zora|\u30be\u30fc\u30e9|Z\u014dra}{ZOR-ah}} are a race of aquatic [[piscine humanoid]]s that appear in nearly every game of the series. In the original game and ''Link to the Past'', Zoras were enemies that attacked Link from the water with projectiles, though the giant Zora King sells Link a pair of flippers in ''A Link to the Past'', allowing him to swim and to use the network of whirlpools that link far corners of Hyrule. By ''Ocarina of Time'', their role in most stories had changed to a neutral or friendly race. Zoras rely heavily on water, and can only live on land for limited time periods.<ref>[[Super Smash Brothers Brawl]] (2008). In game trophy description of the \"Zora\" trophy.</ref> Zoras are mostly seen gracefully swimming about and frolicking in water. Besides routine swimming and sports, Zoras also enjoy music.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040347/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/z.jsp \"Led by their King, the Zoras are peaceful creatures who enjoy music and sports\"]</ref>\n\nMost Zoras do not wear [[clothing]], and they are generally covered in silver [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], which give them a pale blue sheen from a distance. Where humans sometimes have long hair, average Zoras have rear-hanging [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] extensions that resemble tails. These tails undulate periodically, which gives a Zora's head the unique semblance of a fish. They are sometimes depicted as having webbed feet and hands. They lack ears in the traditional sense, but do have pronounced noses and gills on their abdomen. Their fins can be used to fight by extending out to serve as sharp weapons. Zoras lay [[egg]]s to reproduce. Zora eggs need to be kept in cold, clean water to develop healthily, and every egg from the same [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] must be kept together for them to hatch. Newborn Zoras are [[tadpole]]-like with a circular body and a long, skinny tail ending in a [[wikt:fluke|fluke]].\n\nZora government is apparently [[Monarchy|monarchical]], either ruled by a king, {{nihongo|King Zora|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30be\u30fc\u30e9|Kinguz\u014dra}}, or queen, such as Queen {{nihongo|Rutela|\u30eb\u30c6\u30e9|Rutera}} from ''Twilight Princess''. Two different tribes exist: \"river Zora\" are more violent and can shoot fire, while \"sea Zora\" make up the friendly Zoras. The Zora Royal Family is responsible for maintaining order among their people, overseeing care for {{nihongo|Jabu Jabu|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6}}, whom they worship as a guardian god,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', [[King Zora]]: \u201cOur guardian god, Lord Jabu-Jabu, would never eat my dear [[Princess Ruto]]!\u201d</ref> and assuring that the waters upon which he and all creatures rely are clean and pure.\n\nThe Zora appear to be extinct in ''The Wind Waker''; a sage named {{nihongo|Laruto|\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8|Raruto}} is encountered in spirit. They may be linked to the {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} race, along with Princess {{nihongo|Ruto|\u30eb\u30c8}}. The Zora typically inhabit fresh water such as Zora River and Lake Hylia, while sea-dwelling Zora are known to appear in Termina (''Majora's Mask'') and Labrynna (''Oracle of Ages'')\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'', Link is able to inhabit the body of the Zora Mikau, who was killed by Gerudo pirates, and can use his fins in the same manner as the boomerang.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Zoras are a major part of the game. Link must head to Zora's Domain in Lanayru to meet with King Dorephan and Prince Sidon. The King called for a Hylian because Zora's Domain was in danger of being washed away by Divine Beast Vah Ruta, who was at the East Reservoir Lake. Muzu, a Zora elder and the King's assistant, resents Link, because him and most Zora elders blame Link for the death of the beloved Zora Champion and Princess, Mipha. After realizing that Link has had a special connection with the princess, he tasks Link with finding 20 Shock Arrows from Ploymus Mountain, which is guarded by a Lynel. After retrieving the arrows, Link heads for the East Reservoir Lake to board Vah Ruta. Once he regains control of the beast, Mipha appears as a spirit and grants Link her healing ability. She then moves Vah Ruta to a location that isn't blocked so she can have a direct lock on Hyrule Castle and assist Link in fighting Ganon.\n\n===Creatures===\nNote: Some creatures' outlook may vary in different titles of the series.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Armos'''|\u30a2\u30e2\u30b9|Amosu}} are animated statues built to guard ancient ruins that come to life and attack when disturbed. ''The Minish Cap'' features them as guards created by the Wind Tribe. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Beamos'''|\u30d3\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9|B\u012bmosu}} like Armos are statues built to guard ancient ruins. Beamos sit stationary scanning the room with a single rotating \"eye\". When they spot an intruder they fire off a high powered laser that tracks the target some distance. They first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Biri and Bari'''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2|G\u014dria}} are electrified jellyfish that can hover in the air. Striking them with a metal weapon causes Link to be electrocuted. They often split into smaller duplicates after being attacked.\n*'''Blade Traps''': Indestructible metallic devices armed with spikes. Some sense intruders and fly towards them, while others move in a set pattern.

In ''The Wind Waker'' their appearance was changed to upright, opaque bodies and vibrantly colored faces. They first appeared by that name in ''Majora's Mask'', but two similar blob-type enemies were in the original ''The Legend of Zelda'' named \"Bit\" and \"Bot\", and a Bot became two Bits when Link slashed it, similar to the behavior of ChuChus in newer titles. Modern ChuChus come in Green, Red (the two most common colors), Yellow, Blue and dark Purple. They aggressively attack anything that invades their territory by tackling it, but will hide in puddles on the ground if no one is close. They mostly move by bouncing around, though the Green, Yellow and Blue ChuChus will occasionally melt and turn into small invincible puddles, and proceed to move around in their puddle forms until they can get close to Link, or until Link uses an item such as his Boomerang to stun and coax them out of their puddles. In ''Twilight Princess'', after one is killed, Link can use their puddles as potions or lantern fuel, depending on the type of ChuChu. In ''Skyward Sword'', ChuChus come in a variety of colors: Green, red (fire), blue (underwater), and yellow (electricity). ChuChus' sizes also vary a lot, depending on their color. The smallest can be defeated with one sword strike, the medium-sized need to be hit multiple times, and the largest ones can be split into two smaller ones with a vertical slash. In ''Breath of the Wild'', ChuChus came in four different forms, normal, fire, ice, and electric. They come in a big or small size. They will jump around and sometimes pounce at Link. If they charge at Link, they will lose their element and become dark and faded, but retain their color. They are vulnerable at this point to attack. They will try to regain their elemental power if left for too long without being killed. Once they are defeated, they will drop ChuChu jelly, which will stay in the element they are, unless an elemental arrow or weapon is used on it to change the element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14-skyward-sword-enemies.php#ChuchuBlue |title=Zelda Dungeon Wiki: Enemies: ChuChus |publisher=Zeldadungeon.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>\n*{{nihongo|'''Cuccos'''|\u30b3\u30c3\u30b3|Kokko}} are a type of Hylian [[chicken]] commonly domesticated for their eggs and meat.

Some breeds of Cucco, like blue and gold Cuccos can even outright fly while being held. While normally docile, Cuccos will become angry if attacked repeatedly and crow to summon a flock of Cuccos to attack the aggressor until he or she dies or leaves the area. Cuccos first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''. They mostly come in white, although ''The Minish Cap'' had gold Cuccos and ''Twilight Princess'' had black, brown, golden and grey variants as well.

Only a few mountaintops are still visible above the water, and these form the islands and [[archipelago]]s of the Great Sea. Due to the relatively small size of the many islands, the large expanses of ocean between each island require the player to use charts to navigate from island to island.

It is one of the few weapons capable of harming [[Ganon]] and a key to the Sacred Realm. First introduced in ''[[A Link To The Past]]'', it has the power to \"repel evil\", which enables it to overcome powerful dark magic and evil beings and keep them from using the sword. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'', the blade originally began as the Goddess Sword, which has a sentient female avatar named Fi integrated into it. Eventually, the Goddess Sword transforms into its current state after being infused with the Three Sacred Flames, with Fi's spirit form ceasing to be once the Master Sword absorbs Demise's remains.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/16/e3-2010-nintendo-developer-roundtable-live-blog E3 2010: Nintendo Developer Roundtable Live Blog]. [[IGN]], June 15, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe sword traditionally rests in [[wiktionary:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] locations indigenous to [[#Hyrule|Hyrule]], such as the Temple of Time or the Lost Woods. Similar to [[Arthurian legend]], the Master Sword is often obtained by [[Sword in the stone (King Arthur)|pulling it from a stone pedestal]]. The sword is often not at full power, leading it to need to be \"recharged\" in some way, or have its power increased beyond its standard level to fight Ganon. There are some situations when the blade, already at full power, can be further improved; in ''[[A Link to the Past]]'', it was tempered to the Tempered Sword. It can later be upgraded to the Golden Sword. Similarly, in ''[[Twilight Princess]]'', the sword's power is increased by the two Sols in the Palace of Twilight. ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' establishes that the sword needs the power of two sages praying to the gods to keep its powers, or else it will no longer be able to prevent an evil person from gaining the Triforce.<ref>[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]], King of Red Lions: The fact that the Master Sword lost the power to repel evil suggests to me that something has happened to the sages who infused the blade with the gods\u2019 power. The sages should be in Hyrule...  in the Wind Temple to the north and the Earth Temple to the south, praying to the gods.</ref> In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'' the Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, though if it is used too often the sword's power needs to be recharged becoming temporarily unusable. The sword is located in the Korok Forest, which Link can only access by going through the Lost Woods. Zelda moved it there to be guarded by the Great Deku Tree and to protect knowledge of its location from Calamity Ganon. Link can travel to the Korok Forest at any point after receiving the Paraglider, though he can only remove the sword after obtaining 13 or more Heart Containers, as removing it drains Link's hearts as a way to test his strength. In addition to its unbreakability, Link can also fire Sword Beams while he is at full health. The Master Sword has a base damage of 30 but its true power glows when in the presence of pools of Calamity Ganon's Malice, Cursed Enemies, and all of Calamity Ganon's various forms; its durability is greatly increased in this state. It can later be enhanced to 60 damage once completing the \"trial of the sword\" side quest.\n\nOnce removed, Link sees a vision of Zelda entrusting the Master Sword to the protection of the Great Deku Tree 100 years ago. During her conversation with him, Princess Zelda reveals that the sword spoke to her (which is implied to be Fi, whose consciousness apparently still exists within the sword though unable to manifest her spirit form) and told her that her destiny was not finished and that she still had something she must do, leading to Princess Zelda's sealing Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle for 100 years while Link slept. The weapon's in-game description reveals that the sword is delighted to be in Link's possession, echoing Fi's words at the end of ''Skyward Sword''. 100 years after Calamity Ganon was sealed in Hyrule Castle, the sword became known across Hyrule as the Sword that Seals the Darkness and is sought by several travelers Link encounters despite the fact that only the chosen hero can wield its power.\n\nThe Master Sword is a [[Arming sword|double-edged one-handed sword]]. The blade cross-section is hexagonal with no [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]]. On the flats of the blade near the [[hilt]] is a [[Triforce]] symbol, etched into the steel or emblazoned in gold. It has a blue or purple curved [[Guard (weapon)|crossguard]] in the shape of a pair of wings with a small yellow jewel where it meets the hilt. The hilt is often padded red with a non-ornate blue [[Pommel (sword)|pommel]]. Since ''The Wind Waker'', the Master Sword's blade glows white when it is revived by the [[Wise old man|sages]] in the mid-game. In ''Breath of the Wild'', this glow represents the Master Sword's true power. ''Breath of the Wild'' is the first game to depict the blade showing signs of wear and rust, when Zelda places it in its pedestal in Korok Forest, though 100 years later the Master Sword is shown to have been restored to its undamaged state.\n\n[[Nintendo Power]] listed the Master Sword as one of the best weapons in gaming: citing that it is more than just a powerful sword, but also integral to Link's adventures and development as a character.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nintendo Power 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |page=44 |title-link=Nintendo Power }}</ref>\n\n===Triforce===\n{{main|Triforce}}\n[[File:Triforce.svg|thumb|210px|The Triforce is represented as three conjoined golden triangles, with one triangle placed above the other two.]]\nThe {{nihongo|Triforce|\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9|Toraif\u014dsu}}, also called {{nihongo|\"Power of the Gods\"|\u795e\u306e\u529b|Kami no Chikara}} and the {{nihongo|\"Golden Triangle\"|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u5927\u4e09\u89d2|\u014cgon no Dai-Sankaku}}, is a triangular sacred [[relic]] left behind by the three [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Golden Goddesses|Golden Goddesses]] when they created Hyrule.

These embody the essences of [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|their respective goddesses]], and bestow certain boons on their bearers. In most of its appearances, the Triforce or its pieces manifest as a marking on the hands of their bearers. These markings resonate when near each other, and the Triforce pieces can emerge from their bearers as a result.\n\nWhen united, the Triforce allows one who touches it to make a wish that usually lasts until they die or the wish is fulfilled. If the one who finds it does not possess a balance of the three virtues it represents, however, the pieces split into its three components and the finder is left with the one that represents the characteristic they value most; the other two pieces do likewise with two other characters \"chosen by destiny\". Ganon makes it his goal to obtain the Triforce in various games, often having a single piece himself (the Triforce of Power) that he uses to further his goals.\n\nThe Triforce of Power, which is positioned as the topmost of the three, holds the presence of Din, the goddess of Power, and radiates the physical and magical power of its bearer. It is associated with [[Ganon]], who is power-hungry. The Triforce of Wisdom, positioned on the lower left, embodies the essence of Nayru, the goddess of Wisdom, and amplifies the wisdom and mystical powers of its bearer. It is associated with [[Princess Zelda]], whose great wisdom brings peace and prosperity to Hyrule. The Triforce of Courage, positioned on the lower right, embodies the essence of Farore, the goddess of Courage, and seems to amplify the courage and adventuring skills of its bearer. It is associated with [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], who bravely defends Hyrule from Ganon and other malevolent forces.\n\n==Other worlds==\n===Termina===\n{{nihongo|Termina|\u30bf\u30eb\u30df\u30ca|Tarumina}} is a parallel world to Hyrule that serves as the main setting of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]''. Link falls into this world from a portal deep within the Lost Woods. The land has very similar geography to that of Hyrule, and many of its citizens have identical names and appearances to (although different personalities from) people in Hyrule. The land itself is split into four distinct regions, one for every compass direction, and each guarded by four giant deities: The [[swamp]]y Woodfall, home of the Deku Scrubs, to the south; The icy Snowhead Mountains of the Gorons to the north; Great Bay, home of the Zora to the west; and the undead wastelands of Ikana Canyon to the east. Its capital, Clock Town, lies in the center.\n\n===Lorule===\n{{nihongo|Lorule|\u30ed\u30a6\u30e9\u30eb|Rouraru}} is a parallel world to Hyrule in ''A Link Between Worlds''. It is similar to Hyrule in geography, features Lorulean counterparts of many people found in Hyrule, and is ruled by Princess Zelda's Lorulean counterpart, Princess Hilda. Like Hyrule, Lorule originally had its own Triforce and was the source of various conflicts. However, the Royal Family of Lorule decided to destroy the Triforce in an attempt to put an end to conflict, only to bring calamity to their world as a result. Desperate to save the kingdom and her people, Princess Hilda conspired with her servant Yuga to steal Hyrule's Triforce, unaware that Yuga wanted the Triforce for himself. Eventually Yuga is defeated by Link, and Hilda's former servant Ravio manages to show her the error of her ways. Ultimately Link and Zelda decide to forgive Hilda for her misguided actions and use the Triforce to restore the Lorulean Triforce, which in turn restores the land of Lorule.\n\n===Others===\nSeveral other parallel worlds to Hyrule exist, such as the Twilight Realm, the World of the Ocean King, and the Dark World from ''Twilight Princess'', ''The Phantom Hourglass'', and ''A Link to the Past'', respectively. Several other lands also exist beyond the kingdom. In ''Oracle of Ages'' and ''Oracle of Seasons'', Link travels to Labrynna and Holodrum. ''Triforce Heroes'' is set in Hytopia, a kingdom connected to Hyrule.<ref>{{Cite web |quote= Hyrule and Hytopia are connected. |author=Tri Force Heroes developers |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=October 22, 2015 |url=https://www.facebook.com/NintendoHandheldGaming/photos/a.150955828309750.40686.149152295156770/953796588025666/?type=3 |title=Most games in The Legend of Zelda series have a connection to Hyrule. Does the land of Hytopia connect to Hyrule in any way? |website=Facebook}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Races==\n===Ancient Robots===\nThe {{nihongo|Ancient Robots|RS-301}} are a mechanical race from ''Skyward Sword''. They were created by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru, but their land eventually became a barren desert while they rusted away. By using a Timeshift Stone they can be revived and serve three purposes. Some of them mine for Timeshift Stones, one group protected one of the Sacred Flames, and some act as Lanayru's servants. In addition there is a band of Ancient Robot Pirates, though only two of them are seen: LD-002S Scervo on the Sandship, and LD-003D Dreadfuse in the Sky Keep. During Link's quest for Nayru's Flame, Link is aided by a robot named Skipper, who is captain of the Sandship and lost his ship to the Pirate Scervo. Skipper aids Link in traversing the Lanayru Sand Sea using his Timeshift Stone powered motorboat, which can transform the impassible sea of sand into the ancient sea of water that once existed in the past. Also, Gondo, one of the citizens of Skyloft, owns an Ancient Robot that he inherited from his grandfather; at one point in the game this robot, named Scrapper, is restored to full functionality, and assists Link by carrying items up to Skyloft from the surface. The Ancient Robots require the oil produced by Ancient Flowers to function; because these flowers can no longer be found in the present day Lanayru Desert, it is implied that the flower's disappearance resulted in the decline of the LD-301 Series Ancient Robots. Most ancient robots are part of the LD-301 Series, including LD-301S Scrapper and LD-301N Skipper, while Servo and Dreadfuse are part of the LD-002 and LD-003 series, which unlike the LD-301 Series remain functional in the present.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', similar robots exist called Guardians and Divine Beasts. The Divine Beasts consist of Vah Ruta of the Zora, Vah Rudania of the Gorons, Vah Naboris of the Gerudo, and Vah Medoh of the Rito. The Guardians are ancient mechanisms with powerful sniper blasts who were intended to be used to defeat Ganon, but Ganon used his power to turn the robots against Hyrule. Mipha, the Zora Champion, Urbosa, the Gerudo Champion, Daruk, the Goron Champion, and Revali, the Rito Champion, who once piloted the Divine Beasts, were killed by the Blight Ganons, creations of Ganon who represent the element of the Divine Beast e.g. Thunderblight Ganon for Vah Naboris.\n\n===Anouki===\n{{nihongo|Anouki|\u30e6\u30ad\u30ef\u30ed\u30b7|Yukiwaroshi}} are an Inuit-like race that appear to be a cross between a reindeer and penguins. There are different variations of them with purple, red, blue, and yellow shirts and facial hair or small or big antlers. They are found on the Isle of Frost in the World of Ocean King and in Anouki Village in New Hyrule. In ''Spirit Tracks'', the Anouki are the only race who live in the snow realm.\n\n===Bokoblin===\nBokoblins are a race of humanoid [[goblin]]-like creatures, that first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Bokoblins come in a variety of colors such as red, blue, and green. They often appear as standard enemies and wield Boko Sticks, machetes, and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In ''Twilight Princess'', they are less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by the Bulblins. In ''Skyward Sword'', Bokoblins are revealed to have been around since ancient times and are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces different varieties of Bokoblin such as Technoblins, which lived in Lanayru Desert in the distant past and wield ancient technology; and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that can curse Link. The game introduces the bow-wielding Bokoblin Archers and Bokoblin Leaders that can summon other Bokoblins using the Monster Horns they carry.\n\nIn ''Breath of the Wild'', Bokoblin are revealed to have an omnivorous diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. They also can occasionally be seen hunting wild animals for their meat, which they will consume after a successful kill. Bokoblins can wield a variety of weapons, but tend to favor their own crafted clubs, bats, spears, and bows, the strongest of which are made from Dragonbone. The game also introduces another undead variant of Bokoblin called Stalkoblin, which raise from the ground at night and will continuously regenerate unless all Stalkoblin skulls in the area are destroyed, because a single skull can reanimate its headless comrades. The game also introduces stronger Black Bokoblins and Silver Bokoblins, which are stronger and more resilient. Cursed Bokoblins return in ''Breath of the Wild,'' but are depicted as floating Stalkoblin skulls corrupted by Calamity Ganon's malice.\n\nRed Bokoblins and Stalkoblins drop Bokoblin Horns and Bokoblin Fangs, while Blue, Black, and Silver Bokoblins drop those parts along with Bokoblin Guts. These monster parts can be sold to shops and merchants for Rupees or to Kilton for ''Mon'' at the Fang and Bone shop, though Link can also cook them with bugs to make Elixirs or use them as materials by the four Great Fairies to upgrade his armor. Link can also buy a Bokoblin Mask from Kilton, which allows him to disguise himself as a Bokoblin and blend in with them.\n\n===Bulblin===\n{{nihongo|Bulblins|\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Buruburin}} are a green, horned race that resemble the [[orc]]s of classic fantasy. They are led by {{nihongo|King Bulblin|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Kingu Buruburin}},<ref name=\"BulblinTrophy\"><!--\"Creatures that serve under King Bulblin. They follow their superiors and pillage the land like hyenas. They typically attack with spears and fiery arrows but sometimes attack while mounted on boarlike beasts.

In-game trophy description \"Bulblin\" trophy.</ref> who unlike the rest has the ability to talk.<ref>\"King Bulblin... When he loses in his final battle, he pays subtle respect to Link when he says, 'I follow the strongest side!'\". [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008). Trophy description of the \"King Bulblin\" trophy.</ref> Bulblins usually fight with heavy clubs or flaming arrows and commonly ride on boars. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' King Bulblin appears as an obstacle in the Bridge of Eldin stage in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.\n\n===Cobble===\nThe Cobble are a race that appear in ''Phantom Hourglass''. The Cobble once inhabited a prosperous land called the Cobble Kingdom. By the time the game takes place, the only Cobble that remain are the ghosts of the soldiers and King Mutoh, who dress in ancient Egyptian-like clothes and live in pyramid-like temples. The Isle of Ruins in the Northeastern Sea is all that remains of the once-mighty kingdom, and Link must visit there to retrieve the Aquanine, a pure metal entrusted to the Cobble by the Ocean King. There, he delves beneath Mutoh's Temple and destroys a corrupt Cobble war machine that is disrupting the king's eternal rest.\n\n===Deku===\nThe {{nihongo|Deku|\u30c7\u30af\u30ca\u30c3\u30c4|Dekunattsu}} are wooden plant-like creatures introduced in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' that appear mostly in the [[overworld]] and dungeons. Deku are small creatures with leaves sprouting out from their heads. They often have red glowing eyes and tube-like mouths that can shoot Deku Nuts. Their bodies consist of wood and leaves and perish quickly if set on fire. They can fly by using large leaves to glide, and some can use the leaves on their head to fly indefinitely after taking off from a Deku Flower. There are four types of Deku depicted in the series: Deku Scrubs, Mad Scrubs, Business Scrubs, and Royal Scrubs. Deku Scrubs are the most common type, which have green leaves and often give information when caught. Mad Scrubs are violent, have red and yellow leaves, and do not talk. Business Scrubs are traders who offer to sell their wares and services. Royal Scrubs have larger heads, bigger eyes, smaller mouths, and extra leaves covering their body. In ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of an unknown deceased Deku Scrub who is  implied to be the son of the Deku King's butler. In this form, Link can temporarily fly using a Deku Flower, shoot bubbles, and hop on deep water five times before sinking.\n\n===Dragon===\n[[Dragon]]s are a recurring race that usually appear as benevolent guardians or powerful enemies. In ''Ocarina of Time'', after becoming the King of Evil, Ganondorf resurrects the evil Goron-eating dragon Volvagia, who had terrorized the Goron people in the distant past before being defeated by Darunia's ancestor, who wielded the Megaton Hammer. When Ganondorf orders his minions to capture and feed the Gorons to Volvagia as a warning to his enemies, Darunia journeys to the Fire Temple to rescue his people and defeat Volvagia, but he is defeated because he could not locate the Megaton Hammer. However, Link manages to free the Gorons, slay Volvagia, and awaken Darunia as the Sage of Fire. In ''The Wind Waker'', the Sky Spirit Valoo acts as the protector and patron deity of the Rito tribe, providing them with his scales that allow them to grow wings. When Link arrives on Dragon Roost Island, he discovers that Gohma was tormenting Valoo, and defeats Gohma to obtain Din's Pearl. Valoo and the Rito later repay their debt to Link by rescuing him and Tetra from Ganondorf during their encounter with him in Forsaken Fortress. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link encounters a species of malevolent draconic warriors called Aeralfos and the Twilit dragon Argorok, who is the boss of the City in the Sky. In ''Skyward Sword'', Link is aided by the Three Dragons that guard the three regions of the Surface. Faron the Water Dragon rules over the Parella and protector of Faron Woods, Lake Floria, and the Ancient Cistern that holds Farore's Flame. Eldin the Fire Dragon guards Eldin Volcano. Lanayru the Thunder Dragon created the Ancient Robots and protects Lanayru Desert. Each dragon was entrusted with part of the Song of the Hero, which provides clues on the location of the Triforce. During his quest for Farore's Flame, Link aids Faron, who had been injured while fighting Ghirahim; she leads him to the Ancient Cistern. During his quest for the Song of the Hero, Link encounters Eldin after he is captured and imprisoned by Bokoblins during an eruption. Link learns that the Fire Dragon had caused the eruption, and the dragon apologizes to Link for all the trouble it caused him. Unlike the other two dragons, Lanayru is shown to have died from an illness in the past, forcing Link to go back in time, cure him of his illness, and prevent his death. After Link cures him and learning his part of the song, Lanayru allows Link to take part in the Lightning Round, which allows him to face a boss battle challenge and a Silent Realm challenge for various prizes. If Link completes eight boss battles, Lanayru will reward him with the unbreakable Hylian Shield, the strongest shield in the game.\n\n===Fairy===\n{{nihongo|[[Fairy|Fairies]]|\u5996\u7cbe|[[Y\u014dsei]]}} are magical creatures associated with nature and the Goddess Farore that appear as small, winged [[humanoid]]s often obscured by light. Fairies tend to shy away from human settlements and are most often associated with the Lost Woods, but can be found hiding in many places throughout Hyrule. Fairy Fountains or Fairy Springs are special places that contain sparkling magical water and attract Fairies in large numbers. In most games in the series, fairies will heal Link if he manages to catch one and he can also put them in empty bottles to have them heal him later. If Link dies while he has a bottled fairy in his possession, the fairy will automatically resurrect him instead of receiving a [[Game Over]].\n\n{{nihongo|Great Fairies|\u5927\u5996\u7cbe|Dai-y\u014dsei}} are powerful, high ranking fairies that often watch over their smaller brethren. They use their magic to enchant Link's items into more powerful versions and in some games they can also teach Link various magic spells. In ''Ocarina of Time'', the Kokiri form a symbiotic relationship with their Guardian Fairies, who act as constant companions and mentors. One of these is [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]], who serves as Link's sidekick and aids Link in learning about the world outside Kokiri Forest. Another Guardian Fairy is Tatl from ''Majora's Mask'' who was a friend of the Skull Kid until he betrayed her and her brother Tael. In ''Phantom Hourglass'', Link's guardian fairy is Ciela, who is eventually joined by two more fairies, Leaf and Neri. In some of the games, such as ''The Minish Cap'', players will be tested of their honesty and if they are, fairies give them gifts and upgrades.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], fairies can be found around the springs of the four great fairies. There is a fifth fairy named Malayna, but she is not a Great Fairy; instead, she is known as the Horse God and can revive dead horses. Fairies can be used to cook potions and other food; if they are used in making a dish, they increase the amount of hearts the food heals before disappearing from the player's inventory.\n\n===Gerudo===\nThe {{nihongo|Gerudo|\u30b2\u30eb\u30c9}} are a tribe of humanoid [[Theft|thieves]] who mainly live in the desert. Physical Gerudo traits typically include bronzed skin, scarlet hair, aquiline noses, gold eyes and round ears; however, evil Gerudo like Ganondorf and the Twinrova Sisters possess an olive skin color. Gerudo sentries carry [[pole weapon|polearms]] reminiscent of the Japanese ''[[naginata]]''. Apart from a single Gerudo male who is born every century and is crowned king of the tribe, the race consists entirely of women.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Nabooru: \"A kid like you may not know this, but the Gerudo race consists only of women. Only one man is born every hundred years\u2026 Even though our laws say that lone male Gerudo must become King of the Gerudo, I'll never bow to such an evil man!\"</ref> [[Ganon]]dorf, the main antagonist of the series, is king of the Gerudo in ''Ocarina of Time'' and the surrogate son of the twin Gerudo witch sisters Kotake and Koume. Gerudo appear as pirates in ''Majora's Mask'', where they live in the ocean at Great Bay, and are ruled by a woman instead of a man.  These Gerudo are enemies of the Zoras. They search for treasures in the sea and assault Zora and fishermen but do not approach Clock Town. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', only women are permitted in the town, so [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] has to [[crossdress]] as a female in order to enter the town. After gaining entrance to Gerudo Town, Link has to retrieve a thunder-resistant helmet known as the Thunder Helm from a clan of thieves called the Yiga, a traitorous formation who broke away from the Sheikah tribe. The helm is used to board Vah Naboris, named after the Sage of Spirit, Nabooru, as stated by the spirit of former Gerudo Champion Urbosa.\n\n===Goron===\n[[File:Goron.JPG|thumb|A Goron, as seen in ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'']]\nThe {{nihongo|Goron|\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3}} are a race of mountain-dwelling [[giant]]s who first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''. Goron culture revolves around brotherhood and strength, usually referring to each other and those they deem strong as \"Brother\" or \"Big Brother\". Gorons show high regard for individuals who display great strength and bravery and enjoy matching their strength with others in competition such as [[sumo wrestling]]<ref><!--\"They like sumo wrestling\"-->In-game trophy description of a \"Goron\" from [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008).</ref> and [[racing]]. While not all ''Zelda'' games featuring Gorons include full tribes, the games that do depict as tribes depict them as headed by a [[patriarch]] who is aided by one or more elders who assume leadership of the tribe in the event that the patriarch cannot. {{nihongo|Darunia|\u30c0\u30eb\u30cb\u30a2}} is the patriarch in ''Ocarina of Time''. The Goron elders in ''Twilight Princess'' are {{nihongo|Gor Coron|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Don Kor\u014dne}}, {{nihongo|Gor Amoto|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30b2\u30eb|Don S\u012bgeru}} {{nihongo|Gor Ebizo|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30d3\u30fc\u30be|Don Eb\u012bzo}}, and {{nihongo|Gor Liggs|\u30c9\u30f3\u30fb\u30ec\u30b2\u30fc\u30cc|Don Reg\u0113nu}}.\n\nOne of the oldest races in Hyrule, Gorons' bodies are resistant to intense heat and lava and they consume rocks and minerals,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap'', Goron figurine: \"These rock- and iron-eaters once lived on Mount Crenel in Western Hyrule.\"</ref><ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \"You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all of your green rocks? If you don't, you won't grow up big and strong!\"</ref> which they mine from the earth. By adulthood, most Gorons gain rock-like protrusions on their backs and sometimes on their arms and head as well. These stony growths act as a natural armor and continue to grow as the Goron ages. Gorons enter the [[fetal position]] when resting, and can also assume this position for self defense or to travel at high speed by [[Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend|rolling]]. Gorons endowed with magic power can sprout metal spikes from their body while rolling.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani's memorial: \"If Gorons who possess magic power roll swiftly enough, spikes will emerge from their bodies so that they may mow down enemies.\"</ref>\n\nFor leisure, Gorons enjoy music and dance, rolling and racing,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: \u201cThis wild rolling is the only way to relieve my stress!\u201d [\u2026] \u201cLet me express my joy with more wild rolling!\u201d</ref> games,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages'', Goron: \"We Gorons love games!\"</ref> sumo wrestling, and bathing in hot springs. Gorons have taken on occupations such as crafting, blacksmithing, sculpting, demolition, and merchantry. Rock sirloin, [[amber]], and metal shields are some Goron delicacies.\n\nThree Gorons appear in ''Skyward Sword:'' Gorko, Golo, and Gortram. Gorko and his assistant Golo, are shown working as archaeologists; Gorko travels the land researching ancient artifacts and ruins, while Golo excavates the Lanayru Caves. Unlike the other two, Gortram works as the proprietor of the Rickety Coaster mine cart ride at the abandoned Lanayru Shipyards. All three Gorons are encountered in the Lanayru Desert region at some point and the Lanayru Caves seems to serve as the base of operations for Gorko and Golo.\n\nGorons are large humanoids with long muscular arms, stout legs, hulking shoulders and necks, and rotund bellies. Their skin is generally beige in color and their hair is typically white. Gorons lack external hearing organs; Goron ears are instead holes on the sides of their heads. Most are as tall as a human, though some individuals such as {{nihongo|Biggoron|\u30c0\u30a4\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3|Daigoron}} can grow as large as a mountain. To date, no female Gorons have been seen in the series, but they do exist, as child and baby Gorons do appear and Darunia has a son during the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. Due to their great density, Gorons sink to the bottom of bodies of water and are thus helpless in such an environment. However, they do not need to breath to survive, as a Goron child proves by resting underwater and mentioning that he never feels the need to take a breath. Also, in ''Twilight Princess'', a Goron becomes submerged in the main pool in Zora's Domain, but enjoys the cold water rather than drowning.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani III's memorial: \"Water is disastrous for Goron heroes, for they sink like stones and are rendered motionless in the deep. Beware.\"</ref> Gorons are exceptionally resistant to heat and can walk through shallow [[lava]].\n\nIn ''Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of the deceased Goron hero Darmani and roll and punch as hard as the Megaton Hammer from ''Ocarina of Time.''\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the Gorons are encountered all over Hyrule, but mostly appear in the Eldin region. They live around Death Mountain, which Link must use heat-resistant armor or elixirs to enter.\n\n===Hylian===<!-- In the official game they call them \"Hylians\". They also call them this on Zelda Universe. (Nintendo's official website) -->\n{{Redirect|Hylian|the language|#Hylian language}}\n{{nihongo|Hylians|\u30cf\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u65cf|Hairia-zoku}} are an [[elf]]-like race that make up the main population of Hyrule, which they established organized civilization on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |title=Zelda Universe |publisher=Zelda.com |accessdate=2012-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207075201/http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |archive-date=2013-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They are born with magic-infused blood said to be a gift from [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|the goddesses]] that grants them psychic powers and magical skill. Their long pointed ears are said to allow them to hear messages sent by the gods. Link and Princess Zelda belong to this race in all games of the series. In some games, such as ''Twilight Princess'', Hylians are referred to as \"humans\". In ''Skyward Sword'', Hylians live on a floating island known as Skyloft and are accompanied by bird-like creatures called Loftwings.\n\n===Keaton===\n{{nihongo|Keaton|\u30ad\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3|K\u012btan}} are a three-tailed fox-like race mostly found in Termina. They normally stay hidden from sight, but reveal themselves to Link and challenge him with a quiz if he wears a Keaton Mask. No known Keaton exist in Hyrule in ''Ocarina of Time'', although at least one of them is a well-known fictional character in Hyrule Castle Town.<ref name=\"Keaton-1\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'': \"Oh, I know that character! It's Keaton! He's very hot in Hyrule Castle Town right now!\"</ref><ref name=\"Keaton-2\">''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Death Mountain Guard: \"Oh? Is that a \"Kee...something...\" character mask? I heard he's very popular recently? He's my boy's favorite.\"</ref> In ''The Minish Cap'', however, some thuggish Keaton roam the Hyrule countryside, walking on their hindpaws and having only one tail instead of three; if they injure Link, he loses some Rupees.\n\n===Kikwi===\nThe {{nihongo|Kikwi|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a4\u65cf|Kyui-zoku}} are a race in ''Skyward Sword'' who inhabit the Faron Woods. They have the appearance of black-and-white masked wingless birds, and can cause a plant to blossom from their backs for camouflage.\n\n===Kokiri and Koroks===\nThe {{nihongo|Kokiri|\u30b3\u30ad\u30ea\u65cf|Kokiri-zoku}} are a [[pixie]]-like race who inhabit the Kokiri Forest. They were created by the Great Deku Tree who considers them to be his children, and each receives a small fairy that is their lifelong friend, guardian, and teacher. They do not age once they grow up into kids. Cautious and secretive, the Kokiri believe that they will die if they leave the forest.<ref>'': Ocarina of Time'', Kokiri boy: \"The Great Deku Tree said that if a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or she will die!\"</ref> This belief seems to be false, as Saria leaves the forest when she becomes the Forest Sage. It is also suggested that if they wander too deep into the forest, they will turn into a Skull Kid, although this has not been proven definitively.\n\nA Kokiri named Saria is the Sage of the Forest. Another Kokiri, Fado, is the first Sage of Wind in ''The Wind Waker'', but he is killed prior to the events of the game, leaving the player to interact with his spirit and locate his successor, the Korok Makar. Link was raised as a Kokiri in ''Ocarina of Time'', but he is actually a Hylian whose mother entrusted the Great Deku Tree with his care when he was an infant. It wasn't until he traveled into the future when getting the Master Sword that Link found out he wasn't a Kokiri by aging.\n\nThe {{nihongo|Koroks|\u30b3\u30ed\u30b0|Korogu}} of ''The Wind Waker'' are said to have been transformed from the Kokiri after the Great Flood.<ref name=\"Kokiri forms\">''The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'', Great Deku Tree: \"Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks took on human forms, but when they came to live on the sea, they took these shapes.\"</ref> They are small creatures with wood-like bodies and masks made from leaves. They are very light, which allows them to travel by using sprouts as propellers. They leave their home, the \"Forest Haven\", to plant seeds from the Great Deku Tree all over the world, and return once a year to hold a ceremony and obtain more seeds.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Koroks can be found all over Hyrule. The player must solve puzzles to get Korok Seeds from them. Once the player retrieves Korok Seeds from Koroks, one can trade it with Hestu, a large Korok, for more inventory slots for swords, shields, and bows.\n\n===Light Spirits===\nThere are four {{nihongo|Light Spirits|\u5149\u306e\u7cbe\u970a|Hikari no Seirei}} throughout Hyrule in ''Twilight Princess''.\n\nThe first light spirit is {{Nihongo|Ordona|\u30e9\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30cc|Rato\u0101nu}}, who resembles an Ordon Goat. Ordona has an orb between her antlers and first appears at Ordon Spring when Link has defeated the first Shadow Beast.\n\nThe second light spirit, {{nihongo|Faron|\u30d5\u30a3\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd|Fir\u014dne}}, resembles a monkey. He holds his golden orb with his tail over his head. He appears in Faron Spring when Link has completed the first collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe third light spirit, {{nihongo|Eldin|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|Orudin}}, resembles an eagle with his orb between his feet. He appears in the lake near the shaman's house in Kakariko Village once Link has completed the second collection of twilight bugs.\n\nThe fourth and last light spirit, {{nihongo|Lanayru|\u30e9\u30cd\u30fc\u30eb|Ran\u0113ru}}, resembles a serpent with his orb inside his mouth. He appears in the cave at Lake Hylia when Link has completed the third and final collection of twilight bugs. But after Lanayru tells Link the story of the three goddesses and the three Fused Shadows, Zant appears and embeds the Shadow Crystal in Link's skull that later allows him to transform between his human and wolf form. He also exposes Midna to Lanayru's light causing her to become very ill and sends Link on the quest for the Master Sword.\n\n===Lokomo===\n{{nihongo|Lokomos|\u30ed\u30b3\u30e2|Rokomo}} are a humanoid race who first appear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]''. All but one of the encountered Lokomo are sages who reside in the New Hyrule and the Tower of Spirits. They are distinguishable by their pointed ears and short legs, the latter of which forces them to use motorized carts for transportation.  However, an exceptionally strong Lokomo named Byrne is capable of walking on his legs.\n\n===Oocca===\nThe {{nihongo|Oocca|\u5929\u7a7a\u4eba|Tenk\u016b-jin|lit. \"sky people\"}}  are a race of birds with long necks and human-like faces that appear in ''Twilight Princess''. They live in the {{nihongo|\"City in the Sky\"|\u5929\u7a7a\u90fd\u5e02|Tenk\u016b Toshi}},<ref>\"One of the Oocca, Ooccoo travels around with her son in search of a means to return to her home, the City in the Sky.\" [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008). Ooccoo & Son in-game trophy description.</ref> an airborne city that acts as the seventh [[dungeon]] in ''Twilight Princess''. A female Oocca named {{nihongo|Ooccoo|\u304a\u3070\u3061\u3083\u3093|Oba-chan}} can warp the player back to the entrance of the game's dungeons. Ooccoo's son, {{nihongo|Ooccoo Jr|\u307c\u304f\u3061\u3083\u3093|Boku-chan}}, warps the player to Ooccoo's location. In ''Twilight Princess'', these creatures are mentioned to be closer to the gods than the Hylians. It is supposed that they created Hylians and created a city in the sky for them to live in. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link reaches this city by launching himself out of an enormous cannon.\n\n===Minish===\nMinish, referred to in their native language as {{nihongo|Picori|\u30d4\u30c3\u30b3\u30eb|Pikkoru|inspired by the [[Koropokkuru]]}}, are small humanoid [[Sprite (folklore)|sprites]] no bigger than a human [[thumb]] that live in secret. They are only visible to children and tend to live in forests, but also appear inside of buildings and holes in and around various spots of Hyrule. There are three variations of the Minish, which can be distinguished by their attire: Forest Minish, Town Minish and Mountain Minish. They first appear in ''The Minish Cap''. Most Minish are helpful, and like to hide valuable objects for others to find, although one Picori, {{nihongo|Vaati|\u30b0\u30d5\u30fc|Guf\u016b}} became evil after becoming obsessed with human nature.\n\n===Mogma===\nThe {{nihongo|Mogma|\u30e2\u30b0\u30de\u65cf|Moguma-zoku}} are long-armed anthropomorphic rodents who debuted in ''Skyward Sword.'' They are demolition experts who like digging for treasure and are known to never go anywhere without their bomb bag.  Mogmas are found in Eldin Volcano and play major parts in the plot of the Volcano Summit, Eldin Volcano, the Fire Sanctuary, and the Earth Temple.\n\n===Parella===\nThe {{nihongo|Parella|\u30d1\u30e9\u30b2\u65cf|Parage-zoku}} are an aquatic squid-like race who debuted in ''Skyward Sword'' who live in the underwater spiraling caverns of Lake Floria. Conical spirals appear as their central body and the shape of their dwellings.\n\n===Rito===\nThe {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} are a race of bird-like humanoids who debuted in ''The Wind Waker''. In that game, they lived on Dragon Roost Island, an island on the Great Sea. They have a tribal elder and elaborately dressed guards. No Rito is born with wings, and instead, must visit their guardian, the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in a coming-of-age ceremony to receive one of his scales, which enables them to grow wings.\n\nRito appear to be covered by dark shaded skin or feathers. Most Rito have red eyes, but the Rito Chieftain has yellow eyes. They have pointed ears,  bird-like feet, and a beak whose shape and size varies from Rito to Rito. Unlike real-life birds, his beak appears to only be used for smelling, and cannot be used as a mouth. However, the Rito have a mouth below this beak.\n\nThroughout a young Rito's childhood, he or she is called a Fledgling and is flightless without any wings. After a child reaches a certain age they can receive their wings after they retrieve a scale from the dragon Valoo. While not in use,  Rito wings are mostly white with black colored plumage along the ends. When in flight the top of a Rito's wings are colored brown with black along the edges while the bottoms of the wings contain white plumage along the wings interior. However Medli has pure white wings, possibly suggesting that female Rito have white wings or that her wings are not fully grown yet. Most Rito can fly over a great distance and hover in place, but some have trouble flying for long periods of time, likely due to inexperience.\n\nIn [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|''Breath of the Wild'']], the Rito reside in the Tabantha region in northwest Hyrule. The Rito cannot fly at a preferred height because the Divine Beast Vah Medoh shoots down Rito who fly at its height. The Rito warrior Teba helps Link board Vah Medoh, but is severely injured by Medoh's cannons. After Link defeats Windblight Ganon, the Rito Champion Revali regains control of Vah Medoh and prepares to blast Ganon when Link finally fights him. Notably, Revali resents Link, stating that he has many skills as an archer, and that he was only called to assist Link because Link has the Master Sword.\n\n===Sheikah===\nThe {{nihongo|Sheikah|\u30b7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc|Sh\u012bk\u0101}} are an ancient clan of mysterious [[ninja]]-like warriors distinguished by, but not limited to, red eyes, and white hair, who protect the Hylian Royal Family.<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Professor Shikashi: \"Have you heard the legend of the \"Shadow Folk\"? They are the Sheikah...the shadows of the Hylians. They say they swore allegiance to the King of Hyrule and guarded the Royal Family.\"</ref> They bear some physical resemblance the to Hylians, but are a completely different species, with much more technological prowess and lifespans that can extend over many millennia. As revealed in ''Skyward Sword'', the Sheikah are servants of the goddess Hylia, whose reincarnation is Zelda. The Sheikah crying eye symbol is commonly seen in the series, even in games where the Sheikah are not present. It is alluded that the tear was added after the Hyrule Civil War, which took place some time before the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. By the events of ''Ocarina of Time'', the Sheikah are referred to as an extinct race who built the Shadow Temple, with Impa among the last few members. In ''Skyward Sword'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''Majora's Mask'', Sheikah Stones or Gossip Stones created by the Sheikah give Link information on where to go and what to do.\n\nVery few Sheikah members are met throughout the games, with the only recurring one being various incarnations of Zelda's [[nursemaid]] Impa. Others include Impa's descendant Impaz and the [[fortune-telling|fortune-teller]] Madame Fanadi, both from ''Twilight Princess'', and the Composer Brothers from ''Ocarina of Time'', who researched magical music for the Royal Family before killing themselves when Ganondorf demanded the fruits of their labour. They are met in an undead form, as Poes, in the Kakariko Graveyard.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', the ancient Sheikah invented the Divine Beasts and Guardians 10,000 years before the Great Calamity to fight Ganon. The Sheikah reside primarily in Kakariko Village, but can be found elsewhere, such as the two Ancient Tech Labs or in Tarrey Town. An old painter named Pikango left Kakariko Village many years ago to search for beautiful landscapes, and uses his knowledge to help Link locate his memories. Link also possesses a Sheikah Slate, a piece of ancient technology that can be upgraded with various runes. The four primary Runes are Magnesis, which can move metallic objects; Remote Bombs, circular or cube-shaped bombs that can remotely detonate once thrown or dropped; Stasis, which can freeze objects and monsters; and Cryonis, which can create icy blocks on watery surfaces.\n\nAdditionally in ''Breath of the Wild'' is a group of rebellious, antagonistic Sheikah known as the Yiga Clan. 10,000 years ago, after the First Great Calamity, the Sheikah split due to the king of the time exiling them out of fear of their technology. Some remained loyal, and went to live as peaceful farmers in Kakariko Village. Others felt betrayed, and turned against the kingdom, becoming a militant Sheikah group  and siding with Calamity Ganon due to both now having a common enemy. They then adopted an upside-down Sheikah eye as their symbol. Just over 100 years ago, when the Calamity's return was inevitable, the militant Sheikah came out of hiding. Spearheaded by Master Kohga, whose family had lead for at least four generations, they called themselves the Yiga Clan and went on the hunt for the enemies of the Calamity, including Link and Princess Zelda, but were pushed back and forced to make a hideout in an abandoned Gerudo archaeological site. Their hideout is located in Karusa Valley in the Gerudo Highlands. They spawn throughout the world and sometimes appear as lost travelers or merchants who will attack Link if he talks to them. There are three types of Yiga Clansmen: Yiga Footsoldiers, who may ambush Link with a Duplex Bow which can fire two arrows at once, or may disguise as a Hylian, only to reveal themselves and fight with a Vicious Sickle or a Demon Carver; Yiga Blademasters, who carry around a Windcleaver, and Master Kogha, a large master of esoteric arts who waits in the Yiga Clan Hideout while his minions search for Link. He is referenced by certain disguised Yiga. One Kakariko Villager, the guard Dorian, is an ex-Yiga member. After being stationed there, he found a wife who bore two daughters with him, Koko and Cottla, all of whom made him want to change his ways; the Yiga murdered his wife when they discovered his defection.\n\nIt is also here that the Sheikah are shown as a race with diversity, with many members sporting grey, brown or blue eyes and some having varying hair colour. Only one member, Purah, the ancient researcher and older sister of Impa, is shown to have red eyes. Jerrin, wife of elderly researcher Robbie, and her son Grant\u00e9 are the only two members with blonde hair, and Rola, as well as the entire Yiga Clan, exhibit black hair. Rola and as the elderly couple Steen and Trissa have brown skin; the other members have skin ranging from pale to tan.\n\n===Subrosian===\n{{nihongo|Subrosians|\u30a6\u30fc\u30e9|\u016ara}} are a mysterious race that live in the subterranean world of Subrosia in ''Oracle of Seasons''. They have large glowing eyes and are always seen wearing either green, blue or red hooded cloaks. There are two exceptions: Rosa, who wears a yellow cloak with a ribbon, and another unnamed yellow-clothed Subrosian who gives Link a Secret to use in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are shy when around people of other races and prefer to be rarely seen. They can survive in lava and use a currency made of metal rocks found in the ground called Ore Chunks.\n\n===Tokay===\n{{nihongo|Tokay|\u30c8\u30ab\u30b2\u4eba|Tokage-jin|lit. \"lizard people\"}} are green-scaled lizards who reside on Crescent Island in Labrynna in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are known to search for valuable items and be deceitful. They are also expert gardeners which can grow scent seeds from seedlings over a course of four hundred years. They have never seen anyone from other races, so when they see Link, they think he is a Tokay without a tail and call him \"Strange Tokay\".\n\n===Twili===\n{{nihongo|Twili|\u30c8\u30ef\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u6c11|Towairaito no Tami}} are a race that come from the Twilight Realm and first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]].'' They are the descendants of the Dark Interlopers, who were sent to the Twilight Realm by the {{nihongo|Golden Goddesses|\u4e09\u67f1\u306e\u5973\u795e|Mihashira no Megami <small>Three Goddesses</small>}} after trying to seize control of the Sacred Realm. Eventually, they abandoned their plans to rule the Sacred Realm and Hyrule and became peacefully adapted to the Twilight Realm. One member of their race is {{nihongo|[[Midna]]|\u30df\u30c9\u30ca|Midona}}. {{nihongo|Zant|\u30b6\u30f3\u30c8|Zanto}} was also part of this race. He overthrew Midna with Ganon's help and helped Ganon take over Hyrule.\n\nThe skin tone of the Twili is mostly black while their faces, necks, and chest tend to be gray. The Twili have long limbs, necks, and heads, and great variances in appearance.\n\n===Wizzrobes===\n{{nihongo|Wizzrobes|\u30a6\u30a3\u30ba\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Wizur\u014dbu}} are [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] creatures that wear [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] robes and often use fire and ice magic. In ''The Wind Waker,'' they can also summon other enemies and wear [[toucan]]-like or bird-like masks and headdresses. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda.]]''\n\n''Breath of the Wild'' introduced Electric Wizzrobes, who use Lighting or Thunderstorm Rods. They can teleport and shoot electricity. The other Wizzrobes can also teleport and shoot fire and ice respectively.\n\n===Yeti===\nYetis are creatures that resemble the 'real-life' yeti, but have large beaver-like tails and speak with poor grammar. The females are smaller than the males and wear an armless sweater, showing no arms or tail. {{nihongo|Yeta|\u30de\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3|Mat\u014dnya}} and {{nihongo|Yeto|\u30c9\u30b5\u30f3\u30b3\u30d5|Dosankofu}}, characters who live in Snowpeak Ruins in ''Twilight Princess'' were {{nihongo|[[Yeti]]s|\u96ea\u7537|yukiotoko}}.<ref><!--\"The wife of Yeto.

Brawl]] (2008) In-game trophy description of the \"Yeta\" trophy.</ref> Yeto helps Link by giving him soup that heals up to eight hearts of his health.\n\n===Zora===\nThe {{nihongo|Zora|\u30be\u30fc\u30e9|Z\u014dra}{ZOR-ah}} are a race of aquatic [[piscine humanoid]]s that appear in nearly every game of the series. In the original game and ''Link to the Past'', Zoras were enemies that attacked Link from the water with projectiles, though the giant Zora King sells Link a pair of flippers in ''A Link to the Past'', allowing him to swim and to use the network of whirlpools that link far corners of Hyrule. By ''Ocarina of Time'', their role in most stories had changed to a neutral or friendly race. Zoras rely heavily on water, and can only live on land for limited time periods.<ref>[[Super Smash Brothers Brawl]] (2008). In game trophy description of the \"Zora\" trophy.</ref> Zoras are mostly seen gracefully swimming about and frolicking in water. Besides routine swimming and sports, Zoras also enjoy music.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040347/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/z.jsp \"Led by their King, the Zoras are peaceful creatures who enjoy music and sports\"]</ref>\n\nMost Zoras do not wear [[clothing]], and they are generally covered in silver [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], which give them a pale blue sheen from a distance. Where humans sometimes have long hair, average Zoras have rear-hanging [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] extensions that resemble tails. These tails undulate periodically, which gives a Zora's head the unique semblance of a fish. They are sometimes depicted as having webbed feet and hands. They lack ears in the traditional sense, but do have pronounced noses and gills on their abdomen. Their fins can be used to fight by extending out to serve as sharp weapons. Zoras lay [[egg]]s to reproduce. Zora eggs need to be kept in cold, clean water to develop healthily, and every egg from the same [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] must be kept together for them to hatch. Newborn Zoras are [[tadpole]]-like with a circular body and a long, skinny tail ending in a [[wikt:fluke|fluke]].\n\nZora government is apparently [[Monarchy|monarchical]], either ruled by a king, {{nihongo|King Zora|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30be\u30fc\u30e9|Kinguz\u014dra}}, or queen, such as Queen {{nihongo|Rutela|\u30eb\u30c6\u30e9|Rutera}} from ''Twilight Princess''. Two different tribes exist: \"river Zora\" are more violent and can shoot fire, while \"sea Zora\" make up the friendly Zoras. The Zora Royal Family is responsible for maintaining order among their people, overseeing care for {{nihongo|Jabu Jabu|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6\u30b8\u30e3\u30d6}}, whom they worship as a guardian god,<ref>''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', [[King Zora]]: \u201cOur guardian god, Lord Jabu-Jabu, would never eat my dear [[Princess Ruto]]!\u201d</ref> and assuring that the waters upon which he and all creatures rely are clean and pure.\n\nThe Zora appear to be extinct in ''The Wind Waker''; a sage named {{nihongo|Laruto|\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8|Raruto}} is encountered in spirit. They may be linked to the {{nihongo|Rito|\u30ea\u30c8}} race, along with Princess {{nihongo|Ruto|\u30eb\u30c8}}. The Zora typically inhabit fresh water such as Zora River and Lake Hylia, while sea-dwelling Zora are known to appear in Termina (''Majora's Mask'') and Labrynna (''Oracle of Ages'')\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'', Link is able to inhabit the body of the Zora Mikau, who was killed by Gerudo pirates, and can use his fins in the same manner as the boomerang.\n\nIn ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Zoras are a major part of the game. Link must head to Zora's Domain in Lanayru to meet with King Dorephan and Prince Sidon. The King called for a Hylian because Zora's Domain was in danger of being washed away by Divine Beast Vah Ruta, who was at the East Reservoir Lake. Muzu, a Zora elder and the King's assistant, resents Link, because him and most Zora elders blame Link for the death of the beloved Zora Champion and Princess, Mipha. After realizing that Link has had a special connection with the princess, he tasks Link with finding 20 Shock Arrows from Ploymus Mountain, which is guarded by a Lynel. After retrieving the arrows, Link heads for the East Reservoir Lake to board Vah Ruta. Once he regains control of the beast, Mipha appears as a spirit and grants Link her healing ability. She then moves Vah Ruta to a location that isn't blocked so she can have a direct lock on Hyrule Castle and assist Link in fighting Ganon.\n\n===Creatures===\nNote: Some creatures' outlook may vary in different titles of the series.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Armos'''|\u30a2\u30e2\u30b9|Amosu}} are animated statues built to guard ancient ruins that come to life and attack when disturbed. ''The Minish Cap'' features them as guards created by the Wind Tribe. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Beamos'''|\u30d3\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9|B\u012bmosu}} like Armos are statues built to guard ancient ruins. Beamos sit stationary scanning the room with a single rotating \"eye\". When they spot an intruder they fire off a high powered laser that tracks the target some distance. They first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Biri and Bari'''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2|G\u014dria}} are electrified jellyfish that can hover in the air. Striking them with a metal weapon causes Link to be electrocuted. They often split into smaller duplicates after being attacked.\n*'''Blade Traps''': Indestructible metallic devices armed with spikes. Some sense intruders and fly towards them, while others move in a set pattern. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Blupees'''|\u30eb\u30df\u30fc|Rum\u012b), according to ''Creating a Champion'',<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Nintendo|first=|title=The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Creating a Campion|publisher=Takashi Yamaori|year=2018|isbn=978-1-50671-010-5|location=Japan|pages=151, 152, 157, 158}}</ref> are small spirits which resembles a rabbit and glow a soft blue, usually residing on places with very few people such as Satori Mountain and north of Kakariko Village. If a Blupee spots the player or an NPC, it will run off and disappear without a trace, however, if the player hits it with a weapon or an arrow, the Blupee with drop varying amounts of rupees, which is the currency within the Legend of Zelda games. There is an in-game side quest given to the player by a Korok called the \u2018Legendary Rabbit Trail\u2019, who asks them to take a picture of a Blupee with the Sheikah Slate and show him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mic.com/articles/174957/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-blupee-how-to-catch-the-glowing-blue-spirit-rabbit|title='Zelda: Breath of the Wild' Blupee: How to catch the glowing blue spirit rabbit|website=Mic|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> These creatures can only found in Breath of the Wild, and are not referenced in any other Legend of Zelda titles.\n*{{nihongo|'''Bokoblin'''|\u30dc\u30b3\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3|Bokoburin}} are demonic goblin-like enemies that wield bladed weapons or clubs. They have red skin and small horns and are very aggressive to intruders. They first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Later, they reappear in ''Skyward Sword'' and ''Breath of the Wild'' as a common enemy. Like Bulblins, they are prone to following particular evil forces, mainly the Demon Lord Ghirahim from ''Skyward Sword''.  \n*{{nihongo|'''Bubbles'''|\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb|Baburu}}, also known as Anti-Fairies or Whisps, are dark fairies that take the form of giant flaming skulls. They can place curses on their victims, the color of their flame denoting the abilities they possess. For example, if a Blue Bubble bites Link he will be temporarily unable to draw his sword. In some games Link can use Magic Powder to turn Bubbles into healing fairies. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Buzz Blobs'''|\u30d0\u30ba\u30d6\u30ed\u30d6|Bazuburobu}} are electrical tapering creatures made of goo. They are passive, but generate large amounts of static electricity when hit. Buzz Blobs deal damage when struck with metal weapons such as swords, with the exception of the Golden Sword, requiring the use of ranged weapons, which can either defeat them instantly or stun them, leaving them vulnerable to sword strikes. They are skinny down near the ground and widen at the top.\n*{{nihongo|'''ChuChus'''|\u30c1\u30e5\u30c1\u30e5|Chuchu}} are jelly-like creatures with squat, translucent bodies, stalk-eyes, and a smiling mouth that have a variety of colors. In ''The Wind Waker'' their appearance was changed to upright, opaque bodies and vibrantly colored faces. They first appeared by that name in ''Majora's Mask'', but two similar blob-type enemies were in the original ''The Legend of Zelda'' named \"Bit\" and \"Bot\", and a Bot became two Bits when Link slashed it, similar to the behavior of ChuChus in newer titles. Modern ChuChus come in Green, Red (the two most common colors), Yellow, Blue and dark Purple. They aggressively attack anything that invades their territory by tackling it, but will hide in puddles on the ground if no one is close. They mostly move by bouncing around, though the Green, Yellow and Blue ChuChus will occasionally melt and turn into small invincible puddles, and proceed to move around in their puddle forms until they can get close to Link, or until Link uses an item such as his Boomerang to stun and coax them out of their puddles. In ''Twilight Princess'', after one is killed, Link can use their puddles as potions or lantern fuel, depending on the type of ChuChu. In ''Skyward Sword'', ChuChus come in a variety of colors: Green, red (fire), blue (underwater), and yellow (electricity). ChuChus' sizes also vary a lot, depending on their color. The smallest can be defeated with one sword strike, the medium-sized need to be hit multiple times, and the largest ones can be split into two smaller ones with a vertical slash. In ''Breath of the Wild'', ChuChus came in four different forms, normal, fire, ice, and electric. They come in a big or small size. They will jump around and sometimes pounce at Link. If they charge at Link, they will lose their element and become dark and faded, but retain their color. They are vulnerable at this point to attack. They will try to regain their elemental power if left for too long without being killed. Once they are defeated, they will drop ChuChu jelly, which will stay in the element they are, unless an elemental arrow or weapon is used on it to change the element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14-skyward-sword-enemies.php#ChuchuBlue |title=Zelda Dungeon Wiki: Enemies: ChuChus |publisher=Zeldadungeon.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>\n*{{nihongo|'''Cuccos'''|\u30b3\u30c3\u30b3|Kokko}} are a type of Hylian [[chicken]] commonly domesticated for their eggs and meat. Although Cuccos strongly resemble real-life chickens they differ in several key ways. Most Cuccos can fly short distances and are even strong enough to glide while carrying the weight of an adult man, allowing Link to use them to glide to otherwise unreachable areas. Some breeds of Cucco, like blue and gold Cuccos can even outright fly while being held. While normally docile, Cuccos will become angry if attacked repeatedly and crow to summon a flock of Cuccos to attack the aggressor until he or she dies or leaves the area. Cuccos first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''. They mostly come in white, although ''The Minish Cap'' had gold Cuccos and ''Twilight Princess'' had black, brown, golden and grey variants as well. In ''Ocarina of Time'', there was a single blue Cucco that was used in a trading sequence.  \n*{{nihongo|'''Darknuts'''|\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30c3\u30af|T\u0101tonakku}} are large armored knights armed with swords and shields. In ''The Wind Waker'', when their helmets are removed, they are revealed to have jackal-like heads. Some Darknuts also have capes, which must be destroyed before they can be hurt. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''. They reappear in groups at Hyrule Castle. They also appeared in ''Twilight Princess'' for the first time in The Temple of Time, and in several other dungeons thereafter.\n*{{nihongo|'''Deku Babas'''|\u30c7\u30af\u30d0\u30d0|Deku Baba}} are [[Venus fly trap]]-like [[carnivorous plant]]s, that live in forests. They spend much of their time shrunk down springing from the ground whenever their [[root]]s detect the footsteps of potential prey. They first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''.\n*{{nihongo|'''Dodongos'''|\u30c9\u30c9\u30f3\u30b4|Dodongo}} are fire-breathing reptiles that resemble gigantic iguanas.

Floormasters roam around the room and are visible at all times, while Wallmasters hide on the ceiling out of sight. Also, Floormasters split up into smaller versions when the original is attacked, whereas Wallmasters do not. Wallmasters first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda'' while Floormasters first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''. Floormasters appeared in ''The Wind Waker'' as a spectral arm and hand that will transport Link to a jail-like holding area if he is caught. They do not split up when attacked.\n*'''Gargoyles''' are statues that appear in ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link''.  They shoot fireballs at Link in the underground dungeons.\n*{{nihongo|'''Gibdos'''|\u30ae\u30d6\u30c9|Gibudo}} are undead creatures wrapped like [[mummy|mummies]].

They are the largest monster found within the game and will uproot nearby trees to use as weapons against the player if provoked. Once defeated, they will drop roasted meat, weapons, Hinox toenail, Hinox guts, and Hinox teeth. One of the Shrine Quests called \u2018The Tree Giant Brothers\u2019 in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]],'' requires the player to beat the younger kin, middle kin, and oldest kin of Hinoxs found around Taran Pass. \n**'''Stalnoxs''' are animated versions of Hinoxs that appear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild.]]'' Like stalmoblins or stalkoblins, they are just as powerful as there living selves, however if you aim for the eye of a Stalnox, the eye will fall out of the skull, allowing the player to attack it and deal a significant amount of damage before it roles back towards the Stalnox, and it put back into its skull. In Hyrule Castle, in order to obtain the Hylian Shield, the player must defeat the Stalnox kept within the prison cells underneath the castle. \n*{{nihongo|'''Iron Knuckles'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30c3\u30af|Aian-nakku}} are heavily armored knights with axes. While they are even slower than the Darknuts, they are the most powerful enemies in their games as they can take four hearts from Link with just one hit and because of that they are often used to guard treasures.

In that game, red and blue Lynel can be found in many places. The white one appears in a lot of places too, but mostly in colder climates. They can be found naturally in Gerudo Highlands and N. Tabantha Snowfield. Every Lynel, except for the one in Shatterback Point northeast of Zora's Domain, will become Silver after being beaten enough. After every Blood Moon, the Lynel's type will change to a stronger variant (i.e. a defeated red Lynel will become a blue Lynel after being defeated).

In ''Spirit Tracks'', Miniblins were pirates usually led by a \"Big Blin\", a larger, muscled variation that wields a spiked club. In ''Skyward Sword'', they are depicted as fatter and will use their weight in a final attempt to crush Link before dying. In ''Breath of the Wild'', they are taller and lankier and revealed that they are carnivorous and require a diet of meat and fish to maintain their bulky frames. \n**'''Stalmoblin''' are the animated skeletons of Moblins that appear in ''Breath of the Wild''.
