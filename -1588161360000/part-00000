The novel was published on October 7, 2009 by [[Delacorte Press]], an imprint of [[Random House]], and was made into a [[The Maze Runner (film)|2014 major motion picture]] by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nThomas wakes up in a metal elevator that brings him to a place called ''the Glade''. He has no memory of who he is or how he got there. He gradually discovers that the Glade is run by two boys: Alby, the leader, and Newt, the second-in-charge, who both maintain order by enforcing simple but effective rules. The elevator box surfaces from under the ground once every week supplying new food, tools, medicine, and sometimes weapons. Every month a new boy with no memory of anything but his first name finds himself in that elevator box. The Glade is surrounded by a square of 4&nbsp;mile-high walls made of concrete. These walls have openings in them, which slide shut like doors every night. Outside the walls is the Maze, a labyrinth of high concrete walls covered in ivy that changes every day. The Maze houses strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers. Grievers are described as amorphous monsters of metal and flesh. The Gladers are trying to stay alive as well as \"solve\" the Maze by appointing 'runners' to run through it as fast as they can while tracking movements of the walls and trying to find an exit to escape.\n\nOne day after Thomas' arrival, a girl named Teresa is delivered through the elevator into the Glade with a note saying \"She's the last one. Ever.\" It implies that there will be no more children sent into the Glade. The girl subsequently lapses into a long \ncoma. When Thomas comes to visit her, he recognizes her, but cannot remember her name until he hears her voice telepathically in his mind telling him her name. Teresa wakes up and tells Thomas that they knew each other before they were sent into the Glade, and reveals that they could communicate telepathically.\n\nMinho, the keeper of the runners, and Alby go into the Maze to see what they think is their first dead Griever. Alby is stung by the creature and, while Minho is trying to help him out of the Maze, Thomas runs in to help. All three are then stranded in the Maze overnight. Minho, believing Alby is dead without the Serum, tells Thomas to leave him and just run, looking for shelter so the Grievers don't find them. Thomas, unable to leave Alby to die, uses the vines on the walls to pull him up and out of the view of the Grievers, then attracts their attention and evades them. Minho sees Thomas's evasion tactic and uses it to send the four Grievers chasing them over the Cliff. Thomas, Alby, and Minho are the first people in the Glade to survive a night in the maze. After getting back to The Glade the next morning, Newt calls a Gathering of The Keepers to discuss what to do with Thomas. Some of the Keepers vote to relieve him of punishment while others (especially Gally) vote to lock him up in the Slammer (the jail block) as a punishment. Minho, however, nominates Thomas to replace him as the Keeper of The Runners. Gally decides to kick Minho off The Council, causing Minho to attack him. Thomas is locked up in jail and the next day he starts his training with Minho. \n\nAfter their miraculous return, Teresa's arrival triggers a series of changes to life in the Glade: people start acting strangely, the sun disappears, the weekly deliveries of supplies stop coming, and the doors of the Maze stay open at night, which allows the Grievers to enter the Glade and hunt the children. \n\nThomas proposes that the walls of the Maze are not random, but that their movements are actually a code, leading to the discovery that the Maze is spelling out words. Thomas also discovers that what they previously thought was the Cliff is actually where the Grievers leave the Maze (\"The Griever Hole\"). This drives Thomas to think they need memories to get out, so he intentionally gets stung by a Griever so he can receive the antidote (\"Grief Serum\") and thereby go through ''the Changing''. It is known that the Changing can trigger memories and sometimes violence.\n\nThomas and the Gladers find out what the pattern is. The Gladers to decide to make a run for the exit, knowing that taking on the Grievers is a suicide mission, but deciding that nothing is worse than their current fate. They succeed, only to find out that they were test subjects in an experiment conducted by an organization called ''World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department'' (WICKED). The teenagers escape to a laboratory but encounter Gally, who had not escaped with them. Acting under mind control, he moves to throw a knife at Thomas, but a young Glader, Chuck, jumps to save him.\n\nAfter briefly mourning the death of Chuck, all 20 Gladers are rescued. They are brought to a safe haven and told about catastrophic [[solar flare]]s that caused an apocalyptic event, followed by a virus called ''the Flare'' that killed millions. The rescuers reveal that orphaned children are being tested to find a cure for the virus.\n\n;Epilogue\nThe epilogue is [[Omniscient narrator|written in the voice of]] Chancellor Ava Paige\u2014a feature of all the novels in the trilogy. She reveals that the group who rescued the Gladers may just be another variable in the experiment and that the Gladers weren't the only group being evaluated.\n\n==Characters==\n; '''Thomas''': The [[protagonist]]. Thomas is the last boy, but not the last person to enter the Glade. The only thing he remembered when he came into the glade was his name. Chuck described him as about 16 years old, of average height, and brown-haired. He was called \"Greenie\", a nickname given to new arrivals. He becomes a Runner with Minho after being the first person to spend a whole night in the Maze and saves Alby when he is about to die. He has a telepathic connection with Teresa and was able to talk to her while she was in a coma.\n; '''Teresa''': One of the main protagonists. The first girl and last person to enter the Glade. When she entered the Glade she was in a [[coma]] and Newt thought she was dead. She also calls Thomas \"Tom\". She has a telepathic connection with Thomas. She is also known to help Thomas out of the maze and fight the Grievers in the Griever Hole. She is thin, has black hair and blue eyes, and relatively pale skin.\n; '''Alby''': The eldest and the leader of the Gladers. He is described as 'The dark-skinned boy with short-cropped hair, his face clean-shaven'. He tries to keep order within the group by having all the boys follow the rules they've set down to survive. He has a very close relationship with Newt, his second-in-command. He was in the group of 30 people who first arrived in the Glade. Alby commits suicide by walking into a group of Grievers, thinking that it was better that he die there than outside the Maze.\n; '''Newt''': One of the main protagonists and is good friends with Thomas and Minho. He used to be a Runner but is no longer able-footed. He is very kind, friendly, and welcoming to Thomas. He is Alby's closest friend and second-in-command and takes over as leader when Alby no longer feels capable.\n;'''Minho''': One of the main protagonists and is the Keeper of the Runners. He is in charge of navigating and mapping out the Maze. As a Runner, he's in very good shape and is described as \"an Asian kid with strong, heavily-muscled arms and short black hair.\" He is sarcastic and a jokester. He tends to react without thinking, which leads himself into trouble. He and Thomas quickly become good friends. \n; '''Chuck''': A young and chubby boy with curly hair who was the newest Glader until Thomas arrived. He immediately becomes friends with Thomas and acts like a little brother towards him. Chuck was a \"Slopper\". He is around 12 or 13&nbsp; years old. He is killed by Gally after a knife is thrown at him while he is saving Thomas (shot in the movie).\n; '''Gally''': The main antagonist. A Glader who lives by the rules Alby put in place. He does not trust Thomas and shows an immense dislike for him. He is also the Keeper of the Builders. He runs away from the Glade in a fit of rage after exclaiming that he thought \"Thomas was not to be trusted\" in the Gathering. At the end of the book, he kills Chuck by throwing a knife into his chest. (shot with a gun in the movie)\n; '''Ben''': A Runner. After undergoing the Changing and attempting to kill Thomas. Ben is banished to the Maze while still induced with the serum and still psycho and dies overnight.\n; '''Ava Paige''': The Chancellor of WICKED and the person responsible for sending teenagers into the Maze. She appears in the Epilogue as an e-mail.\n; '''Grievers''': Mechanical creatures that haunt and kill the Gladers in the maze. In \"The Ending\" they are let free onto the Glade to kill one person every day.\n\n==Development==\nIn late 2005, Dashner had published four books to complete ''The Jimmy Fincher Saga'', which had been with a small regional publisher. His publisher wanted him to write another book, but he decided he would try for a national book market instead. In November of that year he had an idea when going to be \"about a bunch of teenagers living inside an unsolvable Maze full of hideous creatures, in the future, in a dark, dystopian world. It would be an experiment, to study their minds. Terrible things would be done to them &ndash; awful things; completely hopeless &ndash; until the victims turn everything on its head.\" The book was later published in 2009.<ref name=\"tale\">{{cite web |first=James |last=Dashner |url=http://jamesdashner.blogspot.com/2008/07/tale-of-maze-runner.html |title=The Tale of The Maze Runner |publisher=The Dashner Dude |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Dashner wrote the book from December 2005 to March&nbsp;2006.<ref name=\"tale\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote: \"Hard to put down, this is clearly just a first installment, and it will leave readers dying to find out what comes next.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-dashner/the-maze-runner/ |title=The Maze Runner |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nJessica Harrison of the ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' labelled ''The Maze Runner'' as \"a thrilling adventurous book for kids ages&nbsp;13+ that will get readers' hearts pumping and leave them asking for more.\" She noted that it \"starts out a bit slow\" but as it matched Thomas's confusion and picked up pace as he became more accustomed, she wrote that \"it's almost as if Dashner is easing the reader into what becomes a fast-paced, nonstop action.\" However, she thought the \"only drawback\" was the \"fictionalized slang\", saying, \"While it feels realistic and fits with his characters, it gets old pretty fast.

{"title_page": "Robert Johnson (1745\u20131833)", "text_new": "'''Robert Johnson (1745-1833)''' was an Irish [[barrister]], politician and [[judge]]. He sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] and was a judge of the [[Court of Common Pleas (Ireland)]]. \n\nIn 1803 he published a series of venomous attacks on the Irish  Government  in the form of  a series of letters written under the pseudonym  \"Juverna\". After some delay he was identified as the author of the letters. He was prosecuted, after some further delay, and convicted of [[seditious libel]]. He was spared a [[prison sentence]] but forced to resign from the Bench, and retired into private life. \n\nHis motives for writing the ''Juverna''  letters  are unclear, although he had made a similar anonymous  attack on a  senior Irish judge, Christopher Robinson,   many years earlier.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Dublin]], eldest son of [[Thomas Johnson (apothecary)|Thomas Johnson]], an [[apothecary]]. He married Susan Evans of Dublin in 1778. He entered Middle Temple in 1774 and was [[called to the Bar]] in 1776. He [[took silk]]  in 1791, and was appointed counsel to the Revenue Board.  He held office as [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[Hillsborough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Hillsborough]] and also served as MP for Hillsborough.  He supported the [[Act of Union 1800]]. He served briefly in the last session of the pre-Union  [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]  as member for [[Philipstown (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Philipstown]],  and  was made a judge  of the Common Pleas  in 1801, shortly after the Union took effect.\n\nHe had a town house in Dublin and a house at [[Milltown, Dublin |Milltown]] in south County Dublin; he also had a  country estate at the Derries, near [[Ballybrittas]],  [[County  Laois]]. He was a member of the popular drinking club,  [[The Monks of the Screw]] (or Order of Saint Patrick), founded by [[John Philpot Curran]].\n\n==The Juverna affair==\nIn 1803 the radical journalist [[William Cobbett]] published a series of letters in his weekly newspaper ''[[Political Register]]'',  written by an anonymous author calling himself  \"Juverna\". The name  [[Juverna]]  is a variant of \"Hibernia\", and was sometimes used by Irish nationalists as a poetic symbol for Ireland.  These attacked the Irish executive with great venom. They were extremely  well-informed about the Irish judiciary, suggesting that the author was himself a judge.  Suspicion fell  at first on  Johnson's colleague in the Common Pleas,  [[Luke Fox (judge)|Luke Fox]],  who was noted for his violent outbursts in Court. However in a personal interview with [[William Downes, 1st Baron Downes]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], Fox was able to convince Downes of his innocence.\n\nFurther inquiries revealed Johnson to be the author; he may have fallen under suspicion because many years earlier he had published a similar attack on a long-serving High Court judge, [[Christopher Robinson (Irish judge)|Christopher Robinson]],  under another  [[pseudonym]].  In addition, Johnson had few admirers: [[Daniel O'Connell ]] probably spoke for many when he described him as \"dishonest\".  He pleaded for leniency, but the authorities took a severe view of the matter, and a [[arrest warrant|warrant ]]  was issued for his arrest to stand trial in England for seditious libel. Johnson did everything possible to evade prosecution, petitioning each of his  judicial colleagues in vain to cancel the warrant. Finally  Downes, losing patience, had him arrested.  Downes, a very stern man, told Johnson that  his  attempt to evade justice was as serious a matter as the libel itself. After  some further delay he was convicted  of seditious libel in the autumn of 1805. He was forced to resign from the Bench the following year. The rest of his long life was spent in obscurity.\n\n==Sources==\n*Ball, F. Elrington  T''he Judges in Ireland 1221-1921'' London  John Murray 1926\n*Cole, G.D.H.

Best known for his orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'', he composed many other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the [[English folk music#Folk revivals 1890\u20131969|English folksong revival]] of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as [[Maurice Ravel]], led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.\n\n\n\nFat humongous fart erupted in the houses of australia\nThere were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist but was prevented by [[neuritis]] in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] under [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the [[trombone]] professionally and later became a teacher\u2014a great one, according to his colleague [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Among other teaching activities, he built up a strong tradition of performance at [[Morley College]], where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924 and pioneered music education for women at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of [[Whitsun]] music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.\n\nHolst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of ''The Planets'' in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years, his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a considerable influence on a number of younger English composers, including [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Michael Tippett]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. Apart from ''The Planets'' and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\n====Family background====\n[[File:Holst-family-tree.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|right|alt=family tree diagram showing Gustav in relation to three earlier generations|Holst family tree (simplified)]]\nHolst was born in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, ''n\u00e9e'' Lediard.

He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.<ref>Holst (1969), p. 30</ref>\n\nAccording to the composer [[Edmund Rubbra]], who studied under him in the early 1920s, Holst was \"a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of [[Ebenezer Prout|Prout]] and [[John Stainer|Stainer]], but with a miniature score of ''[[Petrushka]]'' or the then recently published [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] of Vaughan Williams\".<ref>Rubbra, p. 40</ref> He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. \"I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest\u2014if I agreed!\u2014that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon&nbsp;...

While written within the traditions of north-country brass-band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, \"from the skipping [[Time signature#Most frequent time signatures|6/8]] of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of ''Saturn''\".<ref>Short, p. 263</ref> 'A Moorside Suite' has undergone major revisionism in the article 'Symphony Within: rehearing Holst's 'A Moorside Suite' by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 edition of 'The Musical Times'.<ref>Stephen Arthur Allen, 'Symphony within: rehearing Holst's \"A Moorside Suite\"', The Musical Times (Winter, 2017), pp.7\u201332</ref> As with 'Egdon Heath' \u2013 commissioned as a symphony \u2013 the article reveals the symphonic nature of this brass-band work.\n\nAfter this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with ''The Wandering Scholar'' (1929\u201330), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen refers to the music as \"Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind\";<ref name=H664/> Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: \"Do you think there's a ''little'' bit too much 6/8 in the opera?\"<ref>Quoted in Short, p. 351</ref> Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being identified with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.<ref>Short, p. 420</ref>\n\nHolst composed few large-scale works in his final years. ''A Choral Fantasia'' of 1930 was written for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] at [[Gloucester]]; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, \"knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of ''Egdon Heath''\".<ref>Holst (1986), pp. 100\u2013101</ref> Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight ''Canons'' of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The ''Brook Green Suite'' (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the ''St Paul's Suite''.<ref name=H663/> The ''Lyric Movement'' for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for [[Lionel Tertis]]. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists.<ref>Short, pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Robin Hull, in ''Penguin Music Magazine'', praised the work's \"clear beauty\u2014impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer\"; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains \"a frail creation\".<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 154</ref> Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier music\u2014\"a summing up of Holst's orchestral art\", according to Short.<ref>Short, pp. 319\u2013320</ref> Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 157</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nHolst made some recordings, conducting his own music. For the [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] company he recorded ''Beni Mora'', the ''Marching Song'' and the complete ''Planets'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) in 1922, using the [[Recording studio#1890s to 1930s|acoustic process]]. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual fade-out of women's voices at the end of \"Neptune\", and the lower strings had to be replaced by a tuba to obtain an effective bass sound.<ref>Short, p. 205</ref> With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the ''St Paul's Suite'' and ''Country Song'' in 1925.<ref>{{cite news|title= Columbia Records|newspaper=The Times|date=5 November 1925|page=10}}</ref> Columbia's main rival, [[the Gramophone Company|HMV]], issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Gramophone Notes |newspaper=The Times|date=9 June 1928|page=12}}</ref> When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded ''The Planets'' for Columbia in 1926.<ref>Short, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn the early [[Long playing record|LP]] era little of Holst's music was available on disc.

By the early years of the 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc.

In it he found \"a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language\".<ref name=dnb/> Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors.

Thus, says Short, \"many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works&nbsp;... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol '[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]'\".<ref>Short, p. 339</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death.

The subsequent inspiration of the [[English folk music#Folk revivals 1890\u20131969|English folksong revival]] of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as [[Maurice Ravel]], led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.\n\nThere were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist but was prevented by [[neuritis]] in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] under [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the [[trombone]] professionally and later became a teacher\u2014a great one, according to his colleague [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Among other teaching activities, he built up a strong tradition of performance at [[Morley College]], where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924 and pioneered music education for women at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of [[Whitsun]] music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.\n\nHolst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of ''The Planets'' in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years, his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a considerable influence on a number of younger English composers, including [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Michael Tippett]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. Apart from ''The Planets'' and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\n====Family background====\n[[File:Holst-family-tree.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|right|alt=family tree diagram showing Gustav in relation to three earlier generations|Holst family tree (simplified)]]\nHolst was born in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, ''n\u00e9e'' Lediard.

Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. \"I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest\u2014if I agreed!\u2014that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon&nbsp;...

Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the ''[[Beni Mora]]'' suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of [[Minimal music|minimalism]] in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in [[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|E flat (1909)]] and [[Second Suite in F for Military Band|F major (1911)]] respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple.<ref name=grove/> This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\".<ref>Short, p. 82</ref> Also in 1911 he wrote ''Hecuba's Lament'', a setting of [[Gilbert Murray]]'s translation from [[Euripides]] built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent [[Hecuba]]'s defiance of divine wrath.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 22</ref> In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with [[plainsong]];<ref name=H662>Holst (1980), p. 662</ref> the same year saw the enduringly popular ''St Paul's Suite'' (a \"gay but retrogressive\" piece according to Dickinson),<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 167</ref> and the failure of his large scale orchestral work ''Phantastes''.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===Full flowering===\n====''The Planets''====\n[[File:Holst-Planets-Saturn-score.jpg|thumb|The opening of \"Saturn\", the fifth movement of ''The Planets'']]\nHolst conceived the idea of ''[[The Planets]]'' in 1913, partly as a result of his interest in astrology,{{refn|Holst was reading [[Alan Leo]]'s booklet ''What is a Horoscope?'' at the time.<ref>Short, p. 122</ref>|group=n}} and also from his determination, despite the failure of ''Phantastes'', to produce a large-scale orchestral work.<ref name=dnb/> The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's [[Five Pieces for Orchestra|''F\u00fcnf Orchesterst\u00fccke'']], and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' or ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]''.<ref name=grove/><ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 169</ref> Holst began composing ''The Planets'' in 1914;

While written within the traditions of north-country brass-band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, \"from the skipping [[Time signature#Most frequent time signatures|6/8]] of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of ''Saturn''\".<ref>Short, p. 263</ref> 'A Moorside Suite' has undergone major revisionism in the article 'Symphony Within: rehearing Holst's 'A Moorside Suite' by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 edition of 'The Musical Times'.<ref>Stephen Arthur Allen, 'Symphony within: rehearing Holst's \"A Moorside Suite\"', The Musical Times (Winter, 2017), pp.7\u201332</ref> As with 'Egdon Heath' \u2013 commissioned as a symphony \u2013 the article reveals the symphonic nature of this brass-band work.\n\nAfter this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with ''The Wandering Scholar'' (1929\u201330), to a text by Clifford Bax.

''A Choral Fantasia'' of 1930 was written for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] at [[Gloucester]]; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, \"knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of ''Egdon Heath''\".<ref>Holst (1986), pp. 100\u2013101</ref> Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight ''Canons'' of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers.

Thus, says Short, \"many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works&nbsp;... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol '[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]'\".<ref>Short, p. 339</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death. It is inscribed with words from the text of ''The Hymn of Jesus'': \"The heavenly spheres make music for us\".<ref>{{cite web|title=A New Memorial for Gustav Holst|url=http://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/a-new-memorial-for-gustav-holst-posted-15-jan-2010.shtml|publisher=Chichester Cathedral|accessdate=20 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422235240/http://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/a-new-memorial-for-gustav-holst-posted-15-jan-2010.shtml#|archive-date=22 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In April 2011 a BBC television documentary, ''Holst: In the Bleak Midwinter'', charted Holst's life with particular reference to his support for socialism and the cause of working people.<ref>{{cite web|title=In the Bleak Midwinter|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010p530|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|25em|group=n|}}\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|25em|}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book | last=Boult | first=Adrian |authorlink=Adrian Boult|title=My Own Trumpet | location=London | publisher=Hamish Hamilton | year=1973 | isbn=0-241-02445-5}}\n* {{cite book | last= Boult | first= Adrian | year=1979 | title=Music and Friends | location= London | publisher= Hamish Hamilton | isbn = 0-241-10178-6}}\n* {{cite book | last= Dickinson | first=Alan Edgar Frederic |editor=Alan Gibbs| year=1995 | title= Holst's Music\u2014A Guide | location=London | publisher= Thames| isbn=0-905210-45-X }}\n* {{cite book | last= Dickinson | first=A E F |editor= Alfred Louis Bacharach|chapter=Gustav Holst| year=1957 | title= The Music Masters IV: The Twentieth Century | location= Harmondsworth| publisher=Penguin | oclc=26234192}}\n* {{cite book | last= Gibbs | first= Alan | title= Holst Among Friends | publisher= Thames Publishing |year= 2000 | location= London | isbn= 978-0-905210-59-9}}\n* {{cite book | last= Holmes | first= Paul | year= 1998| title= Holst |series= Illustrated Lives of the Great Composers| location=London | publisher=Omnibus Press | oclc=650194212 }}\n* {{cite book |authorlink= | last =Holst | first= Gustav| year= 1974|edition=| title= Letters to W.

The site was sold and subsequently redeveloped for housing, employment space, community uses and playing fields.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Ashton Research Station, Bristol|url=http://www.alderking.com/case_studies/pdf/Long%20Ashton%20Research%20Station.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Alder King|accessdate=27 February 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Long Ashton International Symposia==\nThis series of international conferences was well respected and attended by scientists from every continent.\n\n* 1967&nbsp;\u2013 Recent aspects of [[nitrogen]] [[metabolism]] in plants\n* 1969&nbsp;\u2013 [[Physiology]] of tree crops\n* 1971&nbsp;\u2013 [[Fungi|Fungal]] [[pathogenicity]]\n* 1973&nbsp;\u2013 [[Lactic acid]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] in beverages and food\n* 1975&nbsp;\u2013 Environmental effects on crop physiology\n* 1977&nbsp;\u2013 [[Nitrogen]] assimilation of plants\n* 1979&nbsp;\u2013 Quality in stored and processed vegetables and fruit\n* 1982&nbsp;\u2013 Improving vegetatively propagated crops\n* 1984&nbsp;\u2013 Rational [[pesticide]] use\n* 1986&nbsp;\u2013 [[Hormone]] action in plant development&nbsp;\u2014 a critical appraisal\n* 1989&nbsp;\u2013 [[Herbicide resistance]] in weeds and crops\n* 1991&nbsp;\u2013 Transport and receptor [[protein]]s of plant [[cell membrane|membrane]]s: molecular structure and function\n* 1993&nbsp;\u2013 Ecology and integrated farming systems\n* 1995&nbsp;\u2013 Plant [[root]]s&nbsp;\u2014 from [[cell (biology)|cells]] to systems\n* 1997&nbsp;\u2013 Understanding [[pathosystems]]: a focus on ''[[Septoria]]''\n* 1999&nbsp;\u2013 [[Biotechnology]] of cereals: tools, targets and triumphs\n* 2002&nbsp;\u2013 New frontiers in plant development: from [[gene]]s to [[phenotype]]\n\n==Notable former staff==\n* [[John Pilkington Hudson]]&nbsp;\u2013 director, horticultural scientist\n* [[H.G.H.
