AB De Villiers captained two matches while Fakhar Zaman led the side in six matches. They finished sixth in the season after winning three of their ten matches, and as a result, were eliminated in the group stage for the fourth consecutive year.

In their first match against the [[Multan Sultans]], they went off to a solid start, [[Chris Lynn]] and [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer|Fakhar Zaman]] made an opening partnership of 59 in 4 overs. After that, the team collapsed and scored a total of 138-8. Multan in reply chased the target in 16.1 overs which led Lahore to lose their opening game. In their second match, they batted well and then with the balling dragged the match to the last over. [[Islamabad United]] needed 9 to win of the final over with one wicket in hand and the irresponsible decision of calling [[Usman Khan]] led them to lose and [[Musa Khan]] become a Islamabad hero. In the third match, it was reduced to 12 overs due to rain delay. [[Dilbar Hussain]] bowled well, in the end Lahore lost by 12 runs. Lucked turned around when they won against [[Quetta Gladiators]] in their fourth match, [[Ben Dunk]] scored a terrific 93* with 11 sixes, making a record for the most sixes in an innings in PSL and was named Man-of-the-match. Lahore were humiliated by [[Islamabad United]] in their home ground losing by 71 runs. In their sixth match, the spinners humiliated [[Quetta Gladiators]], taking 9 wickets while conceding 98 runs and winning the match by 8 wickets. [[Ben Dunk]] again made a record for most sixes in an innings with 13 sixes and an unbeaten 99* helping them chase down a huge target of 188 with ease. After consecutively losing to the [[Peshawar Zalmi]] in the last seasons, this time lahore won by 5 wickets 50's from both [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)|Fakhar Zaman]] and [[Chris Lynn]] with [[David Wiese]] finishing it off in style with a six while chasing down a monstrous target of 188 and winning with ease in the end. In their second last match of the group stage against [[Karachi Kings]], they miserably lost with giving a target of 150 and failing to take a wicket while bowling. Their last match was a must win to qualify for the semis, it was against [[Multan Sultans]]. Again they were given to chase 188. The openers [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)|Fakhar Zaman\n]] and [[Chris Lynn]] made a partnership of 100, then Fakhar got out. Chris Lynn led his team to the semis posting the first ever century for a Lahore Qalandars and leading them to the first ever semis.

After consecutively losing to the [[Peshawar Zalmi]] in the last seasons, this time lahore won by 5 wickets 50's from both [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)|Fakhar Zaman]] and [[Chris Lynn]] with [[David Wiese]] finishing it off in style with a six while chasing down a monstrous target of 188 and winning with ease in the end. In their second last match of the group stage against [[Karachi Kings]], they miserably lost with giving a target of 150 and failing to take a wicket while bowling. Their last match was a must win to qualify for the semis, it was against [[Multan Sultans]]. Again they were given to chase 188. The openers [[Fakhar Zaman]] and [[Chris Lynn]] made a partnership of 100, then Fakhar got out. Chris Lynn led his team to the semis posting the first ever century for a Lahore Qalandars and leading them to the first ever semis.

{"title_page": "The Wide Window", "text_new": "'''''The Wide Window''''' is the third novel of the [[Children's literature|children's]] book series ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' by [[Lemony Snicket]]. In this novel, the Baudelaire orphans live with their aunt Josephine, who is seemingly scared of everything. The book was published on February 25th, 2000 by [[HarperCollins]] and illustrated by [[Brett Helquist]].{{Infobox book| \n| name          = The Wide Window\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| image         = The Wide Window USA.PNG\n| caption       = First edition cover\n| author        = [[Lemony Snicket]] (pen name of [[Daniel Handler]])\n| illustrator   = [[Brett Helquist]]\n| cover_artist  = Brett Helquist\n| country       = United States\n| language      = English\n| series        = ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]''\n| genre         = {{hlist|[[Gothic fiction]]|[[Absurdist fiction]]|[[Mystery fiction|Mystery]]}}\n| publisher     = [[HarperCollins]]\n| release_date  = February 25, 2000\n| media_type    = Print (hardback & paperback)\n| pages         = 214\n| isbn          = 0-06-440768-3\n| dewey= [[Fiction|Fic]] 21\n| congress= PZ7.S6795 Wi 2000\n| oclc= 41355668\n| preceded_by   = [[The Reptile Room]]\n| followed_by   = [[The Miserable Mill]]\n}}\n\n==Plot==\n\nMr. Poe puts the Baudelaire orphans,(Violet, Klaus,and Sunny) under the care of Aunt Josephine, who lives in a house atop a hill overlooking Lake Lachrymose, a lake so large that hurricanes have occurred in that area. Aunt Josephine is afraid of almost everything from cooking food because she is scared that her stove would explode, to her welcome mat. Her library is filled with books about the grammar of the English language because she had loved grammar.\n\nWhile helping Aunt Josephine in the grocery store, Violet runs into a sailor named \"Captain Sham\", who she concludes is Count Olaf, a vile and terrible man who continuously and relentlessly tried to steal the Baudelaire fortune that they would inherit when Violet comes of age. Aunt Josephine declines to believe this due to Captain Sham's charming personality. That night, the children hear a crash and find out that their new guardian had jumped out of the Wide Window that overlooks Lake Lachrymose, and that before doing so left a note for them informing them that Captain Sham will be their new guardian.\n\nMr. Poe refuses to believe the children's claim the note was a lie by Count Olaf and takes them to dinner with him at a cheap and grimy restaurant with an over-enthusiastic waiter, the Anxious Clown. Needing a distraction to come up with a strategy, Violet puts peppermints in her own food and that of Klaus and Sunny. Allergic, they break into [[Urticaria|hives]], forcing Count Olaf to allow them to go back to their aunt's house. Klaus shows them the note is in Aunt Josephine's handwriting but coded a hidden message using grammar errors, which all together form the two words 'Curdled Cave'. Once they finish the note, Hurricane Herman hits and the house begins to fall apart into the lake.\n\nWith this information, the Baudelaire orphans go to steal a boat from Captain Sham's boat store near Lake Lachrymose to get to Curdled Cave while the hurricane continues on. There, they encounter one of Count Olaf's henchpeople, a [[List of supporting A Series of Unfortunate Events characters|large person of undetermined gender]]. They endure the storm and reach the Curdled Cave, where Aunt Josephine reveals that Count Olaf forced her to write the note, and broke the Wide Window to cause them to believe that she had committed suicide.\n\nWhile travelling back, Lachrymose [[leech]]es attempt to suck their blood due to smelling food in Aunt Josephine's stomach since she ate a banana under the one hour limit. They are able to signal for help, but only Count Olaf arrives on a ship. After leaving Aunt Josephine to be eaten by the leeches, he brings the children back to the house, where Sunny is able to prove that he was Count Olaf to Mr. Poe by biting Count Olaf's fake wooden peg in half to reveal his eye tattoo underneath. He and his henchperson lock the Baudelaire Orphans and Mr. Poe in the gate of Captain Sham's boat rental and escape, leaving Mr. Poe to once again find a home for the orphans.\n\n==Foreshadowing==\nOn the side of a building in the picture hangs a sign in the shape of a pair of glasses with a pair of squinting eyes, referencing Dr. Orwell's Office in ''[[The Miserable Mill]]''.\n\n==Cultural references and literary allusions==\n*The name Damocles Dock presumably alludes to the legendary Greek figure [[Damocles]] who had a sword dangling over his head. The picture at the beginning of the book shows the three Baudelaires standing on Damocles Dock. In the archway at the entrance to the dock is a sword dangling over their heads.\n*In the previous book of the series, the endnote references the Caf\u00e9 Kafka, a reference to the Austrian-Hungarian author [[Franz Kafka]]. One of Kafka's short stories, \"[[Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk]]\", features Josephine, the only mouse that can sing. In the short story, Josephine's music sounds like whistling if heard from the wrong angle, which may be a reference{{original research inline|date=April 2014}} to Aunt Josephine's late husband's ability to whistle with crackers in his mouth (along with the [[Baudelaire orphans]]' mother). Josephine's last name was Anwhistle, making her husband Ike Anwhistle (\"I can whistle\").\n*Lachrymose (Lachrymose Lake) means \"given to or causing tears\".\n*The TV adaptation includes several references to ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', including naming the hurricane Herman after author [[Herman Melville]] and the cab driver saying \"[[Call me Ishmael]]!\".\n\n==Special editions==\n\n===Disappearance!===\n'''''A Series of Unfortunate Events No.3: The Wide Window or, Disappearance!'''''<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0061146331/ Amazon.com: A Series of Unfortunate Events #3: The Wide Window: Or, Disappearance!

A year later, her best friend [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] gets her out during a prison break and tries to convince her that he does not love her. Despite Ivy's support, Harley's attempt to break up with Joker fails after he sweet-talks her into staying with him. The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger. Following a costume change, Harley officially breaks up with Joker and declares her intention to make a name for herself in the criminal underworld.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A High Bar\n| DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo<br>[[Ben Jones (Canadian cartoonist)|Ben Jones]]<br>Frank Marino\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = Believing she has to join the [[Legion of Doom]] to prove herself as a supervillain, Harley attempts to make a big splash by crashing one of their criminal enterprises with Ivy's help. However, they accidentally crash a Bar Mitzvah for [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s nephew, Joshua. When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants. They rush to her apartment to retrieve the antidote and return in time to help Harley fight off the other villains. Using her psychology background, Harley convinces them to stop taking abuse from Joker, forcing the clown prince to leave.

However, she struggles to recruit others to her cause due to her gender and her past association with Joker. After talking with the [[Queen of Fables]], Harley decides she needs other downtrodden villains like her. She starts by recruiting disgraced [[Wonder Woman]] villain [[Doctor Psycho]], who was kicked out of the Legion of Doom by [[Lex Luthor]] for calling her and [[Giganta]] the \"[[Cunt|C word]]\" on national television instead of the \"[[Bitch (slang)|B word]].\" They next recruit Gotham City's shapeshifting thespian extraordinaire [[Clayface]] after meeting him in a bar. For their first heist, Harley decides to rob [[Maxie Zeus]]' Olympic Gold Medals as revenge for insults he made against her during her quest. Despite their initial struggles, they ultimately succeed after brutally beating up Zeus before Harley sells the medals to purchase a nuclear warhead and force the city into naming a highway after her.

Even worse, Robin appears on a talk show and lies about Harley agreeing to be his nemesis. After a failed attempt to get [[Superman]] to be her nemesis by kidnapping [[Lois Lane]], Harley recruits [[King Shark]] into her crew, captures Robin, threatens him into confessing he lied, then reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain to publicly humiliate him. When King Shark goes berserk after smelling blood, Batman arrives and subdues him before getting into a three-way brawl with the arriving Joker, Harley, and Ivy. Joker ends the fight by kidnapping Robin and forcing Batman to pursue them. Much to Ivy's dismay, she and Harley's crew are evicted from their apartment by their cybernetic landlord [[Sy Borgman]].

Ivy has Psycho bring them, Clayface, and King Shark into Harley's mind and meet up with her consciousness. However, she accidentally triggers her mental defenses and locks them all in. While trying to find the \"Emergency Exit\" in her subconscious, Harley discovers her indecision comes from the belief her \"origin story\" was not her decision and that she altered her memory to believe that her becoming a villain was Joker's doing. Choosing the moment she broke up with him as her true \"origin story,\" Harley cures herself somewhat. Meanwhile, Borgman finds Harley and her crew's comatose bodies and believes they committed suicide, so he takes them to an abandoned mall to cremate them. At the last minute, everyone wakes up and nearly kill Borgman. Upon seeing the mall however, Harley decides to make it their new lair.

Becoming depressed after learning Batman doesn't see him as a friend and confiscated the [[Bat-Signal]] after he abused it, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] interrogates Clayface's hand for the location of Harley's crew, but eventually bonds with it. While Harley, Clayface, and King Shark try to recover the hand, Ivy and Psycho seek revenge on an online personality called the Cowled Critic, who slandered them. King Shark is beaten by police officers and sent to prison while Ivy and Psycho learn the Cowled Critic is the latter's estranged son Herman, and makes amends with him. While in a shoot-out with Gordon, Harley discovers the device is a teleporter when it sends her to the [[Batcave]]. Once Harley realizes she had been selfish and ignoring her teammates, she encourages Batman to help stop Gordon after he starts obsessively defending the hand. Batman reconciles with Gordon, Clayface reabsorbs his hand, and Harley and her crew escape.

They then use the force field device to steal a weather-controlling machine from Kord Industries to ransom the city, but the Queen shows up to steal it for herself. They are interrupted by Jason Praxis, a surviving member of the family with electrical powers who seeks revenge on the Queen for their murder. Harley uses the force field device to protect the Queen, subdue Praxis, and get her to leave. Killing Praxis on her way out however, the Queen tells Harley that only villains willing to cross any line can succeed and that she'll regret letting her live.

He secretly reveals to Ivy however that he is not actually interested in Harley and will not let her join unless she joins as well. Ivy refuses and tries to warn Harley of Luthor's treachery. Suddenly, [[Aquaman]] breaks into the Hall of Doom and beats up several villains while seeking revenge for Harley's theft, but she tricks him into breaking an aquarium and focus on saving the fish. As thanks, the Legion inducts Harley as an official member. Harley accuses Ivy of lying to her and they angrily part ways. Meanwhile, Psycho and Borgman deal with a mutant monster in their lair's basement. When Psycho tries to kill it, Borgman stops him; revealing it's his sister Mirielle, who got mutated because of him.

Unlike Harley however, her crew are treated as lowly henchmen and Bane hires them to help him get revenge on a clerk for always getting his name wrong. Harley attends a dinner date with Joker to try to persuade him to convince Luthor to elevate her crew's status, but she has so much fun with him, she forgets to tell him. While planting a bomb for Bane, King Shark ends up being hospitalized after the former loses patience and detonates it early. When Batman pursues them, Joker kisses Harley before shoving her out of his helicopter to slow the dark knight down.

Meanwhile, Ivy finds herself trapped in a laboratory, but manages to use a dandelion to tell her sentient plant Frank to get Harley's help. She's later shocked to find that Scarecrow's her captor. Another assassin attacks and kills Harley's grandfather before she defeats her. Her parents suddenly attack her, explaining that someone put a bounty on her and they aim to collect.

Harley disapproves of their control, especially after they give her a small amount of territory, and attempts to rebel against them; only to get herself captured. Months later, Ivy and the rest of the crew manage to break her out, giving her the chance to murder the Penguin and see that the rest of the Injustice League have taken over the rest of Gotham.

Harley and Ivy steal the invitations for themselves and Clayface and successfully enter the party, where they learn that the kidnapped students are being used as human batteries before Riddler captures them. Meanwhile, dissatisfied with doing nothing, Barbara becomes inspired by her father, Commissioner Gordon, to stop Riddler herself. Despite being outnumbered, she manages to take out the generator, subdue Riddler, and free everyone. Instead of killing Riddler, Harley, Ivy, and Clayface use him to power the mall while Barbara makes the decision to become [[Batgirl]].\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Trapped\n| DirectedBy      = Brandon McKinney\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Peters\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|17}}\n| ShortSummary    = After a failed attempt to infiltrate Mr. Freeze's lair, Harley and her crew decide to steal [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]]'s flamethrower from [[Doctor Trap]]'s museum in order to melt their way in. Harley and Ivy recruit Kite Man and [[Catwoman]] to help them while the others have to locate Riddler after he manipulated Psycho into facilitating his escape. During the theft, Ivy starts to question the direction her life is going in and finds herself under even more pressure as Kite Man tries to steal a ring from the museum and propose to her. To make matters worse, Catwoman betrays them and escapes on her own, leaving them to die until they manage to escape using the flamethrower. After beating Doctor Trap and heading home, Harley and Ivy help the rest of the crew recapture Riddler, who decides to keep powering the mall due to the benefits that come with it. Afterward, Harley convinces Ivy that she does not have to feel ashamed about letting her past go, so the latter goes to find Kite Man and insists he pop the question again.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 17\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

Despite Ivy's support, Harley's attempt to break up with Joker fails after he sweet-talks her into staying with him. The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger.

When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants. They rush to her apartment to retrieve the antidote and return in time to help Harley fight off the other villains. Using her psychology background, Harley convinces them to stop taking abuse from Joker, forcing the clown prince to leave.

After talking with the [[Queen of Fables]], Harley decides she needs other downtrodden villains like her. She starts by recruiting disgraced [[Wonder Woman]] villain [[Doctor Psycho]], who was kicked out of the Legion of Doom by [[Lex Luthor]] for calling her and [[Giganta]] the \"[[Cunt|C word]]\" on national television instead of the \"[[Bitch (slang)|B word]].\" They next recruit Gotham City's shapeshifting thespian extraordinaire [[Clayface]] after meeting him in a bar. For their first heist, Harley decides to rob [[Maxie Zeus]]' Olympic Gold Medals as revenge for insults he made against her during her quest. Despite their initial struggles, they ultimately succeed after brutally beating up Zeus before Harley sells the medals to purchase a nuclear warhead and force the city into naming a highway after her.

After a failed attempt to get [[Superman]] to be her nemesis by kidnapping [[Lois Lane]], Harley recruits [[King Shark]] into her crew, captures Robin, threatens him into confessing he lied, then reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain to publicly humiliate him. When King Shark goes berserk after smelling blood, Batman arrives and subdues him before getting into a three-way brawl with the arriving Joker, Harley, and Ivy. Joker ends the fight by kidnapping Robin and forcing Batman to pursue them. Much to Ivy's dismay, she and Harley's crew are evicted from their apartment by their cybernetic landlord [[Sy Borgman]].

While trying to find the \"Emergency Exit\" in her subconscious, Harley discovers her indecision comes from the belief her \"origin story\" was not her decision and that she altered her memory to believe that her becoming a villain was Joker's doing. Choosing the moment she broke up with him as her true \"origin story,\" Harley cures herself somewhat. Meanwhile, Borgman finds Harley and her crew's comatose bodies and believes they committed suicide, so he takes them to an abandoned mall to cremate them.

While Harley, Clayface, and King Shark try to recover the hand, Ivy and Psycho seek revenge on an online personality called the Cowled Critic, who slandered them. King Shark is beaten by police officers and sent to prison while Ivy and Psycho learn the Cowled Critic is the latter's estranged son Herman, and makes amends with him. While in a shoot-out with Gordon, Harley discovers the device is a teleporter when it sends her to the [[Batcave]]. Once Harley realizes she had been selfish and ignoring her teammates, she encourages Batman to help stop Gordon after he starts obsessively defending the hand.

Just then, Joker appears with a large tower and destroys the Hall of Doom as he enacts his plans to take over Gotham City and orders the Queen to kill Harley and her team. Ivy uses the contaminated water to grow into a giant to fight the trees while Harley defeats the Queen, beheading her in the process. Just as Harley makes amends with Ivy, Joker shoots a giant flagpole through Ivy's chest.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = The Final Joke\n| DirectedBy      = Brandon McKinney\n| WrittenBy       = Tom Hyndman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|21}}\n| ShortSummary    = Harley's crew, Frank, and Kite Man hold an impromptu funeral for Ivy before they join forces with Batman to avenge her. While they distract Joker, Batman skydives to the top of the tower to take him down. However, Clayface inadvertently ruins the plan and gets the crew and Batman captured while Harley is forced into hiding. His takeover largely complete, Joker spends the next week subjugating Gotham and brutally torturing Batman and the crew, only to get bored. Hoping to help, Scarecrow unmasks Batman, but Joker kills him for ruining the \"mystery\". Meanwhile, Harley revisits Ivy's grave, where Frank and Kite Man tell her the crew's going to be publicly executed, so she surrenders herself in exchange for their lives. Once her crew's safe, Harley tries to kill Joker, but he gets the upper hand. Instead of killing her, Joker decides to drop her in acid that will render her \"normal.\" At the last minute, a resurrected Ivy saves Harley and drops Joker in the acid, though not before he destroys his tower and Gotham. Batman saves Harley and Ivy before disappearing in the debris. Reunited, the crew reflect on everything that has happened amidst Gotham's ruins while a \"normal\" Joker emerges from the rubble.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2020)===\n{{Episode table |background=#000000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=25 |director=17 |writer=32 |airdate=16 |released=y |titleR=<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dcuniverse.com/videos/harley-quinn/193/season-2 |title=Watch ''Harley '' Season 2 on DC Universe |website=DC Universe |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |url-access=limited}}</ref> |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/harley-quinn/listings/|title=Shows A-Z - harley quinn on dc|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 14\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = New Gotham\n| DirectedBy      = Vinton Heuck\n| WrittenBy       = Adam Stein\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3}}\n| ShortSummary    = Weeks after Joker's defeat and Batman's disappearance, the President has declared the destroyed Gotham a no man's land while Harley and her crew revel in the resulting anarchy and Robin tries to take up the mantle of Batman. What's left of the GCPD, with the exception of Gordon, have become outnumbered and unmotivated to restore law and order as various sections of the city have been taken over by the Penguin, the Riddler, Bane, Two-Face, and [[Mr. Freeze]]; who have formed the [[Injustice League]] following the Legion of Doom's destruction. Harley disapproves of their control, especially after they give her a small amount of territory, and attempts to rebel against them; only to get herself captured. Months later, Ivy and the rest of the crew manage to break her out, giving her the chance to murder the Penguin and see that the rest of the Injustice League have taken over the rest of Gotham. Seeing as how she was the one who defeated the Joker, Harley believes she deserves to rule the city and vows to take out all of her rivals.

Harley and Ivy track down Barbara to kill her before she can warn Riddler, but she tells them she wants to stop him after deducing he was responsible for kidnapping students ever since he took over and that she procured invitations for a party at a fraternity house where the disappearances are happening. Harley and Ivy steal the invitations for themselves and Clayface and successfully enter the party, where they learn that the kidnapped students are being used as human batteries before Riddler captures them. Meanwhile, dissatisfied with doing nothing, Barbara becomes inspired by her father, Commissioner Gordon, to stop Riddler herself. Despite being outnumbered, she manages to take out the generator, subdue Riddler, and free everyone.

To make matters worse, Catwoman betrays them and escapes on her own, leaving them to die until they manage to escape using the flamethrower. After beating Doctor Trap and heading home, Harley and Ivy help the rest of the crew recapture Riddler, who decides to keep powering the mall due to the benefits that come with it.

In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].<ref name=\"fromherz\"/>\n\nEffendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah.

Additionally, the country has seen job cuts in 2016 from its petroleum companies and other sectors in the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/taxes-on-junk-food-luxury-items-to-be-rolled-out-in-qatar-soon/|title=Taxes on junk food, luxury items to be rolled out in Qatar soon|date=16 February 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/tag/layoffs/|title=layoffs Archives \u2013 Doha News|website=Doha News|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Energy===\n{{main|Energy in Qatar}}\n[[File:ORYX GTL Plant - Qatar.jpg|thumb|Oryx [[Gas to liquids|GTL]] plant in Qatar]]\n{{As of|2012}}, Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource. As a result, it is the richest state per-capita in the world. None of its 2 million residents live below the poverty line and less than 1% are unemployed.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\">{{cite web|author=Simon Lincoln Reader |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/11/12/qatar-shows-how-money-can-solve-most-problems |title=Qatar shows how money can solve most problems |publisher=Bdlive.co.za |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n[[File:Qatar Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Qatar's product exports in 28 color-coded categories (2011).]]\nOil production will not remain at the peak level of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m\u00b3) per day for long as the national oil fields are projected to be largely depleted by 2023. Large natural gas reserves have, however, been located off Qatar's northeast coast. Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000&nbsp;km\u00b3). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in [[Umm Said]], include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m\u00b3) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar's [[Qatar National Vision 2030|National Vision 2030]] has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades.<ref name=\"Qatar National Vision 2030\" /> Qatar pursues a vigorous programme of \"[[Qatarization|Qatarisation]]\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar may suffer significant geopolitical losses if there is a global transition to renewable energy; it is ranked 152 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Bazilian|first2=Morgan|last3=Ilimbek Uulu|first3=Talgat|last4=Vakulchuk|first4=Roman|last5=Westphal|first5=Kirsten|date=2019|title=The GeGaLo index: Geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211467X19300999|journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|language=en|volume=26|pages=100406|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100406|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n{{Main|Transport in Qatar}}\n[[File:Hamad International Airport Doha Qatar 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamad International Airport]]]]\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\n\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity.\n\n[[File:QTR A7-APA A380!137 EDHI 16-04-14.jpg|thumb|[[Qatar Airways]] [[Airbus A380]], Qatar Airways, one of the world's largest airlines, links over 150 international destinations from its base in [[Doha]].]]\nMass-transit options, such as a [[Doha metro]], light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers.\n\n[[Hamad International Airport]] is the [[international airport]] of [[Doha]].

Qatari-Ottoman relations, however, soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of [[Abu Dhabi]]-occupied [[Khawr al Udayd]].

Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah ({{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}} west of [[Doha]]), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disbands his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].<ref name=\"fromherz\"/>\n\nEffendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they were again forced to draw back from a Qatari incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land.<ref>Habibur Rahman, p. 152</ref> Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |title=Battle of Al Wajbah |publisher=Qatar Visitor |date=2 June 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117024415/http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |archivedate=17 January 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===British period (1916\u20131971)===\n[[File:Al Zubarah (6989829695).jpg|thumb|left|[[Zubarah Fort]] built in 1938.]]\nBy the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha.

OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n[[File:Qatar Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Qatar's product exports in 28 color-coded categories (2011).]]\nOil production will not remain at the peak level of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m\u00b3) per day for long as the national oil fields are projected to be largely depleted by 2023. Large natural gas reserves have, however, been located off Qatar's northeast coast. Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000&nbsp;km\u00b3). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in [[Umm Said]], include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m\u00b3) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar's [[Qatar National Vision 2030|National Vision 2030]] has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades.<ref name=\"Qatar National Vision 2030\" /> Qatar pursues a vigorous programme of \"[[Qatarization|Qatarisation]]\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.<ref name=\"bdlive.co.za\" />\n\nQatar may suffer significant geopolitical losses if there is a global transition to renewable energy; it is ranked 152 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Bazilian|first2=Morgan|last3=Ilimbek Uulu|first3=Talgat|last4=Vakulchuk|first4=Roman|last5=Westphal|first5=Kirsten|date=2019|title=The GeGaLo index: Geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211467X19300999|journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|language=en|volume=26|pages=100406|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100406|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n{{Main|Transport in Qatar}}\n[[File:Hamad International Airport Doha Qatar 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamad International Airport]]]]\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\n\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity.\n\n[[File:QTR A7-APA A380!137 EDHI 16-04-14.jpg|thumb|[[Qatar Airways]] [[Airbus A380]], Qatar Airways, one of the world's largest airlines, links over 150 international destinations from its base in [[Doha]].]]\nMass-transit options, such as a [[Doha metro]], light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion.

{"title_page": "Burke (series)", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Burke'' (series)}}\nThe '''''Burke'' series''' is an 18-book [[fiction]] series written by [[Andrew Vachss]],<ref name=\"credentials\">[http://www.vachss.com/vachss/credentials.html Andrew Vachss, ''The '']</ref> centered on a man named [[Burke (character)|Burke]] and his battle against child abusers/molesters. The series is written from Burke's perspective in the [[first person narrative|first person]].\n\nThe first book, ''Flood'', was published in 1985; the 18th and final, ''Another Life'', was published in December 2008.\n\n==Childhood/early years==\n[[Burke (character)|Burke]] was abandoned at birth by his teenage mother. She wasn't sure who his father was. He was passed around from surrogate home to surrogate through his early years. It is revealed that Burke was abused in the various foster homes, severely scarring his mental state.\n\nIn his teenage years, Burke lived on the streets with gangs of other abandoned, abused children. Throughout the series Burke describes those days as when he was a \"cowboy\". Burke states he always intended to die robbing a convenience store or in a gang war.\n\n==Prison sentences/creating family of choice==\nBurke went to prison twice, and in prison found friends that become part of his Family of Choice. Of the several lifelong companions, Burke finds a fatherly figure, known as the \"Prof\", in his first stay in prison. The name is short for both Professor and Prophet, depending on who's listening.\n\nThe Prof teaches Burke a philosophy that Burke lives by for the rest of his life: Survive. The Prof shows Burke how to stay alive without fighting, how to use knowledge, any knowledge he can get, to have at his disposal. Burke takes this to heart, reads the entire prison library, and when he is released from prison before the Prof, Burke waits for his mentor and picks him up when he himself is released.\n\nBurke also meets and adopts as his brother a man known as \"Max the Silent\" (sometimes extended to \"Max the Silent, widowmaking wind of death\"). Max is a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] warrior, and is [[deaf]] and [[Muteness|mute]].\n\nBurke comes to know another man known as the \"Mole\", an anti-Nazi Jew who specializes in bombs, weaponry, breaking and entering, chemistry, and computer hacking. The Mole is associated with Michelle, a [[transsexual]] woman who teaches Burke social skills, and Terry, a young man Burke had once rescued from a [[pimp]] and his abusive bio-family, whom Michelle and the Mole have adopted and are teaching their skills.\n\nBurke moves on to a career of hijacking after his first release from prison, and after a crooked deal with a gang Burke ends up holding off the police with a crate full of grenades in an abandoned subway tunnel in order to give his brothers (Max, the Prof, and the Mole) time to escape.\n\nDuring his second prison sentence, Burke states he \"finds the freaks\". Burke becomes intensely aware of child abuse and the scars it leaves upon a youth's mind.  Burke spends this prison sentence \"studying\" the freaks, and when he is released he becomes an unlicensed [[private investigator]]. He spends considerable resources and effort to live \"off the radar,\" with multiple false identities. He mentions a man who he pays to file false payroll and income taxes on his behalf.\n\nBurke begins to battle child abuse, assists (a few) police in locating runaway girls, takes on cases (for generous amounts of money), runs fake subscriptions for [[kiddie porn]] in order to keep a list of known \"freaks\", steals, extorts, blackmails and anything else he can do to remain anonymous from [[police]] but still make a difference and, in his own way, find vengeance for the misdeeds committed to him as a child.\n\n==Pansy==\nDogs have been a critical part of the Burke series.  Burke shares his life with Pansy, a [[Neapolitan Mastiff]] he has raised from puppyhood. She is a robust, ice cream and Chinese food eating blue Neo.

The series is written from Burke's perspective in the [[first person narrative|first person]].\n\nThe first book, ''Flood'', was published in 1985; the 18th and final, ''Another Life'', was published in December 2008.\n\n==Childhood/early years==\n[[Burke (character)|Burke]] was abandoned at birth by his teenage mother. She wasn't sure who his father was. He was passed around from surrogate home to surrogate through his early years. It is revealed that Burke was abused in the various foster homes, severely scarring his mental state.\n\nIn his teenage years, Burke lived on the streets with gangs of other abandoned, abused children. Throughout the series Burke describes those days as when he was a \"cowboy\". Burke states he always intended to die robbing a convenience store or in a gang war.\n\n==Prison sentences/creating family of choice==\nBurke went to prison twice, and in prison found friends that become part of his Family of Choice. Of the several lifelong companions, Burke finds a fatherly figure, known as the \"Prof\", in his first stay in prison. The name is short for both Professor and Prophet, depending on who's listening.\n\nThe Prof teaches Burke a philosophy that Burke lives by for the rest of his life: Survive. The Prof shows Burke how to stay alive without fighting, how to use knowledge, any knowledge he can get, to have at his disposal. Burke takes this to heart, reads the entire prison library, and when he is released from prison before the Prof, Burke waits for his mentor and picks him up when he himself is released.\n\nBurke also meets and adopts as his brother a man known as \"Max the Silent\" (sometimes extended to \"Max the Silent, widowmaking wind of death\"). Max is a [[Tibetan]] warrior, and is [[deaf]] and [[Muteness|mute]].\n\nBurke comes to know another man known as the \"Mole\", an anti-Nazi Jew who specializes in bombs, weaponry, breaking and entering, chemistry, and computer hacking. The Mole is associated with Michelle, a [[transsexual]] woman who teaches Burke social skills, and Terry, a young man Burke had once rescued from a [[pimp]] and his abusive bio-family, whom Michelle and the Mole have adopted and are teaching their skills.\n\nBurke moves on to a career of hijacking after his first release from prison, and after a crooked deal with a gang Burke ends up holding off the police with a crate full of grenades in an abandoned subway tunnel in order to give his brothers (Max, the Prof, and the Mole) time to escape.\n\nDuring his second prison sentence, Burke states he \"finds the freaks\". Burke becomes intensely aware of child abuse and the scars it leaves upon a youth's mind.  Burke spends this prison sentence \"studying\" the freaks, and when he is released he becomes an unlicensed [[private investigator]]. He spends considerable resources and effort to live \"off the radar,\" with multiple false identities. He mentions a man who he pays to file false payroll and income taxes on his behalf.\n\nBurke begins to battle child abuse, assists (a few) police in locating runaway girls, takes on cases (for generous amounts of money), runs fake subscriptions for [[kiddie porn]] in order to keep a list of known \"freaks\", steals, extorts, blackmails and anything else he can do to remain anonymous from [[police]] but still make a difference and, in his own way, find vengeance for the misdeeds committed to him as a child.\n\n==Pansy==\nDogs have been a critical part of the Burke series.  Burke shares his life with Pansy, a [[Neapolitan Mastiff]] he has raised from puppyhood. She is a robust, ice cream and Chinese food eating blue Neo. For Vachss fans, Pansy and  [[Vachss#Child_protection|Burke]] are both icons for \"The Children of the Secret\".

They participate in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. They currently have 25 teams across schoolboy, junior and senior grades. The Roosters premier team began the [[Te Atatu Roosters 2019 Season|2019 season]] in the \"Fox Championship Qualifying Competition\", but after qualifying first they gained entry to the Fox Championship competition where a top 4 finish will see them begin the 2020 season in the top division.\n[[File:Te Atatu v New Lynn.jpg|thumb|right|Te Atatu scoring v New Lynn]]\n\n==Home Ground==\nThe Roosters play at the [[Auckland Council|council owned]] [[Jack Colvin Park]] located on the [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]], next to the [[North Western Motorway]]. Junior teams play at [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]], and at Gloria Park both also on the peninsula.\n\n== History ==\nThe Te Atatu club was founded in 1955 after the opening of the North-Western motorway led to suburban growth in the Te Atat\u016b area. The first team was a 7-aside team formed to represent Te Atatu North and South. They initially had to wear [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] jerseys and their first ever game was against Wesley at [[Fowlds Park]]. The first training area was in a cow paddock on Edmonton Rd, before they were later able to move to [[Ramlea Park]].\n\nIn 1961 Te Atatu won their first schoolboy championship in their Te Atatu colours. In 1960\u201361 [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]] was developed on Neil Avenue and in 1965 they fielded their first senior side in the Senior B grade. The ground is still commonly referred to as 'Neil Ave'.\n\nIn the late 1960s work began on the current club rooms on Toru Avenue. They were built on Crown (council) land arranged with Waitemata Mayor [[Jack Colvin]] after 3 club members were elected to the WCC Parks Committee. However, before the club rooms could be built the land needed to be prepared. The land was in such poor condition that no other clubs had bothered applying for it, and life member Ken Pitman described the task of preparing it thus: \"What a mess, over six acres of swamp, gorse and pine trees, five feet thick. Well we were all enthusiastic and silly enough to attempt the impossible. We chopped, scrounged, swore, drank and burned our way through the lot\". The council also helped by putting a culvert under the motorway and realigned the creek which ran through the park. Eventually the playing fields were established and work could begin on the club rooms.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/67998177/</ref>\n\nThe club rooms took over 6 years to complete with the foundation stone being laid on 17 December 1962, with the official opening on 19 April 1969 by MP Martin Finlay. Just as the land was prepared solely by club members, so to was the clubroom built completely by members including Ken Pitman, Tom Hetherington, Ted Quedely, Eric Draper, Ernie Rainbow, Morrie Ramsey, Peter and Bis Pitman, Buddy Jones, Harry McWilliams, Jim Denyer, Gordon McCarten, Pat Fairweather, Don McMeekin, Murray Hill and Ian Pattulo.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | title = The History of Te Atatu Rugby League Club\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | publisher = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | date = 18 February 2012\n  | url = http://www.foxsportspulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=0-4975-69502-0-0&sID=128875&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=8812328\n  | accessdate = 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s Te Atatu were becoming more competitive on the field at senior level and completed wins over all of the top clubs over a period of time, including [[Ellerslie Eagles]], [[Mt Albert Lions]], [[Glenora Bears]], [[Richmond Bulldogs]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies]].  At this time the club also began producing NZ international quality players such as [[Dennis A. Williams|Dennis Williams]] who aged only 18 famously scored a brilliant individual try with his first touch of the ball in his debut test versus Great Britain, along with John Smith and John Wilson. In 1973 they won the Senior Competition and the Phelan Shield. In the same year they played the first ever [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team]] in a pre season game, losing 13\u201317.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]\n  | title = Aboriginal team wins\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | date = 18 February 1973\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-LIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3423,6519452\n  | accessdate = 10 August 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | title = Aboriginal Rugby League Stars Recognised After 4 Decades\n  | work = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | place =Australia\n  \n  | date = 8 February 2013\n  | url = https://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/1286216/aboriginal-rugby-league-stars-recognised-after-four-decades/\n  | accessdate = 30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAround this time other branches of the club were formed at Ranui (which later led to the formation of the [[Waitemata Seagulls]]), and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Teams playing at [[Moire Park]] in Massey were known as Te Atatu Massey. The nickname 'Roosters' was adopted along with the Eastern Suburbs (now [[Sydney Roosters]]) style jersey. In 1976 they turned 21 yrs old and celebrated with a ball at the Mandalay in the city. In 1979 club members looking for a summer activity to continue bonding and to develop player skills formed the Te Atatu Roosters Softball Club. The softball club has since relocated to the Massey Rugby Club and plays at Rosedale Park on Auckland's North Shore, but has retained the name [[Roosters Softball Club]].<ref>http://www.onlysport.co.nz/browse/profile-607-Roosters_Softball_Club_Inc.html</ref><ref>http://www.roosterssoftball.co.nz/</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the club finally began experiencing the success on the field they had sought after for many years. In 1986 they were runners up in the Fox Memorial to Mt Albert but weeks later were crowned National Club Champions after defeating the same opposition. Then in 1988 they won the Fox Memorial Shield beating local rivals [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 23\u201316 in the final at [[Carlaw Park]] and a month later won the National Club title for the second time by again defeating Glenora at Eden Park as curtain-raiser to the Kiwis \u2013 Kangaroo World Cup final.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Te Atatu Roosters Facebook page]]\n  | first = Graeme Murdoch\n  | title = 60th Jubilee Speech Notes\n  |publisher=Facebook\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | pages = 1\u20132\n  | date = 20 June 2015\n  | url = https://www.facebook.com/1423833681197274/photos/pb.1423833681197274.-2207520000.1436166628./1638454956401811/?type=3&theater\n  | accessdate = 6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Te Atatu formed their first women's premier team. They have now played four seasons and won the 2nd division title twice (2016 and 2019).<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/sport/80016339/women-flock-to-the-te-atatu-roosters-rugby-league-team</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\n{{see also|Auckland Rugby League club trophies}}\nTe Atatu's first ever senior trophy was the Gillette Cup in 1968. They won it again in 1974.\n\nTheir other trophies early in their existence were in the Sharman Cup where they won it in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976 and 1978.\n\nTe Atatu had a historic year in 1986 when they won the Rukutai Shield for winning the minor premiership and making the Fox Memorial grand final (both for the first time) where they lost to the [[Mt Albert Lions]] 31\u20134. A month later they had revenge when they beat the Lions by 36\u201310 to claim their first National Club title at [[Carlaw Park]], defeating Randwick and Upper Hutt along the way.\n\nTe Atatu finally won the coveted [[Fox Memorial Shield]], awarded to the Auckland club champions in 1988 with a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6JGSd5irZ4|22-16 win] over local rivals the [[Glenora Bears]].  They also went on to win the Lion Red National Club Final against Glenora at [[Eden Park]] 18\u20138 in the same year.  The match was televised live as it was the curtain-raiser to the New Zealand \u2013 Australia Rugby League World Cup final which Australia went on to win 25\u201312 in front of 45,363 spectators.\n\nIn 1990 they again made the Fox Memorial final but lost to a [[Tawera Nikau]] inspired [[Otahuhu Leopards]]. In 1993 they made the Fox Memorial final for the 4th time but were again defeated by the [[Northcote Tigers]] 29\u201310.\n\nIn 2005 the Roosters celebrated their 50th Jubilee. In 2007 Te Atatu won the Roope Rooster (which by this time had become a trophy the winning team defended on their home ground). They defeated Mt Albert to win it and defended it for 3 matches before losing it to the [[Richmond Bulldogs]].\n\nIn 2010 they finished 4th at the end of the regular season in the Fox Memorial and defeated 3rd placed Howick in the minor final, before losing to Otahuhu in preliminary final.\n\nThe 2011 to 2014 seasons were largely uneventful, spent in the lower divisions. The 2014 season was arguably one of the worst in the club's history with just 2 wins from 18 games, both over the last placed [[Manukau Magpies]].\n\nThe club then rebuilt in 2015 by appointing Revell Neil and bringing in many new players to the premier team. This saw a massive reversal in results and over the 2015 and 2016 seasons they won a remarkable 35 games, with 2 draws and just 3 losses. In 2015 they had their 60th Jubilee which featured a celebratory match with local rivals Glenora and was won by Te Atatu 38\u201328. They also won the Phelan Shield in this time. In 2016 they won the Phelan Shield again along with promotion back to the Fox Memorial when they beat the [[Bay Roskill Vikings]] 31\u201322 in the Sharman Cup final. In 2017 they were competitive in many matches but failed to convert this into wins. They were relegated back to the Sharman Cup and in 2018 were forced to rebuild after losing many of their players to other teams. Former Te Atatu player [[Lawrence Tagaloa]] was appointed head coach. They finished the season with a 7\u20137 record and lost to New Lynn in the Sharman Cup championship final. 2019 saw another change with new coaches (Keith Hanley and Phil Gordon) appointed and many new additions to the team.\n\n[[File:TeAtatuRoostersvPtChev.png|thumb|right|Te Atatu players in a match against Point Chevalier]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Williams|Dennis Williams]] in 1971. He went on to play 31 tests for New Zealand. The majority of the NZ representatives were to come from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the club experienced considerable success on the field With the likes of [[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]], [[Mark Elia]], [[Mark Horo]], [[Ron O'Regan]], [[Dean Orr]], and [[Sam Panapa]] in the side. In the early 1990s brothers Henry and [[Robbie Paul]] represented the Kiwi's though Robbie moved to play professionally in England at a young age and due to the difficulty for players from England being able to return to New Zealand or Australia for tests he did not represent New Zealand as many times as he would undoubtedly have. His brother [[Henry Paul]] also moved to play professionally in England and he later switched codes representing England in rugby union, and in [[Rugby Sevens]]. He was not the only Te Atatu Rooster to represent another country in Rugby Union. [[Shontayne Hape]] switched codes and was selected for the full English international side who he represented 13 times, and more recently [[James O'Connor (rugby union)|James O'Connor]] who was a Te Atatu Schoolboy was selected for the Wallabies, the [[Australia national rugby union team]].\n\n===NZ Representatives===\n'''Kiwis'''\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]] (16 tests)\n*[[Mark Elia]] (37 tests)\n*[[Shontayne Hape]] (14 tests)\n*[[Mark Horo]] (16 tests)\n*[[Suaia Matagi]] (1 test)\n*[[Ron O'Regan]] (8 tests)\n*[[Dean Orr]] (1 test)\n*[[Sam Panapa]] (8 tests)\n*[[Henry Paul]] (24 tests)\n*[[Robbie Paul]] (29 tests)\n*[[John Smith (rugby league)|John Smith]] (12 tests)\n*[[Dennis A.

They participate in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. They currently have 25 teams across schoolboy, junior and senior grades. The Roosters premier team began the [[Te Atatu Roosters 2019 Season|2019 season]] in the \"Fox Championship Qualifying Competition\", but after qualifying first they gained entry to the Fox Championship competition where a top 4 finish will see them begin the 2020 season in the top division.\n[[File:Te Atatu v New Lynn.jpg|thumb|right|Te Atatu scoring v New Lynn]]\n\n==Home Ground==\nThe Roosters play at the [[Auckland Council|council owned]] [[Jack Colvin Park]] located on the [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula]], next to the [[North Western Motorway]]. Junior teams play at [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]], and at Gloria Park both also on the peninsula.\n\n== History ==\nThe Te Atatu club was founded in 1955 after the opening of the North-Western motorway led to suburban growth in the Te Atat\u016b area. The first team was a 7-aside team formed to represent Te Atatu North and South. They initially had to wear [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] jerseys and their first ever game was against Wesley at [[Fowlds Park]]. The first training area was in a cow paddock on Edmonton Rd, before they were later able to move to [[Ramlea Park]].\n\nIn 1961 Te Atatu won their first schoolboy championship in their Te Atatu colours. In 1960\u201361 [[Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park]] was developed on Neil Avenue and in 1965 they fielded their first senior side in the Senior B grade. The ground is still commonly referred to as 'Neil Ave'.\n\nIn the late 1960s work began on the current club rooms on Toru Avenue. They were built on Crown (council) land arranged with Waitemata Mayor [[Jack Colvin]] after 3 club members were elected to the WCC Parks Committee. However, before the club rooms could be built the land needed to be prepared. The land was in such poor condition that no other clubs had bothered applying for it, and life member Ken Pitman described the task of preparing it thus: \"What a mess, over six acres of swamp, gorse and pine trees, five feet thick. Well we were all enthusiastic and silly enough to attempt the impossible. We chopped, scrounged, swore, drank and burned our way through the lot\". The council also helped by putting a culvert under the motorway and realigned the creek which ran through the park. Eventually the playing fields were established and work could begin on the club rooms.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/67998177/</ref>\n\nThe club rooms took over 6 years to complete with the foundation stone being laid on 17 December 1962, with the official opening on 19 April 1969 by MP Martin Finlay. Just as the land was prepared solely by club members, so to was the clubroom built completely by members including Ken Pitman, Tom Hetherington, Ted Quedely, Eric Draper, Ernie Rainbow, Morrie Ramsey, Peter and Bis Pitman, Buddy Jones, Harry McWilliams, Jim Denyer, Gordon McCarten, Pat Fairweather, Don McMeekin, Murray Hill and Ian Pattulo.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | title = The History of Te Atatu Rugby League Club\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | publisher = [[Fox Sport Pulse]]\n  | date = 18 February 2012\n  | url = http://www.foxsportspulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=0-4975-69502-0-0&sID=128875&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=8812328\n  | accessdate = 7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s Te Atatu were becoming more competitive on the field at senior level and completed wins over all of the top clubs over a period of time, including [[Ellerslie Eagles]], [[Mt Albert Lions]], [[Glenora Bears]], [[Richmond Bulldogs]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies]].  At this time the club also began producing NZ international quality players such as [[Dennis A. Williams|Dennis Williams]] who aged only 18 famously scored a brilliant individual try with his first touch of the ball in his debut test versus Great Britain, along with John Smith and John Wilson. In 1973 they won the Senior Competition and the Phelan Shield. In the same year they played the first ever [[Australian Aboriginal rugby league team]] in a pre season game, losing 13\u201317.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]\n  | title = Aboriginal team wins\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | date = 18 February 1973\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-LIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3423,6519452\n  | accessdate = 10 August 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | title = Aboriginal Rugby League Stars Recognised After 4 Decades\n  | work = [[The Armidale Express]]\n  | place =Australia\n  \n  | date = 8 February 2013\n  | url = https://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/1286216/aboriginal-rugby-league-stars-recognised-after-four-decades/\n  | accessdate = 30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAround this time other branches of the club were formed at Ranui (which later led to the formation of the [[Waitemata Seagulls]]), and [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]]. Teams playing at [[Moire Park]] in Massey were known as Te Atatu Massey. The nickname 'Roosters' was adopted along with the Eastern Suburbs (now [[Sydney Roosters]]) style jersey. In 1976 they turned 21 yrs old and celebrated with a ball at the Mandalay in the city. In 1979 club members looking for a summer activity to continue bonding and to develop player skills formed the Te Atatu Roosters Softball Club. The softball club has since relocated to the Massey Rugby Club and plays at Rosedale Park on Auckland's North Shore, but has retained the name [[Roosters Softball Club]].<ref>http://www.onlysport.co.nz/browse/profile-607-Roosters_Softball_Club_Inc.html</ref><ref>http://www.roosterssoftball.co.nz/</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the club finally began experiencing the success on the field they had sought after for many years. In 1986 they were runners up in the Fox Memorial to Mt Albert but weeks later were crowned National Club Champions after defeating the same opposition. Then in 1988 they won the Fox Memorial Shield beating local rivals [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 23\u201316 in the final at [[Carlaw Park]] and a month later won the National Club title for the second time by again defeating Glenora at Eden Park as curtain-raiser to the Kiwis \u2013 Kangaroo World Cup final.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Te Atatu Roosters Facebook page]]\n  | first = Graeme Murdoch\n  | title = 60th Jubilee Speech Notes\n  |publisher=Facebook\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | pages = 1\u20132\n  | date = 20 June 2015\n  | url = https://www.facebook.com/1423833681197274/photos/pb.1423833681197274.-2207520000.1436166628./1638454956401811/?type=3&theater\n  | accessdate = 6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Te Atatu formed their first women's premier team. They have now played four seasons and won the 2nd division title twice (2016 and 2019).<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/sport/80016339/women-flock-to-the-te-atatu-roosters-rugby-league-team</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\n{{see also|Auckland Rugby League club trophies}}\nTe Atatu's first ever senior trophy was the Gillette Cup in 1968. They won it again in 1974.\n\nTheir other trophies early in their existence were in the Sharman Cup where they won it in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976 and 1978.\n\nTe Atatu had a historic year in 1986 when they won the Rukutai Shield for winning the minor premiership and making the Fox Memorial grand final (both for the first time) where they lost to the [[Mt Albert Lions]] 31\u20134. A month later they had revenge when they beat the Lions by 36\u201310 to claim their first National Club title at [[Carlaw Park]], defeating Randwick and Upper Hutt along the way.\n\nTe Atatu finally won the coveted [[Fox Memorial Shield]], awarded to the Auckland club champions in 1988 with a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6JGSd5irZ4|22-16 win] over local rivals the [[Glenora Bears]].  They also went on to win the Lion Red National Club Final against Glenora at [[Eden Park]] 18\u20138 in the same year.  The match was televised live as it was the curtain-raiser to the New Zealand \u2013 Australia Rugby League World Cup final which Australia went on to win 25\u201312 in front of 45,363 spectators.\n\nIn 1990 they again made the Fox Memorial final but lost to a [[Tawera Nikau]] inspired [[Otahuhu Leopards]]. In 1993 they made the Fox Memorial final for the 4th time but were again defeated by the [[Northcote Tigers]] 29\u201310.\n\nIn 2005 the Roosters celebrated their 50th Jubilee. In 2007 Te Atatu won the Roope Rooster (which by this time had become a trophy the winning team defended on their home ground). They defeated Mt Albert to win it and defended it for 3 matches before losing it to the [[Richmond Bulldogs]].\n\nIn 2010 they finished 4th at the end of the regular season in the Fox Memorial and defeated 3rd placed Howick in the minor final, before losing to Otahuhu in preliminary final.\n\nThe 2011 to 2014 seasons were largely uneventful, spent in the lower divisions. The 2014 season was arguably one of the worst in the club's history with just 2 wins from 18 games, both over the last placed [[Manukau Magpies]].\n\nThe club then rebuilt in 2015 by appointing Revell Neil and bringing in many new players to the premier team. This saw a massive reversal in results and over the 2015 and 2016 seasons they won a remarkable 35 games, with 2 draws and just 3 losses. In 2015 they had their 60th Jubilee which featured a celebratory match with local rivals Glenora and was won by Te Atatu 38\u201328. They also won the Phelan Shield in this time. In 2016 they won the Phelan Shield again along with promotion back to the Fox Memorial when they beat the [[Bay Roskill Vikings]] 31\u201322 in the Sharman Cup final. In 2017 they were competitive in many matches but failed to convert this into wins. They were relegated back to the Sharman Cup and in 2018 were forced to rebuild after losing many of their players to other teams. Former Te Atatu player [[Lawrence Tagaloa]] was appointed head coach. They finished the season with a 7\u20137 record and lost to New Lynn in the Sharman Cup championship final. 2019 saw another change with new coaches (Keith Hanley and Phil Gordon) appointed and many new additions to the team.\n\n[[File:TeAtatuRoostersvPtChev.png|thumb|right|Te Atatu players in a match against Point Chevalier]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Williams|Dennis Williams]] in 1971. He went on to play 31 tests for New Zealand. The majority of the NZ representatives were to come from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the club experienced considerable success on the field With the likes of [[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]], [[Mark Elia]], [[Mark Horo]], [[Ron O'Regan]], [[Dean Orr]], and [[Sam Panapa]] in the side. In the early 1990s brothers Henry and [[Robbie Paul]] represented the Kiwi's though Robbie moved to play professionally in England at a young age and due to the difficulty for players from England being able to return to New Zealand or Australia for tests he did not represent New Zealand as many times as he would undoubtedly have. His brother [[Henry Paul]] also moved to play professionally in England and he later switched codes representing England in rugby union, and in [[Rugby Sevens]]. He was not the only Te Atatu Rooster to represent another country in Rugby Union. [[Shontayne Hape]] switched codes and was selected for the full English international side who he represented 13 times, and more recently [[James O'Connor (rugby union)|James O'Connor]] who was a Te Atatu Schoolboy was selected for the Wallabies, the [[Australia national rugby union team]].\n\n===NZ Representatives===\n'''Kiwis'''\n{{colbegin|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Peter Brown (rugby league)|Peter Brown]] (16 tests)\n*[[Mark Elia]] (37 tests)\n*[[Shontayne Hape]] (14 tests)\n*[[Mark Horo]] (16 tests)\n*[[Suaia Matagi]] (1 test)\n*[[Ron O'Regan]] (8 tests)\n*[[Dean Orr]] (1 test)\n*[[Sam Panapa]] (8 tests)\n*[[Henry Paul]] (24 tests)\n*[[Robbie Paul]] (29 tests)\n*[[John Smith (rugby league)|John Smith]] (12 tests)\n*[[Dennis A.
