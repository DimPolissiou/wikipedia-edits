Following her recording, Republic Records sent it to Minaj to record her verse. Goldstein then sent it to CEO [[Monte Lipman]], who insisted that Grande listen to it.

It debuted at number one in the United Kingdom becoming Grande's second top ten single and second number one debut that year.

Minaj added her rap later. Martin had already previously collaborated with Jessie J (\"[[Domino (Jessie J song)|Domino]]\"), Grande (\"[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]\", \"[[Break Free (song)|Break Free]]\"), and Minaj (\"[[Va Va Voom]]\", \"[[Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded|Masquerade]]\").\n\nThe song was originally offered to and recorded by Grande, who didn't like the result. Republic Records EVP Wendy Goldstein then sent it to EVP Rob Stevenson who got a demo of the song played to Jessie J, which she decided to record. Following her recording, Republic Records sent it to Minaj to record her verse. Goldstein then sent it to CEO [[Monte Lipman]], who insisted that Grande listen to it.

The book tells the story of Burroughs's bizarre childhood life after his mother, a chain-smoking aspiring poet, sent him to live with her psychiatrist.<ref>[http://www.picadorusa.com/product/product.aspx?isbn=031242227X Picador book review]</ref> ''Running with Scissors'' spent eight weeks on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]] list.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last=  |title= Best Sellers |work= New York Times |date= September 8, 2002 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n''Running with Scissors'' covers the period of Burroughs' [[adolescence|adolescent]] years, beginning at age 12 after a brief overview of his life as a child. Burroughs spends his early childhood in a clean and orderly home, obsessing over his clothes, hair, accessories, and having great potential, with his parents constantly fighting in the background.\n\nWhen his parents separate and his mother begins to second-guess her sexuality, Burroughs is sent to live with his mother's [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Finch, who lives in a rundown Victorian house in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. Finch lives with his \"legal\" wife, Agnes,  as well as his biological and adopted children and some of his own patients. Rules are practically nonexistent and children of all ages do whatever they please, such as having sex, smoking [[cigarettes]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and rebelling against authority figures. Finch feels that, at age 13, children should be in charge of their own lives. However, the dysfunctional issues that occur in the Finch family are outdone by the psychotic episodes frequently experienced by Burroughs' mother.\n\nThe Finch house is a parallel universe to the home Burroughs came from.  It is filthy, with cockroaches roaming around the uncleaned dishes, Christmas trees left up year-round, stairs up which Burroughs is afraid to walk because he thinks that they will collapse under him, and nothing off limits. Eventually, Finch comes to believe that God is communicating with him through his feces and develops a form of [[divination]] to try and decipher these messages. When Hope, Finch's second oldest daughter, believes her cat is dying, she keeps it in a laundry basket for four days until it dies: \"Hope said Freud died of kitty leukemia and old age, I thought it was because Freud was stuck under a laundry basket with no food or water for 4 days.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Burroughs|first=Augusten|title=Running with Scissors|url=https://archive.org/details/runningwithsciss00augu|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Picador}}</ref>\n\nBurroughs' mother is shown as emotionally drained, excessive, self-centered, and ultimately incapable of being a parent. She has a sexual relationship with a local minister's wife, which is revealed to Burroughs when he accidentally walks in on them when he skips school. When this relationship ends, Burroughs' mother starts another with an affluent African-American woman. This relationship is tumultuous and unstable.  At one point, they have a mental patient named Cesar live at their house after another of his mother's breakdowns as his \"dad\". Cesar attempts to rape Burroughs while he is sleeping, but is unsuccessful (when Cesar goes to live with the Finches later in the book, he pays one of the Finches' daughters for sex and is then forced from the home).  His mother's biggest psychotic episode happens when she and Dorothy (her partner) move everything out of their house and attack Burroughs when he tries to intervene.  This later ends with a \"road trip\" and events leading to Burroughs' mother being restrained on a bed.\n\nBurroughs tells Dr. Finch's adopted 33-year-old son, Neil Bookman, that he is [[gay]].  From the age of 13 to 15, Burroughs has an intense and open [[Child sexual abuse|sexual relationship]] with Bookman, which begins when Bookman forces the young boy to perform oral sex on him. Neither his mother nor any member of the Finch family is bothered by their relationship. Burroughs begins to enjoy exacting power over Bookman by threatening to charge him with [[statutory rape]].  Bookman is obsessed with the young boy, even though Burroughs has problems with their relationship (going in phases of needing the affection of Bookman to wanting to humiliate or get away from him) which only infatuates Bookman more. Bookman eventually leaves Northampton for New York City and is never heard from again by Burroughs or the Finches, even after they try everything in their power to find him.\n\nBurroughs forms a close relationship with Finch's daughter, Natalie, who is one year older than he is, even though he dislikes her at the beginning of the book. They do everything together, from finding jobs to running behind a waterfall to demolishing the kitchen ceiling. They finally leave the Finch household together.\n\nAt the end of the book, when Burroughs is living in his own apartment with Natalie, he is asked to choose between his mother and Finch when she accuses the doctor of raping her in a motel to cure her of one of her psychotic episodes. He still considers Finch's family and his mother to be his family, and he cannot bring himself to choose sides, although he is fairly certain that Finch did rape his mother. Quoted from the book, Burroughs states: \"So it came to this: Was I a turd-reading Finch? Or was I my crazy mother's son? In the end, I decided that I was neither.\"\n\n==Characters==\n; Augusten Burroughs : The main character, son of Deirdre and Norman, was sent to live with his psychotic mother's psychiatrist, Dr. Finch, and his family at the age of 13 and is eventually signed off to the Finch family. He has mild obsessive compulsive tendencies. It is at the Finch house where he enters into a relationship with Neil, trying to live with the insane and dirty living conditions of the Finches while coping with his mother's mental condition. He has a close relationship with Natalie, Dr. Finch's youngest daughter. He has a passion for hair products, wanting to have his name on a line of hair products.\n; Deirdre Burroughs : Deirdre is the mother of Augusten and was married to Norman until their divorce. She is a mentally unstable lesbian feminist, who, after her divorce, engages in a relationship with the local minister's wife. She allows Augusten to pretend to attempt suicide so he can be released from school. She has a relationship with a teenage girl after the minister's wife will not divorce her own husband.\n; Dr. Finch : The psychiatrist of Deirdre, father of Natalie and Hope, and \"husband\" of Agnes Finch. Although Agnes and Dr. Finch are technically married, Dr. Finch has multiple other relationships with various women, all of whom he calls his wife, saying that Agnes is only his \"legal\" wife and doesn't understand him. Dr. Finch takes Augusten in, and later legally adopts him, after Deirdre decides she cannot handle the emotional stress of mothering Augusten. Dr. Finch's psychiatric methods are highly unconventional; he unwittingly makes his patients worse instead of curing them by giving them unmarked medicines, using techniques that disturb them, and generally encouraging their unhealthy behavior.\n; Neil Bookman : The adopted son of Dr. Finch. Soon after Burroughs moves in with the Finches, Neil, who was 33, forms a sexual relationship with Burroughs, who was only 13. He becomes infatuated with and very protective of Burroughs, who rarely returns these feelings, but still maintains a relationship with him. His infatuation eventually turns to obsession and he constantly tells Burroughs he would die if Burroughs left him.\n; Natalie Finch : The youngest daughter of Dr. Finch and Agnes who is seen as wild, unruly, and promiscuous throughout the memoir, giving her first hand job at the age of 11. She is only one year older than Burroughs, with whom she eventually becomes great friends.\n; Norman Burroughs : The alcoholic and estranged father of Augusten is unable to connect to with his son, the problem becomes more severe when his controlling and abusive wife pushes him into a divorce. Augusten later tries to reach out to him, his phone calls are ignored, leading to further estrangement.\n; Agnes Finch : Mother of the Finch children and wife of Dr. Finch. Her role in the family is small, serving as more of a maid than a wife or mother. No one in the household shows her any respect and rarely even listen to her, telling her constantly to \"shut up\".\n; Hope Finch : The older sister to Natalie. She works as a receptionist in Dr. Finch's office and is the first person in the Finch family to befriend Burroughs.\n; Fern : The first female lover of Deirdre Burroughs. She is a minister's wife with children, and keeps her relationship with Deirdre a secret. The relationship ends when Fern refuses to leave her family.\n; Dorothy : A teenage, African-American former patient of Dr. Finch who becomes Dierdre's second female lover. Dorothy, who was also mentally unstable, encouraged Dierdre's erratic behavior, finding it exciting. She does everything from setting money on fire to putting broken glass in the bathtub.\n\n==Film adaptation==\n{{main|Running with Scissors (film)}}\nThe film adaptation of ''Running with Scissors'', released in 2006, stars [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Joseph Fiennes]], [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[Jill Clayburgh]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Joseph Michael Cross|Joseph Cross]] as Burroughs.

The Turcottes were reportedly seeking [[damages]] of $2 million for invasion of privacy, defamation, and emotional distress; the Turcottes alleged ''Running with Scissors'' was largely fictional and written in a sensational manner. Burroughs defended his work as \"entirely accurate\", but agreed to call the work a \"book\" (instead of a \"memoir\") in the author's note, to alter the acknowledgments page in future editions to recognize the Turcotte family's conflicting memories of described events, and express regret for \"any unintentional harm\" to the Turcotte family.<ref>{{cite news | title = Family Settles With 'Scissors' Author| url = http://www.townhall.com/news/entertainment/2007/08/30/family_settles_with_%60scissors_author | accessdate = 2007-10-27}}</ref>  Burroughs felt vindicated by the settlement.  \"I'm not at all sorry that I wrote [the book].

The book tells the story of Burroughs's bizarre childhood life after his mother, a chain-smoking aspiring poet, sent him to live with her psychiatrist.<ref>[http://www.picadorusa.com/product/product.aspx?isbn=031242227X Picador book review]</ref> ''Running with Scissors'' spent eight weeks on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]] list.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last=  |title= Best Sellers |work= New York Times |date= September 8, 2002 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n''Running with Scissors'' covers the period of Burroughs' [[adolescence|adolescent]] years, beginning at age 12 after a brief overview of his life as a child. Burroughs spends his early childhood in a clean and orderly home, obsessing over his clothes, hair, accessories, and having great potential, with his parents constantly fighting in the background.\n\nWhen his parents separate and his mother begins to second-guess her sexuality, Burroughs is sent to live with his mother's [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Finch, who lives in a rundown Victorian house in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. Finch lives with his \"legal\" wife, Agnes,  as well as his biological and adopted children and some of his own patients. Rules are practically nonexistent and children of all ages do whatever they please, such as having sex, smoking [[cigarettes]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and rebelling against authority figures. Finch feels that, at age 13, children should be in charge of their own lives. However, the dysfunctional issues that occur in the Finch family are outdone by the psychotic episodes frequently experienced by Burroughs' mother.\n\nThe Finch house is a parallel universe to the home Burroughs came from.  It is filthy, with cockroaches roaming around the uncleaned dishes, Christmas trees left up year-round, stairs up which Burroughs is afraid to walk because he thinks that they will collapse under him, and nothing off limits. Eventually, Finch comes to believe that God is communicating with him through his feces and develops a form of [[divination]] to try and decipher these messages. When Hope, Finch's second oldest daughter, believes her cat is dying, she keeps it in a laundry basket for four days until it dies: \"Hope said Freud died of kitty leukemia and old age, I thought it was because Freud was stuck under a laundry basket with no food or water for 4 days.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Burroughs|first=Augusten|title=Running with Scissors|url=https://archive.org/details/runningwithsciss00augu|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Picador}}</ref>\n\nBurroughs' mother is shown as emotionally drained, excessive, self-centered, and ultimately incapable of being a parent. She has a sexual relationship with a local minister's wife, which is revealed to Burroughs when he accidentally walks in on them when he skips school. When this relationship ends, Burroughs' mother starts another with an affluent African-American woman. This relationship is tumultuous and unstable.  At one point, they have a mental patient named Cesar live at their house after another of his mother's breakdowns as his \"dad\". Cesar attempts to rape Burroughs while he is sleeping, but is unsuccessful (when Cesar goes to live with the Finches later in the book, he pays one of the Finches' daughters for sex and is then forced from the home).  His mother's biggest psychotic episode happens when she and Dorothy (her partner) move everything out of their house and attack Burroughs when he tries to intervene.  This later ends with a \"road trip\" and events leading to Burroughs' mother being restrained on a bed.\n\nBurroughs tells Dr. Finch's adopted 33-year-old son, Neil Bookman, that he is [[gay]].  From the age of 13 to 15, Burroughs has an intense and open [[Child sexual abuse|sexual relationship]] with Bookman, which begins when Bookman forces the young boy to perform oral sex on him. Neither his mother nor any member of the Finch family is bothered by their relationship. Burroughs begins to enjoy exacting power over Bookman by threatening to charge him with [[statutory rape]].  Bookman is obsessed with the young boy, even though Burroughs has problems with their relationship (going in phases of needing the affection of Bookman to wanting to humiliate or get away from him) which only infatuates Bookman more. Bookman eventually leaves Northampton for New York City and is never heard from again by Burroughs or the Finches, even after they try everything in their power to find him.\n\nBurroughs forms a close relationship with Finch's daughter, Natalie, who is one year older than he is, even though he dislikes her at the beginning of the book. They do everything together, from finding jobs to running behind a waterfall to demolishing the kitchen ceiling. They finally leave the Finch household together.\n\nAt the end of the book, when Burroughs is living in his own apartment with Natalie, he is asked to choose between his mother and Finch when she accuses the doctor of raping her in a motel to cure her of one of her psychotic episodes. He still considers Finch's family and his mother to be his family, and he cannot bring himself to choose sides, although he is fairly certain that Finch did rape his mother. Quoted from the book, Burroughs states: \"So it came to this: Was I a turd-reading Finch? Or was I my crazy mother's son? In the end, I decided that I was neither.\"\n\n==Characters==\n; Augusten Burroughs : The main character, son of Deirdre and Norman, was sent to live with his psychotic mother's psychiatrist, Dr. Finch, and his family at the age of 13 and is eventually signed off to the Finch family. He has mild obsessive compulsive tendencies. It is at the Finch house where he enters into a relationship with Neil, trying to live with the insane and dirty living conditions of the Finches while coping with his mother's mental condition. He has a close relationship with Natalie, Dr. Finch's youngest daughter. He has a passion for hair products, wanting to have his name on a line of hair products.\n; Deirdre Burroughs : Deirdre is the mother of Augusten and was married to Norman until their divorce. She is a mentally unstable poet, who, after her divorce, engages in a relationship with the local minister's wife. She allows Augusten to pretend to attempt suicide so he can be released from school. She has a relationship with a teenage girl after the minister's wife will not divorce her own husband.\n; Dr. Finch : The psychiatrist of Deirdre, father of Natalie and Hope, and \"husband\" of Agnes Finch. Although Agnes and Dr. Finch are technically married, Dr. Finch has multiple other relationships with various women, all of whom he calls his wife, saying that Agnes is only his \"legal\" wife and doesn't understand him. Dr. Finch takes Augusten in, and later legally adopts him, after Deirdre decides she cannot handle the emotional stress of mothering Augusten. Dr. Finch's psychiatric methods are highly unconventional; he unwittingly makes his patients worse instead of curing them by giving them unmarked medicines, using techniques that disturb them, and generally encouraging their unhealthy behavior.\n; Neil Bookman : The adopted son of Dr. Finch. Soon after Burroughs moves in with the Finches, Neil, who was 33, forms a sexual relationship with Burroughs, who was only 13. He becomes infatuated with and very protective of Burroughs, who rarely returns these feelings, but still maintains a relationship with him. His infatuation eventually turns to obsession and he constantly tells Burroughs he would die if Burroughs left him.\n; Natalie Finch : The youngest daughter of Dr. Finch and Agnes who is seen as wild, unruly, and promiscuous throughout the memoir, giving her first hand job at the age of 11. She is only one year older than Burroughs, with whom she eventually becomes great friends.\n; Norman Burroughs : The abusive and alcoholic husband of Deirdre and father of Augusten. His abusive, oppressive relationship with Deirdre is one of the main causes of her instability and Augusten's difficult life. When Augusten later tries to reach out to him, his phone calls are ignored, leading to further estrangement.\n; Agnes Finch : Mother of the Finch children and wife of Dr. Finch. Her role in the family is small, serving as more of a maid than a wife or mother. No one in the household shows her any respect and rarely even listen to her, telling her constantly to \"shut up\".\n; Hope Finch : The older sister to Natalie. She works as a receptionist in Dr. Finch's office and is the first person in the Finch family to befriend Burroughs.\n; Fern : The first female lover of Deirdre Burroughs. She is a minister's wife with children, and keeps her relationship with Deirdre a secret. The relationship ends when Fern refuses to leave her family.\n; Dorothy : A teenage, African-American former patient of Dr. Finch who becomes Dierdre's second female lover. Dorothy, who was also mentally unstable, encouraged Dierdre's erratic behavior, finding it exciting. She does everything from setting money on fire to putting broken glass in the bathtub.\n\n==Film adaptation==\n{{main|Running with Scissors (film)}}\nThe film adaptation of ''Running with Scissors'', released in 2006, stars [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Joseph Fiennes]], [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[Jill Clayburgh]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Joseph Michael Cross|Joseph Cross]] as Burroughs.

Burroughs defended his work as \"entirely accurate\", but agreed to call the work a \"book\" (instead of a \"memoir\") in the author's note, to alter the acknowledgments page in future editions to recognize the Turcotte family's conflicting memories of described events, and express regret for \"any unintentional harm\" to the Turcotte family.<ref>{{cite news | title = Family Settles With 'Scissors' Author| url = http://www.townhall.com/news/entertainment/2007/08/30/family_settles_with_%60scissors_author | accessdate = 2007-10-27}}</ref>  Burroughs felt vindicated by the settlement.  \"I'm not at all sorry that I wrote [the book].

Their songs were originally all in Spanish. After a year, in 1996, in the recording studios of Balmaceda Arte Joven, they recorded four songs for the EP ''Trilog\u00eda de un guerrero'' (''Trilogy of a Warrior'').\n\nIn 1998, Juan Pablo Pizarro decided to move to [[France]]. Six Magics brought on a new bassist, Rodolfo S\u00e1nchez. In 1999, [[Sergio Dom\u00ednguez Molina|Sergio Dom\u00ednguez]] entered as a new vocalist and Sebasti\u00e1n Carrasco entered as a keyboardist. With these changes, Six Magics began to compose the lyrics in English and worked to the goal of creating a professional album. While they were working in their first professional production, they were offered the opportunity to be the opening act for the Finn band [[Nightwish]] in July 2000. In 2001, they played as the opener for Italian band [[Rhapsody of Fire|Rhapsody]]. In January 2001, after the completion of these tours, the band returned to the recording studio. They performed work with narrations and epic stories influenced by the [[Baroque]] and [[Classic romantic]] style.\n\nAt the beginning of 2002, two new members came to the band: Gabriel Hidalgo on guitar and Mauricio Nader on bass. With this new formation, the band enhanced its acoustic sound. They released their first album, ''Dead Kings of the Unholy Valley'', in July 2002. In 2003, they began to work on their second album, ''The Secrets Of An Island.'' This was a conceptual work about the mythological history of [[Chilo\u00e9 Island]]. The songs on this album used choirs, folk instruments, and was influenced by ethnic Chilean music. Six Magics started then and continued to mix ard rock with a Latin American traditional beat in a style called [[Folk Metal]]. Their concerts became larger and more decorated productions and began to attract larger audiences. At one point, singer Sergio Dom\u00ednguez fell ill and was temporarily replaced by Crist\u00f3bal Flores.\n\nIn 2004, the band flew to Germany, France, and Spain to promote their new albums and tour and is well received. Pianist Sebasti\u00e1n Carrasco left in 2005, and the band decided not to replace him and instead become a quintet. They then prepared a film of their work, entitled ''Dead Secrets,'' to be shown at the [[Theater Province]]. The DVD was delayed due to technical difficulties and was not resolved until the end of the year, so instead of being shown at the theater was released straight to DVD.\n\nIn January 2007, Six Magics began work on their third album. The production is directed by the North American [[David Prater]] ([[Dream Theater]], [[FireHouse (band)|FireHouse]], [[Fahrenheit]]). In May of the 2007, Sergio Dom\u00ednguez decided to leave the band to spend more time with his family and his upcoming son.\n\nOn June 26, 2008, they released a single called ''Behind the Sorrow'' ahead of their third album, ''Animal,'' which was released in August, on September they played with [[Tarja Turunen]].\n\nIn 2006, they released \u201cDead Secrets\u201d, their first live DVD containing songs from their two previous albums. After the DVDs release, the decision was made to immediately record a third record with the legendary multi- platinum producer David Prater. His groundbreaking work with Dream Theater on two of their most successful recordings, \u201cImages and Words\u201d and \u201cA Change Of Seasons\u201d, established Prater as perhaps the most sought after producer in all of modern progressive rock. His rich track record also contains an impressive list of best selling mainstream rock artists from the last twenty years (Firehouse, Arcade, Nightranger, Stephen Pearcy, etc.). The \u00e1lbum was called \u201cBehind the Sorrow\u201d and was released by the Italian label Coroner Records\n\nFrom a creative standpoint, Six Magics has experienced a remarkable growth spurt over the last years beginning with the decision to enlist the services of Prater and continuing with the arrival of Elizabeth Vasquez, the band\u2019s sensational new lead vocalist. The decision to break new ground in a changing musical landscape by bringing her brooding, sultry voice to the foreground of the group\u2019s sound signals a courageous sense of adventure sorely needed in a field dominated by faceless male counterparts.\n\nIn 2010 to support the new record \u201cBehind the Sorrow\u201d, Six Magics launched a European tour that kept the musicians on the road for nearly two months. They played in different countries like Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands and Turkey.\n\nIn 2011 Six Magics started working on their next studio album.\nSix Magics also played in Chile at The Metal Fest, the first version of a Chilean festival in which bands like Testament, Blind Guardian, Anthrax, UDO among others were headliners.\n\nIn July 2012 the new material of the band entitled \u201cFalling Angels\u201d was released in Europe, Chile, Japan and USA\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current===\n* [[Elizabeth V\u00e1squez]] (Vocals)\n* [http://www.erickavila.net/ Erick Avila] (Guitar)\n* [[Pablo Proharam]] (Guitar)\n* [[Pablo Stagnaro]] (Drums)\n\n===Past===\n* Juan Pablo Pizarro (Bass)\n* Sergio Villarroel (Vocals)\n* [[Sergio Dom\u00ednguez Molina|Sergio Dom\u00ednguez]] (Vocals)\n* Rodolfo S\u00e1nchez (Bass)\n* [[M.Nader]] (Bass)\n* [[Gabriel Hidalgo]] (Guitar)\n* [[Sebastian Carrasco]] (Keyboard)\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n*''Trilog\u00eda de un guerrero'' (1996)\n*''[[Dead Kings Of The Unholy Valley]]'' (2001)\n*''[[The Secrets Of An Island]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Animal (Six Magics album)|Animal]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Behind the Sorrow]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Falling Angels (Six Magics album)|Falling Angels]]'' (2012)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=17060|title=Six Magics - New Album Details And Live Video Available - Metal Storm|website=www.metalstorm.net}}</ref>\n\n===Singles===\n*\"Behind The Sorrow\" (2008)\n\n===DVD===\n*''Dead Secret'' (2006)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sixmagics.com Six Magics - Official Site ]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1996]]\n[[Category:Chilean heavy metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Power metal musical groups]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Six Magics\n| image                 =\n| caption               =\n| image_size            =\n| background          = group_or_band\n| alias               =\n| origin              = [[Santiago, Chile]]\n| genre               = [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]], [[Progressive metal]], [[Power metal]], [[Symphonic metal]]\n| years_active        = 1996&ndash;present\n| label               =\n| associated_acts     =\n| website                 = [http://www.sixmagics.cl/ www.sixmagics.cl]\n| current_members     = Elizabeth V\u00e1squez<br />[http://www.erickavila.net/ Erick Avila] <br />Pablo Proharam <br />Mauricio Nader <br />Pablo Stagnaro\n| past_members        =\n}}\n\n'''Six Magics''' is a [[Chile]]an metal group formed initially by Pablo Stagnaro, Erick \u00c1vila, Nicol\u00e1s Espinoza, Juan Pablo Pizarro and Sergio Villarroel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/more.php?id=2817|title=Read more about Six Magics|publisher=Encyclopaedia Metallum|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nAt first, Erick \u00c1vila composed the music while Juan Pablo Pizarro and Sergio Villarroel wrote the lyrics.

Additionally, they have shared stages with the likes of international touring acts Nightwish, Blind Guardian and Rhapsody.\n\nIn 2006, they released \u201cDead Secrets\u201d, their first live DVD containing songs from their two previous albums.
