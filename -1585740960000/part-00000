A new [[List of mobile phone generations|generation]] of cellular standards has appeared approximately every tenth year since [[1G]] systems were introduced in 1979 and the early to mid-1980s.\n\n==Issues==\n[[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM, around 80\u201385% market share) and [[IS-95]] (around 10\u201315% market share) were the two most prevalent 2G mobile communication technologies in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/pdf/gsma_stats_q1_07.pdf |title=Subscriber statistics end Q1 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162249/http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/pdf/gsma_stats_q1_07.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> In 3G, the most prevalent technology was [[UMTS]] with [[CDMA-2000]] in close contention.\n\nAll radio access technologies have to solve the same problems: to divide the finite [[RF spectrum]] among multiple users as efficiently as possible. GSM uses [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[Frequency-division multiple access|FDMA]] for user and cell separation. UMTS, IS-95 and CDMA-2000 use [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]. [[WiMAX]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] use [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]].\n\n* [[Time division multiple access|Time-division multiple access (TDMA)]]  provides multiuser access by chopping up the channel into sequential time slices. Each user of the channel takes turns to transmit and receive signals. In reality, only one person is actually using the channel at a specific moment.  This is analogous to [[time-sharing]] on a large computer server.\n* [[Frequency division multiple access|Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)]] provides multiuser access by separating the used frequencies. This is used in GSM to separate cells, which then use TDMA to separate users within the cell.\n* [[CDMA|Code-division multiple access (CDMA)]]  This uses a [[digital modulation]] called [[spread spectrum]] which spreads the voice data over a very wide channel in [[pseudorandom number|pseudorandom]] fashion using a user or cell specific pseudorandom code. The receiver undoes the randomization to collect the bits together and produce the original data. As the codes are pseudorandom and selected in such a way as to cause minimal interference to one another, multiple users can talk at the same time and multiple cells can share the same frequency. This causes an added signal noise forcing all users to use more power, which in exchange decreases cell range and battery life.\n* [[Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access]] (OFDMA) uses bundling of multiple small frequency bands that are orthogonal to one another to provide for separation of users. The users are multiplexed in the frequency domain by allocating specific sub-bands to individual users. This is often enhanced by also performing TDMA and changing the allocation periodically so that different users get different sub-bands at different times.\n\nIn theory, CDMA, TDMA and FDMA have exactly the same spectral efficiency but practically, each has its own challenges \u2013 power control in the case of CDMA, timing in the case of TDMA, and frequency generation/filtering in the case of FDMA.\n\nFor a classic example for understanding the fundamental difference of TDMA and CDMA, imagine a cocktail party where couples are talking to each other in a single room.  The room represents the available bandwidth:\n\n:TDMA: A speaker takes turns talking to a listener. The speaker talks for a short time and then stops to let another couple talk. There is never more than one speaker talking in the room, no one has to worry about two conversations mixing. The drawback is that it limits the practical number of discussions in the room (bandwidth wise).\n\n:CDMA: any speaker can talk at any time; however each uses a different language. Each listener can only understand the language of their partner.  As more and more couples talk, the background noise (representing the ''noise floor'') gets louder, but because of the difference in languages, conversations do not mix. The drawback is that at some point, one cannot talk any louder. After this if the noise still rises (more people join the party/cell) the listener cannot make out what the talker is talking about without coming closer to the talker. In effect, CDMA cell coverage decreases as the number of active users increases. This is called cell breathing.\n\n== Comparison table ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Feature\n!

Perry says her vows, but Alexander hesitates and the church anxiously waits for him to say \"I do\". Perry appears frustrated and the music begins to play, with the congregation dancing as disco lights flash. Perry begins to sing the song to Alexander before he flees the altar. She pursues him, and they proceed to play a [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse game]]. Perry corners him in a warehouse, and Alexander is pulled into an audience and forced to crowd-surf while watching Perry perform the song on stage. He manages to escape but walks out to find Perry in her wedding dress surrounded by several other brides carrying baseball bats. Perry confronts him, but he is able to get away.\n\nPerry and the other brides chase after him. When Alexander pulls out his phone, Perry is on the screen singing to him. He flees the warehouse and finds Perry outside wearing [[Hip hop fashion|urban clothing]], surrounded by dancers dressed similarly. When he turns around, he discovers that he has been cornered by Perry and the group of angry brides. He stumbles and the dancers surround him as he lies on the ground, before Perry approaches him leading a zebra on a leash. Alexander blinks and finds himself back at the altar in the church, revealing that the previous events were just his fantasy. The priest asks him again if he accepts his vows, and this time he says \"I do\". The crowd in the church breaks out into cheers and sighs of relief as Perry runs victoriously down the aisle with him.\n\nPerry's friend [[Jadyn Maria]] appears in the music video as a bridesmaid, and her parents Keith and Mary Hudson also make cameos.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"All Access:\" Katy Perry|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/all-access-katy-perry/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Edelstein|first=Paula|title=Jadyn Maria Interview \u2013 Recording and Touring with Ne-Yo|url=http://www.singeruniverse.com/jadynmaria123.htm|publisher=Singer Universe|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> The video for \"Hot n Cold\" was recorded in Los Angeles in September 2008 and released on October 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicvideocast.com/katy-perry-hot-n-cold.html|publisher=Music Video Cast|accessdate=September 15, 2014|title=Katy Perry \u2013 Hot N Cold (Music Video)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916124755/http://www.musicvideocast.com/katy-perry-hot-n-cold.html|archive-date=September 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was directed by [[Alan Ferguson (director)|Alan Ferguson]].

Perry says her vows, but Alexander hesitates and the church anxiously waits for him to say \"I do\". Perry appears frustrated and the music begins to play, with the congregation dancing as disco lights flash. Perry begins to sing the song to Alexander before he flees the altar. She pursues him, and they proceed to play a [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse game]]. Perry corners him in a warehouse, and Alexander is pulled into an audience and forced to crowd-surf while watching Perry perform the song on stage. He manages to escape but walks out to find Perry in her wedding dress surrounded by several other brides carrying baseball bats. Perry confronts him, but he is able to get away.\n\nPerry and the other brides chase after him. When Alexander pulls out his phone, Perry is on the screen singing to him. He flees the warehouse and finds Perry outside wearing [[Hip hop fashion|urban clothing]], surrounded by dancers dressed similarly. When he turns around, he discovers that he has been cornered by Perry and the group of angry brides. He stumbles and the dancers surround him as he lies on the ground, before Perry approaches him leading a zebra on a leash. Alexander blinks and finds himself back at the altar in the church, revealing that the previous events were just his fantasy. The priest asks him again if he accepts his vows, and this time he says \"I do\". The crowd in the church breaks out into cheers and sighs of relief as Perry runs victoriously down the aisle with him.\n\nPerry's friend [[Jadyn Maria]] appears in the music video as a bridesmaid, and her parents Keith and Mary Hudson also make cameos.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"All Access:\" Katy Perry|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/all-access-katy-perry/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Edelstein|first=Paula|title=Jadyn Maria Interview \u2013 Recording and Touring with Ne-Yo|url=http://www.singeruniverse.com/jadynmaria123.htm|publisher=Singer Universe|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> The video for \"Hot n Cold\" was recorded in Los Angeles in September 2008 and released on October 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicvideocast.com/katy-perry-hot-n-cold.html|publisher=Music Video Cast|accessdate=September 15, 2014|title=Katy Perry \u2013 Hot N Cold (Music Video)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916124755/http://www.musicvideocast.com/katy-perry-hot-n-cold.html|archive-date=September 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was directed by [[Alan Ferguson (director)|Alan Ferguson]].

Thank you for helping us comply with govermental health recommedations.\"]]\nThe [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]] impacted the [[US restaurant industry]] via government closures, resulting in layoffs of workers and loss of income for restaurants and owners and threatening the survival of independent restaurants as a category. Within a week after the first closures, industry groups representing independent restaurateurs were asking for immediate relief measures from local, state, and federal governments, saying that as many as 75% of independent restaurants could not survive closures of more than a few weeks.\n\nRestaurant closures started March 15 when Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered all bars and restaurants in the state to close their dining rooms and bars; within a week most other states followed suit. By March 23 industry experts were estimating nearly half of the industry's 15 million workers had been laid off. Insurers refused to cover the restaurants' financial losses via business interruption policies.\n\nAcross the world, restaurants' daily traffic dropped precipitously as compared to the same period in 2019 as the [[Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the restaurant industry|coronavirus impacted the overall industry]]. Closures of restaurants caused a ripple effect among dependent industries such as food production, liquor, wine, and beer production, shipping, linen suppliers, fishing and farming and among musicians, florists, and delivery services.\n\n==Industry background==\nThe US restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020 by the [[National Restaurant Association]], the main trade association for the industry in the United States.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2020/03/20/cincinnati-restaurants-ask-feds-for-coronavirus.html|title=Cincinnati restaurants ask feds for coronavirus bailout|last=Brownfield|first=Andy|date=20 March 2020|website=login.research.cincinnatilibrary.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref name=\":17\" /> An estimated 99% of companies in the industry are family-owned small businesses with fewer than 50 employees.<ref name=\":14\" /> The industry as a whole as of February 2020 employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the workforce directly.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is the nation's second largest private employer and the third largest employer overall.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/22/819189939/closed-all-at-once-restaurant-industry-faces-collapse|title=Closed All At Once: Restaurant Industry Faces Collapse|last=Noguchi|first=Yuki|date=22 March 2020|website=NPR.org|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/stephanie-ruhle/watch/restaurant-industry-reeling-from-coronavirus-80967237571|title=Restaurant industry reeling from coronavirus|website=MSNBC.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> It indirectly employed close to another 10% when dependent businesses such as food producers, trucking, and delivery services were factored in, according to Ohio restaurateur Britney Ruby Miller.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ancillary industries such as food purveyors, linen suppliers, florists, farming, fishing, trucking, beverages depend on the restaurant industry for their own financial health.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":14\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/03/23/nj-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-devastates-restaurants/2868629001/|title='We are in survival mode': Coronavirus devastates New Jersey restaurants|last=Davidowitz|first=Esther|website=North Jersey|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/coronavirus-food-industry-portland-oregon-impacts-four-top/|title='The Four Top': Coronavirus Hits The Food Industry|last=Cole|first=Katherine|website=opb.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIn Delaware and Massachusetts, one in ten workers is employed in the restaurant industry.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":22\" /> In North Carolina, 11% of workers are employed by the industry.<ref name=\":26\" /> In Texas, 12% of workers were employed by the industry as of 2016.<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.txresto.com/newsblog/85-restaurant-industry-in-texas|title=Restaurant Industry In Texas|website=txresto.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\nAcross the world, restaurants' daily traffic dropped precipitously as compared to the same period in 2019 as the virus spread.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-restaurant-business-decline-cities/|title=See how much business U.S. restaurants are losing because of the coronavirus|website=cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn a February 28 story about how restaurants could prepare for the possibility of a pandemic, ''[[Restaurant Business]]'' quoted Roslyn Stone, COO of a firm that provides crisis response for restaurants, who said \"The prospect of a global pandemic has already put a spotlight on restaurants and the tendency for employees to come in sick.

Within a week after the first closures, industry groups representing independent restaurateurs were asking for immediate relief measures from local, state, and federal governments, saying that as many as 75% of independent restaurants could not survive closures of more than a few weeks.\n\nRestaurant closures started March 15 when Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered all bars and restaurants in the state to close their dining rooms and bars; within a week most other states followed suit. By March 23 industry experts were estimating nearly half of the industry's 15 million workers had been laid off.

The house was built from 1870 to 1872 by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] for painter [[Frederick Goodall]] and named after the nearby prehistoric earthwork known as [[Grim's Ditch (Harrow)|Grim's Ditch]].\n\nThe house is best known as the home of the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], of the opera partnership [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], who lived and farmed there for the last two decades of his life.  He died while attempting to save a girl from drowning in his lake. Lady Gilbert and the Gilberts' ward, [[Nancy McIntosh]], lived there until her death in 1936. The statue of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] now found in [[Soho Square]] stood on the property from about 1880 to 1938. The house was then used as a rehabilitation centre until 1963.\n\nFrom 1963, the house was used mainly as a location for films and television, including ''[[Futtocks End]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. It was converted into Grim's Dyke Hotel in 1970 but continues to be used as a film location. The hotel retains 30 of the original 110 acres of land that Gilbert purchased with the house.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Grims-Dyke-The-Art-Journal-1881.jpg|thumb|left|Grim's Dyke from the dyke in 1881]]\nThe house was designed in 1870 by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] for the [[Victorian era]] painter [[Frederick Goodall]], who had purchased {{convert|110|acre|km2}} of land<ref>Ainger, p. 320</ref> at [[Harrow Weald]] in 1856, but he did not begin to build until a lease on the property expired.  Shaw's design for the house included aspects of [[Gothic revival]]ism, added to a late-Elizabethan style, which included high red-tiled gables, tall clustered chimneys and leaded lights. To the north of the house, Shaw built a small lodge, a walled garden and various outhouses and a stable block, later converted into garages by [[W. S. Gilbert]] for his collection of motorcars.<ref>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), p. 6</ref> Over the dyke (now a duck pond) Shaw built two stone bridges, which incorporated [[flint]] from the ruined church at [[Stanmore]].<ref>Coincidentally, Gilbert's ashes were buried in the churchyard of this church after his death in 1911.</ref>  Construction on the house was completed in 1872.  Goodall's ground-floor studio was built on a north-south axis in order to catch the light. Goodall sold the property in 1880 to Robert Herriot of [[Hambros Bank]], who added a billiard room in 1883.<ref name=Goodman7>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), p. 7</ref>  [[Windsor Castle]] is visible from the house.<ref name=How/>\n\n[[File:gilbert-library-1891.jpg|thumb|right|[[W.S.

Eventually it covered about one and a half [[acre]]s, with an island in the middle, a [[Punt (boat)|punt]] house and changing hut, and an artificial waterfall that was ceremonially turned on in December 1899. The lake was drained and refilled each year, to keep the water clear, and was stocked with [[trout]].<ref>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), p. 14</ref>  In 1905 the lake was extended again to a roughly rectangular shape, measuring 170 [[yard]]s by 50 yards.

In 1923, Winifred Isabel Emery related to Gilbert's biographers her recollection of what happened on that day:\n\n<blockquote>Sir William Gilbert was teaching me to swim, and he invited me and a pupil of mine [Ruby Preece] to Grim's Dyke on May 29th. We met him at Harrow Station and motored to Grim's Dyke and went straight to the bathing pool. My pupil and I were in the water before Sir William had made an appearance. It was a very hot day, but the water struck very cold. My pupil was a much better swimmer than I, and soon outdistanced me. We were both unaware that the lake was very deep further out, and presently she shrieked out \"Oh, Miss Emery, I am drowning!\" I called Sir William, who was on the steps, and he called out to her not to be frightened, and that he was coming. He swam out to her very quickly, and I heard him say: \"Put your hands on my shoulder and don't struggle.\" This she did, but almost immediately she called out that he had sunk under her and had not come up. We both called to him, but got no answer. I tried to reach them, but got out of my depth and could do nothing but call for help. My pupil managed to struggle to the bank, and presently the gardener came and got out a boat, but it seemed a long time before they recovered the body.<ref name=Dark/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Gilbert's lake.jpg|thumb|left|The lake, seen on 29 May 2011]]\nAt the [[coroner]]'s inquest, Preece stated, \"I found that I could not stand and called out and Sir William swam to me. I put my hand on his shoulder and I felt him suddenly sink. I thought he would come up again. My feet were on the mud then. Miss Emery called for help and the gardeners came with the boat.\"  Gilbert had \"died instantly of the heart attack\".<ref>Stedman, p. 346</ref>  Once his body was recovered, it was laid out in the billiard room (now the hotel's restaurant) at Grim's Dyke.<ref>Eden, D. J., ''W.S. Gilbert \u2013 Appearance and Reality'', Sir Arthur Sullivan Society (2003), p. 111</ref> The family doctor, W.W. Shackleton, and Daniel Wilson of Bushey Heath Cottage Hospital, later certified that Gilbert had died at about 4.20 pm that afternoon of [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (heart failure) brought on by excessive exertion. The coroner's jury, also meeting in the billiard room at Grim's Dyke two days later, on 31 May 1911, recorded a verdict of accidental death.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lady Gilbert had the lake closed off and largely drained.<ref name=Goodman17>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), pp. 17\u201318</ref>   The incident is described in the documentary ''[[Metro-Land (1973 film)|Metro-Land]]''.

The house was built from 1870 to 1872 by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] for painter [[Frederick Goodall]] and named after the nearby prehistoric earthwork known as [[Grim's Ditch (Harrow)|Grim's Ditch]].\n\nThe house is best known as the home of the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], of the opera partnership [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], who lived and farmed there for the last two decades of his life.  He died while attempting to save a girl from drowning in his lake. Lady Gilbert and the Gilberts' ward, [[Nancy McIntosh]], lived there until her death in 1936. The statue of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] now found in [[Soho Square]] stood on the property from about 1880 to 1938. The house was then used as a rehabilitation centre until 1963.\n\nFrom 1963, the house was used mainly as a location for films and television, including ''[[Futtocks End]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. It was converted into Grim's Dyke Hotel in 1970 but continues to be used as a film location. The hotel retains 30 of the original 110 acres of land that Gilbert purchased with the house.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Grims-Dyke-The-Art-Journal-1881.jpg|thumb|left|Grim's Dyke from the dyke in 1881]]\nThe house was designed in 1870 by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] for the [[Victorian era]] painter [[Frederick Goodall]], who had purchased {{convert|110|acre|km2}} of land<ref>Ainger, p. 320</ref> at [[Harrow Weald]] in 1856, but he did not begin to build until a lease on the property expired.  Shaw's design for the house included aspects of [[Gothic revival]]ism, added to a late-Elizabethan style, which included high red-tiled gables, tall clustered chimneys and leaded lights. To the north of the house, Shaw built a small lodge, a walled garden and various outhouses and a stable block, later converted into garages by [[W. S. Gilbert]] for his collection of motorcars.<ref>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), p. 6</ref> Over the dyke (now a duck pond) Shaw built two stone bridges, which incorporated [[flint]] from the ruined church at [[Stanmore]].<ref>Coincidentally, Gilbert's ashes were buried in the churchyard of this church after his death in 1911.</ref>  Construction on the house was completed in 1872.  Goodall's ground-floor studio was built on a north-south axis in order to catch the light. Goodall sold the property in 1880 to Robert Herriot of [[Hambros Bank]], who added a billiard room in 1883.<ref name=Goodman7>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), p. 7</ref>  [[Windsor Castle]] is visible from the house.<ref name=How/>\n\n[[File:gilbert-library-1891.jpg|thumb|right|[[W.S.

Work on digging out the lake began in 1899, with Gilbert himself assisting in the task. Eventually it covered about one and a half [[acre]]s, with an island in the middle, a [[Punt (boat)|punt]] house and changing hut, and an artificial waterfall that was ceremonially turned on in December 1899. The lake was drained and refilled each year, to keep the water clear, and was stocked with [[trout]].<ref>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), p. 14</ref>  In 1905 the lake was extended again to a roughly rectangular shape, measuring 170 [[yard]]s by 50 yards.

In 1923, Winifred Isabel Emery related to Gilbert's biographers her recollection of what happened on that day:\n\n<blockquote>Sir William Gilbert was teaching me to swim, and he invited me and a pupil of mine [Ruby Preece] to Grim's Dyke on May 29th. We met him at Harrow Station and motored to Grim's Dyke and went straight to the bathing pool. My pupil and I were in the water before Sir William had made an appearance. It was a very hot day, but the water struck very cold. My pupil was a much better swimmer than I, and soon outdistanced me. We were both unaware that the lake was very deep further out, and presently she shrieked out \"Oh, Miss Emery, I am drowning!\" I called Sir William, who was on the steps, and he called out to her not to be frightened, and that he was coming. He swam out to her very quickly, and I heard him say: \"Put your hands on my shoulder and don't struggle.\" This she did, but almost immediately she called out that he had sunk under her and had not come up. We both called to him, but got no answer. I tried to reach them, but got out of my depth and could do nothing but call for help. My pupil managed to struggle to the bank, and presently the gardener came and got out a boat, but it seemed a long time before they recovered the body.<ref name=Dark/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Gilbert's lake.jpg|thumb|left|The lake, seen on 29 May 2011]]\nAt the [[coroner]]'s inquest, Preece stated, \"I found that I could not stand and called out and Sir William swam to me. I put my hand on his shoulder and I felt him suddenly sink. I thought he would come up again. My feet were on the mud then. Miss Emery called for help and the gardeners came with the boat.\"  Gilbert had \"died instantly of the heart attack\".<ref>Stedman, p. 346</ref>  Once his body was recovered, it was laid out in the billiard room (now the hotel's restaurant) at Grim's Dyke.<ref>Eden, D. J., ''W.S. Gilbert \u2013 Appearance and Reality'', Sir Arthur Sullivan Society (2003), p. 111</ref> The family doctor, W.W. Shackleton, and Daniel Wilson of Bushey Heath Cottage Hospital, later certified that Gilbert had died at about 4.20 pm that afternoon of [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (heart failure) brought on by excessive exertion. The coroner's jury, also meeting in the billiard room at Grim's Dyke two days later, on 31 May 1911, recorded a verdict of accidental death.\n\nShortly thereafter, Lady Gilbert had the lake closed off and largely drained.<ref name=Goodman17>Goodman (''Grim's Dyke''), pp. 17\u201318</ref>   The incident is described in the documentary ''[[Metro-Land (1973 film)|Metro-Land]]''. Over the century since then, silt has built up in the mostly drained lake and trees and other vegetation have grown, dividing the lake into smaller ponds.  In 2011, the rare [[Great Crested Newt]] was found living near these ponds.<ref>Proctor, Ian.
