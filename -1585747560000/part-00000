In 1945 he was approached by the [[Associated Industries of Georgia]] (AIG) who shared their common desire to have such a program and offered Van Leer their support. It took years for Van Leer to convince the Board of Regents to give Georgia Tech authorization to establish a technical institute. On October 8, 1947 the authorization was granted.

Hughes, \"A Brief Chronology of the Technical Institute Movement in America.\" The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), 1947.</ref>\n\nIn response to the growing demand, the president of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], Colonel [[Blake R. Van Leer]], sought to establish a technical institute program in Georgia. In 1945 he was approached by the [[Associated Industries of Georgia]] (AIG) who shared their common desire to have such a program and offered Van Leer their support. It took years for Van Leer to convince the Board of Regents to give Georgia Tech authorization to establish a technical institute. On October 8, 1947 the authorization was granted.

It concerned a dispute over the apparent return of a candidate, [[Heather Hill (politician)|Heather Hill]], to the [[Australian Senate]] in the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]]. The result was challenged on the basis that Hill was a [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and Australia, and that [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution|section 44(i)]] of the [[Constitution of Australia]] prevents any person who is the citizen of a \"foreign power\" from being elected to the [[Parliament of Australia]]. The High Court found that, at least for the purposes of section 44(i), the United Kingdom is a foreign power to Australia.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Australian independence from the United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Constitutional history of Australia|Republicanism in Australia}}\n\nThe degree to which Australia is and has been independent from the United Kingdom is a topic of much debate.<ref name=AusInd>{{Cite web|title = Australian Independence|publisher = ozpolitics.info|url = http://www.ozpolitics.info/?page_id=586|accessdate = 2009-09-26}}</ref> The common view is that there has been an evolutionary process by which Australia has gained more and more independence.<ref name=AusInd/>\n\nThe [[1926 Imperial Conference]] resulted in the ''[[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]]'', and the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]], which granted the [[Dominion]]s equal status to the United Kingdom. However, laws passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] still had force in Australia, and laws passed by Australian parliaments would be invalid if they contradicted United Kingdom laws (the doctrine of repugnancy). The ''[[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]]'' ended the doctrine of repugnancy, and provided that United Kingdom laws would only have force in Australia at Australia's request.\n\nThe ''[[Australia Act 1986]]'' ended all legal ties between Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name=crossroad/><ref name=B&W>{{Cite book|year=2006|title=Australian Constitutional Law and Theory|edition=4th edition (abridged)|publisher=The Federation Press|location=Sydney|isbn=1-86287-586-3|last1=Blackshield|first1=Tony|last2=Williams|first2=George}}</ref> The Act, enacted by the [[Parliament of Australia]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]],<ref name=UKAUS>{{Cite news|date=1986-02-17|title=Australia Act 1986|periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament|volume=1986|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1330183 |accessdate=2009-09-26|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> ended the ability of the United Kingdom to make laws for Australia or employ the doctrine of repugnancy,<ref name=found>{{Cite web |title=Australia Act 1986 |publisher=foundingdocs.gov.au |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-32.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815130257/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-32.html |archive-date=15 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> and stopped all remaining avenues of appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] from Australian courts, unless authorised by the [[High Court of Australia]].<ref name=found/>\n\n===1998 election===\n[[Heather Hill (politician)|Heather Hill]], a woman with Australian and United Kingdom [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]], was a [[Queensland]] candidate for the [[Australian Senate]] for [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] who contested the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]]. At the election on 3 October 1998, Hill received 295,903 first preference votes and was accordingly elected without the need to consider the distribution of preferences.\n\nHenry Sue, a voter from Queensland, disputed the election of Hill and filed a petition under the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'' in the [[High Court of Australia]], sitting in its capacity as the [[Court of Disputed Returns]]. Sue argued that on the date of Hill's nomination to the Senate she was still a citizen of the United Kingdom and thus, because of the operation of [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution]], was ineligible to be elected to the Parliament of Australia.\n\nTerry Sharples, a former One Nation candidate who had stood for the Senate in the 1998 election as an independent candidate, made a similar petition. Because both cases involved constitutional questions, and were substantially identical, they were heard together from 11\u201313 May 1999.\n\n==Arguments==\n\n===Eligibility of Hill===\n\nSue argued that Hill was ineligible because of [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution|section 44(i)]] of the [[Constitution of Australia]], which provides that:\n<blockquote>\n'''44.''' Any person who - '''(i)''' Is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power: ...shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.<ref name=section44>{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|44}} Disqualification</ref></blockquote>\n\nSue argued that, since Australia was now an [[Australia Act 1986|independent nation]], the United Kingdom should properly be regarded as a foreign power.\n\nSue also raised the example of [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51(xix) of the Australian Constitution]], which grants the [[Parliament of Australia]] the power to make laws with respect to \"naturalization and aliens\", and argued that since the word \"aliens\" in that section had come to be regarded to include people from the United Kingdom, so too should the word \"foreign power\" be understood to include the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Government of Australia]] decided to intervene in the case, and the [[Solicitor-General of Australia]], [[David Bennett (barrister)|David Bennett]], also argued that the United Kingdom was a \"foreign power\".\n\nHill, on the other hand, argued that: \"The United Kingdom was not a foreign power at Federation, is not a foreign power now and never will be a foreign power while the Constitution remains in its present form.\"<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/> Hill said that because the Constitution was enacted as part of a statute of the [[British Imperial Parliament]] it derived its validity from British law. Further, she argued that because [[section 128 of the Australian Constitution]] provides that the Constitution cannot be changed except in accordance with that section, then only a [[referendums in Australia|constitutional referendum]] could change this special status of the United Kingdom, and the ''Australia Act'' had no effect, \"so long as the United Kingdom retained any residual influence upon legislative, executive or judicial processes in Australia, it could not be regarded as 'foreign' to Australia.\"<ref name=B&W/>\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nAnother question in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case. Hill argued that because of the structure of the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'', the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.\n\nThe Government argued that the sections of the Act dealing with disputation by petition encompassed any question about the validity of an election, including the eligibility of a candidate, and that the sections should be interpreted broadly.

V. Dicey]]'s proposition that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] cannot [[parliamentary supremacy|restrict its future actions]]. To this, Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne said:\n<blockquote>\n\"Provisions such as s 1 may present doctrinal questions for the constitutional law of the United Kingdom, in particular for the dogma associated with Dicey's views as to the sovereignty of the Parliament at Westminster. Professor Sir [[Henry William Rawson Wade|William Wade]] pointed out more than forty years ago that Dicey never explained how he reconciled his assertions that Westminster could destroy or transfer sovereignty and the proposition that it could not bind future Parliaments. The effect in the United Kingdom of any amendment or repeal by the United Kingdom Parliament of s 1 would be for those adjudicating upon the constitutional law of that country. But whatever effect the courts of the United Kingdom may give to an amendment or repeal of the 1986 UK Act, Australian courts would be obliged to give their obedience to s 1 of the statute passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth.\"<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n</blockquote>\nThus they decided that the position in Australia was not affected at all by the position in the United Kingdom, and for Australian purposes, the United Kingdom has no legislative power over Australia.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n\nSimilarly they decided that the United Kingdom could not exercise any judicial power over Australia, with the end of appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], and the court's previous decision, in [[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)]] that the limited purpose of a certificate of appeal,<ref name=\"CSR v AG\">There was only one certificate of appeal granted, in {{Cite AustLII|litigants=[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]] |year=1912 |court=HCA |num=94 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/94.pdf (1912)&nbsp;15&nbsp;CLR&nbsp;182.]}}</ref> was spent and that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal.<ref name=\"kirmani no2\">{{Cite AustLII |litigants=[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)]] |year=1985 |court=HCA |num=27 |parallelcite=(1985)&nbsp;159&nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]]&nbsp;461}}.</ref> They also decided that no executive power existed over Australia, as although the sovereign monarch of Australia and the sovereign monarch of the United Kingdom are the same person, it had been accepted for a long time that the monarch acts in Australian matters on the advice of Australian ministers, and does not accept the advice of United Kingdom ministers in Australian matters at all.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n\nUltimately, they concluded that the United Kingdom was a distinct sovereign power and a distinct legal personality from Australia, and as such was a \"foreign power\" for the purposes of [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution]].<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/><ref name=crossroad/>\n\n===Hill's renunciation===\nThe decision noted in paragraph 176 that an Australian having dual citizenship must take some step to renounce his or her former citizenship before he or she can be treated under Australian law as having renounced it, and noted in paragraph 104 that Hill had on 18 November 1998 become aware of steps that could be taken to renounce her British citizenship, and had taken steps to effect the renunciation on the following day. The election, however, had taken place on 3 October 1998, on which date Hill was still a dual national.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\" />\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the High Court also ruled that dual citizenship on its own will not be enough to disqualify someone under s 44(i).  At paragraph 176, the High Court makes the point that a person must take reasonable steps to renounce their non-Australian citizenship.  If renunciation is not possible, for example by either the laws of the foreign power not permitting it or the process being unreasonable, then the person will not be disqualified by operation of s 44(i).\n\n==Consequences==\nThe court declared that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, they did not declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those could be used to determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, [[Len Harris (politician)|Len Harris]], the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.\n\nThe invalidation of Hill's election caused some controversy in Australian political life. Hill herself viewed the challenge to her election as an attempt by big business and the rich to destroy her, as revenge for One Nation's critique of them during the election campaign.<ref name=BBC>{{Cite news|title=One Nation's dual nationality row|date=1998-12-08|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/231186.stm|accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref> One [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] correspondent observed the irony that One Nation, a populist [[nationalist]] party, was \"now suspected of not being quite Australian enough.\"<ref name=BBC/> [[Australian Greens]] Senator [[Bob Brown]], despite being politically opposed to One Nation, attacked the decision for disenfranchising the people who had voted for Hill.<ref name=greens>{{Cite news|first=Bernard|last=Bowen|title=Greens share One Nation outrage at decision against Hill|date=1999-06-23|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s30980.htm|accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref>\n\nAside from this immediate effect, the case represented a clear recognition that the ''[[Australia Act 1986]]'' finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation in its own right since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force.<ref name=B&W/> Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences.<ref name=mcconvill/> However, even Justice [[Ian Callinan|Callinan]], who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (''Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet'') that the effect of the ''Australia Act'' in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.<ref name=crossroad/><ref name=marquet>{{Cite AustLII |litigants=Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet |year=2003 |court=HCA |num=67 |parallelcite=(2003)&nbsp;217&nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]]&nbsp;545.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Re Canavan]]'', a court case regarding [[2017\u201318 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|the eligibility of seven Members of Parliament who unknowingly held dual citizenship]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sue V Hill}}\n[[Category:High Court of Australia cases]]\n[[Category:Australian constitutional law]]\n[[Category:Australian court of disputed returns cases]]\n[[Category:1999 in Australian law]]\n[[Category:1999 in case law]]\n[[Category:Multiple citizenship]]\n[[Category:Australia\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=April 2018}}\n{{Infobox court case |\nname=Sue v Hill |\ncourt=[[High Court of Australia]] |image=Coat of Arms of Australia.svg |\ndate decided=23 June 1999 |\nfull name=Sue v Hill & Anor;

It concerned a dispute over the apparent return of a candidate, [[Heather Hill (politician)|Heather Hill]], to the [[Australian Senate]] in the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]]. The result was challenged on the basis that Hill was a [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and Australia, and that [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution|section 44(i)]] of the [[Constitution of Australia]] prevents any person who is the citizen of a \"foreign power\" from being elected to the [[Parliament of Australia]]. The High Court found that, at least for the purposes of section 44(i), the United Kingdom is a foreign power to Australia.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Australian independence from the United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Constitutional history of Australia|Republicanism in Australia}}\n\nThe degree to which Australia is and has been independent from the United Kingdom is a topic of much debate.<ref name=AusInd>{{Cite web|title = Australian Independence|publisher = ozpolitics.info|url = http://www.ozpolitics.info/?page_id=586|accessdate = 2009-09-26}}</ref> The common view is that there has been an evolutionary process by which Australia has gained more and more independence.<ref name=AusInd/>\n\nThe [[1926 Imperial Conference]] resulted in the ''[[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]]'', and the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]], which granted the [[Dominion]]s equal status to the United Kingdom. However, laws passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] still had force in Australia, and laws passed by Australian parliaments would be invalid if they contradicted United Kingdom laws (the doctrine of repugnancy). The ''[[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]]'' ended the doctrine of repugnancy, and provided that United Kingdom laws would only have force in Australia at Australia's request.\n\nThe ''[[Australia Act 1986]]'' ended all legal ties between Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name=crossroad/><ref name=B&W>{{Cite book|year=2006|title=Australian Constitutional Law and Theory|edition=4th edition (abridged)|publisher=The Federation Press|location=Sydney|isbn=1-86287-586-3|last1=Blackshield|first1=Tony|last2=Williams|first2=George}}</ref> The Act, enacted by the [[Parliament of Australia]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]],<ref name=UKAUS>{{Cite news|date=1986-02-17|title=Australia Act 1986|periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament|volume=1986|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1330183 |accessdate=2009-09-26|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> ended the ability of the United Kingdom to make laws for Australia or employ the doctrine of repugnancy,<ref name=found>{{Cite web |title=Australia Act 1986 |publisher=foundingdocs.gov.au |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-32.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815130257/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-did-32.html |archive-date=15 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> and stopped all remaining avenues of appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] from Australian courts, unless authorised by the [[High Court of Australia]].<ref name=found/>\n\n===1998 election===\n[[Heather Hill (politician)|Heather Hill]], a woman with Australian and United Kingdom [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]], was a [[Queensland]] candidate for the [[Australian Senate]] for [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] who contested the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]]. At the election on 3 October 1998, Hill received 295,903 first preference votes and was accordingly elected without the need to consider the distribution of preferences.\n\nHenry Sue, a voter from Queensland, disputed the election of Hill and filed a petition under the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'' in the [[High Court of Australia]], sitting in its capacity as the [[Court of Disputed Returns]]. Sue argued that on the date of Hill's nomination to the Senate she was still a citizen of the United Kingdom and thus, because of the operation of [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution]], was ineligible to be elected to the Parliament of Australia.\n\nTerry Sharples, a former One Nation candidate who had stood for the Senate in the 1998 election as an independent candidate, made a similar petition. Because both cases involved constitutional questions, and were substantially identical, they were heard together from 11\u201313 May 1999.\n\n==Arguments==\n\n===Eligibility of Hill===\n\nSue argued that Hill was ineligible because of [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution|section 44(i)]] of the [[Constitution of Australia]], which provides that:\n<blockquote>\n'''44.''' Any person who - '''(i)''' Is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power: ...shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.<ref name=section44>{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|44}} Disqualification</ref></blockquote>\n\nSue argued that, since Australia was now an [[Australia Act 1986|independent nation]], the United Kingdom should properly be regarded as a foreign power.\n\nSue also raised the example of [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51(xix) of the Australian Constitution]], which grants the [[Parliament of Australia]] the power to make laws with respect to \"naturalization and aliens\", and argued that since the word \"aliens\" in that section had come to be regarded to include people from the United Kingdom, so too should the word \"foreign power\" be understood to include the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Government of Australia]] decided to intervene in the case, and the [[Solicitor-General of Australia]], [[David Bennett (barrister)|David Bennett]], also argued that the United Kingdom was a \"foreign power\".\n\nHill, on the other hand, argued that: \"The United Kingdom was not a foreign power at Federation, is not a foreign power now and never will be a foreign power while the Constitution remains in its present form.\"<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/> Hill said that because the Constitution was enacted as part of a statute of the [[British Imperial Parliament]] it derived its validity from British law. Further, she argued that because [[section 128 of the Australian Constitution]] provides that the Constitution cannot be changed except in accordance with that section, then only a [[referendums in Australia|constitutional referendum]] could change this special status of the United Kingdom, and the ''Australia Act'' had no effect, \"so long as the United Kingdom retained any residual influence upon legislative, executive or judicial processes in Australia, it could not be regarded as 'foreign' to Australia.\"<ref name=B&W/>\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nAnother question in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case. Hill argued that because of the structure of the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'', the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.\n\nThe Government argued that the sections of the Act dealing with disputation by petition encompassed any question about the validity of an election, including the eligibility of a candidate, and that the sections should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were not mutually exclusive and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.\n\n===Separation of powers===\nHill also argued that if the ''Electoral Act'' actually appeared to confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as the determination of disputes about election results is a non-judicial function. Also, the doctrine of [[separation of powers]] meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a [[Chapter III Court]] such as the High Court.\n\nBoth the Government and Sue argued that two previous decisions, which may have ''[[inter alia]]'' suggested that determining disputed returns is a non-judicial function, were incorrect. They said that the jurisdiction conferred by the Act required the court to consider real issues and not \"abstract or hypothetical questions\".<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/> They also said that the Act gave the court a wide discretion and allowed it to function in a manner entirely consistent with the exercise of judicial power.\n\n==Judgement==\nThe High court ruled that [[Australian Senate|Senator-elect]] Hill had not been duly elected to the national parliament because at the time of her election she was a subject or citizen of a foreign power.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n\nFive judgements were delivered, with Chief Justice [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson]] and Justices [[William Gummow|Gummow]] and [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]] writing a joint judgement, and Justices [[Mary Gaudron|Gaudron]], [[Michael McHugh (judge)|McHugh]], [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Kirby]] and [[Ian Callinan|Callinan]] writing individual judgements.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/><ref name=crossroad/>\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nGaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, decided that the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'' validly conferred the jurisdiction to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/> They said that if Hill's argument about the structure of the Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it would not be able to hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/> They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n\nThe four judges then went on to decide that the jurisdiction involved an exercise of judicial power,<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/> mentioning an earlier decision of Justice [[Isaac Isaacs|Isaacs]], in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power.

But whatever effect the courts of the United Kingdom may give to an amendment or repeal of the 1986 UK Act, Australian courts would be obliged to give their obedience to s 1 of the statute passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth.\"<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n</blockquote>\nThus they decided that the position in Australia was not affected at all by the position in the United Kingdom, and for Australian purposes, the United Kingdom has no legislative power over Australia.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n\nSimilarly they decided that the United Kingdom could not exercise any judicial power over Australia, with the end of appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], and the court's previous decision, in [[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)]] that the limited purpose of a certificate of appeal,<ref name=\"CSR v AG\">There was only one certificate of appeal granted, in {{Cite AustLII|litigants=[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]] |year=1912 |court=HCA |num=94 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/94.pdf (1912)&nbsp;15&nbsp;CLR&nbsp;182.]}}</ref> was spent and that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal.<ref name=\"kirmani no2\">{{Cite AustLII |litigants=[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)]] |year=1985 |court=HCA |num=27 |parallelcite=(1985)&nbsp;159&nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]]&nbsp;461}}.</ref> They also decided that no executive power existed over Australia, as although the sovereign monarch of Australia and the sovereign monarch of the United Kingdom are the same person, it had been accepted for a long time that the monarch acts in Australian matters on the advice of Australian ministers, and does not accept the advice of United Kingdom ministers in Australian matters at all.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/>\n\nUltimately, they concluded that the United Kingdom was a distinct sovereign power and a distinct legal personality from Australia, and as such was a \"foreign power\" for the purposes of [[section 44 of the Australian Constitution]].<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\"/><ref name=crossroad/>\n\n===Hill's renunciation===\nThe decision noted in paragraph 176 that an Australian having dual citizenship must take some step to renounce his or her former citizenship before he or she can be treated under Australian law as having renounced it, and noted in paragraph 104 that Hill had on 18 November 1998 become aware of steps that could be taken to renounce her British citizenship, and had taken steps to effect the renunciation on the following day. The election, however, had taken place on 3 October 1998, on which date Hill was still a dual national.<ref name=\"HCA30/1999\" />\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the High Court also ruled that dual citizenship on its own will not be enough to disqualify someone under s 44(i).  At paragraph 176, the High Court makes the point that a person must take reasonable steps to renounce their non-Australian citizenship.  If renunciation is not possible, for example by either the laws of the foreign power not permitting it or the process being unreasonable, then the person will not be disqualified by operation of s 44(i).\n\n==Consequences==\nThe court declared that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, they did not declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those could be used to determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, [[Len Harris (politician)|Len Harris]], the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.\n\nThe invalidation of Hill's election caused some controversy in Australian political life. Hill herself viewed the challenge to her election as an attempt by big business and the rich to destroy her, as revenge for One Nation's critique of them during the election campaign.<ref name=BBC>{{Cite news|title=One Nation's dual nationality row|date=1998-12-08|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/231186.stm|accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref> One [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] correspondent observed the irony that One Nation, a populist [[nationalist]] party, was \"now suspected of not being quite Australian enough.\"<ref name=BBC/> [[Australian Greens]] Senator [[Bob Brown]], despite being politically opposed to One Nation, attacked the decision for disenfranchising the people who had voted for Hill.<ref name=greens>{{Cite news|first=Bernard|last=Bowen|title=Greens share One Nation outrage at decision against Hill|date=1999-06-23|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s30980.htm|accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref>\n\nAside from this immediate effect, the case represented a clear recognition that the ''[[Australia Act 1986]]'' finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation in its own right since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force.<ref name=B&W/> Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences.<ref name=mcconvill/> However, even Justice [[Ian Callinan|Callinan]], who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (''Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet'') that the effect of the ''Australia Act'' in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.<ref name=crossroad/><ref name=marquet>{{Cite AustLII |litigants=Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet |year=2003 |court=HCA |num=67 |parallelcite=(2003)&nbsp;217&nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]]&nbsp;545.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Re Canavan]]'', a court case regarding [[2017\u201318 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|the eligibility of seven Members of Parliament who unknowingly held dual citizenship]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sue V Hill}}\n[[Category:High Court of Australia cases]]\n[[Category:Australian constitutional law]]\n[[Category:Australian court of disputed returns cases]]\n[[Category:1999 in Australian law]]\n[[Category:1999 in case law]]\n[[Category:Multiple citizenship]]\n[[Category:Australia\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "Update date format tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_v_Hill"}
