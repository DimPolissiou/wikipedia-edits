It is the second version post 1801 that is depicted on the Australian Flag.  It was often used to represent them collectively, and each colony also had its own flag based on the Union Flag.<ref name=\":8\" /> As an Australian national consciousness began to emerge, several flag movements were formed and unofficial new flags came into common usage.<ref name=\":8\" /> Two attempts were made throughout the nineteenth century to design a national flag. The first such attempt was the [[National Colonial Flag for Australia|National Colonial Flag]] created in 1823\u20131824 by Captains John Nicholson and John Bingle.<ref name=\":8\" /> This flag consisted of a red cross on a white background, with an eight-point star on each of the four limbs of the cross, while incorporating a Union Flag in the canton.<ref name=\":8\" /> The most popular \"national\" flag of the period was the 1831 [[Australian Federation Flag|Federation Flag]], also designed by Nicholson. This flag was the same at the National Colonial Flag, except that the cross was blue instead of resembling that of St. George. Although the flag was designed by Nicholson in 1831, it did not become widely popular until the latter part of the century, when calls for federation began to grow louder.<ref name=\":8\" /> These flags, and many others such as the [[Eureka Flag]] (which came into use at the [[Eureka Stockade]] in 1854), featured stars representing the Southern Cross.<ref name=\":8\" /> The oldest known flag to show the stars arranged as they are seen in the sky is the [[Australasian Anti-Transportation League Flag|Anti-Transportation League Flag]], which is similar in design to the present National Flag.<ref name=\":8\" /> The differences were that there was no Commonwealth Star, while the components of the Southern Cross are depicted with eight points and in gold. This flag was only briefly in usage, as two years after the formation of the Anti-Transportation League in 1851, the colonial authorities decided to stop the intake of convicts, so the ATL ceased its activities.<ref name=\":8\" /> The Eureka Flag is often viewed as the first \"Australian\" flag as it was the first notable example of a design that had the Southern Cross while excluding the Union Flag. The [[Murray River Flag]], popular since the 1850s, is still widely used by boats that traverse Australia's [[Murray River|main waterway]].

It is the second version post 1801 that is depicted on the Australian Flag.  It was often used to represent them collectively, and each colony also had its own flag based on the Union Flag.<ref name=\":8\" /> As an Australian national consciousness began to emerge, several flag movements were formed and unofficial new flags came into common usage.<ref name=\":8\" /> Two attempts were made throughout the nineteenth century to design a national flag. The first such attempt was the [[National Colonial Flag for Australia|National Colonial Flag]] created in 1823\u20131824 by Captains John Nicholson and John Bingle.<ref name=\":8\" /> This flag consisted of a red cross on a white background, with an eight-point star on each of the four limbs of the cross, while incorporating a Union Flag in the canton.<ref name=\":8\" /> The most popular \"national\" flag of the period was the 1831 [[Australian Federation Flag|Federation Flag]], also designed by Nicholson. This flag was the same at the National Colonial Flag, except that the cross was blue instead of resembling that of St. George. Although the flag was designed by Nicholson in 1831, it did not become widely popular until the latter part of the century, when calls for federation began to grow louder.<ref name=\":8\" /> These flags, and many others such as the [[Eureka Flag]] (which came into use at the [[Eureka Stockade]] in 1854), featured stars representing the Southern Cross.<ref name=\":8\" /> The oldest known flag to show the stars arranged as they are seen in the sky is the [[Australasian Anti-Transportation League Flag|Anti-Transportation League Flag]], which is similar in design to the present National Flag.<ref name=\":8\" /> The differences were that there was no Commonwealth Star, while the components of the Southern Cross are depicted with eight points and in gold. This flag was only briefly in usage, as two years after the formation of the Anti-Transportation League in 1851, the colonial authorities decided to stop the intake of convicts, so the ATL ceased its activities.<ref name=\":8\" /> The Eureka Flag is often viewed as the first \"Australian\" flag as it was the first notable example of a design that had the Southern Cross while excluding the Union Flag. The [[Murray River Flag]], popular since the 1850s, is still widely used by boats that traverse Australia's [[Murray River|main waterway]]. It is the same as the National Colonial Flag, except that the white background in the three quadrants other the canton were replaced with four alternating blue and white stripes, representing the four major rivers that run into the Murray River.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n|\n{| cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3\n|- class=\"noresize\"\n|  style=\"width:180px\"|[[File:Australian Colonial Flag.svg|x60px|border]]\n|  style=\"width:180px\"|[[File:Australian Federation Flag.svg|x60px|border]]\n|  style=\"width:180px\"|[[File:Eureka Flag.svg|x60px|border]]\n|  style=\"width:180px\"|[[File:AntiTransportation League Flag.svg|x60px|border]]\n|  style=\"width:180px\"|[[File:Murray River Flag (Combined).svg|border|x60px]]\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|[[National Colonial Flag for Australia|National Colonial Flag]]\n|[[Australian Federation Flag]]\n|[[Eureka Flag]]\n|[[Australasian Anti-Transportation League Flag|Anti-Transportation League Flag]]\n|[[Murray River Flag]]\n|}\n|}\n\n===1901 Federal Flag Design Competition===\n{{Main|1901 Federal Flag Design Competition}}\n\n[[File:reviewofreviews.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The edition of the ''Review of Reviews'' front cover signed by Egbert Nuttall, after the winning designers of the 1901 Federal Flag design competition were announced.]]\nAs Federation approached, thoughts turned to an official federal flag.

As a smooth operator in church politics he secured the support of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for a Highland education scheme in 1824, with the purpose of teaching the people of the Highlands and Islands to read the [[Bible]], [[catechism]] and other material in their native Gaelic.
