They fought in 48 BC at [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Dyrrhachium]] and [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]], but were disbanded in 45 BC and settled in their native Central Italy around the area of [[Bovianum Undecumanorum]].<ref name=\"livius\" />\n\n==Late Republic==\nLegio XI was reconstituted in 42 BC by [[Augustus|Octavian]] for the civil wars.<ref name=\"livius\"/> They served under the command of the second triumvirate consisting of Octavian, [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] against [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and Cassius, who had assassinated Julius Caesar. The Legion was present at the [[Battle of Philippi|Battle of Phillipi]] in 48 BC, following which they were dispatched to [[Perugia]] in Italy to suppress a local revolt. They likely also served with Octavian in Sicily against [[Sextus Pompey|Sextus Pompeius]].\n\n[[File:Bust of augustus.jpg|left|thumb|Octavian who controlled the XI after Caesar]]\nLegio XI participated in the civil war between Octavian and Mark Antony from 32\u201332 BC, and ended with the [[Battle of Actium]]. Their participation in the battle was commemorated on the tombstones of soldiers from the Legion.<ref name=\"livius\" />\n\n==Principate and dominate==\nAfterwards, the XI was sent to the Balkans, where it seems to have stayed for a century or so. The location of its base is uncertain prior to 9 AD, when it is recorded at Burnum ([[Kistanje]]) on the coast with [[Legio VII Claudia]], mostly involved in construction and development works such as roads. [[Vexillatio]]nes were stationed at [[Salona]] and [[Gardun]] as well. In 42 AD, Legio XI was still stationed at Burnum when the governor of Dalmatia, Scribonianus, revolted against [[Claudius]]. In response, Legio XI put down the rebellion and was awarded the title ''Claudia Pia Fidelis''.<ref name=\"livius\" /> Legio XI Claudia remained at Burnum until around 68 AD, at the time of the death of Nero.\n\nDuring the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], Legio XI Claudia, alongside Legio VII Claudia and Legio XIIII Gemina, sided with [[Otho]] against [[Vitellius]], who had executed [[Galba]]. They marched to the [[Battle of Cremona (69 AD)|Battle of Cremona]] but arrived too late, and Vitellius ordered Legio XI Claudia to return to the Balkans without any punishment. Legio XI then sided with Vespasian and participated in the [[Second Battle of Cremona]], which resulted in a victory for Vespasian and his accession as emperor.\n\nIn 70 AD, Legio XI was part of the expeditionary force under Cerialis to put down the [[Revolt of the Batavi|Batavian Revolt]] on the Rhine. They were then stationed at Vindonissa ([[Windisch]]) in 71 AD. There are reports of Legio XI fighting in on the Rhine in 73\u201374 AD and they participated in [[Domitian]]'s war against the [[Chatti]] in 83 AD. It is believed to have been stationed in [[Mainz]] at the time. Later in 101, it was sent to Brigetio ([[Sz\u0151ny|Szony]]) in [[Pannonia]]. They participated in [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] from 101 to 106 AD, commemorated with a [[Trajan's Column|column]] in Rome.\n\nLegio XI Claudia was then sent to Durostorum ([[Silistra]]) before 114 AD, when they are first attested at the site, and would remain headquartered there for at least the next three centuries. Soldiers of Legio XI Claudia were dispatched to occupy the Crimea, build the fortress at Draschna in [[Buz\u0103u County|Buzau]], and to serve bureaucratic functions in Tomis. A Vexillatio of Legio XI Claudia was sent to Judea in 132 under Hadrian to suppress the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]. In 193, Legio XI Claudia supported [[Septimius Severus|Septimus Severus]] and they fought against [[Pescennius Niger]], besieging [[Byzantium]], forcing their way through the [[Cilician Gates|Cilician gates]], and fighting against his forces at the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]]. They also took part in Severus' Parthian campaign, in which they helped capture [[Ctesiphon]] in 198.\n\nIn 260\u2013268 the Legion supported [[Gallienus]] in his war against [[Postumus]] of the [[Gallic Empire]], being awarded the title ''Pia Fidelis'' for the 5th and 6th times, although unlike other units it never received a 7th recognition. In 273 the Legion participated in road construction in modern Jordan, and in 295 a detachment was present in Egypt. In 298 a detachment of XI Claudia was stationed in Mauretania.<ref>CIL V 893</ref> Some Christians within the legion were persecuted by Diocletian in 302, at Durostorum. In 395\u2013425, the Legion remained headquartered on the Danube at Durostorum, with detachments under the [[Magister militum|Magister Militum per Gallias]] and under the [[Magister Militum|Magister Militum Praesentalis II]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lukeuedasarson.com/NDundecimaniWest.html|title=The Undecimani (West)|last=Ueda-Sarson|first=Luke|date=3 August 2015|website=lukeuedasarson.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Roman legions]]\n* [[Roman legion]]\n{{Roman Legion|}}\n\n[[Category:Roman legions|11]]\n[[Category:50s BC establishments]]\n[[Category:58 BC]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in the 1st century BC]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2009}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Legio XI Claudia Pia Fidelis\n|dates    =58 BC to 45 BC, then reconstituted 42 BC.\n|country  =[[Roman Republic]] ([[Italia]]), [[Roman Empire]] ([[Italia]]), and [[Eastern Roman Empire]] ([[Constantinople]])\n|type     =[[Roman legion]]\n|role     =Heavy Infantry\n|size     =Varied.

They fought in 48 BC at [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Dyrrhachium]] and [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]], but were disbanded in 45 BC and settled in their native Central Italy around the area of [[Bovianum Undecumanorum]].<ref name=\"livius\" />\n\n==Late Republic==\nLegio XI was reconstituted in 42 BC by [[Augustus|Octavian]] for the civil wars.<ref name=\"livius\"/> They served under the command of the second triumvirate consisting of Octavian, [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] against [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and Cassius, who had assassinated Julius Caesar. The Legion was present at the [[Battle of Philippi|Battle of Phillipi]] in 48 BC, following which they were dispatched to [[Perugia]] in Italy to suppress a local revolt. They likely also served with Octavian in Sicily against [[Sextus Pompey|Sextus Pompeius]].\n\n[[File:Bust of augustus.jpg|left|thumb|Octavian who controlled the XI after Caesar]]\nLegio XI participated in the civil war between Octavian and Mark Antony from 32\u201332 BC, and ended with the [[Battle of Actium]]. Their participation in the battle was commemorated on the tombstones of soldiers from the Legion.<ref name=\"livius\" />\n\n==Principate and Dominate==\nAfterwards, the XI was sent to the Balkans, where it seems to have stayed for a century or so. The location of its base is uncertain prior to 9 AD, when it is recorded at Burnum ([[Kistanje]]) on the coast with [[Legio VII Claudia]], mostly involved in construction and development works such as roads. [[Vexillatio]]nes were stationed at [[Salona]] and [[Gardun]] as well. In 42 AD, Legio XI was still stationed at Burnum when the governor of Dalmatia, Scribonianus, revolted against [[Claudius]]. In response, Legio XI put down the rebellion and was awarded the title ''Claudia Pia Fidelis''.<ref name=\"livius\" /> Legio XI Claudia remained at Burnum until around 68 AD, at the time of the death of Nero.\n\nDuring the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], Legio XI Claudia, alongside Legio VII Claudia and Legio XIIII Gemina, sided with [[Otho]] against [[Vitellius]], who had executed [[Galba]]. They marched to the [[Battle of Cremona (69 AD)|Battle of Cremona]] but arrived too late, and Vitellius ordered Legio XI Claudia to return to the Balkans without any punishment. Legio XI then sided with Vespasian and participated in the [[Second Battle of Cremona]], which resulted in a victory for Vespasian and his accession as emperor.\n\nIn 70 AD, Legio XI was part of the expeditionary force under Cerialis to put down the [[Revolt of the Batavi|Batavian Revolt]] on the Rhine. They were then stationed at Vindonissa ([[Windisch]]) in 71 AD. There are reports of Legio XI fighting in on the Rhine in 73\u201374 AD and they participated in [[Domitian]]'s war against the [[Chatti]] in 83 AD. It is believed to have been stationed in [[Mainz]] at the time. Later in 101, it was sent to Brigetio ([[Sz\u0151ny|Szony]]) in [[Pannonia]]. They participated in [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] from 101 to 106 AD, commemorated with a [[Trajan's Column|column]] in Rome.\n\nLegio XI Claudia was then sent to Durostorum ([[Silistra]]) before 114 AD, when they are first attested at the site, and would remain headquartered there for at least the next three centuries. Soldiers of Legio XI Claudia were dispatched to occupy the Crimea, build the fortress at Draschna in [[Buz\u0103u County|Buzau]], and to serve bureaucratic functions in Tomis. A Vexillatio of Legio XI Claudia was sent to Judea in 132 under Hadrian to suppress the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]. In 193, Legio XI Claudia supported [[Septimius Severus|Septimus Severus]] and they fought against [[Pescennius Niger]], besieging [[Byzantium]], forcing their way though the [[Cilician Gates|Cilician gates]], and fighting against his forces at the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]]. They also took part in Severus' Parthian campaign, in which they helped capture [[Ctesiphon]] in 198.\n\nIn 260-268 the Legion supported [[Gallienus]] in his war against [[Postumus]] of the [[Gallic Empire]], being awarded the title ''Pia Fidelis'' for the 5th and 6th times, although unlike other units it never received a 7th recognition. In 273 the Legion participated in road construction in modern Jordan, and in 295 a detachment was present in Egypt. In 298 a detachment of XI Claudia was stationed in Mauretania.<ref>CIL V 893</ref> Some Christians within the legion were persecuted by Diocletian in 302, at Durostorum.

The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal rod [[electrode]] projects through the stopper at the mouth of the jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an [[electrostatic generator]], or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]].

In the 1700s American statesman and scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]] performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him to conclude that the charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge can be found on the metal plates, and therefore it must be in the [[dielectric]].  The first documented instance of this demonstration is in a 1749 letter by Franklin.<ref>Letter IV: Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749 (Bigelow vol II p. 237-253) [http://www.compadre.org/precollege/items/Load.cfm?ID=3430 (PDF containing extracts)]</ref>  Franklin designed a \"dissectible\" Leyden jar ''(right)'', which was widely used in demonstrations. The jar is constructed out of a glass cup nested between two fairly snugly fitting metal cups. When the jar is charged with a high voltage and carefully dismantled, it is discovered that all the parts may be freely handled without discharging the jar. If the pieces are re-assembled, a large [[electric spark|spark]] may still be obtained from it.\n\nThis demonstration appears to suggest that [[capacitor]]s store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar.<ref name=\"Mills\">{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Allan | title = Part 6: The Leyden jar and other capacitors | journal = Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society | issue = 99 | pages = 20\u201322 | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | accessdate = 2010-06-13 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024546/http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 }}</ref> In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred to the surface of the glass cup by [[corona discharge]] when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the residual charge after the jar is reassembled.

[[Soda glass]] is [[hygroscopic]] and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which holds the charge.<ref name=\"Mills\" /> Addenbrooke (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, the charge remained on the metal plates.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Addenbrooke | first = G.

By the middle of the 19th century, the Leyden jar had become common enough for writers to assume their readers knew of and understood its basic operation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Around the turn of the century it began to be widely used in [[spark-gap transmitter]]s and medical [[electrotherapy]] equipment. By the early 20th century, improved dielectrics and the need to reduce their size and undesired [[inductance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for use in the new technology of [[radio]] caused the Leyden jar to evolve into the modern compact form of [[capacitor]].\n\n== Design ==\n[[Image:Leyden jar showing construction.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Leyden jar construction.]]\nA typical design consists of a [[glass]] jar with conducting tin foil coating the inner and outer surfaces. The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal rod [[electrode]] projects through the stopper at the mouth of the jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an [[electrostatic generator]], or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]]. The inner and outer surfaces of the jar store equal but opposite charges.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm| title=How Capacitors Work| date=2007-09-17| access-date=2014-02-15| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103184652/https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm| archive-date=2018-01-03| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe original form of the device is just a glass bottle partially filled with water, with a metal wire passing through a cork closing it. The role of the outer plate is provided by the hand of the experimenter.

In the 1700s American statesman and scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]] performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him to conclude that the charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge can be found on the metal plates, and therefore it must be in the [[dielectric]].  The first documented instance of this demonstration is in a 1749 letter by Franklin.<ref>Letter IV: Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749 (Bigelow vol II p. 237-253) [http://www.compadre.org/precollege/items/Load.cfm?ID=3430 (PDF containing extracts)]</ref>  Franklin designed a \"dissectible\" Leyden jar ''(right)'', which was widely used in demonstrations. The jar is constructed out of a glass cup nested between two fairly snugly fitting metal cups. When the jar is charged with a high voltage and carefully dismantled, it is discovered that all the parts may be freely handled without discharging the jar. If the pieces are re-assembled, a large [[electric spark|spark]] may still be obtained from it.\n\nThis demonstration appears to suggest that [[capacitor]]s store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar.<ref name=\"Mills\">{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Allan | title = Part 6: The Leyden jar and other capacitors | journal = Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society | issue = 99 | pages = 20\u201322 | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | accessdate = 2010-06-13 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024546/http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 }}</ref> In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred to the surface of the glass cup by [[corona discharge]] when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the residual charge after the jar is reassembled.
