Andreotti did not use his influence to advance his children to prominence, despite being widely considered the most powerful person in the country for decades. \"See all, tolerate much, and correct one thing at a time,\" was a quote that emphasised what has been called his 'art of the possible' view of politics.\n\nAndreotti was known for his discretion and retentive memory, and also a sense of humour, often placing things in perspective with a sardonic quip.<ref name=Sen/><ref name=jessup>{{cite book |last=Jessup |first=John E. |title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945\u20131996 |year=1998 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |page=25 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/20/giulio-andreotti |title=Prince of Darkness: He was prime minister of Italy seven times - but for many of those years Giulio Andreotti had ties to the Mafia.

The measures were aimed at preventing American productions from dominating the market against [[Neorealist film]]s, a genre which exhibitors complained lacked stars and was held in low esteem by the public. As he phrased it, there were to be 'Less rags, more legs'. Raunchy comedies and historical dramas with voluptuous toga-clad actresses became the staple of the Italian film industry. To ensure that state funds were not used to prop up commercially unsustainable films, the screenplays were vetted, thereby creating a form of preproduction [[censorship]]. It was intended that Italian studios use part of their profits for high-quality films.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/06/giulio-andreotti-prime-minister |title=Giulio Andreotti obituary |first=Donald |last=Sassoon |date=6 May 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> However, [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Umberto D.]]'', which depicted the lonely life of a retired man, could only strike government officials as a dangerous throwback, due to the opening scene featuring police breaking up a demonstration of old pensioners and the ending scene featuring Umberto's aborted suicide attempt.

In the same period, Andreotti started to form a ''corrente'' (unofficial political association, or a faction) within the Christian Democracy, which was then the largest party in Italy. His ''corrente'' was supported by the Roman Catholic right wing.

Andreotti, known as a staunch anti-communist, was called in to lead the first experiment in that direction: his new cabinet, formed in July 1976, included only members of his own Christian Democratic party but had the indirect support of the communists.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fallaci |first=Oriana |author-link=Oriana Fallaci |date=1974 |title=Intervista con la storia |language=it |location=Milan |publisher=Rizzoli|title-link=Interview with History }}</ref>\n\nAndreotti's third cabinet was called \"the government of the \"not-[[Motion of no confidence|no confidence]]\", because it was externally supported by all the political parties in the Parliament, except for the neo-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ilpost.it/2013/04/10/il-governo-della-non-sfiducia-nel-1976/ |title=Il governo della \"non sfiducia\", nel 1976 |date=10 April 2013 |newspaper=[[Il Post]] |language=it |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Legislative action===\nOn 28 January 1977 the [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] approved the Land Use Law, which introduced severe constraints on construction, such as new criteria for land expropriations and new planning procedures. On 27 July 1978, the Fair Rent Law completed state control of rents with general rules for rent levels and terms of leases. A law of 16 February 1977 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for the agricultural sector. In November 1977, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to all other pension schemes not administered by INPS. A law of 16 February 1977 extended family allowances to agricultural part-time workers.

This cabinet fell in January 1978. In March, the crisis was overcome by the intervention of Moro, who proposed a new cabinet, again formed only by DC politicians, but this time with positive confidence votes from the other parties, including the PCI. This cabinet was also chaired by Andreotti, and was formed on 16 March 1978.\n\n===Kidnapping of Aldo Moro===\n{{main|Kidnapping of Aldo Moro}}\n[[File:Moro Andreotti.jpg|thumb|right|Giulio Andreotti with [[Aldo Moro]]]]\nOn the morning of 16 March 1978, the day on which the new Andreotti cabinet was supposed to have undergone a [[confidence and supply|confidence]] vote in the [[Italian Parliament]], the car of Aldo Moro, then-president of the Christian Democracy, was assaulted by a group of [[Red Brigades]] (Italian: ''Brigate Rosse'', or BR) terrorists in Via Fani in Rome. Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro's bodyguards (two [[Carabinieri]] in Moro's car and three [[law enforcement in Italy|policemen]] in the following car) and kidnapped him.\n\nDuring the kidnapping of Moro, Andreotti refused any negotiation with the terrorists. Moro, during his imprisonment, wrote a statement expressing very harsh judgements against Andreotti.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valeriolucarelli.it/MemorialeMoro.pdf |title=Il Memoriale di Aldo Moro |last=Moro |first=Aldo |year=1978 |website=ValerioLucarelli.it |accessdate=17 October 2010 |language=it}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 May 1978 Moro's body was found in the [[trunk (car)|trunk]] of a [[Renault 4]] in Via Caetani after 55 days of imprisonment, during which Moro was submitted to a political trial by the so-called \"people's court\" set up by the Brigate Rosse and the Italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners.\n\nAfter his death, Andreotti continued as Prime Minister of the \"National Solidarity\" government with the support of the PCI. Laws approved during his tenure included the reform of the Italian National Health Service. However, when the PCI asked to participate more directly in the government, Andreotti refused, and the government was dissolved in June 1979. Due also to conflict with [[Bettino Craxi]], secretary of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), the other main party in Italy at the time, Andreotti did not hold any further government position until 1983.\n\n==Foreign Affairs Minister==\nIn 1983, Andreotti became [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the first Cabinet of Bettino Craxi, despite the long-lasting personal antagonism between the two men which had occurred earlier on; Craxi was the first Socialist to become Prime Minister of Italy since [[Italian unification|Unification]].\n\n===Sigonella Crisis===\n{{main|Achille Lauro hijacking}}\n[[File:Giulio Andreotti e Bettino Craxi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Andreotti with the Socialist leader and Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]]]]\nOn October 7, 1985, four men representing the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] (PLF) [[Piracy|hijacked]] the Italian [[MS Achille Lauro|MS ''Achille Lauro'']] liner off the coast of [[Egypt]], as she was sailing from [[Alexandria]] to [[Ashdod]], Israel.

However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As Craxi's relationship with the then-National Secretary of the DC, [[Ciriaco De Mita]], was even worse, Andreotti was instrumental in the creation of the so-called \"CAF triangle\" (from the initials of the surnames of Craxi, Andreotti and another DC leader, [[Arnaldo Forlani]]) opposing De Mita's power.\n\nAfter Craxi's resignation in 1987, Andreotti remained Minister of Foreign Affairs also in the governments of [[Amintore Fanfani|Fanfani]] and De Mita.

His government was characterized by a turbulent course: Andreotti decided to stay at the head of government, despite the abandonment of many [[social democracy|social democratic]] ministers, after the approval of the norm on TV spots (favorable to private TV channels of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]).

The deep [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] favoured by Italy was opposed by Britain's [[Margaret Thatcher]], who wanted a system of competition between currencies. Germany had doubts about committing to the project without requiring economic reforms from Italy, which was seen as having various imbalances. As President of the European Council, Andreotti co-opted Germany by making admittance to the single market automatic once the criteria had been met, and committing to a rigorous overhaul of Italian public finances. Critics later questioned Andreotti's understanding of the obligation, or whether he had ever intended to fulfill it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ca48d566-a43d-11e1-84b1-00144feabdc0.html |title=Giulio Andreotti, Italian statesman |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |first1=Maurizio |last1=Ferrera |first2=Elisabetta |last2=Gualmini |title=Rescued by Europe?: Social and Labour Market Reforms in Italy |pages=132\u2013133 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-9-05356-651-0}}</ref>\n\n===Resignation and decline===\nIn 1992, at the end of the legislature, Andreotti resigned from premiership; he was the last Christian Democratic Prime Minister of Italy. The previous year, Cossiga had appointed him [[Senator for Life]]. Andreotti was one of the most likely candidates to succeed Cossiga as President of the Republic in the [[1992 Italian presidential election|1992 presidential election]].\n\nAndreotti and the members of his ''corrente'' had adopted a strategy of launching his candidature only after effectively quenching all the others. The strategy was thwarted by allegations against him; moreover, the election was influenced by the murder of the [[anti-mafia]] magistrate [[Giovanni Falcone]] in [[Palermo]].\n\n==Later political life==\n===Tangentopoli===\n{{main|Mani Pulite}}\nIn 1992 an investigation was started in [[Milan]], dubbed ''[[Mani pulite]]''. It uncovered endemic corruption practices at the highest levels, causing many spectacular (and sometimes controversial) arrests and resignations. After the dismaying result in the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]] (29.7%) and two years of mounting scandals (which included several Mafia investigations which notably touched Andreotti), the Christian Democracy was disbanded in 1994. In the 1990s most of the politicians prosecuted during those investigations were acquitted, sometimes however on the basis of legal formalities or on the basis of [[statute of limitations|statutory time limit]] rules.\n\n===After the Christian Democracy===\nThe Christian Democracy suffered heavy defeats in the provincial and municipal elections, and polling suggested heavy losses in [[1994 Italian general election|the election due in the spring of 1994]]. In hopes of changing the party's image, the DC's last secretary, [[Mino Martinazzoli]], decided to change the name of the party to the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]]. [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]], representing the centre-right faction of the party (previously led by Forlani), decided to launch a new party called [[Christian Democratic Centre]] and to form an alliance with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s new party, [[Forza Italia]]. The left wing faction either joined the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] or stayed within the new Italian People's Party, while some right-wingers others joined [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].\n\n[[File:Giulio Andreotti-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Andreotti in the late 2000s]]\nAndreotti joined the Italian People's Party of Mino Martinazzoli.

On 21 January 2008 he abstained from a vote in the Senate concerning Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]]'s report on foreign politics. Together with the abstentions of another life senator, [[Sergio Pininfarina]], and of two communist senators, this caused the government to lose the vote. Consequently, Prime Minister [[Romano Prodi]] resigned. On previous occasions, Andreotti had always supported Prodi's government with his vote.\n\nDuring the 16th term of the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] in 2008\u201313, he opted to join the parliamentary group [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre \u2013 Independents]] of [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]].\n\n==Controversies==\n===Trial for Mafia association===\n[[File:Salvo Lima 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Salvatore Lima]]]]\nAndreotti came under suspicion because his relatively small faction within the Christian Democrats included Sicilian [[Salvatore Lima]].

The bullets used to kill him were ''Gevelot'' brand, a peculiarly rare type of bullets not easily found on gun markets, legal and clandestine alike. The same kind of bullets were later found in the ''[[Banda della Magliana]]''{{'}}s weapon stock, concealed in the Health Ministry's basement. Investigations targeted [[Massimo Carminati]], member of the far-right organization ''[[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]]'' (NAR) and of the ''Banda della Magliana'', the head of Propaganda Due, [[Licio Gelli]], Antonio Viezzer, Cristiano Fioravanti and [[Valerio Fioravanti]].\n\nOn April 6, 1993, Mafia [[pentito|turncoat]] Tommaso Buscetta told Palermo prosecutors that he had learnt from his boss [[Gaetano Badalamenti]] that Pecorelli's murder had been carried out in the interest of Andreotti. The [[Salvo cousins]], two powerful Sicilian politicians with deep ties to local Mafia families, were also involved in the murder. Buscetta testified that Gaetano Badalamenti told him that the murder had been commissioned by the Salvo cousins as a favor to Andreotti. Andreotti was allegedly afraid that Pecorelli was about to publish information that could have destroyed his political career. Among the information was the complete memorial of [[Aldo Moro]], which would be published only in 1990 and which Pecorelli had shown to General [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] before his death.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/aprile/15/intreccio_Pecorelli_Moro_gia_anno_co_0_930415968.shtml |title=Intreccio Pecorelli-Moro: gi\u00e0 da un anno s'indaga |first=Maria Antonietta |last=Calabr\u00f2 |date=15 April 1993 |newspaper=Corriere della Sera |language=it |accessdate=19 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174652/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/aprile/15/intreccio_Pecorelli_Moro_gia_anno_co_0_930415968.shtml |archive-date=12 May 2011}}</ref> Dalla Chiesa was also assassinated by Mafia in September 1982.\n\nAndreotti was acquitted along with his co-defendants in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/25/world/ex-premier-andreotti-acquitted-of-mafia-murder-conspiracy.html |title=Ex-Premier Andreotti Acquitted of Mafia Murder Conspiracy |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley |date=25 September 1999 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> Local prosecutors successfully appealed the acquittal and there was a retrial, which in 2002 convicted Andreotti and sentenced him to 24 years imprisonment.

Andreotti is widely considered the most powerful and prominent politician of the so-called [[History of the Italian Republic#The \"First Republic\" (1948\u20131992)|First Republic]].\n\nBeginning as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], Andreotti achieved cabinet rank at a young age and occupied all the major offices of state over the course of a forty-year political career, being seen as a reassuring figure by the civil service, business community, and Vatican. In foreign policy, he guided Italy's [[European Union]] integration and established closer relations with the Arab world. Admirers of Andreotti saw him as having mediated political and social contradictions, enabling the transformation of a substantially rural country into the world's fifth-biggest economy. Critics said he had done nothing to challenge a system of patronage that had led to pervasive corruption. Andreotti staunchly supported the Vatican and a capitalist structure, while opposing the [[Italian Communist Party]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Irving|first=R. E.

Andreotti was sometimes called ''Divo Giulio'' (from Latin ''Divus Iulius'', \"Divine Julius\", an [[epithet]] of [[Julius Caesar]] after his posthumous deification).\n\n==Background and attributes==\nGiulio Andreotti, the youngest of three children, was born on 14 January 1919 in [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WvGGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=14+january+1919+andreotti&source=bl&ots=hqevVllqvD&sig=ACfU3U0qT8LRLLdrwagkqnP91AFUfj7iAQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIv5G8hK_oAhVHCM0KHcWBC8YQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=14%20january%201919%20andreotti&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture|publisher=Routledge|editor=Gino Moliterno|year=2000}}</ref> His father, who died when Giulio was two, was a primary school teacher from [[Segni]], a small town in [[Lazio]]; after a few years his sister Elena also died.

His mother was described as not very affectionate, and an aunt is said to have advised him to remember that few things in life are important, and never to over-dramatise difficulties. As an adult he was described as having a somewhat unusual demeanor for an Italian politician, being mild-mannered and unassuming. Andreotti did not use his influence to advance his children to prominence, despite being widely considered the most powerful person in the country for decades. \"See all, tolerate much, and correct one thing at a time,\" was a quote that emphasised what has been called his 'art of the possible' view of politics.\n\nAndreotti was known for his discretion and retentive memory, and also a sense of humour, often placing things in perspective with a sardonic quip.<ref name=Sen/><ref name=jessup>{{cite book |last=Jessup |first=John E. |title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945\u20131996 |year=1998 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |page=25 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/20/giulio-andreotti |title=Prince of Darkness: He was prime minister of Italy seven times - but for many of those years Giulio Andreotti had ties to the Mafia.

His election was supported by [[Alcide De Gasperi]], founder of the modern DC, of whom Andreotti became a close assistant and advisor; the two politicians became close friends despite their very different characters.

The measures were aimed at preventing American productions from dominating the market against [[Neorealist film]]s, a genre which exhibitors complained lacked stars and was held in low esteem by the public. As he phrased it, there were to be 'Less rags, more legs'. Raunchy comedies and historical dramas with voluptuous toga-clad actresses became the staple of the Italian film industry.

Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro's bodyguards (two [[Carabinieri]] in Moro's car and three [[law enforcement in Italy|policemen]] in the following car) and kidnapped him.\n\nDuring the kidnapping of Moro, Andreotti refused any negotiation with the terrorists.

Laws approved during his tenure included the reform of the Italian National Health Service. However, when the PCI asked to participate more directly in the government, Andreotti refused, and the government was dissolved in June 1979.

After the dismaying result in the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]] (29.7%) and two years of mounting scandals (which included several Mafia investigations which notably touched Andreotti), the Christian Democracy was disbanded in 1994. In the 1990s most of the politicians prosecuted during those investigations were acquitted, sometimes however on the basis of legal formalities or on the basis of [[statute of limitations|statutory time limit]] rules.\n\n===After the Christian Democracy===\nThe Christian Democracy suffered heavy defeats in the provincial and municipal elections, and polling suggested heavy losses in [[1994 Italian general election|the election due in the spring of 1994]]. In hopes of changing the party's image, the DC's last secretary, [[Mino Martinazzoli]], decided to change the name of the party to the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]]. [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]], representing the centre-right faction of the party (previously led by Forlani), decided to launch a new party called [[Christian Democratic Centre]] and to form an alliance with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s new party, [[Forza Italia]]. The left wing faction either joined the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] or stayed within the new Italian People's Party, while some right-wingers others joined [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].\n\n[[File:Giulio Andreotti-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Andreotti in the late 2000s]]\nAndreotti joined the Italian People's Party of Mino Martinazzoli.

On 21 January 2008 he abstained from a vote in the Senate concerning Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]]'s report on foreign politics. Together with the abstentions of another life senator, [[Sergio Pininfarina]], and of two communist senators, this caused the government to lose the vote. Consequently, Prime Minister [[Romano Prodi]] resigned. On previous occasions, Andreotti had always supported Prodi's government with his vote.\n\nDuring the 16th term of the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] in 2008\u201313, he opted to join the parliamentary group [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre \u2013 Independents]] of [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]].\n\n==Controversies==\n===Trial for Mafia association===\n[[File:Salvo Lima 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Salvatore Lima]]]]\nAndreotti came under suspicion because his relatively small faction within the Christian Democrats included Sicilian [[Salvatore Lima]].

[[Cardinal Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#Great Charter of 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.<!--Note: the 1225 date is correct in this context, and shouldn't be confused with the 1215 charter--> His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the [[Angevin Empire|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but [[English invasion of France (1230)|the invasion]] was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Catholic Church|the Church]].\n\nFollowing the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he [[Saintonge War|invaded Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard of Cornwall]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].\n\nBy 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[King Louis IX]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n\nIn 1263, one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some [[miracle]]s were declared after his death; however, he was not [[canonised]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and childhood==\n{{main|Angevin Empire|First Barons' War}}\n[[File:Angevin empire in France c. 1200 (simplified).png|thumb|alt=A coloured map of medieval France, showing the Angevin territories in France|King [[John of England|John]]'s lands in France, c. 1200]]\nHenry was born in [[Winchester Castle]] on 1 October 1207.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> He was the eldest son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=45}}</ref> Little is known of Henry's early life.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2002|p=230}}</ref> He was initially looked after by a [[wet nurse]] called Ellen in the south of England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters \u2013 [[Richard of Cornwall|Richard]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan]], [[Isabella of England|Isabella]] and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor]] \u2013 and various older illegitimate siblings.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=47}}</ref> In 1212 his education was entrusted to [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]]; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Henry's appearance; he was probably around {{convert|1.68|m}} tall, and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build, with a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]].<ref name=ODNB/>{{efn|The description of Henry's eyelid, written after his death, comes from the chronicler [[Nicholas Trevet]].

The son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]], Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the [[First Barons' War]]. [[Cardinal Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#Great Charter of 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.<!--Note: the 1225 date is correct in this context, and shouldn't be confused with the 1215 charter--> His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the [[Angevin Empire|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but [[English invasion of France (1230)|the invasion]] was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Catholic Church|the Church]].\n\nFollowing the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he [[Saintonge War|invaded Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard of Cornwall]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].\n\nBy 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[King Louis IX]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.\n\nIn 1263, one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some [[miracle]]s were declared after his death; however, he was not [[canonised]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background and childhood==\n{{main|Angevin Empire|First Barons' War}}\n[[File:Angevin empire in France c. 1200 (simplified).png|thumb|alt=A coloured map of medieval France, showing the Angevin territories in France|King [[John of England|John]]'s lands in France, c. 1200]]\nHenry was born in [[Winchester Castle]] on 1 October 1207.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> He was the eldest son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=45}}</ref> Little is known of Henry's early life.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Cole|2002|p=230}}</ref> He was initially looked after by a [[wet nurse]] called Ellen in the south of England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=46}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters \u2013 [[Richard of Cornwall|Richard]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan]], [[Isabella of England|Isabella]] and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor]] \u2013 and various older illegitimate siblings.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=47}}</ref> In 1212 his education was entrusted to [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]]; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |title=Henry III (1207\u20131272) |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition |publication-date=September 2010 |year=2004 |last=Ridgeway |first=Huw W. |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053239/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |mode=cs2 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Henry's appearance; he was probably around {{convert|1.68|m}} tall, and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build, with a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]].<ref name=ODNB/>{{efn|The description of Henry's eyelid, written after his death, comes from the chronicler [[Nicholas Trevet]].

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

represented the [[University of Central Florida]] during the [[2019 NCAA Division I men's soccer season]] and the [[2019 American Athletic Conference men's soccer season]]. The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.
