Milan]].\n\nThe son of famed [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] goalkeeper [[Miguel Reina]], Pepe Reina began his career with the Barcelona youth team and made his [[La Liga]] debut in the [[2000\u201301 La Liga|2000\u201301 season]]. He signed for [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] in 2002, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] twice. Reina moved on to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and made his debut in the [[2005 UEFA Super Cup]], which Liverpool won. He instantly became first-choice goalkeeper and went on to win both the [[FA Cup]] \u2013 where he saved three out of four [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] in [[2006 FA Cup Final|the final]] \u2013 and the [[FA Community Shield]]. In 2007, he reached the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League Final]] with Liverpool, matching the feat achieved by his father in 1974, but Liverpool lost to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]].\n\nFollowing eight consecutive seasons as Liverpool's first-choice keeper, Reina spent the 2013\u201314 season on loan at [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], where he was reunited with [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]], the coach who signed him to play for Liverpool in 2005. During his loan tenure in [[Naples]], Reina was part of the side that won the [[2014 Coppa Italia Final|2014]] [[Coppa Italia]]. Reina then completed a permanent move to [[FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen|Bayern Munich]] in 2014 upon returning to Napoli on a permanent deal in 2015 after having been the second-choice keeper for Bayern behind [[Manuel Neuer]]. In 2018, Reina left Napoli for [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and 1.5 years later he completed a loan move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].\n\nAt international level, Reina played for Spain's youth team, winning the [[UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] in 1999.

The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the [[tepals]] (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily [[family (biology)|family]], [[Liliaceae]], along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to ''[[Amana (plant)|Amana]]'', ''[[Erythronium]]'' and ''[[Gagea]]'' in the tribe [[Lilieae]]. There are about 75 [[species]], and these are divided among four [[subgenera]]. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a [[Persian language|Persian]] word for [[turban]], which it may have been thought to resemble. Tulips originally were found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to [[Central Asia]], but since the seventeenth century have become widely [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] and cultivated (''see map''). In their natural state they are adapted to [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppes]] and [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climates]]. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\nTulips grew wild in the [[Tien Shan]] Mountains and were cultivated in Istanbul in 1055. In the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; the flower was the symbol of the Ottomans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/|title=There Never Was a Real Tulip Fever|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> While tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the tenth century, they did not come to the attention of the West until the sixteenth century, when Western diplomats to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court observed and reported on them.  They were rapidly introduced into Europe and became a frenzied commodity during [[Tulip mania]]. Tulips were frequently depicted in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth century Netherlands, during the time of the Tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the [[tulip breaking virus]] created [[variegation|variegated]] patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips do not exist anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the  group known as the Rembrandts \u2013 so named because [[Rembrandt]] painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBreeding programs have produced thousands of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] and [[cultivar]]s in addition to the original species (known in [[horticulture]] as botanical tulips).  They are popular throughout the world, both as [[ornamental garden plants]] and as [[cut flowers]].\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| header    = Tulip [[plant morphology|morphology]]\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 130\n| image1    = Tulipa fringed - burgundy lace - bulbs.jpg\n| caption1  = '''[[Bulbs]]''', showing [[tunica (biology)|tunic]] and scales\n| alt1      = Collection of tulip bulbs, some sliced to show interior scales\n| image2    = Tulipa orphanidea 060506.jpg\n| caption2  = Cup-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa orphanidea]]''\n| alt2      = Flower of Tulipa orphanidea, showing cup shape\n| image3    = Tulip Tulipa clusiana 'Lady Jane' Rock Ledge Flower 2000px.jpg\n| caption3  = Star-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa clusiana]]'' with three [[sepals]] and three [[petals]], forming six identical [[tepals]]\n| alt3      = Photograph of Tulipa clusiana, showing six identical tepals (petals and sepals)\n}}\n''Tulipa'' (tulips) is a genus of spring-blooming [[perennial]] [[herbaceous]] [[bulb]]iferous [[geophytes]], dying back after flowering to an underground storage bulb.  Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between {{convert|4|in|cm}} and {{convert|28|in|cm}} high.\n\n[[Flowers]]: The tulip's flowers are usually large and are [[actinomorphic]] (radially symmetric) and [[hermaphrodite]] (contain both male ([[androecium]]) and female ([[gynoecium]]) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely [[pendulous]], and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when [[pluriflor]] as two to three (e.g. ''[[Tulipa turkestanica]]''), but up to four, flowers on the end of a [[:wikt:floriferous|floriferous]] [[Plant stem|stem]] ([[scape (botany)|scape]]), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star shaped. As with other members of [[Liliaceae]] the [[perianth]] is undifferentiated ([[perigonium]]) and biseriate (two [[Whorl (botany)|whorled]]), formed from six free (i.e. [[perianth#Flowering plants|apotepalous]]) [[caducous]] [[tepals]] arranged into two separate whorls of three parts ([[Merosity|trimerous]]) each. The two whorls represent three [[petal]]s and three [[sepals]], but are termed [[tepal]]s because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Botany of Desire|last=Pollan|first=Michael|publisher=Random House|year=2002|isbn=0-375-76039-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95 95]|url=https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95}}</ref> Tulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent [[nectaries]].{{sfn|King|2005|p=164}}{{sfn|Tenenbaum|2003|p=395}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}{{sfn|Grey-Wilson|Matthews|1980}} Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters. The Dutch regarded this lack of scent as a virtue, as it demonstrates the flower's chasteness.<ref name=\":1\" />\n \n[[Androecium]]: The flowers have six distinct, basifixed [[introrse]] [[stamen]]s arranged in two whorls of three, which vary in length and may be glabrous or hairy.

Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is [[glossary of botanical terms#cauline|cauline]] (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem.

Within Liliaceae, Tulipa is placed within [[Lilioideae]], one of three subfamilies, with two [[tribe (biology)|tribes]]. Tribe [[Lilieae]] includes seven other genera in addition to Tulipa.\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n\nThe genus, which includes about 75 [[species]], is divided into four [[subgenera]].{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n* Clusianae (4 species)\n* Orithyia (4 species)\n* Tulipa (52 species)\n* Eriostemones (16 species)\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word ''tulip'', first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], first appeared in English as ''tulipa'' or ''tulipant'', entering the language by way of {{lang-fr|tulipe}} and its obsolete form ''tulipan'' or by way of Modern Latin ''tulipa'', from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''t\u00fclbend'' (\"[[muslin]]\" or \"[[gauze]]\"), and may be ultimately derived from the {{lang-fa|\u062f\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f}} ''delband'' (\"[[Turban]]\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tulip&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Tulip |website=Etymplogy Online |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref> This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans.

In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the [[Balkans]]. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is the Ukraine.{{sfn|King|2005|p=16}} Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from [[Anatolia]] and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (''see map''). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.{{sfn|Marais|1984}} These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.{{sfn|Hall|1940}}{{sfn|Eker et al|2014}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\nTulips are indigenous to [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climate]]s, where they are a common element of [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppe]] and winter-rain [[Mediterranean vegetation]].

While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists\u2019 techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed.

Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as [[vernalization|vernalisation]]. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20\u201325\u2009\u00b0C), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (<10\u2009\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rietveld|first=Patrick L.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Clare|date=March 2000|title=Low temperature sensing in tulip (Tulipa gesneriana L.) is mediated through an increased response to auxin|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=51|issue=344|pages=587\u2013594|doi=10.1093/jexbot/51.344.587|pmid=10938815|doi-access=free}}</ref> Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\n\nThe colour of tulip flowers also vary with growing conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Nard|first=M.|last2=Biot|first2=E.|date=1997|title=MEASUREMENT OF COLOUR VARIATION OF TULIP FLOWERS GROWN IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS|url=https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=430_133|journal=International Society for Horticultural Science|volume=10|pages=837\u2013842|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n===History===\n\n====Islamic World====\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 717) (8447528823).jpg|thumb|upright|''Tulipa sylvestris'' subsp.

After he was appointed the director of the [[Leiden University]]'s newly established [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]], he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the [[Netherlands]], despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in [[Antwerp]] and [[Amsterdam]] two or three decades earlier.

N''ouveaux riches'' seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it a special \u2018aura\u2019 of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower.

''Tulipa \u00d7gesneriana'' is in itself an early hybrid of complex origin and is probably not the same taxon as was described by [[Conrad Gessner]] in the 16th century.{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\n====Introduction to the United States====\n[[File:The_Dallas_Arboretum_and_Botanical_Garden.jpg|thumb|The [[Dallas]] Arboretum and Botanical Garden]]\nIt is believed the first tulips in the [[United States]] were grown near [[Spring Pond]] at the Fay Estate in [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]]. From 1847 to 1865, Richard Sullivan Fay, Esq., one of Lynn's wealthiest men, settled on {{convert|500|acre|km2}} located partly in present-day Lynn and partly in present-day Salem. Mr. Fay imported many different trees and plants from all parts of the world and planted them among the meadows of the Fay Estate.<ref>The Daily Item, Lynn, Mass.

Seeds are most often used to propagate [[species]] and [[subspecies]] or to create new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]. Many tulip species can [[cross-pollination|cross-pollinate]] with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]].\n\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually [[Topping (agriculture)|topped]] using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\n\nBecause of the fact that tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct. Unlike other flowers that do not suffer this same limitation, the Tulip's historical forms do not survive alongside their modern incarnations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Horticultural classification===\n[[File:Tulip Gavota.jpg|thumb|'Gavota', a division 3 cultivar]]\n[[File:Yonina Tulip.jpg|thumb|'Yonina', a division 6 cultivar]]\n[[File:Kvetouc\u00ed tulip\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|'Texas Flame', a division 10 cultivar]]\nIn horticulture, tulips are divided into fifteen groups (Divisions) mostly based on flower morphology and plant size.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brickell |first1=Christopher |first2=Judith D. |last2=Zuk |year=1997 |title=The American Horticultural Society A\u2013Z encyclopedia of garden plants |location=New York, N.Y. |publisher=DK Pub. |isbn=978-0-7894-1943-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanhorticul00chri/page/1028 1028] |url=https://archive.org/details/americanhorticul00chri/page/1028 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theplantexpert.com/springbulbs/TulipIntro.html |title=Tulips |publisher=The Plant Expert |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref>\n*'''Div. 1: Single early''' \u2013 with cup-shaped single flowers, no larger than 8&nbsp;cm across (3&nbsp;inches).

The history of naturalisation is unknown, but populations are usually associated with agricultural practices and are possibly linked to [[saffron]] cultivation{{Clarify|date=January 2014}}. Some neo-tulipae have been brought into cultivation, and are often offered as botanical tulips.

Tulips should be planted {{convert|4|to|6|in|cm}} apart from each other. The recommended hole depth is {{convert|4|to|8|in|cm}} deep, and is measured from the top of the bulb to the surface. Therefore, larger tulip bulbs would require deeper holes.

In the poem ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' by [[Sa'di (poet)|Musharrifu'd-din Saadi]], described a visionary garden paradise with \"The murmur of a cool stream / bird song, ripe fruit in plenty / bright multicoloured tulips and fragrant roses...\"{{sfn|Pavord|1999|p=31}} In recent times, tulips have featured in the poems of [[Simin Behbahani]].\n\nTulips are called ''lale'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (from [[Persian language|Persian]]: \"laleh\" \u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647). When written in Arabic letters, \"lale\" has the same letters as ''Allah'', which is why the flower became a holy symbol. It was also associated with the House of [[Ottoman dynasty|Osman]], resulting in tulips being widely used in decorative motifs on tiles, mosques, fabrics, crockery, etc. in the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}} The tulip was seen as a symbol of abundance and indulgence. The era during which the Ottoman Empire was wealthiest is often called the [[Tulip era]] or ''Lale Devri'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].\n\nThe shape of [[emblem of Iran]] is chosen to resemble a tulip, in memory of the people who died for Iran. According to Iranian folklore, when a martyr dies, a red tulip grows from where he has fallen.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nTulips became popular garden plants in east and west, but, whereas the tulip in Turkish culture was a [[symbol]] of [[paradise]] on earth and had almost a divine status, in the Netherlands it represented the briefness of life.{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\n''[[The Black Tulip]]'' is a historical romance by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]. The story takes place in the Dutch city of [[Haarlem]], where a reward is offered to the first grower who can produce a truly black tulip.\n\nWhile tulips can be bred to display a wide variety of colours, black tulips have historically been difficult to achieve. The Queen of the Night tulip is as close to black as a flower gets, though it is, in fact, a dark and glossy maroonish purple - nonetheless, an effect prized by the Dutch.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe first truly black tulip was bred in 1986 by a Dutch flower grower in Bovenkarspel, Netherlands. The specimen was created by cross-breeding two deep purple tulips, the Queen of the Night and Wienerwald tulips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/20/Worlds-first-black-tulip-grown-in-Holland/4964509259600/|title=World's first black tulip grown in Holland|date=United Press International Archives|website=United Press International|archive-url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/20/Worlds-first-black-tulip-grown-in-Holland/4964509259600/|archive-date=Feb 20, 1986|url-status=|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Semper Augustus was the most expensive tulip during tulip mania. \u201cThe colour is white, with Carmine on a blue base, and with an unbroken flame right to the top\u201d \u2013 wrote Nicolas van Wassenaer in 1624 after seeing the tulip in the garden of one Dr Adriaen Pauw, a director of the new East India Company. With limited specimens in existence at the time and most owned by Pauw, his refusal to sell any flowers, despite wildly escalating offers, is believed by some to have sparked the mania.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy contrast to other flowers such as the coneflower or lotus, tulips have historically been capable of genetically reinventing themselves to suit changes in aesthetic values. In his 1597 herbal, John Gerard says of the tulip that \u201cnature seems to play more with this flower than with any other that I do know.\u201d When in the Netherlands, beauty was defined by marbleized swirls of vivid contrasting colours, the petals of tulips were able to become \"feathered\" and \"flamed.\" However, in the 19th century, when the English desired tulips for carpet bedding and massing, the tulips were able to once again accommodate this by evolving into \u201cpaint filled boxes with the brightest, fattest dabs of pure pigment.\u201d This inherent mutability of the tulip even led the Ottoman Turks to believe that nature cherished this flower above all others.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Tulip is also viewed prominently in a number of the Major Arcana cards of the Oswald Wirth Tarot deck.

The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the [[tepals]] (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily [[family (biology)|family]], [[Liliaceae]], along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to ''[[Amana (plant)|Amana]]'', ''[[Erythronium]]'' and ''[[Gagea]]'' in the tribe [[Lilieae]]. There are about 75 [[species]], and these are divided among four [[subgenera]]. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a [[Persian language|Persian]] word for [[turban]], which it may have been thought to resemble. Tulips originally were found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to [[Central Asia]], but since the seventeenth century have become widely [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] and cultivated (''see map''). In their natural state they are adapted to [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppes]] and [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climates]]. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\n\nTulips grew wild in the [[Tien Shan]] Mountains and were cultivated in Istanbul in 1055. In the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; the flower was the symbol of the Ottomans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/|title=There Never Was a Real Tulip Fever|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> While tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the tenth century, they did not come to the attention of the West until the sixteenth century, when Western diplomats to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court observed and reported on them.  They were rapidly introduced into Europe and became a frenzied commodity during [[Tulip mania]]. Tulips were frequently depicted in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth century Netherlands, during the time of the Tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the [[tulip breaking virus]] created [[variegation|variegated]] patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips do not exist anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the  group known as the Rembrandts \u2013 so named because [[Rembrandt]] painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBreeding programs have produced thousands of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] and [[cultivar]]s in addition to the original species (known in [[horticulture]] as botanical tulips).  They are popular throughout the world, both as [[ornamental garden plants]] and as [[cut flowers]].\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| header    = Tulip [[plant morphology|morphology]]\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 130\n| image1    = Tulipa fringed - burgundy lace - bulbs.jpg\n| caption1  = '''[[Bulbs]]''', showing [[tunica (biology)|tunic]] and scales\n| alt1      = Collection of tulip bulbs, some sliced to show interior scales\n| image2    = Tulipa orphanidea 060506.jpg\n| caption2  = Cup-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa orphanidea]]''\n| alt2      = Flower of Tulipa orphanidea, showing cup shape\n| image3    = Tulip Tulipa clusiana 'Lady Jane' Rock Ledge Flower 2000px.jpg\n| caption3  = Star-shaped flower of ''[[Tulipa clusiana]]'' with three [[sepals]] and three [[petals]], forming six identical [[tepals]]\n| alt3      = Photograph of Tulipa clusiana, showing six identical tepals (petals and sepals)\n}}\n''Tulipa'' (tulips) is a genus of spring-blooming [[perennial]] [[herbaceous]] [[bulb]]iferous [[geophytes]], dying back after flowering to an underground storage bulb.  Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between {{convert|4|in|cm}} and {{convert|28|in|cm}} high.\n\n[[Flowers]]: The tulip's flowers are usually large and are [[actinomorphic]] (radially symmetric) and [[hermaphrodite]] (contain both male ([[androecium]]) and female ([[gynoecium]]) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely [[pendulous]], and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when [[pluriflor]] as two to three (e.g. ''[[Tulipa turkestanica]]''), but up to four, flowers on the end of a [[:wikt:floriferous|floriferous]] [[Plant stem|stem]] ([[scape (botany)|scape]]), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star shaped. As with other members of [[Liliaceae]] the [[perianth]] is undifferentiated ([[perigonium]]) and biseriate (two [[Whorl (botany)|whorled]]), formed from six free (i.e. [[perianth#Flowering plants|apotepalous]]) [[caducous]] [[tepals]] arranged into two separate whorls of three parts ([[Merosity|trimerous]]) each. The two whorls represent three [[petal]]s and three [[sepals]], but are termed [[tepal]]s because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Botany of Desire|last=Pollan|first=Michael|publisher=Random House|year=2002|isbn=0-375-76039-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95 95]|url=https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesire00poll/page/95}}</ref> Tulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent [[nectaries]].{{sfn|King|2005|p=164}}{{sfn|Tenenbaum|2003|p=395}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}{{sfn|Grey-Wilson|Matthews|1980}} Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters.

Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is [[glossary of botanical terms#cauline|cauline]] (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem.

Within Liliaceae, Tulipa is placed within [[Lilioideae]], one of three subfamilies, with two [[tribe (biology)|tribes]]. Tribe [[Lilieae]] includes seven other genera in addition to Tulipa.\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n\nThe genus, which includes about 75 [[species]], is divided into four [[subgenera]].{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n* Clusianae (4 species)\n* Orithyia (4 species)\n* Tulipa (52 species)\n* Eriostemones (16 species)\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word ''tulip'', first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], first appeared in English as ''tulipa'' or ''tulipant'', entering the language by way of {{lang-fr|tulipe}} and its obsolete form ''tulipan'' or by way of Modern Latin ''tulipa'', from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''t\u00fclbend'' (\"[[muslin]]\" or \"[[gauze]]\"), and may be ultimately derived from the {{lang-fa|\u062f\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f}} ''delband'' (\"[[Turban]]\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tulip&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Tulip |website=Etymplogy Online |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}</ref> This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans.

From there it extends eastwards through [[Jerevan]], (Armenia) and [[Baku]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) and on the eastern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]] through [[Turkmenistan]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Tashkent]] (Uzbekistan), to  the eastern end of the range in the [[Pamir-Alai]] and [[Tien-Shan]] mountains in [[Central Asia]], which form the [[centre of diversity]].<ref name=pavord6/> Further to the east, ''Tulipa'' is found in the western [[Himalayas]], southern [[Siberia]], Inner Mongolia, and as far as the northwest of China. While authorities have stated that no tulips west of the Balkans are native,{{sfn|Marais|1984}} subsequent identification of ''[[Tulipa sylvestris]]'' [[subsp.]] ''australis'' as a native of the [[Iberian peninsula]] and adjacent [[North Africa]] shows that this may be a simplification. In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the [[Balkans]]. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is the Ukraine.{{sfn|King|2005|p=16}} Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from [[Anatolia]] and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (''see map''). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.{{sfn|Marais|1984}} These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.{{sfn|Hall|1940}}{{sfn|Eker et al|2014}}{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2013}}\n\nTulips are indigenous to [[mountainous]] areas with [[temperate climate]]s, where they are a common element of [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|steppe]] and winter-rain [[Mediterranean vegetation]].

While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists\u2019 techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed. Today the virus is almost eradicated from tulip growers' fields.

Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as [[vernalization|vernalisation]]. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20\u201325\u2009\u00b0C), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (<10\u2009\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rietveld|first=Patrick L.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Clare|date=March 2000|title=Low temperature sensing in tulip (Tulipa gesneriana L.) is mediated through an increased response to auxin|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=51|issue=344|pages=587\u2013594|doi=10.1093/jexbot/51.344.587|pmid=10938815|doi-access=free}}</ref> Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\n\nThe colour of tulip flowers also vary with growing conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Nard|first=M.|last2=Biot|first2=E.|date=1997|title=MEASUREMENT OF COLOUR VARIATION OF TULIP FLOWERS GROWN IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS|url=https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=430_133|journal=International Society for Horticultural Science|volume=10|pages=837\u2013842|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n===History===\n\n====Islamic World====\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 717) (8447528823).jpg|thumb|upright|''Tulipa sylvestris'' subsp.

[[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]] illustrated a tulip in 1565 but identified it as a [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]].\n\n[[Carolus Clusius]] is largely responsible for the spread of tulip bulbs in the final years of the sixteenth century. He planted tulips at the Vienna Imperial Botanical Gardens in 1573. He finished the first major work on tulips in 1592 and made note of the variations in colour. After he was appointed the director of the [[Leiden University]]'s newly established [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]], he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the [[Netherlands]], despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in [[Antwerp]] and [[Amsterdam]] two or three decades earlier. These tulips at Leiden would eventually lead to both the [[tulip mania]] and the tulip industry in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/magazine/how-a-turkish-blossom-enflamed-the-dutch-landscape.html |title=How A Turkish Blossom Enflamed the Dutch Landscape |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-03-04 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> Over two raids, in 1596 and in 1598, more than one hundred bulbs were stolen from his garden.\n\nTulips spread rapidly across Europe and more opulent varieties such as double tulips were already known in Europe by the early 17th century. These curiosities fitted well in an age when natural oddities were cherished and especially in the Netherlands, France, Germany and England, where the spice trade with the East Indies had made many people wealthy. N''ouveaux riches'' seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it a special \u2018aura\u2019 of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower. An export business was built up in France, supplying Dutch, Flemish, German and English buyers.

Tulip bulbs had become so expensive that they were treated as a form of currency, or rather, as futures, forcing the Dutch government to introduce trading restrictions on the bulbs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Around this time, the [[ceramic]] [[tulipiere]] was devised for the display of cut flowers stem by stem. Vases and bouquets, usually including tulips, often appeared in [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Still lives|Dutch still-life painting]]. To this day, tulips are associated with the Netherlands, and the cultivated forms of the tulip are often called \"Dutch tulips.\" The Netherlands has the world's largest permanent display of tulips at the [[Keukenhof]].\n\nThe majority of tulip cultivars are classified in the taxon ''[[Tulipa \u00d7gesneriana]]''. They have usually several species in their direct background, but most have been derived from ''[[Tulipa schrenkii|Tulipa suaveolens]]'' (today often regarded as a synonym with ''[[Tulipa schrenkii]]'').

Many tulip species can [[cross-pollination|cross-pollinate]] with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]].\n\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually [[Topping (agriculture)|topped]] using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\n\nBecause of the fact that tulip bulbs don't reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct.

When written in Arabic letters, \"lale\" has the same letters as ''Allah'', which is why the flower became a holy symbol.

They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member team of the league's [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyota Center]], located in [[Downtown Houston]]. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established in 1967 as the '''San Diego Rockets''', an [[expansion team]] originally based in [[San Diego]]. In 1971, the Rockets [[Relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Houston.\n\nThe Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the [[1968 NBA draft]], the Rockets were awarded the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] and selected power forward [[Elvin Hayes]], who would lead the team to its [[1969 NBA playoffs|first playoff appearance]] in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] center [[Moses Malone]]. Malone went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award twice while playing with the Rockets and led Houston to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] in [[1976\u201377 NBA season|his first year]] with the team. During the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record. Despite their losing record, they qualified for the [[1981 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Led by Malone, the Rockets stunned the entire league by making their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], becoming only the second team in NBA history to make the NBA Finals with a losing record. They would lose in six games to the 62\u201320 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]], [[Robert Parish]], and future Rockets' head coach [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. {{As of|2019}}, the [[1980\u201381 Houston Rockets season|1980\u201381 Rockets]] are the last team since the [[1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers season|1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers]] to make it all the way to the NBA Finals with a losing record.\n\nIn the [[1984 NBA draft]], once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with {{convert|7|ft|4|inch|m}} [[Ralph Sampson]], they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the [[1986 NBA Finals]]\u2014the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014where Houston was again defeated by Larry Bird and the 67-win Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second round defeat to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in [[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]]. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a franchise record 58 wins and went to the [[1994 NBA Finals]]\u2014the third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014and won the franchise's first championship against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. During the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], reinforced by another All-Star, [[Clyde Drexler]], the Rockets\u2014in their fourth NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014repeated as champions with a four-game [[Whitewash (sport)|sweep]] of the [[Orlando Magic]], who were led by a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]]. Houston, which finished the season with a 47\u201335 record and was seeded sixth in the Western Conference during the 1995 playoffs, became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.\n\nThe Rockets acquired all-star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Charles Barkley]] in 1996, but the presence of three of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time]] (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Yao Ming]], followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The acquisition of franchise player [[James Harden]] in 2012 has launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s.\n\n[[Moses Malone]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[James Harden]] have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, under general manager [[Daryl Morey]], are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to [[sabermetrics]] in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Houston Rockets}}\n\n===1967\u20131971: San Diego Rockets===\n[[File:Elvin Hayes.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Elvin Hayes]] was selected first overall by the San Diego Rockets in the 1968 NBA Draft.]]\nThe Rockets were founded in 1967 in [[San Diego]] by Robert Breitbard, who paid an entry fee of US$1.75&nbsp;million to join the NBA as an expansion team for the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]].<ref name=\"chronhistory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Owners-fans-waited-years-before-Rockets-took-off-2045395.php|title=Owners, fans waited years before Rockets took off|work=Houston Chronicle|date=September 20, 2001|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=uniforms>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |title=Going Retro: Houston Rockets |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119064025/http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The NBA wanted to add more teams in the [[Western United States]], and chose San Diego based on the city's strong economic and population growth, along with the local success of an [[ice hockey]] team owned by Breitbard, the [[San Diego Gulls (1966\u201374)|San Diego Gulls]].

Road uniforms featured the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block lettering. This was the only uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.<ref name=breitbard/>\n\nUpon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red.<ref name=uniforms/> They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name. The logo used is of a player with a spinning basketball launching upward, with boosters on his back, leaving a trail of red and gold flames and the words \"Houston Rockets\" below it.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFor the 1972\u201373 season, the Rockets introduced the famous \"ketchup and mustard\" logo, so dubbed by fans, featuring a gold basketball surrounded by two red trails, with \"Houston\" atop the first red trail and \"Rockets\" (all [[capitalization|capitalized]] save for the lowercase 'E' and 'T') in black surrounding the basketball. The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975\u201376 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nIn the 1976\u201377 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the [[Cooper Black]] fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location. With minor modifications in the number font, this version was used in all four of their NBA Finals appearances, including their {{nbafy|1994}} and {{nbafy|1995}} championships.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFollowing the 1995 title, the Rockets opted to modernize their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team went with the idea of [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]] artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill.<ref name=\"Barron, David\"/> Nash would later sue the Rockets for [[breach of contract]], given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/06/27/Franchises/ROCKETS-WIN-LOGO-SUIT-BUT-STILL-MAY-HAVE-TO-PAY-ARTIST.aspx|title=Rockets Win Logo Suit But Still May Have to Pay Artist|date=June 27, 1997|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120061258/http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archivedate=November 20, 2015|title=Nash v.

They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member team of the league's [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyota Center]], located in [[Downtown Houston]]. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established in 1967 as the '''San Diego Rockets''', an [[expansion team]] originally based in [[San Diego]]. In 1971, the Rockets [[Relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Houston.\n\nThe Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the [[1968 NBA draft]], the Rockets were awarded the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] and selected power forward [[Elvin Hayes]], who would lead the team to its [[1969 NBA playoffs|first playoff appearance]] in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] center [[Moses Malone]]. Malone went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award twice while playing with the Rockets and led Houston to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] in [[1976\u201377 NBA season|his first year]] with the team. During the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record. Despite their losing record, they qualified for the [[1981 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Led by Malone, the Rockets stunned the entire league by making their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], becoming only the second team in NBA history to make the NBA Finals with a losing record. They would lose in six games to the 62\u201320 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]], [[Robert Parish]], and future Rockets' head coach [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. {{As of|2019}}, the [[1980\u201381 Houston Rockets season|1980\u201381 Rockets]] are the last team since the [[1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers season|1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers]] to make it all the way to the NBA Finals with a losing record.\n\nIn the [[1984 NBA draft]], once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with {{convert|7|ft|4|inch|m}} [[Ralph Sampson]], they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the [[1986 NBA Finals]]\u2014the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014where Houston was again defeated by Larry Bird and the 67-win Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second round defeat to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in [[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]]. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a franchise record 58 wins and went to the [[1994 NBA Finals]]\u2014the third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014and won the franchise's first championship against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. During the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], reinforced by another All-Star, [[Clyde Drexler]], the Rockets\u2014in their fourth NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014repeated as champions with a four-game [[Whitewash (sport)|sweep]] of the [[Orlando Magic]], who were led by a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]]. Houston, which finished the season with a 47\u201335 record and was seeded sixth in the Western Conference during the 1995 playoffs, became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.\n\nThe Rockets acquired all-star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Charles Barkley]] in 1996, but the presence of three of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time]] (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Yao Ming]], followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The acquisition of franchise player [[James Harden]] in 2012 has launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s.\n\n[[Moses Malone]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[James Harden]] have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, under general manager [[Daryl Morey]], are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to [[sabermetrics]] in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Houston Rockets}}\n\n===1967\u20131971: San Diego Rockets===\n[[File:Elvin Hayes.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Elvin Hayes]] was selected first overall by the San Diego Rockets in the 1968 NBA Draft.]]\nThe Rockets were founded in 1967 in [[San Diego]] by Robert Breitbard, who paid an entry fee of US$1.75&nbsp;million to join the NBA as an expansion team for the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]].<ref name=\"chronhistory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Owners-fans-waited-years-before-Rockets-took-off-2045395.php|title=Owners, fans waited years before Rockets took off|work=Houston Chronicle|date=September 20, 2001|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=uniforms>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |title=Going Retro: Houston Rockets |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119064025/http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The NBA wanted to add more teams in the [[Western United States]], and chose San Diego based on the city's strong economic and population growth, along with the local success of an [[ice hockey]] team owned by Breitbard, the [[San Diego Gulls (1966\u201374)|San Diego Gulls]].

Road uniforms featured the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block lettering. This was the only uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.<ref name=breitbard/>\n\nUpon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red.<ref name=uniforms/> They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name. The logo used is of a player with a spinning basketball launching upward, with boosters on his back, leaving a trail of red and gold flames and the words \"Houston Rockets\" below it.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFor the 1972\u201373 season, the Rockets introduced the famous \"ketchup and mustard\" logo, so dubbed by fans, featuring a gold basketball surrounded by two red trails, with \"Houston\" atop the first red trail and \"Rockets\" (all [[capitalization|capitalized]] save for the lowercase 'E' and 'T') in black surrounding the basketball. The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975\u201376 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nIn the 1976\u201377 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the [[Cooper Black]] fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location. With minor modifications in the number font, this version was used in all four of their NBA Finals appearances, including their {{nbafy|1994}} and {{nbafy|1995}} championships.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFollowing the 1995 title, the Rockets opted to modernize their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team went with the idea of [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]] artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill.<ref name=\"Barron, David\"/> Nash would later sue the Rockets for [[breach of contract]], given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/06/27/Franchises/ROCKETS-WIN-LOGO-SUIT-BUT-STILL-MAY-HAVE-TO-PAY-ARTIST.aspx|title=Rockets Win Logo Suit But Still May Have to Pay Artist|date=June 27, 1997|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120061258/http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archivedate=November 20, 2015|title=Nash v.

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref name=wormssales>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | url=http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | title=Sales of ''Worms'' skyrockets | author=Staff | date=March 1996 | archivedate=October 18, 1996 | work=[[Computer Game Review]] | url-status=dead }}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=retrogamer>{{cite journal | author=Day, Ashley | title=The Making of... ''Worms'' | journal=[[Retro Gamer]] | issue=23 | date=April 2006 | pages=26\u201329 }}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref name=wormssales>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | url=http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | title=Sales of ''Worms'' skyrockets | author=Staff | date=March 1996 | archivedate=October 18, 1996 | work=[[Computer Game Review]] | url-status=dead }}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=retrogamer>{{cite journal | author=Day, Ashley | title=The Making of... ''Worms'' | journal=[[Retro Gamer]] | issue=23 | date=April 2006 | pages=26\u201329 }}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)"}
