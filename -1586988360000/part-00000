It is named for [[South Carolina]] General, and later Governor, [[William Moultrie]]. General Moultrie defended [[Sullivan's Island]], South Carolina from British attack in 1776. The site was later renamed [[Fort Moultrie]]. Nearby [[Jasper County, Illinois|Jasper County]] was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]], another hero of the defense of Sullivan's Island.\n\nThe official flag of the county is the [[Moultrie Flag]], which was flown over the new fortress on Sullivan's Island, when Moultrie defended it, and was designed by Moultrie. It went on to become iconic of liberty in the South.\n\nWhen Abraham Kellar of Lovington, John Cook of Marrowbone, and John Fleming of Nelson proposed the formation of a new county from Macon, Shelby, and Coles counties, Macon gave up a strip of \u201cworthless swamp\u201d that is now among the most fertile land in the world, but Shelby and Coles voters refused to give up any land. Finally, Shelby County gave up some of its land to make a zig-zag border with Moultrie County.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Moultrie County Illinois 1843.png|Moultrie County at the time of its creation in 1843\nFile:Flag of Fort Moultrie, South Carolina.svg|Moultrie Flag, the official flag of the county\nFile:Battle_of_Sullivans_Island.jpg|The Moultrie Flag being raised by Sergeant William Jasper\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|344|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|336|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.5|sqmi}} (2.5%) is water.<ref name=CD/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Sullivan, Illinois]]\n|19|34|1.99\n|24|41|1.89\n|33|52|3.30\n|43|65|3.70\n|53|75|3.99\n|62|83|4.05\n|66|87|4.00\n|63|85|3.27\n|56|80|3.05\n|45|68|3.07\n|35|52|3.85\n|24|39|2.98\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=WX>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL1139|title=Monthly Averages for Sullivan IL|accessdate=27 January 2011|publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Sullivan have ranged from a low of {{convert|19|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|87|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-26|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1915 and a record high of {{convert|111|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1936.

It is named for [[South Carolina]] General, and later Governor, [[William Moultrie]]. General Moultrie defended [[Sullivan's Island]], South Carolina from British attack in 1776. The site was later renamed [[Fort Moultrie]]. Nearby [[Jasper County, Illinois|Jasper County]] was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]], another hero of the defense of Sullivan's Island.\n\nThe official flag of the county is the [[Moultrie Flag]], which was flown over the new fortress on Sullivan's Island, when Moultrie defended it, and was designed by Moultrie. It went on to become iconic of liberty in the South.\n\nWhen Abraham Kellar of Lovington, John Cook of Marrowbone, and John Fleming of Nelson proposed the formation of a new county from Macon, Shelby, and Coles counties, Macon gave up a strip of \u201cworthless swamp\u201d that is now among the most fertile land in the world, but Shelby and Coles voters refused to give up any land. Finally, Shelby County gave up some of its land to make a zig-zag border with Moultrie County.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Moultrie County Illinois 1843.png|Moultrie County at the time of its creation in 1843\nFile:Flag of Fort Moultrie, South Carolina.svg|Moultrie Flag, the official flag of the county\nFile:Battle_of_Sullivans_Island.jpg|The Moultrie Flag being raised by Sergeant William Jasper\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|344|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|336|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.5|sqmi}} (2.5%) is water.<ref name=CD/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Sullivan, Illinois]]\n|19|34|1.99\n|24|41|1.89\n|33|52|3.30\n|43|65|3.70\n|53|75|3.99\n|62|83|4.05\n|66|87|4.00\n|63|85|3.27\n|56|80|3.05\n|45|68|3.07\n|35|52|3.85\n|24|39|2.98\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=WX>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL1139|title=Monthly Averages for Sullivan IL|accessdate=27 January 2011|publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Sullivan have ranged from a low of {{convert|19|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|87|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-26|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1915 and a record high of {{convert|111|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1936.
