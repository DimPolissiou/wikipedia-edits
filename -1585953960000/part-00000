The town has a population of 252,530 within an area of 4.8 km<sup>2</sup>. It is the [[Regional centre (Singapore)|regional centre]] for the North Region of the city-state. The Woodlands planning area borders [[Sembawang]] to the east, [[Mandai]] to the south and [[Sungei Kadut]] to the west. Woodlands New Town is situated within the Woodlands planning area.\n\n==History==\n===British administration===\n\nThe area consisting of modern-day Woodlands Town first witnessed the opening of the [[Johor-Singapore Causeway]] in 1923. Early Woodlands consisted of villages where residents made their living mostly as small-time shopkeepers and vegetable farmers in the [[Marsiling]] area, while rubber plantations and poultry farms dot the landscape at where modern-day [[Admiralty, Singapore|Admiralty]] is located. \n\n===Post-independence===\n\nThe first [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] flats were built from 1972 in the northern part of Marsiling, and the Woodlands Bus Interchange located at Woodlands Centre Road was built in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jalelah Abu Baker|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/st/print/1175465|title=This used to be my playground|page=B14, Home section|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1988, Woodlands was divided into [[Bukit Panjang SMC]] and Sembawang SMC, before it was merged in 1991 into [[Sembawang GRC]] in the sense of growing development.\n\nThe development of Woodlands began in 1981. This comprises the building of HDB flats in the Neighbourhood 1, which was completed in 1985; well after the Marsiling Estate. The Neighbourhood 8 was completed in 1987, together with the Neighbourhood 3 in 1989. Because of the saturation of HDB flats, the numbering system added 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Blocks 6xx in Admiralty begun to be completed in 1996, together with the 7xx in 1997. Expansion into Innova began in 1998 and was completed in 2002, which consists of block 5xx. Expansion into the Woodlands East began in 1999 and completed in 2004.\n\nThe Jalan Ulu Sembawang is a kampong road that cut across parts of the Woodlands New Town and the Sembawang Airbase. Starting from June 1992, the Jalan Ulu Sembawang is being cleared because of the extension of Woodlands New Town, Gambas Avenue, Sembawang Airbase and the Seletar Expressway.

Most of the bus routes are operated by [[SMRT Buses]], while [[SMRT Trains]] operates the train stations.\n\nLand transportation in Woodlands is relatively efficient, contrasting by the amount of well-maintained roads, though a common sight in Singapore. Twelve avenues support and help circulate all of the traffic of the town, especially the notable ones, such as Avenue 2, Avenue 3 and Avenue 7, which come from the expressways.\n\n'''Woodlands Avenue 2''' is a shorter route from the older estates of the town to the [[Seletar Expressway]]. To connect the Woodlands Avenue 2 into the Seletar Expressway, part of the road was being built since 1998. SBS Services 161 and 168 plies along the shorter route of Woodlands Avenue 2.\n\n'''Woodlands Avenue 3''' connects Marsiling from the exit of [[Bukit Timah Expressway]] to Woodlands Centre Road, which leads to Woodlands Checkpoint. The rest of it maintains a similar route of the MRT line, which connects to Woodlands Square.\n\nAs the avenue ends at the entrance of the slope of Woodlands Square (the road that circulates Woodlands Square), another end starts at '''Woodlands Avenue 7''', which connects Woodlands to Admiralty, also along the route of the MRT line, ending at Gambas Avenue.\n\n''Divisions'' within estates are further connected and regulated by two- or single lane roads called ''streets,'' which are distinguished by a suffix of double-digit numbers, such as Woodlands Street 82 and Woodlands Street 83. This was a common practice before the late '90s. ''Drives'' are two- or single lane roads built for newer divisions within an estate, similar to that of the streets.\n\n''Links'' and ''Crescents'' are often three-, two-, or single-lane roads that convey commuters from the main road to another main road, such as the Woodlands Link, which connects Woodlands Avenue 9 to the main roads in the Woodlands Industrial Park. ''Crescents'' connect main roads to streets or drives.\n\n===Rail===\nResidents of Woodlands are currently serviced by five [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) stations: [[Woodlands MRT station]] in the centre, [[Woodlands North MRT station]] in the north, [[Woodlands South MRT station]] in the south, [[Marsiling MRT station]] to the west, and [[Admiralty MRT station]] to the east. The [[Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange]] has been relocated from the previous Woodlands Town Centre to the current town centre at Woodlands Square, and temporarily relocated to outside Woodlands Square.\n\nA planned rapid transit link, the [[Johor Bahru\u2013Singapore Rapid Transit System]], will have its Singapore terminus at Woodlands North, improving access between Johor Bahru and Singapore.\n\n==Future plans==\nAccording to the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] and its Master Plan for the North Region, the Woodlands Regional Centre is set to become the \"Northern Gateway\" of Singapore. Featuring some 700,000m\u00b2 of new commercial space and more than 100 hectares of land that will be developed, the growth of the Woodlands Regional Centre will anchor the development of the North Coast Innovation Corridor. More commercial and shopping options will progressively be made available in the Woodlands Central, with a future pedestrian mall running through the heart of the district. As a significant employment cluster, the Woodlands North Coast will bring jobs and commercial opportunities closer to home for residents of the North Region. A new waterfront park will be built to connect the two districts of Woodlands Central and Woodlands North Coast. More park connectors and cycling paths will be built to connect to the 150&nbsp;km Round Island Route and Rail Corridor.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/master-plan/View-Master-Plan/master-plan-2014/master-plan/Regional-highlights/north-region/north-region | title=North Region | publisher=Urban Redevelopment Authority | accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Singapore}}\n{{commons|Singapore#Woodlands}}\n* [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]]\n* [[Places in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040829135310/http://www.northwest-cdc.org.sg/ North West Community Development Council]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709021228/http://www.sembawangtc.org.sg/ Sembawang Town Council]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050308120707/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/parks/loc/par-loc-woo_tow_gdn.shtml Woodlands Town Park]\n* [http://www.rp.edu.sg Republic Polytechnic]\n* [http://www.sportsschool.edu.sg Singapore Sports School]\n* [http://www.sas.edu.sg Singapore American School]\n* [http://hdbteamwoodlands.myweb.sg HDB Team Woodlands]\n\n{{Places in Singapore}}\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring areas'''\n|Northwest = [[Southern Integrated Gateway]]\n|North     = [[Stulang]]\n|Northeast = [[Permas Jaya]]\n|West      = [[Kranji]]\n|Centre    = Woodlands\n|East      = [[Sembawang]]\n|Southwest = [[Bukit Timah Expressway]]\n|South     = [[Mandai]]\n|Southeast = [[Sembawang Airbase]]\n}}\n{{Singapore border crossings|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Places in Singapore]]\n[[Category:New towns in Singapore]]\n[[Category:North Region, Singapore]]\n[[Category:Woodlands, Singapore| ]]\n[[Category:Malaysia\u2013Singapore border crossings]]\n[[Category:New towns started in the 1980s]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{About|a town in Singapore|other towns with similar or exact names in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]]|Woodlands (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name = Woodlands\n| settlement_type = [[Planning Areas of Singapore|Planning Area]] and [[Regional centre (Singapore)|Regional Centre]]\n| translit_lang1 = Other\n| image_skyline = {{Photomontage\n| photo1a = RepublicPolytechnic-CulturalCentre-20070205.jpg\n| photo2a = Si Ling Secondary School, Oct 06.jpg\n| photo2b = MarsilingMRT.JPG\n| photo3a = Tel-Woodlands-Platform.jpg\n| photo4a = SMRT bus service 911 in front of Block 878 Woodlands Street 82, Singapore.jpg \n| photo4b = HDB flats along Woodlands Avenue 4, Singapore.jpg\n| size = 280\n| spacing = 2\n| color = transparent\n| border = 0\n}}\n| image_caption = From top left to right:  [[Republic Polytechnic]], [[Si Ling Secondary School]], Woodlands Street 82,  [[Marsiling MRT station]], [[Woodlands MRT station]], Woodlands Street 82, [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] flats along Woodlands Avenue 4\n| image_map                       = {{maplink|frame=yes|plain=yes|type=shape|stroke-width=2|stroke-color=#000000|zoom=14|frame-latitude=1.4382|frame-longitude=103.7890}}\n| map_caption                     = Location of Woodlands in Singapore\n| pushpin_map                     = #Singapore#Asia#Earth\n| pushpin_mapsize                 = 300px\n| pushpin_map_caption             = {{Legend inline|#CC0000|outline=black}} '''Woodlands''' in {{Legend inline|#FEFEEF|outline=black}} '''[[Singapore]]'''\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|1|26|10.57|N|103|47|12.14|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type = Country\n| subdivision_name = {{flag|Singapore}}\n| subdivision_type1 = Region\n| subdivision_type2 = [[Community Development Council|CDC]]\n| subdivision_type3 = Town councils\n| subdivision_type4 = [[Constituencies of Singapore|Constituencies]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[North Region, Singapore|North Region]]\n----\n| subdivision_name2 = * [[North West Community Development Council|North West CDC]]\n| subdivision_name3 = * Marsiling-Yew Tee Town Council\n* Sembawang Town Council\n| subdivision_name4 = * [[Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency|Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC]]\n* [[Sembawang Group Representation Constituency|Sembawang GRC]]\n| leader_title1 = Mayor\n| leader_name1 = '''North West CDC'''\n* [[Teo Ho Pin]]\n----\n| area_footnotes = <ref name=citypopulation>[http://www.citypopulation.de/php/singapore-admin.php?adm1id=407 City Population -

The town has a population of 252,530 within an area of 4.8 km<sup>2</sup>. It is the [[Regional centre (Singapore)|regional centre]] for the North Region of the city-state. The Woodlands planning area borders [[Sembawang]] to the east, [[Mandai]] to the south and [[Sungei Kadut]] to the west. Woodlands New Town is situated within the Woodlands planning area.\n\n==History==\n===British administration===\n\nThe area consisting of modern-day Woodlands Town first witnessed the opening of the [[Johor-Singapore Causeway]] in 1923. Early Woodlands consisted of villages where residents made their living mostly as small-time shopkeepers and vegetable farmers in the [[Marsiling]] area, while rubber plantations and poultry farms dot the landscape at where modern-day [[Admiralty, Singapore|Admiralty]] is located. \n\n===Post-independence===\n\nThe first [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] flats were built from 1972 in the northern part of Marsiling, and the Woodlands Bus Interchange located at Woodlands Centre Road was built in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jalelah Abu Baker|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/st/print/1175465|title=This used to be my playground|page=B14, Home section|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1988, Woodlands was divided into [[Bukit Panjang SMC]] and Sembawang SMC, before it was merged in 1991 into [[Sembawang GRC]] in the sense of growing development.\n\nThe development of Woodlands began in 1981. This comprises the building of HDB flats in the Neighbourhood 1, which was completed in 1985; well after the Marsiling Estate. The Neighbourhood 8 was completed in 1987, together with the Neighbourhood 3 in 1989. Because of the saturation of HDB flats, the numbering system added 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Blocks 6xx in Admiralty begun to be completed in 1996, together with the 7xx in 1997. Expansion into Innova began in 1998 and was completed in 2002, which consists of block 5xx. Expansion into the Woodlands East began in 1999 and completed in 2004.\n\nThe Jalan Ulu Sembawang is a kampong road that cut across parts of the Woodlands New Town and the Sembawang Airbase. Starting from June 1992, the Jalan Ulu Sembawang is being cleared because of the extension of Woodlands New Town, Gambas Avenue, Sembawang Airbase and the Seletar Expressway. The kampong was being cleared by 1996 and it was being converted into a military training ground.\n\n==Neighbourhood layout==\nThere are three constituencies in the town, and nine neighbourhoods (N1 to N9) within the Woodlands vicinity made up primarily of Woodlands, [[Marsiling]], [[Woodlands, Singapore#Woodgrove|Woodgrove]] and [[Admiralty, Singapore|Admiralty]].

Most of the bus routes are operated by [[SMRT Buses]], while [[SMRT Trains]] operates the train stations.\n\nLand transportation in Woodlands is relatively efficient, contrasting by the amount of well-maintained roads, though a common sight in Singapore. Twelve avenues support and help circulate all of the traffic of the town, especially the notable ones, such as Avenue 2, Avenue 3 and Avenue 7, which come from the expressways.\n\n'''Woodlands Avenue 2''' is a shorter route from the older estates of the town to the [[Seletar Expressway]]. To connect the Woodlands Avenue 2 into the Seletar Expressway, part of the road was being built since 1998. SBS Services 161 and 168 plies along the shorter route of Woodlands Avenue 2.\n\n'''Woodlands Avenue 3''' connects Marsiling from the exit of [[Bukit Timah Expressway]] to Woodlands Centre Road, which leads to Woodlands Checkpoint. The rest of it maintains a similar route of the MRT line, which connects to Woodlands Square.\n\nAs the avenue ends at the entrance of the slope of Woodlands Square (the road that circulates Woodlands Square), another end starts at '''Woodlands Avenue 7''', which connects Woodlands to Admiralty, also along the route of the MRT line, ending at Gambas Avenue.\n\n''Divisions'' within estates are further connected and regulated by two- or single lane roads called ''streets,'' which are distinguished by a suffix of double-digit numbers, such as Woodlands Street 82 and Woodlands Street 83. This was a common practice before the late '90s. ''Drives'' are two- or single lane roads built for newer divisions within an estate, similar to that of the streets.\n\n''Links'' and ''Crescents'' are often three-, two-, or single-lane roads that convey commuters from the main road to another main road, such as the Woodlands Link, which connects Woodlands Avenue 9 to the main roads in the Woodlands Industrial Park. ''Crescents'' connect main roads to streets or drives.\n\n===Rail===\nResidents of Woodlands are currently serviced by five [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) stations: [[Woodlands MRT station]] in the centre, [[Woodlands North MRT station]] in the north, [[Woodlands South MRT station]] in the south, [[Marsiling MRT station]] to the west, and [[Admiralty MRT station]] to the east. The [[Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange]] has been relocated from the previous Woodlands Town Centre to the current town centre at Woodlands Square, and temporarily relocated to outside Woodlands Square.\n\nA planned rapid transit link, the [[Johor Bahru\u2013Singapore Rapid Transit System]], will have its Singapore terminus at Woodlands North, improving access between Johor Bahru and Singapore.\n\n==Future plans==\nAccording to the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] and its Master Plan for the North Region, the Woodlands Regional Centre is set to become the \"Northern Gateway\" of Singapore. Featuring some 700,000m\u00b2 of new commercial space and more than 100 hectares of land that will be developed, the growth of the Woodlands Regional Centre will anchor the development of the North Coast Innovation Corridor. More commercial and shopping options will progressively be made available in the Woodlands Central, with a future pedestrian mall running through the heart of the district. As a significant employment cluster, the Woodlands North Coast will bring jobs and commercial opportunities closer to home for residents of the North Region. A new waterfront park will be built to connect the two districts of Woodlands Central and Woodlands North Coast. More park connectors and cycling paths will be built to connect to the 150&nbsp;km Round Island Route and Rail Corridor.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/master-plan/View-Master-Plan/master-plan-2014/master-plan/Regional-highlights/north-region/north-region | title=North Region | publisher=Urban Redevelopment Authority | accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Singapore}}\n{{commons|Singapore#Woodlands}}\n* [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]]\n* [[Places in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040829135310/http://www.northwest-cdc.org.sg/ North West Community Development Council]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709021228/http://www.sembawangtc.org.sg/ Sembawang Town Council]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050308120707/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/parks/loc/par-loc-woo_tow_gdn.shtml Woodlands Town Park]\n* [http://www.rp.edu.sg Republic Polytechnic]\n* [http://www.sportsschool.edu.sg Singapore Sports School]\n* [http://www.sas.edu.sg Singapore American School]\n* [http://hdbteamwoodlands.myweb.sg HDB Team Woodlands]\n\n{{Places in Singapore}}\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring areas'''\n|Northwest = [[Southern Integrated Gateway]]\n|North     = [[Stulang]]\n|Northeast = [[Permas Jaya]]\n|West      = [[Kranji]]\n|Centre    = Woodlands\n|East      = [[Sembawang]]\n|Southwest = [[Bukit Timah Expressway]]\n|South     = [[Mandai]]\n|Southeast = [[Sembawang Airbase]]\n}}\n{{Singapore border crossings|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Places in Singapore]]\n[[Category:New towns in Singapore]]\n[[Category:North Region, Singapore]]\n[[Category:Woodlands, Singapore| ]]\n[[Category:Malaysia\u2013Singapore border crossings]]\n[[Category:New towns started in the 1980s]]\n", "name_user": "CCL-DTL", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodlands,_Singapore"}
