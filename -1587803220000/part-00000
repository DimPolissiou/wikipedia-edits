In early 1960, it became the first vessel to execute a submerged circumnavigation of the Earth in [[Operation Sandblast]]. ''Triton'' accomplished this objective during her [[shakedown cruise]] while under the command of Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Edward L. \"Ned\" Beach, Jr]]. She was the only member of her [[Ship class|class]] and had the distinction of being the only Western submarine powered by two nuclear reactors.\n\n''Triton'' was the second submarine and the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Greek god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]].  (The nomenclature being unusual in that U.S. Navy submarines, at that time, were usually named for fish.) At the time of her commissioning in 1959, ''Triton'' was the largest, most powerful, and most expensive submarine ever built at $109&nbsp;million excluding the cost of nuclear fuel and reactors (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|109000000|1959}}}} today).{{Inflation-fn|US}}\n\n''Triton''{{'}}s mission as a radar picket submarine was made obsolete after two years by the introduction of the carrier-based Grumman [[E-1 Tracer|WF-2 Tracer]] [[airborne early warning]] aircraft. She was converted to an [[attack submarine]] in 1962 and became the flagship for the Commander, Submarine Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet ([[ComSubLant|<small>COMSUBLANT</small>]]) in 1964. She was decommissioned in 1969, the first U.S. nuclear submarine to be taken out of service.\n\n''Triton''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hull was moored at the [[St. Julien's Creek Annex]] of [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] as part of the reserve fleet until 1993, though she was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 1986. In 1993, she was towed to [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] to await the [[Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]].  The former ''Triton'' landed on the keel resting blocks in the drydock basin on 1 October 2007 to begin this recycling process, which was completed effective 30 November 2009. ''Triton''{{'}}s sail superstructure was saved from the recycling process and is now part of the USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park located on Port of Benton Boulevard in Richland, Washington.\n\n==Design history==\n\n===General characteristics===\n''Triton'' was a first-generation U.S. [[nuclear-powered submarine]], along with {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}}, {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|2}}, {{USS|Halibut|SSGN-587|2}}, and {{USS|Skate|SSN-578|2}} (and her [[Skate-class submarine|sisters]]).<ref>[[Norman Polmar|Polmar]] and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p.xiii, and Chapter 4, pp. 90\u201393.</ref> While serving as fully operational units of the U.S. Navy, the vessels also played key developmental roles.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 66.</ref>  ''Nautilus'' introduced the use of nuclear power for ship propulsion.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 57\u201360.</ref> ''Seawolf'' utilized a [[liquid metal cooled reactor|liquid-metal nuclear reactor]] using [[liquid sodium]] as an alternative heat exchange medium to pressurized water.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 60\u201363.</ref>  ''Halibut'' was the first nuclear-powered submarine to perform a strategic [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrence]] patrol armed with [[SSM-N-8 Regulus|Regulus]] [[cruise missile]]s.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 90\u201393.</ref> The ''Skate''s were the first nuclear-powered submarine class with more than one ship built.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 63\u201364.</ref>  ''Triton''{{'}}s unique contribution to the development of nuclear power for naval propulsion was her dual reactor plant, which provided the speed required for radar picket missions.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\nRadar picket submarines ([[Hull classification symbol|Navy classification]] \"SSR\") were developed during the post-war period to provide intelligence information, electronic surveillance, and fighter aircraft interception control for forward-deployed naval forces. Unlike destroyers used as radar picket ships during World War Two, these submarines could avoid attack by submerging if detected. The U.S. Navy's MIGRAINE<ref name=UnderseaWarfare /> program involved converting existing fleet submarines into radar picket vessels, and the Navy also ordered two purpose-built diesel-electric SSRs, {{USS|Sailfish|SSR-572|2}} and {{USS|Salmon|SSR-573|2}}.  However, these were incapable of sustaining the high submerged or surfaced speeds necessary to operate with fast carrier task forces and therefore unsuitable to the task.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Submarines Since 1945'', pp.90\u201394.</ref>\n\nNuclear power offered the only possible solution. ''Triton'' was designed in the mid-1950s as a radar picket submarine capable of operating at high speed, on the surface, in advance of an aircraft carrier task force. ''Triton''{{'}}s high speed came from her twin-reactor nuclear propulsion plant, with a designed speed, surfaced and submerged, of {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. On 27 September 1959, ''Triton'' achieved \"well in excess of\" {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} during her initial sea trials.<ref name=Polmar67>Polmar and Moore.

The first set was installed on board the [[destroyer leader]] {{USS|Norfolk|DL-1|2}} prior to its installation on board ''Triton'' in 1959.<ref>Polmar. ''The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet'', p. 527.</ref> Since it was scanned electronically in elevation, the AN/SPS-26 set did not need a separate height-finding radar.  A submarine version of SPS-26, designated BPS-10, was under development, and it was slated for installation on ''Triton''.  To process its radar, electronic, and air traffic data, ''Triton'' had a Combat Information Center (CIC) located in a separate air control compartment, situated between ''Triton''{{'}}s reactor and operations compartments.<ref>Friedman.

''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', p. 95.</ref> As initially designed, it had a three-level hull, with its Combat Intelligence Center (CIC) (''see image'') located on the middle level.<ref name=Friedman95/>  Its overall length was initially {{convert|400|ft|m}}, with a beam of {{convert|38|ft|m}}.<ref name=Friedman95/>  Also as initially designed, its displacement was 4,800 tons surfaced and 6,500 tons submerged.<ref name=Friedman95/>  January 1955 performance estimates called for the SAR propulsion plant to produce {{convert|34,000|shp|lk=in}}, with a surfaced speed of {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} and a submerged speed of {{convert|23|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Friedman95/>  ''Triton'' initially had the same dual radar system installed on the non-nuclear {{sclass-|Sailfish|submarine|0}} radar picket submarines (i.e., BPS-2 search radar and BPS-3 height-finder set) housed in a large, stepped [[sail (submarine)|sail]] (''see image'').<ref name=Friedman95/>  Construction cost was initially estimated at $78,000,000.<ref name=Friedman95/>  Subsequent growth of the SAR propulsion plant necessitated the overall increase in ''Triton''{{'}}s length and tonnage, although without any loss in speed,  while the installation of the AN/SPS-26 3-D search radar allowed the elimination of a separate height-finder.<ref>Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', pp. 95\u201396, 256n3, 263n10.</ref>\n\n''Triton'' was to be the lead ship of a proposed class of nuclear-powered radar picket submarines. A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar picket submarines. The total force included two non-nuclear ''Sailfish''-class submarines and eight nuclear submarines. With construction costs for ''Triton'' escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar picket submarines for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric radar picket submarines each.<ref>Friedman.

Her knife-like bow, with its bulbous forefoot, provided improved surfaced sea-keeping for her radar picket role. Her surface sea-keeping was further enhanced by high reserve buoyancy (30%), provided by 22 [[ballast tanks]], the most ever in an American submarine.<ref name=Polmar67/> She was the last submarine to have a [[conning tower]], as well as the last American submarine to have twin screws or a stern torpedo room.  Her sail was the largest ever aboard an American submarine, measuring {{convert|70|ft|m}} long, {{convert|24|ft|m}} tall, and {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide, and designed to house the large AN/SPS-26 3-D air-search radar antenna when not in use.

The 1956 program not only completed the final authorization for all of the U.S. Navy's first-generation nuclear submarines, but with ''Skipjack'', it also marked the initial authorization for a second-generation nuclear submarine. Finally, the 1956 program included the three submarines of the  diesel-electric {{sclass-|Barbel|submarine|4}}, the last non-nuclear attack submarines to be built for the U.S. Navy. Henceforth, the U.S. Navy submarine service would be a nuclear-powered force.<ref name=USFleetAppC/><ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Keel-laying===\n''Triton''{{'}}s keel was laid down on 29 May 1956 in [[Groton, Connecticut]], by the [[Electric Boat]] Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. Her length presented Electric Boat with many problems during her construction. She was so long her bow obstructed the slipway's railway facility, used for transporting material around the yard. Consequently, the lower half of her bow was cut away to facilitate yard operations, and the bow was re-attached just days prior to her launch. Similarly, the last {{convert|50|ft|m}} of her stern was built on an adjoining slip and attached to the rest of the hull before ''Triton''{{'}}s launch. Her sail was found to be too high to go under the scaffolding, so the top {{convert|12|ft|m}} was cut away and re-attached later.<ref>Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\nEven before her launch, there was considerable discussion of ''Triton''{{'}}s role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration to serve as a [[command ship]] (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced [[sonar]] scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine ([[USS Halibut (SSGN-587)|SSGN]]), or a [[Minelayer#Naval minelayers|minelaying]] [[USS Argonaut (SS-166)|submarine]]. However, with the exception of the command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 68.</ref><ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Submarines Since 1945'', pp. 96\u201398.</ref>\n\nAnother potential mission was as an underwater tug, able to rescue disabled submarines under the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] ice pack. ''Triton''{{'}}s first commanding officer, Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.]], requested plans be drawn up for this modification, which he characterized as \"easy and inexpensive\".  Although there was consideration for a deployment to Arctic waters, there is no evidence that ''Triton'' was ever employed as an underwater tug.<ref>{{cite web | title= Box 28: Submerged Towing | url= https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/finding_aids/PDFs/Beach_Edward_Papers.pdf | work= Edward L.

The mission's objectives were set forth in the published [[ship's log]] (''pictured''):\n\n<blockquote>For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress \u2013 all extremely important to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris program]] \u2013 it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.<ref>{{cite book |title= USS Trton SSRN 586 First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960 \u2013 O \u2013 550280 |year= 1960 |publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]|location= [[Washington, DC]] |isbn=  |pages= B-5 |url=   |quote=Hereafter referred to as ''First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960''}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe actual mission was summarized by the U.S. Navy's ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'':\n\n<blockquote>''Triton'' put to sea on her shakedown cruise on 15 February 1960, bound for the South Atlantic. She arrived in the middle Atlantic off [[St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks]] on 24 February to commence a history-making voyage. Having remained submerged since her departure from the east coast, Triton continued on south towards Cape Horn, rounded the tip of South America, and headed west across the Pacific. After transiting the [[Philippines|Philippine]] and [[Indonesia]]n archipelagos and crossing the [[Indian Ocean]], she rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and arrived off the St. Peter and Paul Rocks on 25 April \u2014 60 days and 21 hours after departing the mid-ocean landmark. Only once did her sail break the surface of the sea, when she transferred a sick sailor to [[USS Macon (CA-132)|USS ''Macon'' (CA-132)]] off [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], on 6 March. She arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 10 May, having completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the earth.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''Triton''{{'}}s globe-girdling cruise proved invaluable to the United States. Politically, it enhanced the nation's prestige. From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit capabilities of the first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data. At the cruise's conclusion, ''Triton'' received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Captain Beach]] received the [[Legion of Merit]] from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref name=DANFS>{{cite DANFS | title = Triton | url = https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/triton-v.html | short = yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''Triton''{{'}}s commanding officer during Operation Sandblast, Captain Edward L. Beach, also provided a unique perspective on the circumnavigation in the published log:\n\n{{quote|The sea may yet hold the key to the salvation of man and his civilization. That the world may better understand this, the Navy directed a submerged retrace of Ferdinand Magellan's historic circumnavigation. The honor of doing it fell to ''Triton'', but it has been a national accomplishment; for the sinews and the power which make up our ship, the genius which designed her, the thousands and hundreds of thousands who labored, each at his own metier, in all parts of the country, to build her safe, strong, self-reliant, are America.  ''Triton'', a unit of their Navy, pridefully and respectfully dedicates this voyage to the people of the United States.<ref>''First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960'', B-79.</ref>}}\n\nThe noted historian [[Bern Dibner]] placed the significance of Operation Sandblast into historical context:\n\n{{quote|The epochal achievement of the fleet of Magellan in circumnavigating the globe was echoed in the magnificent accomplishment by the nuclear submarine ''Triton'' in 1960.  Like the voyage of Magellan, that of ''Triton'' created stirring philosophical concepts.  It demonstrated that a company of men could live and work in the depth of the ocean for months at a time.  It was shown that through the new technology a source of power had been made in such abundance and so manageable that, without refueling, an 8000-ton vehicle would be driven through the water around the world.  It was also shown that the arts of observation, navigation, communication and control had reached the point where travel under the water was possible with pinpoint accuracy.<ref>Dibner.

On the editorial page of the April 1960 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League, Captain Hay noted:\n\n<blockquote>It is truly a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved the [[Edward L.

In early 1960, it became the first vessel to execute a submerged circumnavigation of the Earth in [[Operation Sandblast]]. ''Triton'' accomplished this objective during her [[shakedown cruise]] while under the command of Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Edward L. \"Ned\" Beach, Jr]]. She was the only member of her [[Ship class|class]] and had the distinction of being the only Western submarine powered by two nuclear reactors.\n\n''Triton'' was the second submarine and the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Greek god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]].  (The nomenclature being unusual in that U.S. Navy submarines, at that time, were usually named for fish.) At the time of her commissioning in 1959, ''Triton'' was the largest, most powerful, and most expensive submarine ever built at $109&nbsp;million excluding the cost of nuclear fuel and reactors (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|109000000|1959}}}} today).{{Inflation-fn|US}}\n\n''Triton''{{'}}s mission as a radar picket submarine was made obsolete after two years by the introduction of the carrier-based Grumman [[E-1 Tracer|WF-2 Tracer]] [[airborne early warning]] aircraft. She was converted to an [[attack submarine]] in 1962 and became the flagship for the Commander, Submarine Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet ([[ComSubLant|<small>COMSUBLANT</small>]]) in 1964. She was decommissioned in 1969, the first U.S. nuclear submarine to be taken out of service.\n\n''Triton''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hull was moored at the [[St. Julien's Creek Annex]] of [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] as part of the reserve fleet until 1993, though she was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 1986. In 1993, she was towed to [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] to await the [[Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]].  The former ''Triton'' landed on the keel resting blocks in the drydock basin on 1 October 2007 to begin this recycling process, which was completed effective 30 November 2009. ''Triton''{{'}}s sail superstructure was saved from the recycling process and is now part of the USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park located on Port of Benton Boulevard in Richland, Washington.\n\n==Design history==\n\n===General characteristics===\n''Triton'' was a first-generation U.S. [[nuclear-powered submarine]], along with {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}}, {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|2}}, {{USS|Halibut|SSGN-587|2}}, and {{USS|Skate|SSN-578|2}} (and her [[Skate-class submarine|sisters]]).<ref>[[Norman Polmar|Polmar]] and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p.xiii, and Chapter 4, pp. 90\u201393.</ref> While serving as fully operational units of the U.S. Navy, the vessels also played key developmental roles.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 66.</ref>  ''Nautilus'' introduced the use of nuclear power for ship propulsion.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 57\u201360.</ref> ''Seawolf'' utilized a [[liquid metal cooled reactor|liquid-metal nuclear reactor]] using [[liquid sodium]] as an alternative heat exchange medium to pressurized water.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 60\u201363.</ref>  ''Halibut'' was the first nuclear-powered submarine to perform a strategic [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrence]] patrol armed with [[SSM-N-8 Regulus|Regulus]] [[cruise missile]]s.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 90\u201393.</ref> The ''Skate''s were the first nuclear-powered submarine class with more than one ship built.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 63\u201364.</ref>  ''Triton''{{'}}s unique contribution to the development of nuclear power for naval propulsion was her dual reactor plant, which provided the speed required for radar picket missions.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\nRadar picket submarines ([[Hull classification symbol|Navy classification]] \"SSR\") were developed during the post-war period to provide intelligence information, electronic surveillance, and fighter aircraft interception control for forward-deployed naval forces. Unlike destroyers used as radar picket ships during World War Two, these submarines could avoid attack by submerging if detected. The U.S. Navy's MIGRAINE<ref name=UnderseaWarfare /> program involved converting existing fleet submarines into radar picket vessels, and the Navy also ordered two purpose-built diesel-electric SSRs, {{USS|Sailfish|SSR-572|2}} and {{USS|Salmon|SSR-573|2}}.  However, these were incapable of sustaining the high submerged or surfaced speeds necessary to operate with fast carrier task forces and therefore unsuitable to the task.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Submarines Since 1945'', pp.90\u201394.</ref>\n\nNuclear power offered the only possible solution. ''Triton'' was designed in the mid-1950s as a radar picket submarine capable of operating at high speed, on the surface, in advance of an aircraft carrier task force. ''Triton''{{'}}s high speed came from her twin-reactor nuclear propulsion plant, with a designed speed, surfaced and submerged, of {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. On 27 September 1959, ''Triton'' achieved \"well in excess of\" {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} during her initial sea trials.<ref name=Polmar67>Polmar and Moore.

The first set was installed on board the [[destroyer leader]] {{USS|Norfolk|DL-1|2}} prior to its installation on board ''Triton'' in 1959.<ref>Polmar. ''The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet'', p. 527.</ref> Since it was scanned electronically in elevation, the AN/SPS-26 set did not need a separate height-finding radar.  A submarine version of SPS-26, designated BPS-10, was under development, and it was slated for installation on ''Triton''.  To process its radar, electronic, and air traffic data, ''Triton'' had a Combat Information Center (CIC) located in a separate air control compartment, situated between ''Triton''{{'}}s reactor and operations compartments.<ref>Friedman.

During the early 1950s, many engineers at [[Naval Reactors|Naval Reactors branch]] of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) were concerned about depending on single-reactor plants for submarine operations, particularly involving under-the-ice Arctic missions.<ref>Polmar and Moore.

The 1956 program not only completed the final authorization for all of the U.S. Navy's first-generation nuclear submarines, but with ''Skipjack'', it also marked the initial authorization for a second-generation nuclear submarine. Finally, the 1956 program included the three submarines of the  diesel-electric {{sclass-|Barbel|submarine|4}}, the last non-nuclear attack submarines to be built for the U.S. Navy. Henceforth, the U.S. Navy submarine service would be a nuclear-powered force.<ref name=USFleetAppC/><ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Keel-laying===\n''Triton''{{'}}s keel was laid down on 29 May 1956 in [[Groton, Connecticut]], by the [[Electric Boat]] Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. Her length presented Electric Boat with many problems during her construction. She was so long her bow obstructed the slipway's railway facility, used for transporting material around the yard. Consequently, the lower half of her bow was cut away to facilitate yard operations, and the bow was re-attached just days prior to her launch. Similarly, the last {{convert|50|ft|m}} of her stern was built on an adjoining slip and attached to the rest of the hull before ''Triton''{{'}}s launch. Her sail was found to be too high to go under the scaffolding, so the top {{convert|12|ft|m}} was cut away and re-attached later.<ref>Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\nEven before her launch, there was considerable discussion of ''Triton''{{'}}s role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration to serve as a [[command ship]] (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced [[sonar]] scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine ([[USS Halibut (SSGN-587)|SSGN]]), or a [[Minelayer#Naval minelayers|minelaying]] [[USS Argonaut (SS-166)|submarine]]. However, with the exception of the command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.<ref>Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 68.</ref><ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Submarines Since 1945'', pp. 96\u201398.</ref>\n\nAnother potential mission was as an underwater tug, able to rescue disabled submarines under the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] ice pack. ''Triton''{{'}}s first commanding officer, Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.]], requested plans be drawn up for this modification, which he characterized as \"easy and inexpensive\".  Although there was consideration for a deployment to Arctic waters, there is no evidence that ''Triton'' was ever employed as an underwater tug.<ref>{{cite web | title= Box 28: Submerged Towing | url= https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/finding_aids/PDFs/Beach_Edward_Papers.pdf | work= Edward L.

The mission's objectives were set forth in the published [[ship's log]] (''pictured''):\n\n<blockquote>For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress \u2013 all extremely important to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris program]] \u2013 it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.<ref>{{cite book |title= USS Trton SSRN 586 First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960 \u2013 O \u2013 550280 |year= 1960 |publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]|location= [[Washington, DC]] |isbn=  |pages= B-5 |url=   |quote=Hereafter referred to as ''First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960''}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe actual mission was summarized by the U.S. Navy's ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'':\n\n<blockquote>''Triton'' put to sea on her shakedown cruise on 15 February 1960, bound for the South Atlantic. She arrived in the middle Atlantic off [[St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks]] on 24 February to commence a history-making voyage. Having remained submerged since her departure from the east coast, Triton continued on south towards Cape Horn, rounded the tip of South America, and headed west across the Pacific. After transiting the [[Philippines|Philippine]] and [[Indonesia]]n archipelagos and crossing the [[Indian Ocean]], she rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and arrived off the St. Peter and Paul Rocks on 25 April \u2014 60 days and 21 hours after departing the mid-ocean landmark. Only once did her sail break the surface of the sea, when she transferred a sick sailor to [[USS Macon (CA-132)|USS ''Macon'' (CA-132)]] off [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], on 6 March. She arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 10 May, having completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the earth.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''Triton''{{'}}s globe-girdling cruise proved invaluable to the United States. Politically, it enhanced the nation's prestige. From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit capabilities of the first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data. At the cruise's conclusion, ''Triton'' received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Captain Beach]] received the [[Legion of Merit]] from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref name=DANFS>{{cite DANFS | title = Triton | url = https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/triton-v.html | short = yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''Triton''{{'}}s commanding officer during Operation Sandblast, Captain Edward L. Beach, also provided a unique perspective on the circumnavigation in the published log:\n\n{{quote|The sea may yet hold the key to the salvation of man and his civilization. That the world may better understand this, the Navy directed a submerged retrace of Ferdinand Magellan's historic circumnavigation. The honor of doing it fell to ''Triton'', but it has been a national accomplishment; for the sinews and the power which make up our ship, the genius which designed her, the thousands and hundreds of thousands who labored, each at his own metier, in all parts of the country, to build her safe, strong, self-reliant, are America.  ''Triton'', a unit of their Navy, pridefully and respectfully dedicates this voyage to the people of the United States.<ref>''First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960'', B-79.</ref>}}\n\nThe noted historian [[Bern Dibner]] placed the significance of Operation Sandblast into historical context:\n\n{{quote|The epochal achievement of the fleet of Magellan in circumnavigating the globe was echoed in the magnificent accomplishment by the nuclear submarine ''Triton'' in 1960.  Like the voyage of Magellan, that of ''Triton'' created stirring philosophical concepts.  It demonstrated that a company of men could live and work in the depth of the ocean for months at a time.  It was shown that through the new technology a source of power had been made in such abundance and so manageable that, without refueling, an 8000-ton vehicle would be driven through the water around the world.  It was also shown that the arts of observation, navigation, communication and control had reached the point where travel under the water was possible with pinpoint accuracy.<ref>Dibner.

Hay who had served on ''Triton'' during its historic submerged around-the-world voyage.  On the editorial page of the April 1960 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League, Captain Hay noted:\n\n<blockquote>It is truly a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved the [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|skipper's]] ''tenacity''.  More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at any time, and do what ever was required.  It's a good [[Nautical fiction|sea story]] about doing what had to be done.  On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it's a good thing to do to re-read about one of the forerunners of all we're done since.<ref>{{cite journal |author= James C.

From 1896, at the age of 23, he served in the public service as a legal intern at the Prime Minister's Office. From 1911 he was appointed as ministerial adviser in the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] appointed Skerlecz head of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] crown land in 1913, shortly before [[World War I]].\n\nIn the summer of 1913, shortly after his appointment as Ban of Croatia, [[Stjepan Doj\u010di\u0107]] attempted an assassination on Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz in Zagreb, however Skerlecz was only lightly injured on his right arm. \n\nWhile Croatia-Slavonia was not the site of any battles, Croatian troops, fighting under the Croatian Home Guard took part in the fighting, much of it in neighbouring [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Skerlecz managed to reconvene the Croatian [[Sabor]] (parliament) in [[Zagreb]] by 1915. The Croats made further demands for local authority, as well as unification of Croatia-Slavonia with [[Dalmatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Stefan Sarkoti\u0107]], Austria-Hungary's commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina also sought unification of their provinces. However, Austria-Hungary's outdated political system made any shifts between areas under Hungarian or Austrian spheres of influence difficult. Skerlecz could only support the Croatians in acting autonomously. As the war progressed more Croats found the formation of a South Slav state a potentially beneficial possibility.\n\nHe resigned from his post on June 29, 1917 after his friend PM Istv\u00e1n Tisza was ousted from power, leaving the country in no better state than when he had arrived. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was formed the following year. Skerlecz became [[persona non grata]] in Kingdom of Yugoslavia, because he was known as an ardent opponent of the involvement of Croatia in the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Skerlecz had to move to Hungary. Thereafter he lived in his family villa at [[Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue]].

From 1911 he was appointed as ministerial adviser in the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] appointed Skerlecz head of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] crown land in 1913, shortly before [[World War I]].\n\nIn the summer of 1913, shortly after his appointment as Ban of Croatia, a Serb activist attempted an assassination on Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz in Zagreb, however Skerlecz was only lightly injured. \n\nWhile Croatia-Slavonia was not the site of any battles, Croatian troops, fighting under the Croatian Home Guard took part in the fighting, much of it in neighbouring [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Skerlecz managed to reconvene the Croatian [[Sabor]] (parliament) in [[Zagreb]] by 1915. The Croats made further demands for local authority, as well as unification of Croatia-Slavonia with [[Dalmatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Stefan Sarkoti\u0107]], Austria-Hungary's commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina also sought unification of their provinces. However, Austria-Hungary's outdated political system made any shifts between areas under Hungarian or Austrian spheres of influence difficult. Skerlecz could only support the Croatians in acting autonomously. As the war progressed more Croats found the formation of a South Slav state a potentially beneficial possibility.\n\nHe resigned from his post on June 29, 1917 after his friend PM Istv\u00e1n Tisza was ousted from power, leaving the country in no better state than when he had arrived. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was formed the following year. Skerlecz became [[persona non grata]] in Kingdom of Yugoslavia, because he was known as an ardent opponent of the involvement of Croatia in the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Skerlecz had to move to Hungary. Thereafter he lived in his family villa at [[Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue]]. He died in [[Budapest]] in 1951.\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=59707|title=\u0160krlec, Ivan|encyclopedia=Croatian Encyclopedia|language=hr|accessdate=24 July 2015}}\n\n{{Croatian ban}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skerlecz, Ivan}}\n[[Category:1873 births]]\n[[Category:1951 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Baranya County]]\n[[Category:Hungarian politicians]]\n[[Category:Bans of Croatia]]\n", "name_user": "Liltender", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv%C3%A1n_Skerlecz"}
