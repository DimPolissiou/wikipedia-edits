Enemy players can be \"tagged\" by players in their home territory and, depending on the rules, they may be out of the game, become members of the opposite team, sent back to their own territory, or frozen in place (\"in jail\") until freed by a member of their own team.\n\n==Overview==\nCapture the Flag reqyuires a playing field of some sort. In both indoor and outdoor versions, the field is divided into two clearly designated halves, known as territories. Players form two teams, one for each territory. Each side has a \"flag\" which is most often a piece of fabric, but can be any object small enough to be easily carried by a person (night time games might use [[flashlight]]s, [[glowstick]]s or [[lantern]]s as the \"flags\"). Sometimes teams wear dark colors at night to make it more difficult for their opponents to see them. If one team has the opposing team's flag on their territory they may be tagged because they have the opposing team's flag.\n\nThe objective of the game is for players to venture into the opposing team's territory, grab the flag and return with it to their territory without being tagged. The flag is defended mainly by tagging opposing players who attempt to take it. Within their territory players are \"safe\", meaning that they cannot be tagged by opposing players. Once they cross into the opposing team's territory they are vulnerable.\n\nRules for Capture the Flag appear in the 1920 Edition of \"The Official Handbook for Boys\" published by the [[Boy Scouts of America]].<ref>\"The Official Handbook for Boys\" published by the Boy Scouts of America, 1920</ref>\n\n===Location===\nThe flag is usually placed in a visibly obvious location at the rear of a team's territory. In a more difficult version, the flag is hidden in a place where it can only be seen from one angle. It also might have some challenge involved. For example, the flag could be hidden in the leaves up in a tall tree, and the players have to see the flag, then knock it out and bring it to their base.\n\n===Jail===\nDifferent versions of Capture the Flag have different rules, both for handling the flag and for what happens to tagged players. A player who is tagged may be eliminated from the game entirely (out of the game), be forced to join the opposing team, sent back to their own territory, or be placed in \"jail\" with or without a guard (according to the number of people in a team).<ref name=\"scouts\"/> The jail is a predesignated area of the group's territory which exists for holding tagged players and is normally towards the back of the group's territory.\n\nWhile tagged players may be confined to jail for a limited, predetermined time, the most common form of the game involves the option for a \"jailbreak\". In this version, players who are tagged remain in jail indefinitely. However, players from their own team may free them from jail by means of a jailbreak.<ref name=\"scouts\"/> Jailbreaks are accomplished by a player running from their own territory into the enemy's jail. Such action may, depending on the rules, free all jailed players<ref name=\"scouts\"/> or simply those who are physically touched by the one performing the jailbreak. But in some variants, teammates who got tagged can be jailed only 3 times, or they are kicked from the game until the next round. In general freed players are obligated to return directly to their own territory before attempting offensive action (''i.e.,'' attempting to grab the flag).\n\nWhile they return to their own side, freed players usually acquire \"free walk-backs\", in which they are safe from tagging until they reach their home territory. The player performing the jail break, on the other hand, is neither safe, nor restricted from performing other actions such as attempting to grab the flag or generally moving about enemy territory. Sometimes, players in jail form chains, so that if a teammate tags one person in the chain, everyone is free. Simply leaving jail without being freed is considered poor sportsmanship and is severely frowned upon, often leading to expulsion from the game. If all players on one team are jailed (meaning no teammate can free them from jail), then the other team will have all the time they want to find the other team's flag.\n\n===Capturing the flag===\n[[File:River Ridge 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[ECyD]] member playing a variation of capture the flag, in which the \"flag\" is a softball, at Camp River Ridge in [[Indiana]]]]\nThe rules for the handling of the flag also vary from game to game and deal mostly with the disposition of the flag after a failed attempt at capturing it. In one variant, after a player is tagged while carrying the flag, it is returned to its original place. In another variant, the flag is left in the location where the player was tagged. This latter variant makes offensive play easier, as the flag will tend, over the course of the game, to be moved closer to the dividing line between territories. In some games, it is possible for the players to throw the flag to teammates. As long as the flag stays in play without hitting the ground, it is allowed for the players to pass.\n\nWhen the flag is captured by one player, they're not safe from being tagged, unless they trip. Sometimes, the flag holder may not be safe at all, even in their home territory, until they obtain both flags, thus ending the game. But they have the option to return to their own side or hand it off to a teammate who will then carry it to the other side. In most versions, they may not throw the flag but only hand it off while running. The game is won when a player returns to their own territory with the enemy flag or both teams' flags. Also, as a general rule, the flag carrier may not attempt to free any of their teammates from jail.<ref name=\"scouts\">{{cite web |url=http://usscouts.org/games/game_cf.asp |title=USSSP - Games - Capture the Flag |publisher=Usscouts.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502083522/http://usscouts.org/games/game_cf.asp |archive-date=2019-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\nAlterations may include \"one flag\" CTF in which there is a defensive team and an offensive team, or games with three or more flags. In the case of the latter, one can only win when all flags are captured, not only one.\n\nAnother variation is when the players put bandannas in their pockets with about six inches sticking out. Instead of tagging your opponents, you must pull your opponent's bandanna out of their pocket. No matter where a player is when their bandanna is pulled, they're captured and must, depending on the preferences of the players, go to jail, or return to their base before returning to play. In this version there is no team territory, only a small base where the team's flag is kept. To win, one team must have both of the flags in their base.\n\nIn some urban settings, the game is played indoors in an enclosed area with walls, similar to the walls in a hockey rink. There is also a spot sticking out of the back of the opposing ends which is connected to the playing area for the flag to be placed in. In this urban variation, legal checking hockey style and legal checking against the boards is allowed. A player who commits a [[Foul (sports)|foul]] or illegal check is placed in a [[penalty box]] for a specified amount of time, depending on the severity of the foul. A player who deliberately injures an opponent is expelled from the rest of the game. Throwing the flag is allowed in this variation, as long as the flag is caught before it hits the ground. If the flag is thrown to a teammate but hits the ground before it can be caught, the flag is placed from the spot of the throw. If a player throws the flag, but is blocked or intercepted by a player from the opposing team, the flag is placed back at the base.\n\nIt is not uncommon for people to play airsoft, paintball, or Nerf variations of CTF. Typically there are no territories in these versions. Players who are \"hit\" must sit out a predetermined amount of time before returning to play (respawning).\n\n====Capture the Flag Redux====\n\nIn 2014, Kickstarter users fully funded a campaign<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1885949718/capture-the-flag-redux|title=Capture the Flag REDUX|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref> by Starlux Games for [https://www.starluxgames.com/capture-the-flag-redux/ Capture the Flag Redux], an update that would allow it to be played at night or in the dark.

However, instead of a flag, a number of sticks or other items such as coats or hats are placed in a \"goal\" on the far end of each side of the playing field or area. As in capture the flag, players are sent to a \"prison\" if tagged on the opponents' side, and may be freed by teammates. Each player may only take one of their opponents' sticks at a time. The first team to take all of the opponents' sticks to their own side wins.<ref>[[Jessie H. Bancroft]] (1909). \"[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25660/25660-h/25660-h.htm#Page_188 Stealing Sticks]\".

An [[edutainment]] game with recognizable capture-the-flag mechanics, ''Bannercatch'' allows up to two humans (each alternating between two characters in the game world) to play capture the flag against an increasingly difficult team of four AI bots. ''Bannercatch''{{'}}s game world is divided into quadrants: home, enemy, and two \"no-mans land\" areas which hold the jails. A successful capture requires bringing the enemy flag into one team's \"home\" quadrant. Players can be captured when in an enemy territory, or in \"no-mans land\" while holding a flag. Captured players must be \"rescued\" from their designated jail by one of the other members of the team. Fallen flags remain where they dropped until a time-out period elapses, after which the flag returns to one of several starting locations in home territory. The 2D map also features walls, trees and a moving river, enabling a wide variety of strategies. Special locations in the play area allow humans to query the game state (such as flag status) using binary messages.\n\nIn 1992, Richard Carr released an [[MS-DOS]] based game called ''Capture the Flag''. It is a turn-based strategy game with [[Real-time computing|real time]] network / [[modem]] play (or [[Play-by-mail game|play-by-mail]]) based around the traditional outdoor game. The game required players to merely move one of their characters onto the same square as their opponent's flag, as opposed to bringing it back to friendly territory, because of difficulties implementing the [[artificial intelligence]] that the computer player would have needed to bring the enemy flag home and intercept opposing characters carrying the flag. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n===Computer security===\n{{See also|Wargame (hacking)}}\n[[File:DEF CON 17 CTF competition.jpg|thumb|A team competing in the CTF competition at [[DEF CON]] 17]]\nIn [[computer security]], Capture the Flag (CTF), a type of [[Wargame (hacking)|wargame]], is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world (i.e., [[bug bounty program]]s in professional settings). Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF contests at DEF CON. There are three main styles of capture the flag competitions: attack/defense, hardware challenges and [[Jeopardy!]].\n\nIn an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine (or a small network) to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine(s) and on their success in attacking the other team's machines. Depending on the nature of the particular CTF game, teams may either be attempting to take an opponent's flag from their machine or teams may be attempting to plant their own flag on their opponent's machine. Two of the more prominent attack/defense CTF's are held every year at [[DEF CON (convention)|DEF CON]], the largest hacker conference, and the [[New York University|NYU]]-CSAW (Cyber Security Awareness Week), the largest student cyber-security contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infamoussyn.com/2014/09/22/csaw-ctf-qual-2014-csaw2013reversing2-exe-writeup/|title=CSAW CTF Qual 2014 \u2013 csaw2013reversing2.exe Writeup|date=22 September 2014|website=infamoussyn.com|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706092539/https://infamoussyn.com/2014/09/22/csaw-ctf-qual-2014-csaw2013reversing2-exe-writeup/|archive-date=6 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>http://www.usf.edu/engineering/documents/01132015-csaw-finals.pdf</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/about|title=Cyber Security Awareness Week :: About|author=|date=|website=csaw.engineering.nyu.edu|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nyu-poly-cyber-security-awareness-week-announces-winners-of-worlds-biggest-student-contests-232353621.html|title=NYU-Poly Cyber Security Awareness Week Announces Winners of World's Biggest Student Contests|first=Polytechnic Institute of New York|last=University|date=|website=www.prnewswire.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nHardware challenges usually involve getting an unknown piece of hardware and having to figure out how to bypass part of the security, e.g. using debugging ports or using a [[Side-channel attack]].\n\n[[Jeopardy!]]-style competitions usually involve multiple categories of problems, each of which contains a variety of questions of different point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points in the competition's time frame (for example 24 hours), but do not directly attack each other. Rather than a race, this style of game play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes quantity of correct submissions over the timing.\n\nThere is a fourth type of CTF, most commonly referred to as King of the Hill (KotH). King of the Hill is similar to Attack/Defend, but instead of everyone having their own machine (or small network) to defend, there are only preconfigured ones, which require all teams to exploit them. Once a team has successfully taken over the machine, the focus shifts to defending the machine from other teams' attacks. Score is usually determined by a score reporting service on the machine, that reports a team token. When one team is able to gain access, they will remove the other team's token and insert their own, thus making them the [[King of the Hill (game)|King of the Hill]].\n\n==Urban gaming==\nCapture the Flag is among the games that have made a recent comeback among adults as part of the [[urban gaming]] trend (which includes games like [[Pac-Manhattan]], [[Fugitive (game)|Fugitive]] and [[Manhunt (people game)|Manhunt]]). The game is played on city streets and players use cellphones to communicate. News about the games spreads virally through the use of [[blog]]s and [[mailing list]]s. Urban Capture the Flag has been played in cities throughout North America. One long running example occurs on the [[Northrop Auditorium|Northrop Mall]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] on Fridays with typical attendance ranging from 50 to several hundred.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mndaily.com/2005/09/19/game-captures-campus-attention?page=2&quicktabs_6=1 | title=Game Captures Campus Attention | publisher=www. mndaily.com | date=2005-09-19 | accessdate=2011-09-09 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203835/http://www.mndaily.com/2005/09/19/game-captures-campus-attention?page=2&quicktabs_6=1 | archive-date=2014-07-14 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*Flag-rush\n*[[Fugitive (game)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://defend.plus/capture-the-flag/ Hacking game]\n*[http://www.carrsoft.com/ctf/capture1.html Richard Carr's website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190502083522/http://usscouts.org/games/game_cf.asp Capture the flag] at usscouts.org\n*[http://www.root-me.org/en/Capture-The-Flag/CTF-all-the-day/ Capture the flag] in computer security at root-me.org\n*[http://ctftime.org CTFtime] - worldwide CTF tracking site\n\n{{Outdoor games}}\n{{video game gameplay}}\n\n[[Category:Children's games]]\n[[Category:Computer network security]]\n[[Category:Tag variants]]\n[[Category:Team sports]]\n[[Category:Flag practices]]\n[[Category:Outdoor games]]\n[[Category:Video game gameplay]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{Infobox game \n|name  = Capture the Flag\n|AKA = CTF\n|image         = Capture the flag Fahne.jpg\n|caption       = An uncaptured flag\n|players       = Large group, more than 6 players in a team\n|playing_time = 10-30 minutes\n|skills        = [[endurance]]<br/>[[observation]]<br/>[[strategy]]<br/>[[speed]]<br/>[[stealth game|stealth]]}}\n'''Capture the flag ''' ('''CTF''') is a traditional outdoor game where two teams each have a [[flag]] (or other marker) and the objective is to capture the other team's flag, located at the team's \"base,\" and bring it safely back to their own base.

However, instead of a flag, a number of sticks or other items such as coats or hats are placed in a \"goal\" on the far end of each side of the playing field or area. As in capture the flag, players are sent to a \"prison\" if tagged on the opponents' side, and may be freed by teammates. Each player may only take one of their opponents' sticks at a time. The first team to take all of the opponents' sticks to their own side wins.<ref>[[Jessie H. Bancroft]] (1909). \"[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25660/25660-h/25660-h.htm#Page_188 Stealing Sticks]\".

An [[edutainment]] game with recognizable capture-the-flag mechanics, ''Bannercatch'' allows up to two humans (each alternating between two characters in the game world) to play capture the flag against an increasingly difficult team of four AI bots. ''Bannercatch''{{'}}s game world is divided into quadrants: home, enemy, and two \"no-mans land\" areas which hold the jails. A successful capture requires bringing the enemy flag into one team's \"home\" quadrant. Players can be captured when in an enemy territory, or in \"no-mans land\" while holding a flag. Captured players must be \"rescued\" from their designated jail by one of the other members of the team. Fallen flags remain where they dropped until a time-out period elapses, after which the flag returns to one of several starting locations in home territory. The 2D map also features walls, trees and a moving river, enabling a wide variety of strategies. Special locations in the play area allow humans to query the game state (such as flag status) using binary messages.\n\nIn 1992, Richard Carr released an [[MS-DOS]] based game called ''Capture the Flag''. It is a turn-based strategy game with [[Real-time computing|real time]] network / [[modem]] play (or [[Play-by-mail game|play-by-mail]]) based around the traditional outdoor game. The game required players to merely move one of their characters onto the same square as their opponent's flag, as opposed to bringing it back to friendly territory, because of difficulties implementing the [[artificial intelligence]] that the computer player would have needed to bring the enemy flag home and intercept opposing characters carrying the flag. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n===Computer security===\n{{See also|Wargame (hacking)}}\n[[File:DEF CON 17 CTF competition.jpg|thumb|A team competing in the CTF competition at [[DEF CON]] 17]]\nIn [[computer security]], Capture the Flag (CTF), a type of [[Wargame (hacking)|wargame]], is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world (i.e., [[bug bounty program]]s in professional settings). Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF contests at DEF CON. There are three main styles of capture the flag competitions: attack/defense, hardware challenges and [[Jeopardy!]].\n\nIn an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine (or a small network) to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine(s) and on their success in attacking the other team's machines. Depending on the nature of the particular CTF game, teams may either be attempting to take an opponent's flag from their machine or teams may be attempting to plant their own flag on their opponent's machine. Two of the more prominent attack/defense CTF's are held every year at [[DEF CON (convention)|DEF CON]], the largest hacker conference, and the [[New York University|NYU]]-CSAW (Cyber Security Awareness Week), the largest student cyber-security contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infamoussyn.com/2014/09/22/csaw-ctf-qual-2014-csaw2013reversing2-exe-writeup/|title=CSAW CTF Qual 2014 \u2013 csaw2013reversing2.exe Writeup|date=22 September 2014|website=infamoussyn.com|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706092539/https://infamoussyn.com/2014/09/22/csaw-ctf-qual-2014-csaw2013reversing2-exe-writeup/|archive-date=6 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>http://www.usf.edu/engineering/documents/01132015-csaw-finals.pdf</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/about|title=Cyber Security Awareness Week :: About|author=|date=|website=csaw.engineering.nyu.edu|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nyu-poly-cyber-security-awareness-week-announces-winners-of-worlds-biggest-student-contests-232353621.html|title=NYU-Poly Cyber Security Awareness Week Announces Winners of World's Biggest Student Contests|first=Polytechnic Institute of New York|last=University|date=|website=www.prnewswire.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nHardware challenges usually involve getting an unknown piece of hardware and having to figure out how to bypass part of the security, e.g. using debugging ports or using a [[Side-channel attack]].\n\n[[Jeopardy!]]-style competitions usually involve multiple categories of problems, each of which contains a variety of questions of different point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points in the competition's time frame (for example 24 hours), but do not directly attack each other. Rather than a race, this style of game play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes quantity of correct submissions over the timing.\n\nThere is a fourth type of CTF, most commonly referred to as King of the Hill (KotH). King of the Hill is similar to Attack/Defend, but instead of everyone having their own machine (or small network) to defend, there are only preconfigured ones, which require all teams to exploit them. Once a team has successfully taken over the machine, the focus shifts to defending the machine from other teams' attacks. Score is usually determined by a score reporting service on the machine, that reports a team token. When one team is able to gain access, they will remove the other team's token and insert their own, thus making them the [[King of the Hill (game)|King of the Hill]].\n\n==Urban gaming==\nCapture the Flag is among the games that have made a recent comeback among adults as part of the [[urban gaming]] trend (which includes games like [[Pac-Manhattan]], [[Fugitive (game)|Fugitive]] and [[Manhunt (people game)|Manhunt]]). The game is played on city streets and players use cellphones to communicate. News about the games spreads virally through the use of [[blog]]s and [[mailing list]]s. Urban Capture the Flag has been played in cities throughout North America. One long running example occurs on the [[Northrop Auditorium|Northrop Mall]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] on Fridays with typical attendance ranging from 50 to several hundred.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mndaily.com/2005/09/19/game-captures-campus-attention?page=2&quicktabs_6=1 | title=Game Captures Campus Attention | publisher=www. mndaily.com | date=2005-09-19 | accessdate=2011-09-09 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203835/http://www.mndaily.com/2005/09/19/game-captures-campus-attention?page=2&quicktabs_6=1 | archive-date=2014-07-14 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*Flag-rush\n*[[Fugitive (game)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://defend.plus/capture-the-flag/ Hacking game]\n*[http://www.carrsoft.com/ctf/capture1.html Richard Carr's website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190502083522/http://usscouts.org/games/game_cf.asp Capture the flag] at usscouts.org\n*[http://www.root-me.org/en/Capture-The-Flag/CTF-all-the-day/ Capture the flag] in computer security at root-me.org\n*[http://ctftime.org CTFtime] - worldwide CTF tracking site\n\n{{Outdoor games}}\n{{video game gameplay}}\n\n[[Category:Children's games]]\n[[Category:Computer network security]]\n[[Category:Tag variants]]\n[[Category:Team sports]]\n[[Category:Flag practices]]\n[[Category:Outdoor games]]\n[[Category:Video game gameplay]]\n", "name_user": "70.229.101.32", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eOverview)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag"}

He distributed Giordano T-shirts with portraits of student leaders and began publishing ''[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]'', which combined tabloid sensationalism with hard-hitting political and business reporting.

We had some time to do it and it was something that didn\u2019t involve a huge effort to do. If it didn\u2019t work, it didn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t matter. It was something of a holiday really.

The Fruitvale Bridge is a vertical-lift railroad [[moveable bridge]], while the Fruitvale Avenue Bridge is a road [[bascule bridge]] that connects Fruitvale Avenue in Oakland with Tilden Avenue in Alameda.\n\n==Rail bridge==\nThe rail bridge is immediately west of the Miller-Sweeney road bridge. The rail bridge connected Fruitvale Avenue in Oakland with Tilden Way in Alameda. It has been out of service since 2000.\n\n===History===\nThis [[lift bridge]] was constructed in 1951 to replace an earlier bridge that originally served the [[East Bay Electric Lines|SP interurban trains]] from [[San Francisco]] (SP's Interurban Electric Railway discontinued service in 1941). From 1951 until September 11, 1996, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] operated freight service across the bridge to serve shippers in Alameda and to connect with the [[Alameda Belt Line]] railroad. After SP was acquired by [[Union Pacific]] on September 11, 1996, UP provided infrequent service to Alameda until service was discontinued in 2000.\n\n===Design===\nThe right-of-way still exists through the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], however, the tracks on both sides of the bridge have been severed and the span remains raised at 65 feet above water level, except when operated for maintenance and testing.  The bridge is owned by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and is operated by the [[Alameda County, California|County of Alameda]].  The Miller-Sweeney bridge tender, a county employee, operates the railroad bridge from controls in the Miller-Sweeney [[bridge tender's house|control house]].

The Fruitvale Bridge is a vertical-lift railroad [[moveable bridge]], while the Fruitvale Avenue Bridge is a road [[bascule bridge]] that connects Fruitvale Avenue in Oakland with Tilden Avenue in Alameda.\n\n==Rail bridge==\nThe rail bridge is immediately west of the Miller-Sweeney road bridge which connects Fruitvale Avenue in Oakland with Tilden Way in Alameda. It has been out of service since 2000.\n\n===History===\nThis [[lift bridge]] was constructed in 1951 to replace an earlier bridge that originally served the [[East Bay Electric Lines|SP interurban trains]] from [[San Francisco]] (SP's Interurban Electric Railway discontinued service in 1941). From 1951 until September 11, 1996, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] operated freight service across the bridge to serve shippers in Alameda and to connect with the [[Alameda Belt Line]] railroad. After SP was acquired by [[Union Pacific]] on September 11, 1996, UP provided infrequent service to Alameda until service was discontinued in 2000.\n\n===Design===\nThe right-of-way still exists through the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], however, the tracks on both sides of the bridge have been severed and the span remains raised at 65 feet above water level, except when operated for maintenance and testing.  The bridge is owned by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and is operated by the [[Alameda County, California|County of Alameda]].  The Miller-Sweeney bridge tender, a county employee, operates the railroad bridge from controls in the Miller-Sweeney [[bridge tender's house|control house]].  The last train across the bridge ran in 2000.\n\n==Road bridge==\nThe road bridge is officially named the '''Miller-Sweeney Bridge at Fruitvale Avenue'''.<ref name=ACPWA>{{cite web |url=https://www.acpwa.org/pas/miller-sweeny-bridge |title=Miller-Sweeny ''[sic]'' Bridge |author= |date= |publisher=Alameda County Public Works Agency |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> It has no overhead steel structure like the other road bridges between Alameda and Oakland (the [[High Street Bridge]] and the [[Park Street Bridge]]) so tall vehicles should use the Miller-Sweeney Bridge.<ref name=ACPWA /> Miller-Sweeney opens approximately 1,600 times per year to accommodate marine traffic.<ref name=ACPWA />\n\n===History===\nA bridge at this location initially opened in 1894, initially carrying rail traffic.<ref name=ACPWA /> It was regraded to accommodate road traffic, and the train tracks were removed in 1951 with the completion of the dedicated vertical-lift rail bridge.<ref name=ACPWA /> The present Miller-Sweeney Bridge was completed in 1973 by the US Army Corps of Engineers and turned over to Alameda County in 1975.<ref name=ACPWA /> Miller-Sweeney won a prize bridge award for movable spans from the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aisc.org/globalassets/nsba/prize-bridge-brochures/1974prizebridgebrochure.pdf |title=Prize Bridges 1974 |author= |date=1974 |pages=16\u201317 |publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction |accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Miller-Sweeney Bridge was damaged in the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] and was damaged again in 1991 when a fully loaded barge hit the span.<ref name=ACPWA />\n\n===Design===\nThe Miller-Sweeney Bridge is normally opened by two {{convert|75|hp|adj=on}} motors, which take 66 seconds to fully open the bridge to 79\u00b0.<ref name=ACPWA /> The motors typically operate in tandem, drawing electricity from [[Alameda Municipal Power]].
