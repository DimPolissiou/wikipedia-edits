Relying heavily on technology the film predates or anticipates several technologies - as well as cultural habits - that would later become standard online practice and interaction: [[Netiquette]]. The design, look-and-feel, animation, programming, and general technologies used in the overall [[transmedia storytelling|transmedia]] experience was created by Christian D.

This set-up included two-way live video feeds embedded real-time in an interactive interface. The cameras included DV cameras (SONY PD-150 pal, Sony TRV900) and a variety of USB and FireWire web cameras.\n:*Creating a reliable, high quality video signal for the various web chats which connected all the characters. Developing the interfaces for the web chats in the film [[CU-SeeMe|Tim Dorcy]] and his iVisit software were consulted.\n\n:Internet:\n:*All the websites created and used in the film were also made available on the internet.\n:*Extending the reach and universe of the film beyond the movie going experience. This included making the featured websites available online for the audience to explore the back stories as well as future developments of the characters in the film. This meant that the websites had to reflect each characters or mimic the social environment in which it existed.\n:Featured sites:\n:*SilentCity.net.

This would include an extremely wide range of music from vaudeville and minstrel shows to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the [[rock 'n roll]] revolution of the mid-1950s and continues in a definable path to today.}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nAccording to author John Storey, there are various definitions of popular culture.<ref>John Storey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4\u20138</ref> The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much \"[[high culture]]\" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"leftover\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]],[[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Orwell]].\n\nA third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>S\u00e9rgio Campos Gon\u00e7alves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista \u2013 N\u00facleo de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica em Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 UNAERP (Ribeir\u00e3o Preto), v. 3, pp. 18\u201328, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"\n\nStorey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Levels===\nWithin the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>\n\n===Folklore===\nAdaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A. W. Smith ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'', Vol. 104, No. 1/2 (1993), pp. 144\u2013150</ref>\nThis early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of [[joke]]s or [[urban legend]]s. With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves. \n\n== Criticism ==\n[[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] critiqued the mass media in their 1988 work [[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]. They argue that mass media is controlled by a powerful hegemonic elite who are motivated by their own interests that determine and manipulate what information is present in the mainstream. The mass media is therefore a system of propaganda. \n\n{{quotation | \"In sum, a propaganda approach to media coverage suggests a systematic and highly political dichotomization in news coverage based on serviceability to important domestic power interests. This should be observable in dichotomized choices of story and in the volume and quality of coverage... such dichotomization in the mass media is massive and systematic: not only are choices for publicity and suppression comprehensible in terms of system advantage, but the modes of handling favored and inconvenient materials (placement, tone, context, fullness of treatment) differ in ways that serve political ends.\"<ref>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media. 1988. Page 19-20. Noam Chomsky & Edward S. Herman</ref> }}\n\nThe Postmodernist [[Baudrillard]] argued that the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion, since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview:\n\n{{quotation |\"[[The Matrix]] paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message.
