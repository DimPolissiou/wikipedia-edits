Holland further stated of Gaye's voice that it was \"...one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=9}}</ref> And while he noted that ballads and jazz was \"his basic soul\", he stated Gaye \"...had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&B, any kind of song and make it his own\", later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nGaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voice\u2014especially in Norman Whitfield's recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was \"into being produce-able.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/> After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his \"tough man voice\"\u2014saying, \"I developed a growl.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} In the liner notes of his DVD set, ''Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981'', Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed \"three distinct voices: his smooth, sweet tenor; a growling rasp; and an unreal [[falsetto]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=15}}</ref> Bowman further wrote that the recording of the ''What's Going On'' single was \"...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Bowman found that Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles \"summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Social commentary and concept albums===\nPrior to recording the ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, \"[[Abraham, Martin & John]]\", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} including [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by [[The Temptations]] in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 [[Watts riots]] and once asked himself, \"with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=156}} When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do [[protest music]], Gordy cautioned him, \"Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far.\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}}\n\nGaye was inspired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and supported the efforts they put forth like giving free meals to poor families door to door. However, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were [[nonviolent]]. The lyrics and music of ''What's Going On'' discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Party Music : The Inside Story of the Black Panthers' Band and How Black Power Transformed Soul Music|last = Vincet|first = Rickey|publisher = Lawrence Hill Books|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 288\u2013289}}</ref> Gaye was inspired to make this album because of events such as the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riots in Detroit]], and the [[Kent State shootings]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |title=Things Aint Like What They Used to Be: Marvin Gaye and The Making of What's Going On |last=Charnock |first=Ruth |date=2015 |journal=United Academics Journal of Social Sciences |doi= |pmid= |access-date= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120111436/http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOnce Gaye presented Gordy with the ''What's Going On'' album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Following the album's success, Gaye tried a follow-up album that he would label ''[[You're the Man (album)|You're the Man]]''. The [[You're the Man|title track]] only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Later on, several of Gaye's unreleased songs of social commentary, including \"[[The World Is Rated X]]\", would be issued on posthumous compilation albums. ''What's Going On'' would later be described by an [[AllMusic]] writer as an album that \"not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4344/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic (((Marvin Gaye \u2013 Overview)))|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref>  ''You're the Man'' was finally released on March 29, 2019, through [[Motown]], [[Universal Music Enterprises]], and [[Universal Music Group]].<ref name=\"CoS\">{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|title=Marvin Gaye's lost 1972 album You're the Man to receive official release|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Roffman|first=Michael|date=February 8, 2019|accessdate=February 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124247/https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|archive-date=February 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ''What's Going On'' album also provided another first in both Motown and R&B music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album in a [[song cycle]], segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R&B albums that traditionally included [[filler (music)|filler tracks]] to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Barry White]] making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. ''Let's Get It On'' repeated the suite-form arrangement of ''What's Going On'', as would Gaye's later albums such as ''I Want You'', ''Here, My Dear'' and ''In Our Lifetime''.\n\nAlthough Marvin Gaye was not politically active outside of his music, he became a public figure for social change and inspired/educated many people through his work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nMarvin Gaye has been called \"the number-one purveyor of soul music\".{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}} In his book ''Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye'', [[Michael Eric Dyson]] described Gaye as someone \"...who transcended the boundaries of [[rhythm and blues]] as no other performer had done before.\"{{sfn|Dyson|2004|p=3}} Following his [[death of Marvin Gaye|death]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gaye as someone who \"blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |title=Marvin Gaye Is Shot And Killed; Pop Singer's Father Faces Charge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 1984 |access-date=March 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100807/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further in the article, Gaye was also credited with combining \"the soulful directness of gospel music, the sweetness of soft-soul and pop, and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label's signature sound.

He changed his tone to a rasp for his gospel-inspired early hits such as \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\" and \"Hitch Hike\". As writer [[Eddie Holland]] explained, \"He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do whatever it took to sell that song.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn songs such as \"Pride and Joy\", Gaye used three different vocal ranges\u2014singing in his baritone range at the beginning, bringing a lighter tenor in the verses before reaching a gospel mode in the chorus. Holland further stated of Gaye's voice that it was \"...one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=9}}</ref> And while he noted that ballads and jazz was \"his basic soul\", he stated Gaye \"...had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&B, any kind of song and make it his own\", later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nGaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voice\u2014especially in Norman Whitfield's recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was \"into being produce-able.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/> After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his \"tough man voice\"\u2014saying, \"I developed a growl.\"<ref name=\"Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing\"/>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} In the liner notes of his DVD set, ''Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981'', Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed \"three distinct voices: his smooth, sweet tenor; a growling rasp; and an unreal [[falsetto]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964\u20131981 |date=April 2006 |page=15}}</ref> Bowman further wrote that the recording of the ''What's Going On'' single was \"...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Bowman found that Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles \"summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Social commentary and concept albums===\nPrior to recording the ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, \"[[Abraham, Martin & John]]\", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} including [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by [[The Temptations]] in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 [[Watts riots]] and once asked himself, \"with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=156}} When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do [[protest music]], Gordy cautioned him, \"Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far.\"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}}\n\nGaye was inspired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and supported the efforts they put forth like giving free meals to poor families door to door. However, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were [[nonviolent]]. The lyrics and music of ''What's Going On'' discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Party Music : The Inside Story of the Black Panthers' Band and How Black Power Transformed Soul Music|last = Vincet|first = Rickey|publisher = Lawrence Hill Books|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 288\u2013289}}</ref> Gaye was inspired to make this album because of events such as the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riots in Detroit]], and the [[Kent State shootings]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |title=Things Aint Like What They Used to Be: Marvin Gaye and The Making of What's Going On |last=Charnock |first=Ruth |date=2015 |journal=United Academics Journal of Social Sciences |doi= |pmid= |access-date= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120111436/http://www.united-academics.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biography_Marvin-Gaye_Ruth-Charnock.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOnce Gaye presented Gordy with the ''What's Going On'' album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Following the album's success, Gaye tried a follow-up album that he would label ''[[You're the Man (album)|You're the Man]]''. The [[You're the Man|title track]] only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Later on, several of Gaye's unreleased songs of social commentary, including \"[[The World Is Rated X]]\", would be issued on posthumous compilation albums. ''What's Going On'' would later be described by an [[AllMusic]] writer as an album that \"not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4344/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic (((Marvin Gaye \u2013 Overview)))|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref>  ''You're the Man'' was finally released on March 29, 2019, through [[Motown]], [[Universal Music Enterprises]], and [[Universal Music Group]].<ref name=\"CoS\">{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|title=Marvin Gaye's lost 1972 album You're the Man to receive official release|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Roffman|first=Michael|date=February 8, 2019|accessdate=February 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124247/https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/marvin-gaye-youre-the-man-official-release/|archive-date=February 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ''What's Going On'' album also provided another first in both Motown and R&B music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album in a [[song cycle]], segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R&B albums that traditionally included [[filler (music)|filler tracks]] to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Barry White]] making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. ''Let's Get It On'' repeated the suite-form arrangement of ''What's Going On'', as would Gaye's later albums such as ''I Want You'', ''Here, My Dear'' and ''In Our Lifetime''.\n\nAlthough Marvin Gaye was not politically active outside of his music, he became a public figure for social change and inspired/educated many people through his work.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nMarvin Gaye has been called \"the number-one purveyor of soul music\".{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}} In his book ''Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye'', [[Michael Eric Dyson]] described Gaye as someone \"...who transcended the boundaries of [[rhythm and blues]] as no other performer had done before.\"{{sfn|Dyson|2004|p=3}} Following his [[death of Marvin Gaye|death]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Gaye as someone who \"blended the soul music of the urban scene with the beat of the old-time gospel singer and became an influential force in pop music\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |title=Marvin Gaye Is Shot And Killed; Pop Singer's Father Faces Charge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 1984 |access-date=March 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100807/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further in the article, Gaye was also credited with combining \"the soulful directness of gospel music, the sweetness of soft-soul and pop, and the vocal musicianship of a jazz singer.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> His recordings for Motown in the 1960s and 1970s shaped that label's signature sound.

(Jeffrey Seth)|isbn=978-1-4292-2462-8|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=38|oclc=473463742}}</ref> For instance, if the [[random variable]] {{mvar|X}} is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (\"the experiment\"), then the probability distribution of {{mvar|X}} would take the value 0.5 for {{math|''X''&nbsp;{{=}} heads}}, and 0.5 for {{math|''X''&nbsp;{{=}} tails}} (assuming the coin is fair).  Examples of random phenomena can include the results of an [[Experiment (probability theory)|experiment]] or [[Survey methodology|survey]].\n\nA probability distribution is specified in terms of an underlying [[sample space]], which is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible [[Outcome (probability)|outcomes]] of the random phenomenon being observed. The sample space may be the set of [[real numbers]] or a set of [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]], or it may be a list of non-numerical values; for example, the sample space of a coin flip would be {{math|{heads, tails} }}.\n\nProbability distributions are generally divided into two classes. A '''discrete probability distribution''' (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]], such as a coin toss or a roll of dice) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a [[probability mass function]]. On the other hand, a '''continuous probability distribution''' (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature on a given day) is typically described by [[probability density function]]s (with the probability of any individual outcome actually being 0). The [[normal distribution]] is a commonly encountered continuous probability distribution. More complex experiments, such as those involving [[stochastic processes]] defined in [[continuous time]], may demand the use of more general [[probability measure]]s.\n\nA probability distribution whose sample space is one-dimensional (for example real numbers, list of labels, ordered labels or binary) is called [[Univariate distribution|univariate]], while a distribution whose sample space is a [[vector space]] of dimension 2 or more is called [[Multivariate distribution|multivariate]]. A univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single [[random variable]] taking on various alternative values; a multivariate distribution (a [[joint probability distribution]]) gives the probabilities of a [[random vector]] \u2013 a list of two or more random variables \u2013 taking on various combinations of values. Important and commonly encountered univariate probability distributions include the [[binomial distribution]], the [[hypergeometric distribution]], and the [[normal distribution]]. The [[multivariate normal distribution]] is a commonly encountered multivariate distribution.\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Dice Distribution (bar).svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[probability mass function]] (pmf) ''p''(''S'') specifies the probability distribution for the sum ''S'' of counts from two [[dice]].  For example, the figure shows that ''p''(11) = 2/36 = 1/18.  The pmf allows the computation of probabilities of events such as ''P''(''S'' > 9) = 1/12 + 1/18 + 1/36 = 1/6, and all other probabilities in the distribution.]]\n\nTo define probability distributions for the simplest cases, it is necessary to distinguish between '''discrete''' and '''continuous''' [[random variable]]s. In the discrete case, it is sufficient to specify a [[probability mass function]] <math>p</math> assigning a probability to each possible outcome: for example, when throwing a fair [[die]], each of the six values 1 to 6 has the probability 1/6. The probability of an [[Event (probability theory)|event]] is then defined to be the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes that satisfy the event; for example, the probability of the event \"the dice rolls an even value\" is \n:<math>p(2) + p(4) + p(6) = 1/6+1/6+1/6=1/2.</math>\n\nIn contrast, when a random variable takes values from a continuum then typically, any individual outcome has probability zero and only events that include infinitely many outcomes, such as intervals, can have positive probability. For example, the probability that a given object weighs ''exactly'' 500&nbsp;g is zero, because the probability of measuring exactly 500&nbsp;g tends to zero as the accuracy of our measuring instruments increases. Nevertheless, in quality control one might demand that the probability of a \"500&nbsp;g\" package containing between 490&nbsp;g and 510&nbsp;g should be no less than 98%, and this demand is less sensitive to the accuracy of measurement instruments.\n\nContinuous probability distributions can be described in several ways. The [[probability density function]] describes the [[infinitesimal]] probability of any given value, and the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by [[Integration (mathematics)|integrating]] the probability density function over that interval. The probability that the possible values lie in some fixed interval can be related to the way sums converge to an integral; therefore, continuous probability is based on the definition of an integral. \n[[File:Combined Cumulative Distribution Graphs.png|thumb|455x455px|On the right is the probability density function. On the left is the cumulative distribution function, which is the area under the probability density curve.]]\nThe [[cumulative distribution function]] describes the probability that the random variable is no larger than a given value; the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by taking the difference between the values of the cumulative distribution function at the endpoints of the interval. The cumulative distribution function is the [[antiderivative]] of the probability density function provided that the latter function exists. The cumulative distribution function is the area under the [[probability density function]] from minus infinity <math>\\infty</math> to <math>x</math> as described by the picture to the right.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how|date=2005|publisher=Springer|others=Dekking, Michel, 1946-|isbn=978-1-85233-896-1|location=London|oclc=262680588}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Standard deviation diagram.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[probability density function]] (pdf) of the [[normal distribution]], also called Gaussian or \"bell curve\", the most important continuous random distribution.

Note however that the points where the cdf jumps may form a dense set of the real numbers. The points where jumps occur are precisely the values which the random variable may take.\n\n===Delta-function representation===\nConsequently, a discrete probability distribution is often represented as a generalized [[probability density function]] involving [[Dirac delta function]]s, which substantially unifies the treatment of continuous and discrete distributions.

Equivalently, it is a probability distribution on the [[real numbers]] that is [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]]. Such distributions can be represented by their [[probability density function]]s. If the distribution of ''X'' is continuous, then ''X'' is called a '''continuous random variable'''. There are many examples of continuous probability distributions: [[normal distribution|normal]], [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]], [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]], and [[List of probability distributions#Continuous distributions|others]].\n\nFormally, if ''X'' is a continuous random variable, then it has a [[probability density function]] ''\u0192''(''x''), and therefore its probability of falling into a given interval, say {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}}, is given by the integral\n: <math>\n    \\operatorname{P}[a\\le X\\le b] = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n  </math>\nIn particular, the probability for ''X'' to take any single value ''a'' (that is {{nowrap|''a'' \u2264 ''X'' \u2264 ''a''}}) is zero, because an [[integral]] with coinciding upper and lower limits is always equal to zero.\n\nNote on terminology: some authors use the term \"continuous distribution\" to denote distributions whose cumulative distribution functions are [[continuous function|continuous]], rather than [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]]. These distributions are the ones <math>\\mu</math> such that <math>\\mu\\{x\\}\\,=\\,0</math> for all <math>\\,x</math>. This definition includes the (absolutely) continuous distributions defined above, but it also includes [[singular distribution]]s, which are neither absolutely continuous nor discrete nor a mixture of those, and do not have a density. An example is given by the [[Cantor distribution]].\n\n==Some properties==\n* The probability distribution of the sum of two independent random variables is the '''[[convolution]]''' of each of their distributions.\n* Probability distributions are not a [[vector space]]\u2014they are not closed under [[linear combination]]s, as these do not preserve non-negativity or total integral 1\u2014but they are closed under [[convex combination]], thus forming a [[convex subset]] of the space of functions (or measures).\n\n== [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] definition ==\n{{Main|Probability space|Probability measure}}\n\nIn the [[measure theory|measure-theoretic]] formalization of [[probability theory]], a [[random variable]] is defined as a [[measurable function]] <math>X</math> from a [[probability space]] <math>(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})</math> to a [[measurable space]] <math>(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{A})</math>.

There is spread or variability in almost any value that can be measured in a population (e.g. height of people, durability of a metal, sales growth, traffic flow, etc.); almost all measurements are made with some intrinsic error; in physics many processes are described probabilistically, from the [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic properties of gases]] to the [[quantum mechanical]] description of [[fundamental particles]]. For these and many other reasons, simple [[number]]s are often inadequate for describing a quantity, while probability distributions are often more appropriate.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the most common probability distributions, grouped by the type of process that they are related to. For a more complete list, see [[list of probability distributions]], which groups by the nature of the outcome being considered (discrete, continuous, multivariate, etc.)\n\nAll of the univariate distributions below are singly peaked; that is, it is assumed that the values cluster around a single point.

Examples of random phenomena can include the results of an [[Experiment (probability theory)|experiment]] or [[Survey methodology|survey]].\n\nA probability distribution is specified in terms of an underlying [[sample space]], which is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible [[Outcome (probability)|outcomes]] of the random phenomenon being observed. The sample space may be the set of [[real numbers]] or a set of [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]], or it may be a list of non-numerical values; for example, the sample space of a coin flip would be {{math|{heads, tails} }}.\n\nProbability distributions are generally divided into two classes. A '''discrete probability distribution''' (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]], such as a coin toss or a roll of dice) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a [[probability mass function]]. On the other hand, a '''continuous probability distribution''' (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature on a given day) is typically described by [[probability density function]]s (with the probability of any individual outcome actually being 0). The [[normal distribution]] is a commonly encountered continuous probability distribution. More complex experiments, such as those involving [[stochastic processes]] defined in [[continuous time]], may demand the use of more general [[probability measure]]s.\n\nA probability distribution whose sample space is one-dimensional (for example real numbers, list of labels, ordered labels or binary) is called [[Univariate distribution|univariate]], while a distribution whose sample space is a [[vector space]] of dimension 2 or more is called [[Multivariate distribution|multivariate]]. A univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single [[random variable]] taking on various alternative values; a multivariate distribution (a [[joint probability distribution]]) gives the probabilities of a [[random vector]] \u2013 a list of two or more random variables \u2013 taking on various combinations of values. Important and commonly encountered univariate probability distributions include the [[binomial distribution]], the [[hypergeometric distribution]], and the [[normal distribution]]. The [[multivariate normal distribution]] is a commonly encountered multivariate distribution.\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Dice Distribution (bar).svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[probability mass function]] (pmf) ''p''(''S'') specifies the probability distribution for the sum ''S'' of counts from two [[dice]].  For example, the figure shows that ''p''(11) = 2/36 = 1/18.  The pmf allows the computation of probabilities of events such as ''P''(''S'' > 9) = 1/12 + 1/18 + 1/36 = 1/6, and all other probabilities in the distribution.]]\n\nTo define probability distributions for the simplest cases, it is necessary to distinguish between '''discrete''' and '''continuous''' [[random variable]]s. In the discrete case, it is sufficient to specify a [[probability mass function]] <math>p</math> assigning a probability to each possible outcome: for example, when throwing a fair [[dice]], each of the six values 1 to 6 has the probability 1/6. The probability of an [[Event (probability theory)|event]] is then defined to be the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes that satisfy the event; for example, the probability of the event \"the dice rolls an even value\" is \n:<math>p(2) + p(4) + p(6) = 1/6+1/6+1/6=1/2.</math>\n\nIn contrast, when a random variable takes values from a continuum then typically, any individual outcome has probability zero and only events that include infinitely many outcomes, such as intervals, can have positive probability. For example, the probability that a given object weighs ''exactly'' 500&nbsp;g is zero, because the probability of measuring exactly 500&nbsp;g tends to zero as the accuracy of our measuring instruments increases. Nevertheless, in quality control one might demand that the probability of a \"500&nbsp;g\" package containing between 490&nbsp;g and 510&nbsp;g should be no less than 98%, and this demand is less sensitive to the accuracy of measurement instruments.\n\nContinuous probability distributions can be described in several ways. The [[probability density function]] describes the [[infinitesimal]] probability of any given value, and the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by [[Integration (mathematics)|integrating]] the probability density function over that interval. The probability that the possible values lie in some fixed interval can be related to the way sums converge to an integral; therefore, continuous probability is based on the definition of an integral. \n[[File:Combined Cumulative Distribution Graphs.png|thumb|455x455px|On the right is the probability density function. On the left is the cumulative distribution function, which is the area under the probability density curve.]]\nThe [[cumulative distribution function]] describes the probability that the random variable is no larger than a given value; the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by taking the difference between the values of the cumulative distribution function at the endpoints of the interval.

Note however that the points where the cdf jumps may form a dense set of the real numbers. The points where jumps occur are precisely the values which the random variable may take.\n\n===Delta-function representation===\nConsequently, a discrete probability distribution is often represented as a generalized [[probability density function]] involving [[Dirac delta function]]s, which substantially unifies the treatment of continuous and discrete distributions.

Equivalently, it is a probability distribution on the [[real numbers]] that is [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]]. Such distributions can be represented by their [[probability density function]]s. If the distribution of ''X'' is continuous, then ''X'' is called a '''continuous random variable'''. There are many examples of continuous probability distributions: [[normal distribution|normal]], [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]], [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]], and [[List of probability distributions#Continuous distributions|others]].\n\nFormally, if ''X'' is a continuous random variable, then it has a [[probability density function]] ''\u0192''(''x''), and therefore its probability of falling into a given interval, say {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}}, is given by the integral\n: <math>\n    \\operatorname{P}[a\\le X\\le b] = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n  </math>\nIn particular, the probability for ''X'' to take any single value ''a'' (that is {{nowrap|''a'' \u2264 ''X'' \u2264 ''a''}}) is zero, because an [[integral]] with coinciding upper and lower limits is always equal to zero.\n\nNote on terminology: some authors use the term \"continuous distribution\" to denote distributions whose cumulative distribution functions are [[continuous function|continuous]], rather than [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]]. These distributions are the ones <math>\\mu</math> such that <math>\\mu\\{x\\}\\,=\\,0</math> for all <math>\\,x</math>. This definition includes the (absolutely) continuous distributions defined above, but it also includes [[singular distribution]]s, which are neither absolutely continuous nor discrete nor a mixture of those, and do not have a density. An example is given by the [[Cantor distribution]].\n\n==Some properties==\n* The probability distribution of the sum of two independent random variables is the '''[[convolution]]''' of each of their distributions.\n* Probability distributions are not a [[vector space]]\u2014they are not closed under [[linear combination]]s, as these do not preserve non-negativity or total integral 1\u2014but they are closed under [[convex combination]], thus forming a [[convex subset]] of the space of functions (or measures).\n\n== [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] definition ==\n{{Main|Probability space|Probability measure}}\n\nIn the [[measure theory|measure-theoretic]] formalization of [[probability theory]], a [[random variable]] is defined as a [[measurable function]] <math>X</math> from a [[probability space]] <math>(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})</math> to a [[measurable space]] <math>(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{A})</math>. Given that probabilities of events of the form <math>\\{\\omega\\in\\Omega\\mid X(\\omega)\\in A\\}</math> satisfy [[Probability axioms|Kolmogorov's probability axioms]], the '''probability distribution of ''X''''' is the [[pushforward measure]] <math>X_*\\mathbb{P}</math> of <math>X</math> , which is a [[probability measure]] on <math>(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{A})</math> satisfying <math>X_*\\mathbb{P} = \\mathbb{P}X^{-1}</math>.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Probability theory : an analytic view|last=W.|first=Stroock, Daniel|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521663496|edition= Rev.|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=11|oclc=43953136}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Foundations of the theory of probability|last=Kolmogorov|first=Andrey|publisher=Chelsea Publishing Company|year=1950|isbn=|location=New York, USA|pages=21\u201324|orig-year=1933}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/ma217/axioms.pdf|title=Axioms of Probability|last=Joyce|first=David|date=2014|website=Clark University|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Random number generation==\n{{Main|Pseudo-random number sampling}}\n\nMost algorithms are based on a [[pseudorandom number generator]] that produces numbers ''X'' that are uniformly distributed in the [[half-open interval]] [0,1).

There is spread or variability in almost any value that can be measured in a population (e.g. height of people, durability of a metal, sales growth, traffic flow, etc.); almost all measurements are made with some intrinsic error; in physics many processes are described probabilistically, from the [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic properties of gases]] to the [[quantum mechanical]] description of [[fundamental particles]]. For these and many other reasons, simple [[number]]s are often inadequate for describing a quantity, while probability distributions are often more appropriate.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the most common probability distributions, grouped by the type of process that they are related to. For a more complete list, see [[list of probability distributions]], which groups by the nature of the outcome being considered (discrete, continuous, multivariate, etc.)\n\nAll of the univariate distributions below are singly peaked; that is, it is assumed that the values cluster around a single point.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The British-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (second from right) and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] (left foreground) meet for talks in Bermuda in March 1957 to repair the rift created by the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].]]\nAt the three-power Bermuda Conference in December 1953, Eisenhower and Churchill,{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} who had become prime minister again on 25 October 1951,{{sfn|Farmelo|2013|pp=372\u2013375}} discussed the possibility of the United States giving Britain access to American nuclear weapons in wartime.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} This came to be called [[Project E]].{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}} There were technical and legal issues that had to be overcome before American bombs could be carried in British aircraft. The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK. He ordered extra copies of the report into the fire to be destroyed, and for the printers to destroy their [[Letterpress printing|type]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Britain Suppressed Details of '57 Atomic Disaster: Macmillan feared the loss of U.S. cooperation |first=Steve |last=Lohr |date=2 January 1988 |p=3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/02/world/britain-suppressed-details-of-57-atomic-disaster.html |access-date=18 August 2019 }}</ref> He immediately sensed how shaken the Americans had been by Sputnik.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of IRBMs by a shocked and distraught nation.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nEisenhower and Macmillan agreed to form a study group headed by Sir Richard Powell, the Permanent Secretary to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and [[Donald A. Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

Standing are (left to right): [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]] ([[Governor General of Canada]]), [[Mackenzie King]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]]), Sir [[Alexander Cadogan]], and [[Brendan Bracken]].]]\nDuring the early part of the [[Second World War]], Britain had a [[nuclear weapons]] project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108\u2013111}} At the [[Quadrant Conference]] in August 1943, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Winston Churchill]], and the [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], signed the [[Quebec Agreement]], which merged Tube Alloys with the American [[Manhattan Project]] to create a combined British, American and Canadian project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=277}} The Quebec Agreement established the [[Combined Policy Committee]] and the [[Combined Development Trust]] to co-ordinate their efforts.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285\u2013286}} Many of Britain's top scientists [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|participated in the Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=236\u2013242}}\n\nThe September 1944 [[Hyde Park Aide-M\u00e9moire]] extended both commercial and military co-operation into the post-war period,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=340\u2013342}} but Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and it was not binding on subsequent administrations.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=72\u201373}} In fact, it was physically lost. When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement.

Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed.

Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P.

It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons.

The report states that policies in the 1982 memorandum continue to be appropriate at the current funding level and that present U.S. policy and practice with respect to the U.S. Antarctic Program are well justified.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Early U.S. expeditions to Antarctica ===\nThe first Americans to work in the Antarctic were sealers and whalers who discovered many sub-Antarctic islands. They were first to explore parts of the great peninsula jutting out of the Antarctic mainland toward South America. Among them was Nathaniel Palmer, who was among the first to see Antarctica, while on board the ''Hero'' in 1820, though historians have not settled the question of who discovered Antarctica. James Eights, a geologist from Albany, New York, became the first U.S. scientist to work in Antarctica. In 1830, aboard the ''Annawan'', Eights made investigations in the South Shetland Islands and westward along the Antarctic Peninsula.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/travelAndDeployment/documents/ParticipantGuide_2016-18.pdf|title=United States Antarctic Program: Participant Guide 2016\u20132018 Edition|website=The United States Antarctic Program|access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nExpeditions sponsored by several nations approached the Antarctic continent early in the 19th century. Among the leaders was Charles Wilkes, a U.S. Navy lieutenant who commanded an expedition in 1839\u201340 that was the first to prove the existence of the continent. His expedition mapped about 2,400&nbsp;km (1,500 miles) of Antarctic coastline in the Indian and Australian quadrants.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1928\u20131930 and 1933\u20131935, Admiral Richard E. Byrd led two privately sponsored expeditions, one that included the first flight over the South Pole in 1929, sparking U.S. interest in Antarctica. The U.S. Antarctic Service Expedition (1939\u20131940), under the leadership of the U.S. Navy, maintained bases at Marguerite Bay and Bay of Whales.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Operation Highjump]] in 1946\u20131947 was the largest single expedition ever to explore Antarctica, involving 13 naval vessels, numerous airplanes and more than 4,700 men. The next year, the Navy's Operation Windmill used helicopters to complete some of the work begun during Highjump.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== The International Geophysical Year and the Antarctic Treaty ===\nIn 1956\u201357 the U.S. Navy, during [[Operation Deep Freeze]] I, and in conjunction with research teams funded by the National Science Foundation, established seven research stations in Antarctica to prepare for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY, 1957\u201358). The IGY was an intensive, multi-national, multi-disciplinary, global research effort designed to study a wide range of geophysical processes. Much of that effort took place in Antarctica and was crucial in establishing Antarctica as a continent for peace and science.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe international coordination that resulted from the IGY ultimately lead to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], which was signed in 1959. Since then, Treaty nations have agreed to several addenda, including the 1991 Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty which establishes rules and procedures specifically designed to protect the Antarctic environment. The Protocol was ratified and went into effect in 1998.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== The U.S. Antarctic Program Today ==\nThe U.S. Antarctic Program operates three year-round research stations and two research vessels. Additional temporary field camps are constructed and operated during the austral summer.\n\n=== McMurdo Station ===\n[[McMurdo Station]] (77\u00b051' S, 166\u00b040' E), the largest U.S. station in Antarctica, is situated on barren volcanic hills at the southern tip of Ross Island, about {{convert|3,827|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Christchurch, New Zealand and {{convert|1,350|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the South Pole. The station sits on the eastern shore of McMurdo Sound, the southernmost body of seasonally open water in the world. Mount Erebus, a {{convert|3,794|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} high active volcano, towers over Ross Island. On the west side of the Sound, the Royal Society Range and Mount Discovery, an extinct volcano, provide spectacular vistas. The mean annual temperature is {{convert|-18|C|F}}. Temperatures may reach as high as {{convert|8|C|F}} in summer and {{convert|-50|C|F}} in winter. The average wind speed is {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}}, but winds have exceeded {{convert|100|kn}}.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/travelAndDeployment/documents/ParticipantGuide_2018-20.pdf|title=United States Antarctic Program: Participant Guide 2018\u20132020 Edition|website=The United States Antarctic Program|access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nMcMurdo Sound is a historic area. In 1841, James Clark Ross brought his ships HMS ''Erebus'' and HMS ''Terror'' into the Sound, farther south than anyone had ever gone, before sailing eastward along a great wall of ice. He and his crew were the first humans to see the island and the ice shelf that both now bear his name. In 1902, Robert F. Scott wintered HMS ''Discovery'' in Winter Quarters Bay, adjacent to the station. Both of Scott's (1901\u20131904 and 1910\u20131913) and Ernest Shackleton's (1907\u20131909 and 1914\u20131916) expeditions used the area as a base to deploy sledging parties for both scientific exploration and attempts to reach the South Pole. The huts these expeditions built still stand today at Hut Point, Cape Evans, and Cape Royds.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe original station was constructed in 1955\u20131956. With many additions and modernizations over the years, today's station is the primary logistics facility for airborne and overland resupply of inland stations and field science projects. The station is also the waste management center for much of the USAP.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMcMurdo has two airfields. Phoenix Airfield, located about {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} from McMurdo on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, accommodates wheeled aircraft. Williams Field Skiway, located about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from McMurdo is for ski-equipped aircraft only. McMurdo also has a heliport to support helicopter operations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nApproximately 90% of USAP participants live in or pass through McMurdo Station. The austral winter population ranges from 150 to 200, with the summer population varying between 800 and 1,000. The station has routine weekly flights to and from New Zealand during the austral summer (October \u2013 February), a period called \"Mainbody,\" with fewer flights during the winter months (March \u2013 September).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station ===\n[[South Pole Station]] is located at the geographic South Pole, on the polar plateau, at an elevation of 2,835 m (9,300&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The station sits on an ice sheet that is 2,700 m (8,858&nbsp;ft) thick and drifts with the ice at about 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) a year toward the Weddell Sea.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe mean annual temperature is \u201349&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u201356&nbsp;\u00b0F). Average monthly temperatures range from \u201328&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u201318&nbsp;\u00b0F) in the summer to \u201360&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u201376&nbsp;\u00b0F) in winter. The record high of \u2013 l2.3&nbsp;\u00b0C (9.9&nbsp;\u00b0F) was recorded in December 2011, and the record low of \u201382.8&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u2013117&nbsp;\u00b0F) was recorded in June 1982. The site has very low humidity, and precipitation is only about 20&nbsp;cm of snow (8&nbsp;cm water equivalent) per year. Drifting is the primary cause of snow accumulation around buildings. Average wind speed is 10.8 knots.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe original station was built in 1956-1957 and is buried beneath the ice. A second station, located under a geodesic dome, was completed in 1975. The Dome was dismantled in 2009-10 and removed from the continent. The current station was dedicated on January 12, 2008. The winter population is around 45, and the summer population averages 150.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMost Antarctic Program personnel and cargo reach the South Pole from McMurdo Station via LC-130 ski-equipped aircraft, whereas most fuel IS transported via surface traverse from McMurdo Station. The short austral summer, when most activity occurs, is from late October through mid-February. The station is isolated for the rest of the year.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nResearch at the South Pole includes astronomy, astrophysics, aeronomy, auroral and geospace studies, meteorology, geomagnetism, seismology, earth-tide measurements, and glaciology.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Palmer Station ===\n[[Palmer Station]], on the Antarctic Peninsula region, is named after Nathaniel B. Palmer, the American sealer who pioneered exploration of the Peninsula in 1820. The station is located on Anvers Island at 64\u00b046' S, 64\u00b003\u2019 W and consists of two major buildings and several small ones. There is no airfield.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLocated just north of the Antarctic Circle, the climate is milder than that of the other U.S. Antarctic stations. Temperatures in the summer range from just below freezing to above 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (40&nbsp;\u00b0F). Winter temperatures range from 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) to -10&nbsp;\u00b0C (14&nbsp;\u00b0F). Palmer Station is often windy and wet, with both snow and rain. The water equivalent in snow and rain averages 81&nbsp;cm (32&nbsp;in) per year. Wildlife is abundant near the station, which makes it superbly located for ecosystem research.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStation population is about 44 in the summer and 20 or more in winter. Unlike South Pole and McMurdo stations, Palmer usually receives transportation year-round and does not generally have a period of winter isolation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Research vessels ===\n[[Nathaniel B. Palmer (icebreaker)|RVIB ''Nathaniel B. Palmer'']] is {{convert|94|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and is able to break {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} of ice at a continuous forward speed of {{convert|3|kn|spell=in}}. ''Nathanial B. Palmer'' is a modern, multi-disciplinary research vessel containing six laboratories with a combined space of {{convert|353.5|m2|abbr=on}}. It can accommodate 39 scientists and ASC personnel and operates throughout the Southern Ocean.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[RV Laurence M. Gould|ASRV ''Laurence M.

Managed by the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS), the goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polartrec.com/about|title=About PolarTREC {{!}} PolarTREC|website=www.polartrec.com|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n== Logistics ==\nAntarctica is the most remote region of the world, with no native inhabitants or infrastructure and nearly no vegetation. Working in such a hostile environment requires specialized systems to keep scientists and support staff safe and equipment operational.\n\n=== Airplanes ===\nThe Antarctic Program uses a variety of aircraft to transport people and cargo to and from Antarctica, as well as throughout the continent. McMurdo Station maintains two landing strips on the adjacent McMurdo Ice Shelf: Williams Airfield for ski-equipped planes, and Phoenix Airfield for wheeled planes. U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes and unique New York Air National Guard ski-equipped turboprop planes ferry people and cargo between Christchurch, New Zealand and McMurdo Station. During the peak of the Antarctic summer, the ice runways aren't able to support the weight of wheeled aircraft and only planes that can take off and land on skis can operate.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFor transportation across the vast distances around the continent, the Program uses a combination of ski-equipped LC-130s flown by Air Guard's 109th Airlift Wing and ski-equipped Basler and Twin Otter planes through a contract with through Ken Borek Air, Ltd.. Ski-equipped planes can land on groomed and maintained ski runways like those at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and other field camps, or in relatively smooth ungroomed snow.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Helicopters ===\nThe program maintains a small fleet of helicopters, under contract, at McMurdo Station to transport people and cargo around the immediate area of the station. Helicopters also carry scientific survey equipment and reconnoiter landing and scientific sites. Occasionally some of the helicopters will be temporarily set up at larger field camps to enable transport around an otherwise inaccessible region. The current helicopter support contract is held by Air Center Helicopters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4336|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: Helo Ops|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Traverses ===\nTractor-pulled convoys or \u201ctraverses\u201d are used to transport large quantities of fuel and cargo across large distances. Every year three traverses carrying more than 100,000 gallons of fuel drive the {{convert|1,600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from McMurdo Station to Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to deliver fuel for the next year.

Palmer (icebreaker)|RVIB ''Nathaniel B. Palmer'']] and [[RV Laurence M. Gould|ASRV ''Laurence M. Gould'']]. The ships are used to both transport people and supplies between Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, and the port at Punta Arenas, Chile, and to embark on longer science-focused voyages to understand the Southern Ocean or visit other remote areas of the continent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4359|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: Marine Operations|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nSmaller boats at Palmer Station, including inflatable rafts and larger rigid-hulled inflatable boats, are used to transport scientists around the islands near the station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4275|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Bigger Boats, Better Science|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nMcMurdo Station is resupplied by ship at the end of every summer season. The U.S. Coast Guard heavy icebreaker ''Polar Star'' cuts a channel for a cargo ship to pass through and reach the ice pier at the station. A fuel tanker usually follows the cargo vessel to deliver fuel.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Vehicles and transport ===\nThe Program has a fleet of vehicles to meet a range of needs at each station. A variety of large and small loaders are used to move cargo and other heavy equipment around. Tracked vehicles, including PistenBullys and Hagglunds transport people and equipment over snow and ice covered regions. Smaller snowmobiles are also used for transport across snow and ice-covered areas as well. \u201cIvan the Terra Bus\u201d and the large Kress are used to transport large numbers of people to and from the airfields over the ice roads of McMurdo Station. Passenger vans with wide tires are also used to transport people around McMurdo Station and Amundsen-Scott South Pole station as well. McMurdo Station also has a small fleet of pickup trucks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4319|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: McMurdo Station on the Move|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Power/water/wastewater ===\nEach station uses diesel fuel to generate electricity. At McMurdo Station, wind turbines installed by Antarctic New Zealand in 2010 supply about a third of the station's electricity in a cooperative agreement with ANZ. Field camps have been increasingly using solar power, taking advantage of the 24 hours of daylight during the Antarctic summer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nReverse osmosis is used to desalinize sea water for drinking at McMurdo and Palmer stations. Potable water at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which sits atop an ice sheet nearly three kilometers (two miles) thick, is produced by melting ice.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWastewater is treated by the base wastewater plant using the activated sludge process.The effluent is sterilized using ultra violet light and discharged back into McMurdo Sound. Waste sludge is dried by being processed with a belt filter press and then boxed up for shipment back to the United States for incineration.\n\n=== Food ===\nEach station has its own kitchen and cafeteria. Food is provided free-of-charge to program participants and official visitors. The cafeterias serve breakfast, lunch, dinners, and a midnight meal for the night shift. Each station has a range of rotating entrees. Fresh fruit and vegetables, known colloquially as \u201cfreshies,\u201d are popular items, but because of their short shelf life are not always available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4329|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: Feeding McMurdo|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nLarge field camps often have their own chef that cooks large group meals from shelf-stable supplies sent out at the beginning of their field season. At smaller field camps, cooking duties are often shared with other responsibilities amongst camp staff or researchers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Current Developments ==\n\n=== AIMS ===\nThe Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) is a ten-year construction project to upgrade and update McMurdo Station's infrastructure.

The report states that policies in the 1982 memorandum continue to be appropriate at the current funding level and that present U.S. policy and practice with respect to the U.S. Antarctic Program are well justified.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Early U.S. expeditions to Antarctica ===\nThe first Americans to work in the Antarctic were sealers and whalers who discovered many sub-Antarctic islands. They were first to explore parts of the great peninsula jutting out of the Antarctic mainland toward South America. Among them was Nathaniel Palmer, who was among the first to see Antarctica, while on board the ''Hero'' in 1820, though historians have not settled the question of who discovered Antarctica. James Eights, a geologist from Albany, New York, became the first U.S. scientist to work in Antarctica. In 1830, aboard the ''Annawan'', Eights made investigations in the South Shetland Islands and westward along the Antarctic Peninsula.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/travelAndDeployment/documents/ParticipantGuide_2016-18.pdf|title=United States Antarctic Program: Participant Guide 2016\u20132018 Edition|website=The United States Antarctic Program|access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nExpeditions sponsored by several nations approached the Antarctic continent early in the 19th century. Among the leaders was Charles Wilkes, a U.S. Navy lieutenant who commanded an expedition in 1839\u201340 that was the first to prove the existence of the continent. His expedition mapped about 2,400&nbsp;km (1,500 miles) of Antarctic coastline in the Indian and Australian quadrants.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1928\u20131930 and 1933\u20131935, Admiral Richard E. Byrd led two privately sponsored expeditions, one that included the first flight over the South Pole in 1929, sparking U.S. interest in Antarctica. The U.S. Antarctic Service Expedition (1939\u20131940), under the leadership of the U.S. Navy, maintained bases at Marguerite Bay and Bay of Whales.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Operation Highjump]] in 1946\u20131947 was the largest single expedition ever to explore Antarctica, involving 13 naval vessels, numerous airplanes and more than 4,700 men. The next year, the Navy's Operation Windmill used helicopters to complete some of the work begun during Highjump.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== The International Geophysical Year and the Antarctic Treaty ===\nIn 1956\u201357 the U.S. Navy, during [[Operation Deep Freeze]] I, and in conjunction with research teams funded by the National Science Foundation, established seven research stations in Antarctica to prepare for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY, 1957\u201358). The IGY was an intensive, multi-national, multi-disciplinary, global research effort designed to study a wide range of geophysical processes. Much of that effort took place in Antarctica and was crucial in establishing Antarctica as a continent for peace and science.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe international coordination that resulted from the IGY ultimately lead to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], which was signed in 1959. Since then, Treaty nations have agreed to several addenda, including the 1991 Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty which establishes rules and procedures specifically designed to protect the Antarctic environment. The Protocol was ratified and went into effect in 1998.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== The U.S. Antarctic Program Today ==\nThe U.S. Antarctic Program operates three year-round research stations and two research vessels. Additional temporary field camps are constructed and operated during the austral summer.\n\n=== McMurdo Station ===\n[[McMurdo Station]] (77\u00b051' S, 166\u00b040' E), the largest U.S. station in Antarctica, is situated on barren volcanic hills at the southern tip of Ross Island, about {{convert|3,827|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Christchurch, New Zealand and {{convert|1,350|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the South Pole. The station sits on the eastern shore of McMurdo Sound, the southernmost body of seasonally open water in the world. Mount Erebus, a {{convert|3,794|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} high active volcano, towers over Ross Island. On the west side of the Sound, the Royal Society Range and Mount Discovery, an extinct volcano, provide spectacular vistas. The mean annual temperature is {{convert|-18|C|F}}. Temperatures may reach as high as {{convert|8|C|F}} in summer and {{convert|-50|C|F}} in winter. The average wind speed is {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}}, but winds have exceeded {{convert|100|kn}}.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/travelAndDeployment/documents/ParticipantGuide_2018-20.pdf|title=United States Antarctic Program: Participant Guide 2018\u20132020 Edition|website=The United States Antarctic Program|access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nMcMurdo Sound is a historic area. In 1841, James Clark Ross brought his ships HMS ''Erebus'' and HMS ''Terror'' into the Sound, farther south than anyone had ever gone, before sailing eastward along a great wall of ice. He and his crew were the first humans to see the island and the ice shelf that both now bear his name. In 1902, Robert F. Scott wintered HMS ''Discovery'' in Winter Quarters Bay, adjacent to the station. Both of Scott's (1901\u20131904 and 1910\u20131913) and Ernest Shackleton's (1907\u20131909 and 1914\u20131916) expeditions used the area as a base to deploy sledging parties for both scientific exploration and attempts to reach the South Pole. The huts these expeditions built still stand today at Hut Point, Cape Evans, and Cape Royds.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe original station was constructed in 1955\u20131956. With many additions and modernizations over the years, today's station is the primary logistics facility for airborne and overland resupply of inland stations and field science projects. The station is also the waste management center for much of the USAP.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMcMurdo has two airfields. Phoenix Airfield, located about {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} from McMurdo on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, accommodates wheeled aircraft. Williams Field Skiway, located about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from McMurdo is for ski-equipped aircraft only. McMurdo also has a heliport to support helicopter operations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nApproximately 90% of USAP participants live in or pass through McMurdo Station. The austral winter population ranges from 150 to 200, with the summer population varying between 800 and 1,000. The station has routine weekly flights to and from New Zealand during the austral summer (October \u2013 February), a period called \"Mainbody,\" with fewer flights during the winter months (March \u2013 September).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station ===\n[[South Pole Station]] is located at the geographic South Pole, on the polar plateau, at an elevation of 2,835 m (9,300&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The station sits on an ice sheet that is 2,700 m (8,858&nbsp;ft) thick and drifts with the ice at about 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) a year toward the Weddell Sea.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe mean annual temperature is \u201349&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u201356&nbsp;\u00b0F). Average monthly temperatures range from \u201328&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u201318&nbsp;\u00b0F) in the summer to \u201360&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u201376&nbsp;\u00b0F) in winter. The record high of \u2013 l2.3&nbsp;\u00b0C (9.9&nbsp;\u00b0F) was recorded in December 2011, and the record low of \u201382.8&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u2013117&nbsp;\u00b0F) was recorded in June 1982. The site has very low humidity, and precipitation is only about 20&nbsp;cm of snow (8&nbsp;cm water equivalent) per year. Drifting is the primary cause of snow accumulation around buildings. Average wind speed is 10.8 knots.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe original station was built in 1956-1957 and is buried beneath the ice. A second station, located under a geodesic dome, was completed in 1975. The Dome was dismantled in 2009-10 and removed from the continent. The current station was dedicated on January 12, 2008. The winter population is around 45, and the summer population averages 150.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMost Antarctic Program personnel and cargo reach the South Pole from McMurdo Station via LC-130 ski-equipped aircraft, whereas most fuel IS transported via surface traverse from McMurdo Station. The short austral summer, when most activity occurs, is from late October through mid-February. The station is isolated for the rest of the year.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nResearch at the South Pole includes astronomy, astrophysics, aeronomy, auroral and geospace studies, meteorology, geomagnetism, seismology, earth-tide measurements, and glaciology.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Palmer Station ===\n[[Palmer Station]], on the Antarctic Peninsula region, is named after Nathaniel B. Palmer, the American sealer who pioneered exploration of the Peninsula in 1820. The station is located on Anvers Island at 64\u00b046' S, 64\u00b003\u2019 W and consists of two major buildings and several small ones. There is no airfield.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLocated just north of the Antarctic Circle, the climate is milder than that of the other U.S. Antarctic stations. Temperatures in the summer range from just below freezing to above 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (40&nbsp;\u00b0F). Winter temperatures range from 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) to -10&nbsp;\u00b0C (14&nbsp;\u00b0F). Palmer Station is often windy and wet, with both snow and rain. The water equivalent in snow and rain averages 81&nbsp;cm (32&nbsp;in) per year. Wildlife is abundant near the station, which makes it superbly located for ecosystem research.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStation population is about 44 in the summer and 20 or more in winter. Unlike South Pole and McMurdo stations, Palmer usually receives transportation year-round and does not generally have a period of winter isolation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Research vessels ===\n[[Nathaniel B. Palmer (icebreaker)|RVIB ''Nathaniel B. Palmer'']] is {{convert|94|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and is able to break {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} of ice at a continuous forward speed of {{convert|3|kn|spell=in}}. ''Nathanial B. Palmer'' is a modern, multi-disciplinary research vessel containing six laboratories with a combined space of {{convert|353.5|m2|abbr=on}}. It can accommodate 39 scientists and ASC personnel and operates throughout the Southern Ocean.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[RV Laurence M. Gould|ASRV ''Laurence M.

Gould'' has berthing space to accommodate 28 scientists and ASC personnel. There are an additional nine bunks for passengers transiting to Palmer Station. ''Lawrence M. Gould'' transports personnel and cargo to and from Palmer Station and supports research in the Antarctic Peninsula region.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Field camps ===\nEvery season the Program establishes several dozen field camps to house researchers and support staff around the continent. These range in size from just two or three people in small pitched tents, to large camps of up to 60 people in temporary shelters, to permanent, hard-walled structures that teams return to year after year.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Science ==\n\n=== Astrophysics and Geospace ===\nThe Astrophysics and Geospace Sciences Program sponsors research areas that either use Antarctica as an observing platform or contribute to an understanding of the role played by the Antarctic upper atmosphere in global environmental processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13420|title=Antarctic Astrophysics and Geospace Sciences {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Organisms and Ecosystems ===\nThe Organisms and Ecosystems Program supports research at all levels of biological organization, from molecular, cellular and organismal to communities and ecosystems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13421|title=Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Earth Sciences ===\nThe Earth Sciences Program provides insights into Antarctica's geologic history and lead to increased understanding of processes shaping it today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=8173|title=Antarctic Earth Sciences Program {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Glaciology ===\nThe Glaciology Program supports researched concerned with the history and dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet and its surrounding ice shelves.

Managed by the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS), the goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polartrec.com/about|title=About PolarTREC {{!}} PolarTREC|website=www.polartrec.com|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n== Logistics ==\nAntarctica is the most remote region of the world, with no native inhabitants or infrastructure and nearly no vegetation. Working in such a hostile environment requires specialized systems to keep scientists and support staff safe and equipment operational.\n\n=== Airplanes ===\nThe Antarctic Program uses a variety of aircraft to transport people and cargo to and from Antarctica, as well as throughout the continent. McMurdo Station maintains two landing strips on the adjacent McMurdo Ice Shelf: Williams Airfield for ski-equipped planes, and Phoenix Airfield for wheeled planes. U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes and unique New York Air National Guard ski-equipped turboprop planes ferry people and cargo between Christchurch, New Zealand and McMurdo Station. During the peak of the Antarctic summer, the ice runways aren't able to support the weight of wheeled aircraft and only planes that can take off and land on skis can operate.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFor transportation across the vast distances around the continent, the Program uses a combination of ski-equipped LC-130s flown by Air Guard's 109th Airlift Wing and ski-equipped Basler and Twin Otter planes through a contract with through Ken Borek Air, Ltd.. Ski-equipped planes can land on groomed and maintained ski runways like those at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and other field camps, or in relatively smooth ungroomed snow.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Helicopters ===\nThe program maintains a small fleet of helicopters, under contract, at McMurdo Station to transport people and cargo around the immediate area of the station. Helicopters also carry scientific survey equipment and reconnoiter landing and scientific sites. Occasionally some of the helicopters will be temporarily set up at larger field camps to enable transport around an otherwise inaccessible region. The current helicopter support contract is held by Air Center Helicopters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4336|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: Helo Ops|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Traverses ===\nTractor-pulled convoys or \u201ctraverses\u201d are used to transport large quantities of fuel and cargo across large distances. Every year three traverses carrying more than 100,000 gallons of fuel drive the {{convert|1,600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from McMurdo Station to Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to deliver fuel for the next year. Other \"science traverses\" transport heavy science equipment to field sites hundreds of miles from the station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4397|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: The South Pole Traverse|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Vessels/boats ===\nThe program maintains two research vessels, [[Nathaniel B. Palmer (icebreaker)|RVIB ''Nathaniel B. Palmer'']] and [[RV Laurence M. Gould|ASRV ''Laurence M. Gould'']]. The ships are used to both transport people and supplies between Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, and the port at Punta Arenas, Chile, and to embark on longer science-focused voyages to understand the Southern Ocean or visit other remote areas of the continent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4359|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: Marine Operations|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nSmaller boats at Palmer Station, including inflatable rafts and larger rigid-hulled inflatable boats, are used to transport scientists around the islands near the station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4275|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Bigger Boats, Better Science|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nMcMurdo Station is resupplied by ship at the end of every summer season. The U.S. Coast Guard heavy icebreaker ''Polar Star'' cuts a channel for a cargo ship to pass through and reach the ice pier at the station. A fuel tanker usually follows the cargo vessel to deliver fuel.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Vehicles and transport ===\nThe Program has a fleet of vehicles to meet a range of needs at each station. A variety of large and small loaders are used to move cargo and other heavy equipment around. Tracked vehicles, including PistenBullys and Hagglunds transport people and equipment over snow and ice covered regions. Smaller snowmobiles are also used for transport across snow and ice-covered areas as well. \u201cIvan the Terra Bus\u201d and the large Kress are used to transport large numbers of people to and from the airfields over the ice roads of McMurdo Station. Passenger vans with wide tires are also used to transport people around McMurdo Station and Amundsen-Scott South Pole station as well. McMurdo Station also has a small fleet of pickup trucks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4319|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: McMurdo Station on the Move|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Power/water/wastewater ===\nEach station uses diesel fuel to generate electricity. At McMurdo Station, wind turbines installed by Antarctic New Zealand in 2010 supply about a third of the station's electricity in a cooperative agreement with ANZ. Field camps have been increasingly using solar power, taking advantage of the 24 hours of daylight during the Antarctic summer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nReverse osmosis is used to desalinize sea water for drinking at McMurdo and Palmer stations. Potable water at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which sits atop an ice sheet nearly three kilometers (two miles) thick, is produced by melting ice.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWastewater is treated by the base wastewater plant using the activated sludge process.The effluent is sterilized using ultra violet light and discharged back into McMurdo Sound. Waste sludge is dried by being processed with a belt filter press and then boxed up for shipment back to the United States for incineration.\n\n=== Food ===\nEach station has its own kitchen and cafeteria. Food is provided free-of-charge to program participants and official visitors. The cafeterias serve breakfast, lunch, dinners, and a midnight meal for the night shift. Each station has a range of rotating entrees. Fresh fruit and vegetables, known colloquially as \u201cfreshies,\u201d are popular items, but because of their short shelf life are not always available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4329|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Podcast: Feeding McMurdo|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nLarge field camps often have their own chef that cooks large group meals from shelf-stable supplies sent out at the beginning of their field season.

Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library, including ones by [[Leonhard Euler]], and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. One of the pioneers of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity theory]], she won the grand prize from the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] for her essay on the subject. Her work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life.{{sfn|Case|Leggett|2005|p=39}} Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred.<ref>Mackinnon, Nick (1990). \"Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?\". The Mathematical Gazette 74 (470): 346\u2013351, esp. p. 347.</ref> On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\u2019 school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the [[Sophie Germain Prize]] in her honor.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Family===\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France, in a house on Rue Saint-Denis. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois, was a wealthy silk merchant,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}}{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} though some believe he was a [[goldsmith]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the [[bourgeoisie]] to the [[Estates General of 1789|\u00c9tats-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux]], which he saw change into the [[French Revolution#National Assembly (1789)|Constitutional Assembly]]. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}}\n\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, named Ang\u00e9lique-Ambroise, and one older sister, named Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain's nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline's son, published some of Germain's work after she died (see [[Sophie Germain#Work in philosophy|Work in Philosophy]]).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\n===Introduction to mathematics===\nWhen Germain was 13, the [[French Revolution#Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment she turned to her father's library. Here she found [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla|J. E. Montucla's]] ''L'Histoire des Math\u00e9matiques'', and his story of the death of [[Archimedes]] intrigued her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\nSophie Germain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}} could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=90}} So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. She also enjoyed {{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 d'Arithm\u00e9tique}} by [[\u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout]] and {{lang|fr|Le Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel}} by [[:fr:Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin|Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin]]. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\nGermain's parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics.{{sfn|Gray|1978|pp=47\u201348}} After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\n===\u00c9cole Polytechnique===\n[[Image:Porton antigua sede \u00c9cole Polytechnique Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the historic building of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique]]\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] opened.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=69}} Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/sophie-germain.html |first=Simon |last=Singh |year=1997 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |title=Math's Hidden Woman |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} and he became her mentor.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}}\n\n==Early work in number theory==\n\n===Correspondence with Legendre===\nGermain first became interested in [[number theory]] in 1798 when [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] published {{lang|fr|Essai sur la th\u00e9orie des nombres}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. Legendre showed some of Germain's work in the {{lang|fr|Suppl\u00e9ment}} to his second edition of the {{lang|fr|Th\u00e9orie des Nombres}}, where he calls it {{lang|fr|tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse}} (\"very ingenious\"). See also [[#Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem|Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem]] below.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}}\n\n===Correspondence with Gauss===\n[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\nGermain's interest in number theory was renewed when she read [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' monumental work {{lang|la|[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems,{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=352}} she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} to the author himself, who was one year younger than her.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=157}} The first letter, dated 21 November 1804,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} discussed Gauss' {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}} and presented some of Germain's work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]] of the form ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;7.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}} However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}}\n\nAround 1807 (sources differ),{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of [[Braunschweig]], where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety, a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}\n\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  He replied:{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=349}}\n<blockquote>\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory's] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the most noble courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\n</blockquote>\n\nGauss' letters to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Olbers]] show that his praise for Germain was sincere.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}{{sfn|Bell|1937|p=262}} In the same 1807 letter, Sophie claimed that if <math>x^n + y^n</math> is of the form <math>h^2 + nf^2</math>, then <math>x + y</math> is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: <math>15^{11} + 8^{11}</math> can be written as <math>h^2 + 11 f^2</math>, but <math>15 + 8</math> cannot.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|1994}}\n\nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\n==Work in elasticity==\n\n===Germain's first attempt for the Academy Prize===\n[[Image:Echladni.jpg|thumb|left|Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni]]\nWhen Germain's correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning [[Ernst Chladni]]'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the Academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange's comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] deterred all but two contestants, [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Denis Poisson]] and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the Academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant,{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}} She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Lagrange was able to use Germain's work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n===Subsequent attempts for the Prize===\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Germain's anonymous{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving [[multiple integral|double integrals]],{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain's help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the Academy commission, had had access to her work).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"{{lang|fr|Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques}}\",{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} under her own name, and on 8 January 1816{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Although Germain had at last been awarded the {{lang|fr|prix extraordinaire}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} the Academy was still not fully satisfied.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=91}} Sophie had derived the correct [[differential equation]] (a special case of the [[Kirchhoff\u2013Love_plate_theory#Isotropic_plates|Kirchhoff\u2013Love equation]]),{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} which led to incorrect boundary conditions.{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} Here is Germain's final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\n\n: <math>N^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial y^4}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial t^2} = 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''N''<sup>2</sup> is a constant.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Theory of Elasticity and of the Strength of Materials: Volume 1|author=Isaac Todhunter|editor=Karl Pearson|isbn=978-1108070423 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|page=153}}</ref><ref>This is equation (B) in Germain's own book. {{cite book|title=Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques|url=https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000|author=Sophie Germain|year=1821|page=[https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000/page/27 27]}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the Academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the Academy's tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with [[Joseph Fourier]], a secretary of the Academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}\n\n===Later work in elasticity===\n[[File:Germain - R\u00e9cherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques, 1821 - 723413.tif|thumb|{{lang|fr|R\u00e9cherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques}}, 1821]]\nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in her method.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the Academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the Academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 4}}\n\nOne further work of Germain's on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"{{lang|fr|M\u00e9moire sur la courbure des surfaces}}\". She used the [[mean curvature]] in her research (see [[Sophien|Honors in number theory]]).{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n==Later work in number theory==\n\n===Renewed interest===\nGermain's best work was in number theory,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}} and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the Academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} It reawakened Germain's interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}}\n\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|pp=356\u2013357}} Germain's letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=362}}\n\n===Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem===\n[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre de Fermat]]]]\nFermat's Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers ''p'' that do not divide any of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Case 2 includes all ''p'' that divide at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"[[Sophie Germain's theorem]]\":{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}}\n<blockquote>\nLet ''p'' be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''Np''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (''N'' is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\n# if ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;0 ([[modular arithmetic|mod ''P'']]), then ''P'' divides ''xyz'', and\n# ''p'' is not a ''p''-th power residue (mod ''P'').\nThen the first case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] holds true for ''p''.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all odd primes ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;197\".{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}} [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|L. E. Dickson]] later used Germain's theorem to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for odd primes less than 1700.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=763}}\n\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled {{lang|fr|Remarque sur l'impossibilit\u00e9 de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l'\u00e9quation x<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;y<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;z<sup>p</sup>}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}} Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat's theorem for ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\",{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}} around 40 digits long.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=371}}  Sophie did not publish this work. Her brilliant theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre's treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Legendre|Correspondence with Legendre]]).{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\",{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} but ultimately her method did not work.{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}\n\n==Work in philosophy==\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by [[Auguste Comte]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=73}}\n\nTwo of her philosophical works, {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es diverses}} and {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur l'\u00e9tat des sciences et des lettres, aux diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques de leur culture}}, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=53}}  {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es}} is a history of science and mathematics with Sophie's commentary.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations}}, the work admired by Comte, Sophie argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the [[humanities]].{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}}\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 5\u20136}} she continued to work. In 1831 ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' published her paper on the [[curvature]] of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} in <math>\\tfrac{4(x^p - 1)}{x - 1} = y^2 \\pm pz^2</math>\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Mary Gray records: \"She also published in {{lang|fr|Annales de chimie et de physique}} an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\"{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\nDespite Germain's intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"{{lang|fr|renti\u00e8re \u2013 annuitant}}\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} (property holder),{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} not a \"{{lang|fr|math\u00e9maticienne}}\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1837\u2014six years after Germain's death\u2014Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=347}}\n\n==Honors==\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:Grave, Sophie Germain.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Sophie Germain in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]\nGermain's resting place in the [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris is marked by a gravestone.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} <!-- The grave seems \"OK\" in the image, and the lower plaque includes a reference to the girls' school named after her, so I assume it has been kept up or replaced since the centennial mentioned next. --> At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died. The school houses a bust commissioned by the Paris City Council.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}}\n\nIn January 2020, [[Satellogic]], a high-resolution [[Earth observation]] imaging and analytics company, launched a [[\u00d1uSat]] type [[Small satellite|micro-satellite]] named in honor of Sophie Germain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/china-long-march-2d-satellites-january-2020-launch-success.html/|title=China lofts 4 satellites into orbit with its second launch of 2020 |website=space.com|language=en-US|access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Honors in number theory===\nE.

Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}} Germain was also included in [[H. J. Mozans]]' book \"[[Woman in Science]]\",{{sfn|Mozans|1913}} although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\".{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=201}} Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician [[Claude-Louis Navier]] as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nGermain's contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Gauss|Correspondence with Gauss]]).\n\n===Modern praise and criticisms===\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain's work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=51}} Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young [[child prodigy|prodigy]] to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384\u2013385}}\n\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain's theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain's work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} Mozans writes, however, that when the [[Eiffel tower]] was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain's name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower's construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}}, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\"{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} Gray adds that \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain's creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\",{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}} and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain's biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}\n\n==Germain in popular culture==\nGermain was referenced and quoted in [[David Auburn]]'s 2001 play ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]].'' The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden's [[Proof (2005 film)|film adaptation]] of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\n\nIn the fictional work \"[[The Last Theorem]]\" by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Frederik Pohl]], Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\nA new musical about Sophie Germain's life, entitled The Limit, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.\n\n==Sophie Germain Prize==\n\nThe [[Sophie Germain Prize]] ({{lang-fr|Prix Sophie Germain}}), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in Paris. Its purpose is to honour a French mathematician for research in the [[foundations of mathematics]].

Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library, including ones by [[Leonhard Euler]], and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. One of the pioneers of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity theory]], she won the grand prize from the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] for her essay on the subject. Her work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life.{{sfn|Case|Leggett|2005|p=39}} Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred.<ref>Mackinnon, Nick (1990). \"Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?\". The Mathematical Gazette 74 (470): 346\u2013351, esp. p. 347.</ref> On June 27, 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\u2019 school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the [[Sophie Germain Prize]] in her honor.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Family===\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born on April 1, 1776, in Paris, France, in a house on Rue Saint-Denis. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois, was a wealthy silk merchant,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}}{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} though some believe he was a [[goldsmith]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the [[bourgeoisie]] to the [[Estates General of 1789|\u00c9tats-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux]], which he saw change into the [[French Revolution#National Assembly (1789)|Constitutional Assembly]]. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}}\n\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, named Ang\u00e9lique-Ambroise, and one older sister, named Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain's nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline's son, published some of Germain's work after she died (see [[Sophie Germain#Work in philosophy|Work in Philosophy]]).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\n===Introduction to mathematics===\nWhen Germain was 13, the [[French Revolution#Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment she turned to her father's library. Here she found [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla|J. E. Montucla's]] ''L'Histoire des Math\u00e9matiques'', and his story of the death of [[Archimedes]] intrigued her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\nSophie Germain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}} could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=90}} So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. She also enjoyed {{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 d'Arithm\u00e9tique}} by [[\u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout]] and {{lang|fr|Le Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel}} by [[:fr:Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin|Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin]]. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\nGermain's parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics.{{sfn|Gray|1978|pp=47\u201348}} After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\n===\u00c9cole Polytechnique===\n[[Image:Porton antigua sede \u00c9cole Polytechnique Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the historic building of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique]]\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] opened.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=69}} Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/sophie-germain.html |first=Simon |last=Singh |year=1997 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |title=Math's Hidden Woman |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} and he became her mentor.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}}\n\n==Early work in number theory==\n\n===Correspondence with Legendre===\nGermain first became interested in [[number theory]] in 1798 when [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] published {{lang|fr|Essai sur la th\u00e9orie des nombres}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. Legendre showed some of Germain's work in the {{lang|fr|Suppl\u00e9ment}} to his second edition of the {{lang|fr|Th\u00e9orie des Nombres}}, where he calls it {{lang|fr|tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse}} (\"very ingenious\"). See also [[#Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem|Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem]] below.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}}\n\n===Correspondence with Gauss===\n[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\nGermain's interest in number theory was renewed when she read [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' monumental work {{lang|la|[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems,{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=352}} she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} to the author himself, who was one year younger than her.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=157}} The first letter, dated 21 November 1804,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} discussed Gauss' {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}} and presented some of Germain's work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]] of the form ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;7.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}} However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}}\n\nAround 1807 (sources differ),{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of [[Braunschweig]], where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety, a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}\n\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  He replied:{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=349}}\n<blockquote>\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory's] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the most noble courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\n</blockquote>\n\nGauss' letters to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Olbers]] show that his praise for Germain was sincere.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}{{sfn|Bell|1937|p=262}} In the same 1807 letter, Sophie claimed that if <math>x^n + y^n</math> is of the form <math>h^2 + nf^2</math>, then <math>x + y</math> is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: <math>15^{11} + 8^{11}</math> can be written as <math>h^2 + 11 f^2</math>, but <math>15 + 8</math> cannot.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|1994}}\n\nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\n==Work in elasticity==\n\n===Germain's first attempt for the Academy Prize===\n[[Image:Echladni.jpg|thumb|left|Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni]]\nWhen Germain's correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning [[Ernst Chladni]]'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the Academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange's comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] deterred all but two contestants, [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Denis Poisson]] and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the Academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant,{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}} She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Lagrange was able to use Germain's work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n===Subsequent attempts for the Prize===\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Germain's anonymous{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving [[multiple integral|double integrals]],{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain's help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the Academy commission, had had access to her work).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"{{lang|fr|Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques}}\",{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} under her own name, and on 8 January 1816{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Although Germain had at last been awarded the {{lang|fr|prix extraordinaire}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} the Academy was still not fully satisfied.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=91}} Sophie had derived the correct [[differential equation]] (a special case of the [[Kirchhoff\u2013Love_plate_theory#Isotropic_plates|Kirchhoff\u2013Love equation]]),{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} which led to incorrect boundary conditions.{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} Here is Germain's final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\n\n: <math>N^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial y^4}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial t^2} = 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''N''<sup>2</sup> is a constant.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Theory of Elasticity and of the Strength of Materials: Volume 1|author=Isaac Todhunter|editor=Karl Pearson|isbn=978-1108070423 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|page=153}}</ref><ref>This is equation (B) in Germain's own book. {{cite book|title=Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques|url=https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000|author=Sophie Germain|year=1821|page=[https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000/page/27 27]}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the Academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the Academy's tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members.

In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in her method.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the Academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the Academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 4}}\n\nOne further work of Germain's on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"{{lang|fr|M\u00e9moire sur la courbure des surfaces}}\". She used the [[mean curvature]] in her research (see [[Sophien|Honors in number theory]]).{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n==Later work in number theory==\n\n===Renewed interest===\nGermain's best work was in number theory,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}} and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the Academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} It reawakened Germain's interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}}\n\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|pp=356\u2013357}} Germain's letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=362}}\n\n===Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem===\n[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre de Fermat]]]]\nFermat's Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers ''p'' that do not divide any of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Case 2 includes all ''p'' that divide at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"[[Sophie Germain's theorem]]\":{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}}\n<blockquote>\nLet ''p'' be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''Np''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (''N'' is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\n# if ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;0 ([[modular arithmetic|mod ''P'']]), then ''P'' divides ''xyz'', and\n# ''p'' is not a ''p''-th power residue (mod ''P'').\nThen the first case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] holds true for ''p''.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all odd primes ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;197\".{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}} [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|L. E. Dickson]] later used Germain's theorem to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for odd primes less than 1700.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=763}}\n\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled {{lang|fr|Remarque sur l'impossibilit\u00e9 de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l'\u00e9quation x<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;y<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;z<sup>p</sup>}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}} Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat's theorem for ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\",{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}} around 40 digits long.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=371}}  Sophie did not publish this work. Her brilliant theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre's treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Legendre|Correspondence with Legendre]]).{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\",{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} but ultimately her method did not work.{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}\n\n==Work in philosophy==\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by [[Auguste Comte]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=73}}\n\nTwo of her philosophical works, {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es diverses}} and {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur l'\u00e9tat des sciences et des lettres, aux diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques de leur culture}}, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=53}}  {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es}} is a history of science and mathematics with Sophie's commentary.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations}}, the work admired by Comte, Sophie argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the [[humanities]].{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}}\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 5\u20136}} she continued to work. In 1831 ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' published her paper on the [[curvature]] of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} in <math>\\tfrac{4(x^p - 1)}{x - 1} = y^2 \\pm pz^2</math>\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Mary Gray records: \"She also published in {{lang|fr|Annales de chimie et de physique}} an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\"{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\nDespite Germain's intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"{{lang|fr|renti\u00e8re \u2013 annuitant}}\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} (property holder),{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} not a \"{{lang|fr|math\u00e9maticienne}}\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1837\u2014six years after Germain's death\u2014Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=347}}\n\n==Honors==\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:Grave, Sophie Germain.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Sophie Germain in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]\nGermain's resting place in the [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris is marked by a gravestone.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} <!-- The grave seems \"OK\" in the image, and the lower plaque includes a reference to the girls' school named after her, so I assume it has been kept up or replaced since the centennial mentioned next. --> At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died.

Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}} Germain was also included in [[H. J. Mozans]]' book \"[[Woman in Science]]\",{{sfn|Mozans|1913}} although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\".{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=201}} Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician [[Claude-Louis Navier]] as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nGermain's contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Gauss|Correspondence with Gauss]]).\n\n===Modern praise and criticisms===\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain's work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=51}} Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young [[child prodigy|prodigy]] to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384\u2013385}}\n\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain's theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain's work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} Mozans writes, however, that when the [[Eiffel tower]] was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain's name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower's construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}}, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\"{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} Gray adds that \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain's creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\",{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}} and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain's biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}\n\n==Germain in popular culture==\nGermain was referenced and quoted in [[David Auburn]]'s 2001 play ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]].'' The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden's [[Proof (2005 film)|film adaptation]] of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\n\nIn the fictional work \"[[The Last Theorem]]\" by [[Arthur C.

Beginning in the 1960s through the early 2000s, Gersten played a major role in shaping American drama and [[musical theatre]].\n\nFrom 1960 to 1978, Gersten worked with [[Joseph Papp]] as Associate Producer at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. After leaving the NYSF, he served as Executive Producer of [[Lincoln Center Theater]] from 1986 until he retired in 2013, where (with [[Gregory Mosher]], then with Andre Bishop) he oversaw over 150 productions.\n\nIn addition to receiving the [[Antoinette Perry]] Award (The \u201c[[Tony Award]]\u201d) for Lifetime Achievement in 2013, Gersten has been the recipient of fifteen [[Tony Awards]] for his productions.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGersten is the son of Henrietta (Henig) Gersten and Jacob Israel Gersten, a garment worker and chauffeur. Gersten grew up in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in a traditional Jewish immigrant household, crowded with relatives, his father Jacob holding the position of secretary at the local synagogue. Like his cohort, [[Joseph Papp]], Gersten came to the theater from an unsophisticated middle-class background.<ref name = Gersten>Gersten,Bernard. ''My Life As It Were'', an unpublished autobiography (with John DiLeo).</ref>\n\nAs a teenager, Gersten became interested in theater and acting during his time at West-Side High School.\n<ref name = Rothstein>{{cite news\n| first=Mervyn\n| last=Rothstein\n| title=A Life in the Theatre: Bernard Gersten\n| newspaper=Playbill\n| date=2010\n|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/a-life-in-the-theatre-bernard-gersten-com-165433}}</ref>\nGersten was attending [[Rutgers University]] as the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]] following the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. He enlisted in the quartermaster corps and was stationed in Hawaii. He transitioned into special services after attending a performance on a base of [[Macbeth]] featuring the theater stars [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] (a Captain) and [[Dame Judith Anderson]]. Working on productions in the military, he developed his skills as a stage manager and producer.<ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Rothstein />\n\n==Early career==\n\nAfter World War II, Gersten got his [[Equity card]] and began his professional career when [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] asked him to become the Assistant Stage Manager of the US tour of \u201cGI Hamlet\u201d - starring Evans. Following his first professional gig, Gersten joined the Actor's Lab in [[Los Angeles]], where he met his future colleague and co-producer, [[Joseph Papp]].<ref name =Gersten /><ref name = Turan>Turan, Kenneth; [[Joseph Papp]] with the assistance of Gail Merrifield Papp (2009). \u2018\u2019Free for All: Joe Papp, the Public and the Greatest Theater Story Ever Told\u2019\u2019. [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] New York.</ref> In the late 1950s, Gersten was hired by [[John Houseman]] to work as a stage manager at the [[American Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. He was active as a [[Broadway production]] stage manager at the [[American Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. His last job was as a Production Stage Manager (PSM) to the first performances of [[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]] starring [[Barbra Streisand]]. <ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Rothstein />\n\nDuring the late 1940s and the 1950s, Gersten was politically active. He attended meetings of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and worked on union organizing. Both he and Joseph Papp worked on behalf of Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]]\u2019s unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1948 (as the candidate of the Progressive Party). He was also active on behalf of the plight of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. In time, Gersten was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Commission and was required to appear before the committee in 1958. Gersten [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Self-incrimination|pled the 5th]]. (Papp was also brought before the committee.) Though he was threatened with dismissal, Gersten did not lose his job because both [[John Houseman]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] spoke on his behalf.<ref name =Gersten /><ref name = Epstein>Epstein, Helen (1994). \u2018\u2019Joe Papp: An American Life\u2019\u2019. [[Little Brown]] Boston, Massachusetts.</ref>\n\n==New York Shakespeare Festival==\n\nIn 1960, Joseph Papp invited Gersten to work with him at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. The job as associate producer became a full-time job in 1964. This began a long partnership during which Papp and Gersten established the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF) at the old [[Astor Library]] downtown while presenting a series of significant productions. During his tenure at the NYSF, it would become the preeminent non-profit theater in the United States. (Gersten would also produce at [[Lincoln Center]]\u2019s [[Vivian Beaumont]] and Mitzi E. Newhouse (prior to 1973 the Forum) theaters during [[Shakespeare in the Park|NYSF]]\u2019s tenure there between 1974 and 1977.) <ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Turan /><ref name =Epstein />\n\nThe eighteen year Papp/Gersten regime at the NYSF would usher in a bold new era of [[playwriting]] and [[musical theater]]. Significant dramatists such as [[Liz Swados]], [[David Rabe]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]], [[Richard Foreman]] and [[John Guare]] as well as major stage stars including [[James Earl Jones]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Sam Waterston]] [[Edward Herrmann]] and [[Al Pacino]], [[George C. Scott]] and [[Colleen Dewhurst]] (not to mention the visual artist [[Paul Brooks Davis|Paul Davis]]), got their first national attention at the NYSF. <ref name =Turan /> Productions during this period alo included dozens of plays by [[William Shakespeare]] and free theater in [[Central Park]]. Notable productions during the Papp/Gersten era include an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]\u2019s ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]], [[Hair]], [[That Championship Season]], [[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide]]/When the Rainbow is Enuf, [[Streamers (play)|Streamers]], [[Buried Child]]'' and the crowning achievement of the NYSF during this period: the musical: ''[[A Chorus Line]]''.<ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Turan /><ref name =Epstein />\n\nIn 1968, Gersten married Cora Cahan, at the time touring as a dancer with various modern dance companies. (With [[Eliot Feld]], Cora Cahan would establish and serve as executive director of Eliot Feld's dance company, [[Feld Ballet]]. In 1982, Cora and Eliot conceived and created the [[Joyce Theater]]. Since 1990, Cora has been President of The New 42nd Street, a [[non-profit organization]] generated by the city and the state as part of the 42nd Street Redevelopment Project.) The Gerstens have two children, Jenny Cahan Gersten and Jilian Cahan Gersten.\n\nPerhaps Gersten's most significant contribution to the [[Theater of the United States|American theater]] was his realization that a non-profit theater could produce commercially. In what he has described as a \u2018eureka moment\u2019 <ref name =Gersten /> he found a way to free the New York Shakespeare Festival and later the [[Lincoln Center Theater]] from dependency on commercial producers when moving a show to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Through this innovative approach to underwriting production, beginning with moving ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' to Broadway in 1971, (and particularly with the success of ''A Chorus Line''), the fortunes of the New York Shakespeare Festival grew enormously. Gersten's approach would change the course of non-profit institutions nationally and especially in [[New York City]].\n\nIn 1978, Gersten and Papp went their separate ways when Gersten insisted that the NYSF produce [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]]\u2019s ''Ballroom''. Papp fired Gersten, whereupon Gersten went on to independently produce ''Ballroom'' (as well as [[John Guare]]\u2019s ''[[Bosoms and Neglect]]'') on Broadway later that year.<ref name =Turan /><ref name =Epstein />\n\n==Zoetrope and Radio City Music Hall==\n\nIn 1979, Gersten was invited by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] to come work for his new [[Zoetrope Studios]] as Executive Vice President of Creative Affairs. During his tenure at Zoetrope, Gersten would serve as Executive Producer of [[Francis Ford Coppola]]\u2019s ''[[One From the Heart]]'', as well as three other films. He also acted as Co-Producer of the live-orchestra presentations throughout the world of [[Abel Gance]]\u2019s film [[Napol\u00e9on (1927 film)|''Napol\u00e9on'']].<ref name =Gersten />\nAfter leaving Zoetrope, Gersten was recruited by [[Radio City Music Hall]] to serve as their Vice President to produce live original content. A highlight of his two and a quarter year tenure, was a massive production of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', (featuring a 90-strong company).\n\n==Lincoln Center Theater==\n\nIn 1984, the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]], a component of the larger Lincoln Center performing arts complex, had been dark for four years. A board of directors headed by former New York Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] decided to try one more time to activate the theater which had been built and established in the mid-sixties, but failed to establish itself as a viable theatrical venue.<ref name =Rothstein /> (This period includes the four years in which the [[Shakespeare in the Park|NYSF]] produced at Lincoln Center.)\n\nGersten, at the time working for Alexander Cohen on Broadway and teaching as an adjunct professor of theater administration at [[Columbia University]], was invited to act as a consultant on the board. He proposed a way to organize the Beaumont and was hired as Executive Producer alongside [[Gregory Mosher]] who was hired as Artistic Director to lead the new entity \u201c[[Lincoln Center Theater]]\u201d. Under Mosher and Gersten, the [[Vivian Beaumont]] and the Mitzi E. Newhouse theaters, moribund for nearly a decade, flourished. More than twenty productions followed in quick succession over the next five years, including several major successes. (see Lincoln Center Theater) In 1991, Mr. Mosher announced that he would leave LCT to pursue other projects.\n\nIn 1991, Gersten invited Andre Bishop to take over as Artistic Director. (Bishop's tenure would begin in 1992). (After Gersten's retirement, Bishop would have the title of Producing Artistic Director). The long list of successes at [[Lincoln Center Theater]] would grow under their partnership. For almost twenty years, Mr. Gersten and Mr. Bishop produced an award-winning series of top shelf theatrical productions, sparing no expense to achieve the most exacting artistic results. A number of plays produced at [[Lincoln Center Theater]], would move to Broadway (or be produced directly for Broadway).

Beginning in the 1960s through the early 2000s, Gersten played a major role in shaping American drama and [[musical theatre]].\n\nFrom 1960 and 1978, Gersten worked with [[Joseph Papp]] as Associate Producer at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. After leaving the NYSF, he served as Executive Producer of [[Lincoln Center Theater]] from 1986 until he retired in 2013, where (with [[Gregory Mosher]], then with Andre Bishop) he oversaw over 150 productions.\n\nIn addition to receiving the [[Antoinette Perry]] Award (The \u201c[[Tony Award]]\u201d) for Lifetime Achievement in 2013, Gersten has been the recipient of fifteen [[Tony Awards]] for his productions.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGersten is the son of Henrietta (Henig) Gersten and Jacob Israel Gersten, a garment worker and chauffeur. Gersten grew up in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in a traditional Jewish immigrant household, crowded with relatives, his father Jacob holding the position of secretary at the local synagogue. Like his cohort, [[Joseph Papp]], Gersten came to the theater from an unsophisticated middle-class background.<ref name = Gersten>Gersten,Bernard. ''My Life As It Were'', an unpublished autobiography (with John DiLeo).</ref>\n\nAs a teenager, Gersten became interested in theater and acting during his time at West-Side High School.\n<ref name = Rothstein>{{cite news\n| first=Mervyn\n| last=Rothstein\n| title=A Life in the Theatre: Bernard Gersten\n| newspaper=Playbill\n| date=2010\n|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/a-life-in-the-theatre-bernard-gersten-com-165433}}</ref>\nGersten was attending [[Rutgers University]] as the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]] following the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. He enlisted in the quartermaster corps and was stationed in Hawaii. He transitioned into special services after attending a performance on a base of [[Macbeth]] featuring the theater stars [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] (a Captain) and [[Dame Judith Anderson]]. Working on productions in the military, he developed his skills as a stage manager and producer.<ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Rothstein />\n\n==Early career==\n\nAfter World War II, Gersten got his [[Equity card]] and began his professional career when [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] asked him to become the Assistant Stage Manager of the US tour of \u201cGI Hamlet\u201d - starring Evans. Following his first professional gig, Gersten joined the Actor's Lab in [[Los Angeles]], where he met his future colleague and co-producer, [[Joseph Papp]].<ref name =Gersten /><ref name = Turan>Turan, Kenneth; [[Joseph Papp]] with the assistance of Gail Merrifield Papp (2009). \u2018\u2019Free for All: Joe Papp, the Public and the Greatest Theater Story Ever Told\u2019\u2019. [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] New York.</ref> In the late 1950s, Gersten was hired by [[John Houseman]] to work as a stage manager at the [[American Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. He was active as a [[Broadway production]] stage manager at the [[American Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. His last job was as a Production Stage Manager (PSM) to the first performances of [[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]] starring [[Barbra Streisand]]. <ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Rothstein />\n\nDuring the late 1940s and the 1950s, Gersten was politically active. He attended meetings of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and worked on union organizing. Both he and Joseph Papp worked on behalf of Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]]\u2019s unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1948 (as the candidate of the Progressive Party). He was also active on behalf of the plight of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. In time, Gersten was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Commission and was required to appear before the committee in 1958. Gersten [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Self-incrimination|pled the 5th]]. (Papp was also brought before the committee.) Though he was threatened with dismissal, Gersten did not lose his job because both [[John Houseman]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] spoke on his behalf.<ref name =Gersten /><ref name = Epstein>Epstein, Helen (1994). \u2018\u2019Joe Papp: An American Life\u2019\u2019. [[Little Brown]] Boston, Massachusetts.</ref>\n\n==New York Shakespeare Festival==\n\nIn 1960, Joseph Papp invited Gersten to work with him at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. The job as associate producer became a full-time job in 1964. This began a long partnership during which Papp and Gersten established the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF) at the old [[Astor Library]] downtown while presenting a series of significant productions. During his tenure at the NYSF, it would become the preeminent non-profit theater in the United States. (Gersten would also produce at [[Lincoln Center]]\u2019s [[Vivian Beaumont]] and Mitzi E. Newhouse (prior to 1973 the Forum) theaters during [[Shakespeare in the Park|NYSF]]\u2019s tenure there between 1974 and 1977.) <ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Turan /><ref name =Epstein />\n\nThe eighteen year Papp/Gersten regime at the NYSF would usher in a bold new era of [[playwriting]] and [[musical theater]]. Significant dramatists such as [[Liz Swados]], [[David Rabe]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]], [[Richard Foreman]] and [[John Guare]] as well as major stage stars including [[James Earl Jones]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Sam Waterston]] [[Edward Herrmann]] and [[Al Pacino]], [[George C. Scott]] and [[Colleen Dewhurst]] (not to mention the visual artist [[Paul Brooks Davis|Paul Davis]]), got their first national attention at the NYSF. <ref name =Turan /> Productions during this period alo included dozens of plays by [[William Shakespeare]] and free theater in [[Central Park]]. Notable productions during the Papp/Gersten era include an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]\u2019s ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]], [[Hair]], [[That Championship Season]], [[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide]]/When the Rainbow is Enuf, [[Streamers (play)|Streamers]], [[Buried Child]]'' and the crowning achievement of the NYSF during this period: the musical: ''[[A Chorus Line]]''.<ref name =Gersten /><ref name =Turan /><ref name =Epstein />\n\nIn 1968, Gersten married Cora Cahan, at the time touring as a dancer with various modern dance companies. (With [[Eliot Feld]], Cora Cahan would establish and serve as executive director of Eliot Feld's dance company, [[Feld Ballet]]. In 1982, Cora and Eliot conceived and created the [[Joyce Theater]]. Since 1990, Cora has been President of The New 42nd Street, a [[non-profit organization]] generated by the city and the state as part of the 42nd Street Redevelopment Project.) The Gerstens have two children, Jenny Cahan Gersten and Jilian Cahan Gersten.\n\nPerhaps Gersten's most significant contribution to the [[Theater of the United States|American theater]] was his realization that a non-profit theater could produce commercially. In what he has described as a \u2018eureka moment\u2019 <ref name =Gersten /> he found a way to free the New York Shakespeare Festival and later the [[Lincoln Center Theater]] from dependency on commercial producers when moving a show to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Through this innovative approach to underwriting production, beginning with moving ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' to Broadway in 1971, (and particularly with the success of ''A Chorus Line''), the fortunes of the New York Shakespeare Festival grew enormously. Gersten's approach would change the course of non-profit institutions nationally and especially in [[New York City]].\n\nIn 1978, Gersten and Papp went their separate ways when Gersten insisted that the NYSF produce [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]]\u2019s ''Ballroom''. Papp fired Gersten, whereupon Gersten went on to independently produce ''Ballroom'' (as well as [[John Guare]]\u2019s ''[[Bosoms and Neglect]]'') on Broadway later that year.<ref name =Turan /><ref name =Epstein />\n\n==Zoetrope and Radio City Music Hall==\n\nIn 1979, Gersten was invited by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] to come work for his new [[Zoetrope Studios]] as Executive Vice President of Creative Affairs. During his tenure at Zoetrope, Gersten would serve as Executive Producer of [[Francis Ford Coppola]]\u2019s ''[[One From the Heart]]'', as well as three other films. He also acted as Co-Producer of the live-orchestra presentations throughout the world of [[Abel Gance]]\u2019s film [[Napol\u00e9on (1927 film)|''Napol\u00e9on'']].<ref name =Gersten />\nAfter leaving Zoetrope, Gersten was recruited by [[Radio City Music Hall]] to serve as their Vice President to produce live original content. A highlight of his two and a quarter year tenure, was a massive production of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', (featuring a 90-strong company).\n\n==Lincoln Center Theater==\n\nIn 1984, the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]], a component of the larger Lincoln Center performing arts complex, had been dark for four years. A board of directors headed by former New York Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] decided to try one more time to activate the theater which had been built and established in the mid-sixties, but failed to establish itself as a viable theatrical venue.<ref name =Rothstein /> (This period includes the four years in which the [[Shakespeare in the Park|NYSF]] produced at Lincoln Center.)\n\nGersten, at the time working for Alexander Cohen on Broadway and teaching as an adjunct professor of theater administration at [[Columbia University]], was invited to act as a consultant on the board. He proposed a way to organize the Beaumont and was hired as Executive Producer alongside [[Gregory Mosher]] who was hired as Artistic Director to lead the new entity \u201c[[Lincoln Center Theater]]\u201d. Under Mosher and Gersten, the [[Vivian Beaumont]] and the Mitzi E. Newhouse theaters, moribund for nearly a decade, flourished. More than twenty productions followed in quick succession over the next five years, including several major successes. (see Lincoln Center Theater) In 1991, Mr. Mosher announced that he would leave LCT to pursue other projects.\n\nIn 1991, Gersten invited Andre Bishop to take over as Artistic Director. (Bishop's tenure would begin in 1992). (After Gersten's retirement, Bishop would have the title of Producing Artistic Director). The long list of successes at [[Lincoln Center Theater]] would grow under their partnership. For almost twenty years, Mr. Gersten and Mr. Bishop produced an award-winning series of top shelf theatrical productions, sparing no expense to achieve the most exacting artistic results. A number of plays produced at [[Lincoln Center Theater]], would move to Broadway (or be produced directly for Broadway). Muscular, precise, and visually striking theater became the hallmark of [[Lincoln Center Theater]].<ref name = Cox>{{cite news\n| first=Gordon\n| last=Cox\n| title=Bernard Gersten to Exit LCT\n| newspaper=Variety\n| date=2012\n|url=https://variety.com/2012/legit/news/bernard-gersten-to-exit-lct-1118056369/}}</ref>\n<ref name = Piepenburg>{{cite news\n| first=Erik\n| last=Piepenburg\n| title=Gersten to Step Down at Lincoln Center Theater\n| newspaper=New York Times\n| date=2012\n|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/gersten-to-step-down-at-lincoln-center-theater/}}</ref>\n\nBernard Gersten produced over 150 productions at LCT, including a revival of [[John Guare]]\u2019s ''[[House of Blue Leaves]]'' and premiere of ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', [[Wendy Wasserstein]]\u2019s ''Sisters Rosenzweig'', [[Edward Albee]]\u2019s ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'', Ngema's ''[[Sarafina!
