These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading.

Chaired by legislator [[Wu Chi-wai]], it is currently the third largest party in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], having seven seats and 89 [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]]. It is also the largest [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] party in the legislature.\n\nThe party was founded in 1994 as a merger of the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK) and the [[Meeting Point]] (MP). Founded in 1990, the United Democrats were the first major political party which rose to become the largest party in the last years of the colonial legislature, winning a landslide victory in the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first ever direct election]] led by [[Martin Lee]] in 1991. The UDHK and MP later merged into the Democratic Party to further consolidate the pro-democracy bloc. Due to its emergence from the support to the [[Tiananmen protests of 1989]] and its opposition to Beijing's bloody crackdown and calling for the end of [[one-party rule]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), the party was long seen as \"treasonous\" by the Beijing authorities.{{Citation needed span|text=|date=December 2019|reason=}}\n\nThe Democratic Party became the largest party in the first fully elected legislature after winning another victory in the [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|1995 Legislative Council election]] and retained the largest party status and the flagship pro-democracy party despite its long decline in the first decades of the SAR period due to intra-party factional struggles and the divisive nature of the post-handover [[proportional representation]] system. In the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004 election]], the party lost its largest party status to the flagship [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] rival [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB) and faced competition from the new pro-democracy activists and groups emerged from the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003|2003 large-scale pro-democracy demonstration]].\n\nThe Democratic Party is considered moderate in the pan-democracy camp. In 2010, it reached a breakthrough agreement with the Beijing government over the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform proposal]], which caused disaffection from its pan-democrat allies and a split within the camp. In 2012, the party suffered the worst result in its history, retaining only six seats. The party rebounded by increasing its number of seats to seven in the [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 election]] after three veterans, [[Emily Lau]], [[Albert Ho]], and [[Sin Chung-kai]] stepped down to make way for the party's younger members. It saw further electoral success in the [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|2019 District Council election]], winning 91 seats and simultaneously becoming the largest party.\n\n==Party beliefs==\nFrom the outset, the party supported the restoration of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong.  However, since [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|the handover]] it has consistently stressed the \"two systems\" part of the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle. The party's stance on Hong Kong's future development differs from that of [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing parties]]. It believes Hong Kong must develop more democratic institutions and preserve freedoms and human rights to achieve prosperity.\n\nThe party proposed policies on various areas of governance through designated spokespersons, including:\n\n*Amendment of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] to achieve more democracy and safeguard freedoms, while achieving closer economic co-operation with [[Mainland China]].\n*Protection of human rights.\n*Maintain Hong Kong's status as an international finance and trade centre and improve its economic infrastructure (concrete details not given), as well as a more flexible way to control public expenditure.\n*Better monitoring of public services and utilities (i.e. more accountability), and strengthened measures to [[Environment of Hong Kong|protect the environment]].\n*More resources for education, with less vague policies.\n*Reasonable (i.e. larger) share of economic achievements by the employee for the employee, and increased involvement by the Government to protect labour laws in accordance with social needs.\n*Adopt measures to regulate property prices from fluctuation, and provide adequate public housing\n*Increase spending on social welfare.\nOverall, the Democratic Party advocates economic policies pretty close to \"liberalism\" in the sense of [[John Rawls]] (rather than, say, of [[Robert Nozick]] or [[Friedrich Hayek]], as commonly accepted outside North America), in sharp contrast with the traditional radical free-market [[capitalist]] orientation typical of Hong Kong. However, this point is rarely mentioned in the speeches held by party members during their trips abroad to seek political support.\n\nThe party's position on social or cultural issues is not well-defined but verges on the moderate, partly due to some support from centrist pan-democrat supporters. In a way that may seem contradictory to traditional liberal ideology, the party generally opposes the legalisation of commercial sex or gambling operations. However, the Democratic Party generally support to legalise laws which would prohibit discrimination against the [[LGBT]] community, despite part of the conservative wing of the party against it.\n\nIn recent years with the emergence of the pro-[[Hong Kong independence]] tide, the Democratic Party has been criticised by pro-independence voices for its pro-China position. The party has also been accused for years by pro-Beijing media of being anti-China, as many of the core Democratic Party leaders including [[Szeto Wah]], [[Martin Lee]] and [[Albert Ho]] are self-proclaimed patriots who oppose only the [[one-party rule]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] but not the country in general and support the [[Chinese democracy movement]].<ref>{{cite book|page=71|title=Gender and Change in Hong Kong: Globalization, Postcolonialism, and Chinese Patriarchy|first=Eliza Wing-Yee|last=Lee|publisher=UBC Press|year=2011}}</ref> It also does not support Hong Kong being separated from China.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:DPHK Old Logo.svg|The Party's first logo used in 1994\u20132003.|right|thumb|180px]]\nThe Democratic Party was founded with the merger of the two major [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] parties at the time, the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK) and the [[Meeting Point]] (MP). The Meeting Point was formed in 1983 by a group of liberal intellectuals and people from middle class in the background of the Sino-British negotiations on the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. The group favoured the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] to the People's Republic of China but called for a \"free, democratic and autonomous Hong Kong government under Chinese sovereignty\". Together with the [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] (ADPL) and the [[Hong Kong Affairs Society]] (HKAS), they were the three major pro-democracy organisations actively participated in the local and municipal elections in the 1980s.\n\nThe like-minded liberals also formed the [[Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government]] (JCPDG) and the [[Group of 190]] to strive for the [[1988 Hong Kong electoral reform|1988 Legislative Council election]] and the faster democratisation the political structure towards 1997 and after 1997 during the drafting of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], under the leadership of liberal drafters [[Martin Lee]] and [[Szeto Wah]]. During the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the liberals stood firmly with the student protestors, formed the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] (HKASPDMC) and condemned the bloody suppression on 4 June.\n\nIn preparation for the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first Legislative Council direct election]] in 1991, members of the three political groups and many liberal activists of the JCPDG joined together and formed the United Democrats of Hong Kong in April 1990.{{sfn|Allen|1997|p=169}} Chaired by the Martin Lee, the United Democrats of Hong Kong formed an alliance with [[Anthony Cheung Bing-leung]]'s Meeting Point in the campaign.{{sfn|Lau|1993|p=118}} The liberal alliance won a landslide victory in the direct election, receiving over 52% of the vote{{sfn|Beatty|2003|p=21}} and winning 14 of the 16 [[geographical constituency]] seats in September. The popularity of the pro-democratic alliance was principally rose from its position towards the Tiananmen Square protests and the widespread fear towards the Beijing government afterwards.\n\nThe United Democrats stood a firm anti-Beijing stances, criticising the Tiananmen crackdown and also the democratic situation. As a result, Lee and Szeto were deprived their posts in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee|Basic Law Drafting Committee]] and were accused of \"treason\". The United Democrats supported the last governor [[Chris Patten]]'s [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|democratic reform proposal]], which allowed a much extended electorate for the [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|first fully elected Legislative Council election]] in 1995 and was ferociously opposed by Beijing.\n\nThe United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point further united by announcing the formation of the Democratic Party on 18 April 1994.{{sfn|Preston|2001|p=72}} They formally merged into the Democratic Party on 2 October 1994, in eve of the three-tier elections in 1994 and 1995. Martin Lee became the first Chairman of the party and Anthony Cheung and [[Yeung Sum]] became the Vice-Chairmen, elected on the [[1994 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|first general meeting]] on the establishment day. The ADPL continued to keep its own identity, arguing that it represented grassroots' interest whereas the Democratic Party was more focused on the \"middle class\".{{sfn|Allen|1997|p=169}}\n\nThe founding manifesto of the Democratic Party said it would seek to further unite democratic forces, strive for a high degree of autonomy and an open, democratic government, and would promote welfare and equality in Hong Kong. The party also tried to appropriate the discourse of nationalism as it stated \"We care for China and, as part of the Chinese citizeny, we have the rights and obligations to participate in and comment on the affairs of China.\" It also called for the condemnation of the 1989 Tiananmen Incident as well as an amendment of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] before 1997 to allow full election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.{{sfn|Chan|1997|p=69}}\n\n===1994/95 elections and Provisional Legislative Council (1994\u20131998)===\nThe electorate base of the 1995 LegCo election was largely extended by the [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] [[Chris Patten]]'s [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|controversial electoral reform package]] supported by the pro-democrats. Facing the challenge from the newly formed business conservative [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] and pro-Beijing loyalist [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB), the Democratic Party was able to win handsome victories in the three-tier elections in 1994 and 1995. In the LegCo election in September 1995, the party secured 42% of the vote and 19 of the 60 total seats, emerging as the largest party in the Legislative Council, compared to Liberal Party's 10 seats and DAB's 6 seats. Together with the ADPL and other pro-democracy independents, the democratic coalition was able to garner one- or two-vote majorities on certain anti-government issues during the last term of the legislature.{{sfn|Beatty|2003|p=26}}\n\nThe party's stance conflicted with the PRC government's, which, for a while, earned the party more popularity and recognition both locally and overseas.  The party chairman Martin Lee became well-known internationally in the run-up to reunification as a human rights and democracy fighter, and won a number of international human rights awards.\n\nAfter Patten's reform package was passed, Beijing decided that the legislature elected in 1995 could not ride the \"through train\" beyond the [[handover of Hong Kong]], as the first legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). Instead, Beijing set up a highly controlled [[Provisional Legislative Council]] (PLC) in December 1996. The Democratic Party refused to join the [[Selection Committee]] as it opposed to Beijing's decision \"to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature and replace it with a hand-picked version.\"{{sfn|Chan|1997|p=73}} The party thus lost all 19 seats until the PLC was replaced by the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR in 1998.\n\nAt the midnight on 30 June just after the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony|handover ceremony]], the Democratic Party LegCo members protested against the abrupt termination of their tenure and call for the establishment of democratic government at the balcony of the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], and vow to return to the legislature by means of election in 1998.{{sfn|Eur|2002|p=333}}\n\n===Return to Legislative Council and early crises (1998\u20132002)===\nDecided by the Provisional Legislative Council, the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system was replaced by the [[proportional representation]] system in the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|first LegCo election]] in 1998. The proportional representation gave an advantage to the weaker pro-Beijing DAB as it did not require a majority to win a seat. Thus in 1995 the Democratic Party won 12 seats in the [[geographical constituencies]] with 42.3% of the vote, but it got only 9 seat with 40.2% of the vote in 1998.{{sfn|Bush|2005|p=95}}\n\nAfter the handover, the [[Right of abode issue, Hong Kong|Right of Abode litigation]] was initiated immediately and reached its climax in the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]]'s (CFA) decisions favouring the right of abode seekers in ''Ng Ka Ling'' and ''Chan Kam Nga'' lawsuits in January 1999. The Democratic Party supported the right of abode seekers and opposed strongly to the government's decision to refer the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) to interpret the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]].{{sfn|Khun|2009|p=79-80}} Party chairman Martin Lee condemned this move as \"a dagger striking at the heart of the [[rule of law]]\" and in symbolic protest walked out of the Legislative Council with 18 other members, all dressed in black.{{sfn|Krasner|2013|p=133}} However, the party appeared to suffer from popular discontent with the party's position.{{sfn| Sharpe|2001|p=3}} The party was also criticised for failing to broaden its post-1997 agenda and develop a well-defined social base.{{sfn|Nery|2008|p=49-50}}\n\nThe party also appeared to suffer from the internal dissension. In December 1998, the \"Young Turks\" led by [[Andrew To]] staged a successful coup d'\u00e9tat in the [[1998 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|party leadership election]], which promptly brought the party into a phase of factional struggle. The Young Turks formed their own list of about ten candidates to run for the Central Committee and nominated [[Lau Chin-shek]] to run for vice-chairman against the former Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung. Some hoped to make Lau as their factional leader, to lead the party from the Meeting Point faction's pro-middle class, pro-[[laissez-faire]] and pro-Beijing positions to a more pro-grassroots and confrontational position.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ma| first=Ngok |date= 2001 | title=The Decline of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong: The Second Legislative Election in the HKSAR | journal=[[Asian Survey]] |volume= 41  | issue= 4 | pages=577 | url= | accessdate= | doi=10.1525/as.2001.41.4.564}}</ref>\nAlthough Lau was elected vice-chairman, he resigned after the election. Lau was subsequently forced to leave the party in June 2000 after a one-year membership freeze, due to Lau's Democratic Party/[[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|Frontier]] dual membership.\n\nIn a general meeting in September 1999, the Young Turks also proposed to put the [[minimum wage]] legislation on the [[2000 Hong Kong legislative election|2000 LegCo election]] platform of the party. The Mainstreamers which included the \"triumvirate\", Yeung Sum, [[Cheung Man-kwong]] and [[Lee Wing-tat]], saw the minimum wage debate was a challenge to the party authority and decide to fight back by joining hands with the Meeting Point faction to defeat the Young Turks. Andrew To wrote a newspaper article accusing the Mainstreamers of suppressing intra-party dissent, \"just like the butchers in the Tiananmen massacre.\"{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=139}} To's comment led to a backlash of opinion within the party and led to the defeat of the minimum wage motion.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=139}} The debate, largely took place in the mass media, publicised the factional rivalries and created a bad image within the party.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=140}}\n\nThe popular discontent and internal fragmentation appeared to have marked a turning point in the prospects of the Democratic Party and the DAB. In the [[1999 Hong Kong local elections|1999 District Council elections]], the DAB more than doubled its representation, while Democratic Party performed less well than anticipated, winning 86 seats.{{sfn|Pretson|2001|p=77}} In the [[2000 Hong Kong legislative election|second LegCo election]] in the following year, [[Tsang Kin-shing]] and Steve Chan Kwok-leung left the party and ran as independents after failing to be nominated on the candidates list by the Central Committee.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=144}} The election results showed the party's share in the geographical constituencies dropped to 35%, and the party secured 9 out of the 24 directly elected seats. Its total number of seats in LegCo remained at 12.\n\nIn December 2002, Yeung Sum succeeded Martin Lee as Party chairman in the [[2002 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|leadership change]], legislator [[Albert Chan]], belonging to the pro-grassroots relatively \"radical\" faction, left the party.<ref name=\"Albert\"/> By the end of 2002, more than 50 members of the party which had already formed a political group, [[Social Democratic Forum]], defected to [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|the Frontier]], mostly Young Turks.<ref name=\"Albert\">{{cite news|title=Albert Chan quits day after Democrat leadership change|date=3 December 2002|first=Ambrose|last=Leung|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/399499/albert-chan-quits-day-after-democrat-leadership-change}}</ref>\n\n===2003 July 1 march and rebound in popularity (2002\u20132004)===\nIn 2002 and 2003 the party saw a rebound in popularity, largely due to the low popularity of the [[Tung Chee-hwa]]'s administration, and more significantly the controversy over the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] legislation. The pro-democrats worried that the anti-subversion law would threaten the rights and freedom of the Hong Kong people and damaged the rule of law and \"One Country, Two Systems.\" The Article 23 legislation turned into a territory-wide debate and led to a re-awakening of civil society, mobilising different sectors to join the opposition movement.{{sfn|Khun|2009|p=58}} The Democratic Party used many of their 94 district offices for community-level mobilisation. In the weeks before the [[2003 July 1 march|1 July march]], the Democratic Party managed to collect phone numbers of about 40,000 supporters. The party's volunteers and staff called them one by one to call on them to join the demonstration.{{sfn|Khun|2009|p=58}} The demonstration resulted in a record-breaking number of people, more than 500,000 Hong Kong people joined the march. The SAR government had to back down and shelve the bill indefinitely.\n\nIn the following [[2003 Hong Kong local elections|2003 District Council elections]] in November, the pro-democracy camp turned the popular support into the demand of democratisation, [[universal suffrage]] of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council in 2007 and 2008, their primary goals for years. The Democratic Party received a great victory by claiming 95 seats out of the 120 candidates in the election.{{sfn|Poon|2007|p=164}}\n\nThe civil movement in 2003 also broadened the spectrum of the pro-democracy camp. A number of pro-democracy groups such as [[Article 45 Concern Group]] and individuals such as [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Albert Cheng]] were elected in the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004 LegCo election]]. Although the pan-democracy camp took 25 of 60 seats, the Democratic Party won only 9 seats, falling from the largest party in the Legislative Council to the third, behind DAB's 13 (including the FTU members) and pro-business Liberal Party's 10.{{sfn|Chan|2008|p=11}} Worried by pre-election surveys indicating that Martin Lee might be in danger, the Democratic Party sent out a last minute S.O.S. call to \"save Martin Lee\" who was listed second on the Democratic Party's list behind chairman Yeung Sum in the [[Hong Kong Island constituency]]. As a result, Yeung's and Lee's list absorbed too many votes at the expense of pro-democracy ally [[Cyd Ho]] losing by just 815 votes to DAB's [[Choy So-yuk]].{{sfn|Pepper|2008|p=378}} It caused some dissatisfaction among some supporters of the party and the camp generally. Yeung Sum announced he would not seek for re-election as chairman after the election as a result and subsequently replaced by Lee Wing-tat in the [[2004 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|party leadership election]] in December.\n\n===Campaign for 2007/08 universal suffrage and merge with the Frontier (2004\u20132008)===\nAlthough lack of breakthrough in the legislative elections, the pan-democracy maintains its basic position of seeking universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 for Chief Executive and Legislative Council respectively, even though the NPCSC's interpretation of the Basic Law in April 2004 rejected the demand. After Tung Chee-hwa's resigned as Chief Executive in March 2005, Party chairman Lee Wing-tat attempted to run for the post against [[Donald Tsang]] but failed to get enough nominations in the [[Election Committee]]. Donald Tsang was elected uncontestedly in the [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|Chief Executive election]].\n\nIn October 2005, Donald Tsang's administration issued a [[2005 Hong Kong electoral reform|blueprint for the electoral reform]]. The proposal aimed to double to size of Election Committee to 1,600 and add 10 seats to the Legislative Council, half of which would be directly elected and the rest returned by District Councillors.{{sfn|Poon|2007|p=165}} The pro-democracy parties criticised the proposal as conservative as it did not move towards to universal suffrage. In December, the camp held a [[December 2005 protest for democracy in Hong Kong|mass rally]] against the government's reform package and demanded a timetable and road-map to democracy be attached to the proposal. The reform package was at last vetoed by the pan-democracy camp.{{sfn|Poon|2007|p=165}} In December 2006, 114 of the 137 pro-democracy candidates filled by the Democratic Party and the newly established [[Civic Party]] won the [[2006 Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections|Election Committee subsector elections]] which secured the threshold of 100 nominations to enter the [[2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|next Chief Executive election]].\n\nSince early 2005, 24 members had quit the party, including district councillor Stephen Fong Chun-bong (who was forced out by the party) and Lau Tak-cheung. Twelve district councillors also left the party. Another district councillor died in a car accident. The number of district councillors decreased by 13 to 79. In March 2006, the Mainstreamer faction alleged that some senior members were involved in spying activities of China.

The Democratic Party refused to participate as it argued it was not an effective way. The party's heavyweight veteran [[Szeto Wah]] said the Democratic Party would not join in the resignations itself, but would support pan-democrats who stood for re-election.

Chaired by legislator [[Wu Chi-wai]], it is currently the third largest party in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], having seven seats and 89 [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]]. It is also the largest [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] party in the legislature.\n\nThe party was founded in 1994 as a merger of the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK) and the [[Meeting Point]] (MP). Founded in 1990, the United Democrats were the first major political party which rose to become the largest party in the last years of the colonial legislature, winning a landslide victory in the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first ever direct election]] led by [[Martin Lee]] in 1991. The UDHK and MP later merged into the Democratic Party to further consolidate the pro-democracy bloc. Due to its emergence from the support to the [[Tiananmen protests of 1989]] and its opposition to Beijing's bloody crackdown and calling for the end of [[one-party rule]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), the party was long seen as \"treasonous\" by the Beijing authorities.{{Citation needed span|text=|date=December 2019|reason=}}\n\nThe Democratic Party became the largest party in the first fully elected legislature after winning another victory in the [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|1995 Legislative Council election]] and retained the largest party status and the flagship pro-democracy party despite its long decline in the first decades of the SAR period due to intra-party factional struggles and the divisive nature of the post-handover [[proportional representation]] system. In the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004 election]], the party lost its largest party status to the flagship [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] rival [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB) and faced competition from the new pro-democracy activists and groups emerged from the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003|2003 large-scale pro-democracy demonstration]].\n\nThe Democratic Party is considered moderate in the pan-democracy camp. In 2010, it reached a breakthrough agreement with the Beijing government over the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform proposal]], which caused disaffection from its pan-democrat allies and a split within the camp. In 2012, the party suffered the worst result in its history, retaining only six seats. The party rebounded by increasing its number of seats to seven in the [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 election]] after three veterans, [[Emily Lau]], [[Albert Ho]], and [[Sin Chung-kai]] stepped down to make way for the party's younger members. It saw further electoral success in the [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|2019 District Council election]], winning 91 seats and simultaneously becoming the largest party.\n\n==Party beliefs==\nFrom the outset, the party supported the restoration of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong.  However, since [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|the handover]] it has consistently stressed the \"two systems\" part of the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle. The party's stance on Hong Kong's future development differs from that of [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing parties]]. It believes Hong Kong must develop more democratic institutions and preserve freedoms and human rights to achieve prosperity.\n\nThe party proposed policies on various areas of governance through designated spokespersons, including:\n\n*Amendment of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] to achieve more democracy and safeguard freedoms, while achieving closer economic co-operation with [[Mainland China]].\n*Protection of human rights.\n*Maintain Hong Kong's status as an international finance and trade centre and improve its economic infrastructure (concrete details not given), as well as a more flexible way to control public expenditure.\n*Better monitoring of public services and utilities (i.e. more accountability), and strengthened measures to [[Environment of Hong Kong|protect the environment]].\n*More resources for education, with less vague policies.\n*Reasonable (i.e. larger) share of economic achievements by the employee for the employee, and increased involvement by the Government to protect labour laws in accordance with social needs.\n*Adopt measures to regulate property prices from fluctuation, and provide adequate public housing\n*Increase spending on social welfare.\nOverall, the Democratic Party advocates economic policies pretty close to \"liberalism\" in the sense of [[John Rawls]] (rather than, say, of [[Robert Nozick]] or [[Friedrich Hayek]], as commonly accepted outside North America), in sharp contrast with the traditional radical free-market [[capitalist]] orientation typical of Hong Kong. However, this point is rarely mentioned in the speeches held by party members during their trips abroad to seek political support.\n\nThe party's position on social or cultural issues is not well-defined but verges on the moderate, partly due to some support from centrist pan-democrat supporters. In a way that may seem contradictory to traditional liberal ideology, the party generally opposes the legalisation of commercial sex or gambling operations. However, the Democratic Party generally support to legalise laws which would prohibit discrimination against the [[LGBT]] community, despite part of the conservative wing of the party against it.\n\nIn recent years with the emergence of the pro-[[Hong Kong independence]] tide, the Democratic Party has been criticised by pro-independence voices for its pro-China position. The party has also been accused for years by pro-Beijing media of being anti-China, as many of the core Democratic Party leaders including [[Szeto Wah]], [[Martin Lee]] and [[Albert Ho]] are self-proclaimed patriots who oppose only the [[one-party rule]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] but not the country in general and support the [[Chinese democracy movement]].<ref>{{cite book|page=71|title=Gender and Change in Hong Kong: Globalization, Postcolonialism, and Chinese Patriarchy|first=Eliza Wing-Yee|last=Lee|publisher=UBC Press|year=2011}}</ref> It also does not support Hong Kong being separated from China.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:DPHK Old Logo.svg|The Party's first logo used in 1994\u20132003.|right|thumb|180px]]\nThe Democratic Party was founded with the merger of the two major [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] parties at the time, the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK) and the [[Meeting Point]] (MP). The Meeting Point was formed in 1983 by a group of liberal intellectuals and people from middle class in the background of the Sino-British negotiations on the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. The group favoured the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] to the People's Republic of China but called for a \"free, democratic and autonomous Hong Kong government under Chinese sovereignty\". Together with the [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] (ADPL) and the [[Hong Kong Affairs Society]] (HKAS), they were the three major pro-democracy organisations actively participated in the local and municipal elections in the 1980s.\n\nThe like-minded liberals also formed the [[Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government]] (JCPDG) and the [[Group of 190]] to strive for the [[1988 Hong Kong electoral reform|1988 Legislative Council election]] and the faster democratisation the political structure towards 1997 and after 1997 during the drafting of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], under the leadership of liberal drafters [[Martin Lee]] and [[Szeto Wah]]. During the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the liberals stood firmly with the student protestors, formed the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] (HKASPDMC) and condemned the bloody suppression on 4 June.\n\nIn preparation for the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first Legislative Council direct election]] in 1991, members of the three political groups and many liberal activists of the JCPDG joined together and formed the United Democrats of Hong Kong in April 1990.{{sfn|Allen|1997|p=169}} Chaired by the Martin Lee, the United Democrats of Hong Kong formed an alliance with [[Anthony Cheung Bing-leung]]'s Meeting Point in the campaign.{{sfn|Lau|1993|p=118}} The liberal alliance won a landslide victory in the direct election, receiving over 52% of the vote{{sfn|Beatty|2003|p=21}} and winning 14 of the 16 [[geographical constituency]] seats in September. The popularity of the pro-democratic alliance was principally rose from its position towards the Tiananmen Square protests and the widespread fear towards the Beijing government afterwards.\n\nThe United Democrats stood a firm anti-Beijing stances, criticising the Tiananmen crackdown and also the democratic situation. As a result, Lee and Szeto were deprived their posts in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee|Basic Law Drafting Committee]] and were accused of \"treason\". The United Democrats supported the last governor [[Chris Patten]]'s [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|democratic reform proposal]], which allowed a much extended electorate for the [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|first fully elected Legislative Council election]] in 1995 and was ferociously opposed by Beijing.\n\nThe United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point further united by announcing the formation of the Democratic Party on 18 April 1994.{{sfn|Preston|2001|p=72}} They formally merged into the Democratic Party on 2 October 1994, in eve of the three-tier elections in 1994 and 1995. Martin Lee became the first Chairman of the party and Anthony Cheung and [[Yeung Sum]] became the Vice-Chairmen, elected on the [[1994 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|first general meeting]] on the establishment day. The ADPL continued to keep its own identity, arguing that it represented grassroots' interest whereas the Democratic Party was more focused on the \"middle class\".{{sfn|Allen|1997|p=169}}\n\nThe founding manifesto of the Democratic Party said it would seek to further unite democratic forces, strive for a high degree of autonomy and an open, democratic government, and would promote welfare and equality in Hong Kong. The party also tried to appropriate the discourse of nationalism as it stated \"We care for China and, as part of the Chinese citizeny, we have the rights and obligations to participate in and comment on the affairs of China.\" It also called for the condemnation of the 1989 Tiananmen Incident as well as an amendment of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] before 1997 to allow full election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.{{sfn|Chan|1997|p=69}}\n\n===1994/95 elections and Provisional Legislative Council (1994\u20131998)===\nThe electorate base of the 1995 LegCo election was largely extended by the [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] [[Chris Patten]]'s [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|controversial electoral reform package]] supported by the pro-democrats. Facing the challenge from the newly formed business conservative [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] and pro-Beijing loyalist [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB), the Democratic Party was able to win handsome victories in the three-tier elections in 1994 and 1995. In the LegCo election in September 1995, the party secured 42% of the vote and 19 of the 60 total seats, emerging as the largest party in the Legislative Council, compared to Liberal Party's 10 seats and DAB's 6 seats. Together with the ADPL and other pro-democracy independents, the democratic coalition was able to garner one- or two-vote majorities on certain anti-government issues during the last term of the legislature.{{sfn|Beatty|2003|p=26}}\n\nThe party's stance conflicted with the PRC government's, which, for a while, earned the party more popularity and recognition both locally and overseas.  The party chairman Martin Lee became well-known internationally in the run-up to reunification as a human rights and democracy fighter, and won a number of international human rights awards.\n\nAfter Patten's reform package was passed, Beijing decided that the legislature elected in 1995 could not ride the \"through train\" beyond the [[handover of Hong Kong]], as the first legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). Instead, Beijing set up a highly controlled [[Provisional Legislative Council]] (PLC) in December 1996. The Democratic Party refused to join the [[Selection Committee]] as it opposed to Beijing's decision \"to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature and replace it with a hand-picked version.\"{{sfn|Chan|1997|p=73}} The party thus lost all 19 seats until the PLC was replaced by the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR in 1998.\n\nAt the midnight on 30 June just after the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony|handover ceremony]], the Democratic Party LegCo members protested against the abrupt termination of their tenure and call for the establishment of democratic government at the balcony of the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], and vow to return to the legislature by means of election in 1998.{{sfn|Eur|2002|p=333}}\n\n===Return to Legislative Council and early crises (1998\u20132002)===\nDecided by the Provisional Legislative Council, the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system was replaced by the [[proportional representation]] system in the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|first LegCo election]] in 1998. The proportional representation gave an advantage to the weaker pro-Beijing DAB as it did not require a majority to win a seat. Thus in 1995 the Democratic Party won 12 seats in the [[geographical constituencies]] with 42.3% of the vote, but it got only 9 seat with 40.2% of the vote in 1998.{{sfn|Bush|2005|p=95}}\n\nAfter the handover, the [[Right of abode issue, Hong Kong|Right of Abode litigation]] was initiated immediately and reached its climax in the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]]'s (CFA) decisions favouring the right of abode seekers in ''Ng Ka Ling'' and ''Chan Kam Nga'' lawsuits in January 1999. The Democratic Party supported the right of abode seekers and opposed strongly to the government's decision to refer the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) to interpret the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]].{{sfn|Khun|2009|p=79-80}} Party chairman Martin Lee condemned this move as \"a dagger striking at the heart of the [[rule of law]]\" and in symbolic protest walked out of the Legislative Council with 18 other members, all dressed in black.{{sfn|Krasner|2013|p=133}} However, the party appeared to suffer from popular discontent with the party's position.{{sfn| Sharpe|2001|p=3}} The party was also criticised for failing to broaden its post-1997 agenda and develop a well-defined social base.{{sfn|Nery|2008|p=49-50}}\n\nThe party also appeared to suffer from the internal dissension. In December 1998, the \"Young Turks\" led by [[Andrew To]] staged a successful coup d'\u00e9tat in the [[1998 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|party leadership election]], which promptly brought the party into a phase of factional struggle. The Young Turks formed their own list of about ten candidates to run for the Central Committee and nominated [[Lau Chin-shek]] to run for vice-chairman against the former Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung. Some hoped to make Lau as their factional leader, to lead the party from the Meeting Point faction's pro-middle class, pro-[[laissez-faire]] and pro-Beijing positions to a more pro-grassroots and confrontational position.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ma| first=Ngok |date= 2001 | title=The Decline of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong: The Second Legislative Election in the HKSAR | journal=[[Asian Survey]] |volume= 41  | issue= 4 | pages=577 | url= | accessdate= | doi=10.1525/as.2001.41.4.564}}</ref>\nAlthough Lau was elected vice-chairman, he resigned after the election. Lau was subsequently forced to leave the party in June 2000 after a one-year membership freeze, due to Lau's Democratic Party/[[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|Frontier]] dual membership.\n\nIn a general meeting in September 1999, the Young Turks also proposed to put the [[minimum wage]] legislation on the [[2000 Hong Kong legislative election|2000 LegCo election]] platform of the party. The Mainstreamers which included the \"triumvirate\", Yeung Sum, [[Cheung Man-kwong]] and [[Lee Wing-tat]], saw the minimum wage debate was a challenge to the party authority and decide to fight back by joining hands with the Meeting Point faction to defeat the Young Turks. Andrew To wrote a newspaper article accusing the Mainstreamers of suppressing intra-party dissent, \"just like the butchers in the Tiananmen massacre.\"{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=139}} To's comment led to a backlash of opinion within the party and led to the defeat of the minimum wage motion.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=139}} The debate, largely took place in the mass media, publicised the factional rivalries and created a bad image within the party.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=140}}\n\nThe popular discontent and internal fragmentation appeared to have marked a turning point in the prospects of the Democratic Party and the DAB. In the [[1999 Hong Kong local elections|1999 District Council elections]], the DAB more than doubled its representation, while Democratic Party performed less well than anticipated, winning 86 seats.{{sfn|Pretson|2001|p=77}} In the [[2000 Hong Kong legislative election|second LegCo election]] in the following year, [[Tsang Kin-shing]] and Steve Chan Kwok-leung left the party and ran as independents after failing to be nominated on the candidates list by the Central Committee.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=144}} The election results showed the party's share in the geographical constituencies dropped to 35%, and the party secured 9 out of the 24 directly elected seats. Its total number of seats in LegCo remained at 12.\n\nIn December 2002, Yeung Sum succeeded Martin Lee as Party chairman in the [[2002 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|leadership change]], legislator [[Albert Chan]], belonging to the pro-grassroots relatively \"radical\" faction, left the party.<ref name=\"Albert\"/> By the end of 2002, more than 50 members of the party which had already formed a political group, [[Social Democratic Forum]], defected to [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|the Frontier]], mostly Young Turks.<ref name=\"Albert\">{{cite news|title=Albert Chan quits day after Democrat leadership change|date=3 December 2002|first=Ambrose|last=Leung|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/399499/albert-chan-quits-day-after-democrat-leadership-change}}</ref>\n\n===2003 July 1 march and rebound in popularity (2002\u20132004)===\nIn 2002 and 2003 the party saw a rebound in popularity, largely due to the low popularity of the [[Tung Chee-hwa]]'s administration, and more significantly the controversy over the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] legislation. The pro-democrats worried that the anti-subversion law would threaten the rights and freedom of the Hong Kong people and damaged the rule of law and \"One Country, Two Systems.\" The Article 23 legislation turned into a territory-wide debate and led to a re-awakening of civil society, mobilising different sectors to join the opposition movement.{{sfn|Khun|2009|p=58}} The Democratic Party used many of their 94 district offices for community-level mobilisation. In the weeks before the [[2003 July 1 march|1 July march]], the Democratic Party managed to collect phone numbers of about 40,000 supporters. The party's volunteers and staff called them one by one to call on them to join the demonstration.{{sfn|Khun|2009|p=58}} The demonstration resulted in a record-breaking number of people, more than 500,000 Hong Kong people joined the march. The SAR government had to back down and shelve the bill indefinitely.\n\nIn the following [[2003 Hong Kong local elections|2003 District Council elections]] in November, the pro-democracy camp turned the popular support into the demand of democratisation, [[universal suffrage]] of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council in 2007 and 2008, their primary goals for years. The Democratic Party received a great victory by claiming 95 seats out of the 120 candidates in the election.{{sfn|Poon|2007|p=164}}\n\nThe civil movement in 2003 also broadened the spectrum of the pro-democracy camp. A number of pro-democracy groups such as [[Article 45 Concern Group]] and individuals such as [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Albert Cheng]] were elected in the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004 LegCo election]]. Although the pan-democracy camp took 25 of 60 seats, the Democratic Party won only 9 seats, falling from the largest party in the Legislative Council to the third, behind DAB's 13 (including the FTU members) and pro-business Liberal Party's 10.{{sfn|Chan|2008|p=11}} Worried by pre-election surveys indicating that Martin Lee might be in danger, the Democratic Party sent out a last minute S.O.S. call to \"save Martin Lee\" who was listed second on the Democratic Party's list behind chairman Yeung Sum in the [[Hong Kong Island constituency]]. As a result, Yeung's and Lee's list absorbed too many votes at the expense of pro-democracy ally [[Cyd Ho]] losing by just 815 votes to DAB's [[Choy So-yuk]].{{sfn|Pepper|2008|p=378}} It caused some dissatisfaction among some supporters of the party and the camp generally. Yeung Sum announced he would not seek for re-election as chairman after the election as a result and subsequently replaced by Lee Wing-tat in the [[2004 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|party leadership election]] in December.\n\n===Campaign for 2007/08 universal suffrage and merge with the Frontier (2004\u20132008)===\nAlthough lack of breakthrough in the legislative elections, the pan-democracy maintains its basic position of seeking universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 for Chief Executive and Legislative Council respectively, even though the NPCSC's interpretation of the Basic Law in April 2004 rejected the demand. After Tung Chee-hwa's resigned as Chief Executive in March 2005, Party chairman Lee Wing-tat attempted to run for the post against [[Donald Tsang]] but failed to get enough nominations in the [[Election Committee]]. Donald Tsang was elected uncontestedly in the [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|Chief Executive election]].\n\nIn October 2005, Donald Tsang's administration issued a [[2005 Hong Kong electoral reform|blueprint for the electoral reform]]. The proposal aimed to double to size of Election Committee to 1,600 and add 10 seats to the Legislative Council, half of which would be directly elected and the rest returned by District Councillors.{{sfn|Poon|2007|p=165}} The pro-democracy parties criticised the proposal as conservative as it did not move towards to universal suffrage. In December, the camp held a [[December 2005 protest for democracy in Hong Kong|mass rally]] against the government's reform package and demanded a timetable and road-map to democracy be attached to the proposal. The reform package was at last vetoed by the pan-democracy camp.{{sfn|Poon|2007|p=165}} In December 2006, 114 of the 137 pro-democracy candidates filled by the Democratic Party and the newly established [[Civic Party]] won the [[2006 Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections|Election Committee subsector elections]] which secured the threshold of 100 nominations to enter the [[2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|next Chief Executive election]].\n\nSince early 2005, 24 members had quit the party, including district councillor Stephen Fong Chun-bong (who was forced out by the party) and Lau Tak-cheung. Twelve district councillors also left the party. Another district councillor died in a car accident. The number of district councillors decreased by 13 to 79. In March 2006, the Mainstreamer faction alleged that some senior members were involved in spying activities of China. The \"suspects\" were all Young Turks Reformist members including vice-chairman [[Chan King-ming]] and [[Gary Fan]]. The Young Turk members were all ousted in the following [[2006 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|leadership election]] in December, with Mainstreamer [[Albert Ho]] defeating Chan King-ming as the new party chairman.\n\nThe democrats suffered a humiliating defeat in the [[2007 Hong Kong local elections|District Council elections]] in November 2007. The Democratic Party took the heaviest loss of 36 seats as compared with 2003.{{sfn|Chan|2008|p=86}} 23 of the party's incumbent Councillors were ousted, with just over half of its candidates elected.{{sfn|Lam|2012|p=117}} The Democratic Party was by far outstripped by the Beijing loyalist DAB which won total of 115 seats, recapturing the loss in 2003 and also much expanding.\n\nOn 29 December 2007, the NPCSC unveiled a timetable for the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive in 2017 and for the entire Legislative Council by 2020 with a host of conditions. The NPCSC decision helped reducing the political pressure on Tsang while removing pan-democracy camp's key rallying cry in the following LegCo election, although the pro-democratic parties were still calling for the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council in 2012.\n\nIn the [[2008 Hong Kong legislative election|2008 LegCo election]], the Democratic Party's share of vote further dropped to 20.6%, winning only 8 seats. The emerging pro-democratic parties professionals-formed Civic Party and left-wing [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) took the share of 13.7% and 10.1% and won 5 and 3 seats respectively. Facing the emerging new parties, the two old political parties the Democratic Party and [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|the Frontier]] merged. At the time, the Democratic Party had 636 members, 8 legislators and 57 District Council members, while the Frontier had one legislator, [[Emily Lau]], three District Councillors and around 110 members.<ref name=\"thestandard.com.hk\">[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=72769&sid=20973377&con_type=1 Party pact sees women as kings of a new frontier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530131314/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=72769&sid=20973377&con_type=1 |date=30 May 2009 }}</ref> In the following month, Albert Ho was re-elected chairman, and Emily Lau became a Vice-Chairman of the new combined party in the [[2008 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|party leadership election]].<ref>[http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&20081214&56&545336 Emily Lau elected DP vice-chairman] RTHK 14 December 2008</ref>\n\n===2010 reform proposal breakthrough and 2012 elections (2008\u20132012)===\nIn the following [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|electoral reform for the 2012 Chief Executive and LegCo elections]] in 2009 and 2010, Donald Tsang proposed a reform package which had not much difference from the 2005 proposal.

The Civic Party and League of Social Democrats launched a ''de facto'' referendum by resigning and triggering [[2010 Hong Kong by-election|territory-wide by-elections]] to let the voters voice out their demand on democracy. The Democratic Party refused to participate as it argued it was not an effective way.

The election was dominated by the two candidates from the pro-Beijing camp, [[Henry Tang]] and [[Leung Chun-ying]] and marked by scandals, dirty tactics and smears from both sides. Albert Ho fell behind in the opinion poll throughout the campaign partly due to the impossibility of him being elected by the Beijing-controlled Election Committee. The pan-democracy camp called for casting blank votes on the election day. During the election 1,132 votes were cast, CY Leung received 689; Henry Tang received 285, and Albert Ho received 76.<ref>[http://www.elections.gov.hk/ce2012/eng/result.html The Fourth Term Chief Executive Election \u2013 Result]. Government of Hong Kong.</ref>\n\nIn the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|LegCo election]] in the following September, the party successfully gained two of the five seats of the territory-wide based new [[District Council (Second)]] constituency which were created by its own proposal. However, the total seats of the party dropped from 8 to only 6 seats, the worst results in the party's history. The party could only gained 13.7% of the popular vote, even less than Civic Party's 14.1% and lost all its seats in the [[New Territories West (constituency)|New Territories West]]. Chairman Albert Ho resigned after the election outcomes announced, vice-chairwoman Emily Lau took over as acting chairman. Lau defeated [[Sin Chung-kai]] as the first chairwoman of the party in the December [[2012 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|party leadership election]]. In December 2014, Emily Lau secured her chairwomanship against three challengers in the [[2014 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|chairperson re-election]], which was the most competitive leadership election in party's history.\n\n===Umbrella movement and aftermath (2012\u2013present)===\nIn March 2013, the Democrats formed the [[Alliance for True Democracy]] with other pan democratic parties for pressing the government to give out a genuinely democratic reform proposal. The party supported [[Benny Tai]]'s [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace]] proposal to launch a [[civil disobedience]] movement to further pressure the Beijing government. The party took a supporting role in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]] with many of its party figures arrested. In June 2015, the party voted against the government's proposal.\n\nIn the [[2015 Hong Kong local elections|2015 District Council election]], the Democrats won total number of 43 seats with several second-tier figures, including vice-chairman [[Lo Kin-hei]] and chief executive [[Lam Cheuk-ting]], scored victories, while others like former chairman Albert Ho and vice-chairman [[Andrew Wan]] lost.<ref name=\"ousted\">{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1881920/out-old-two-big-name-pan-democrats-ousted-tight-district|title=Out with the old: Two big-name pan-democrats ousted in tight district council election races|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]], the party proposed an unprecedented [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong) primaries, 2016|pre-election primary]] to hold public debates before selecting candidates for each constituency.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news|title=Hong Kong's Democratic Party to vote on pre-election primary proposal|date=5 December 2015|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1886918/hong-kongs-democratic-party-vote-pre-election-primary|first=Jeffie|last=Lam}}</ref> 14 nominations were received on 31 December 2015, in which three incumbents, chairperson [[Emily Lau]] and veterans [[Albert Ho]] and [[Sin Chung-kai]] did not seek for re-election to hasten the party's rejuvenation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Democratic Party leader Emily Lau decides not to seek re-election in 2016|date=31 December 2015|newspaper=South China Morning Post|first=Jeffie |last=Lam|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1896813/hong-kong-democratic-party-leader-emily-lau-decides-not-seek?page=all}}</ref> They chose to stand as second candidates behind young party colleagues, Lam Cheuk-ting, [[Andrew Wan]] and [[Hui Chi-fung]] respectively in order to boost the chances for them to get elected. Despite the decrease in their vote share, the Democrats gained seven seats, one more than the previous election, by retaking a seat in the [[New Territories West (constituency)|New Territories West]]. [[Roy Kwong]], a young progressive Democrat District Councillor also received most votes of nearly 500,000 in the [[District Council (Second)]] \"super seat\". By taking seven seats, the Democrats retook the status of flagship pro-democracy party.\n\nIn the [[2016 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|December leadership election]], legislator [[Wu Chi-wai]] was elected new chairman uncontestedly. The Democrats supported former [[Financial Secretary of Hong Kong|Financial Secretary]] [[John Tsang]], making the first time a pro-democracy party to support an establishment candidate, after the pro-democrats decided not to field their candidate in order to boost the chance of an alternative candidate against incumbent [[Leung Chun-ying]]. The Democrats opposed former [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Carrie Lam]], the eventual winner of the election. However, the party has developed a warmer relationship with Carrie Lam government, evident in the attendance and donation of the Chief Executive to the party's 2018 anniversary dinner.<ref>{{cite news|title='Great reconciliation': Chief Exec.

You're a waste of life, bitch!\" at a LegCo meeting after Lam dismissed the opposition views as \"extreme\" and \"unnecessary fear\" and called the claims that it was a deliberate decision by the colonial government to exclude the mainland from any rendition arrangements in the 1990s as \"nonsense\".

In 1999, Lee asserted that the Democratic Party should strive to serve as representative of middle class interests, and take balance between parliamentary politics and street action. Yeung and Lee were the party chairmen from 2002 to 2004 and 2004 to 2006 respectively.\n* '''Meeting Point''' \u2013 consisting of former members of the [[Meeting Point]], including Lo Chi-kin, [[Andrew Fung]] and led by the former Meeting Point chairman [[Anthony Cheung]].{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=137}} The Meeting Point faction prefers a more pro-middle class, pro-market and moderate agenda.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=136}} It also stresses dialogue with Beijing and Hong Kong governments over struggle, and parliamentary politics over street action.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=137}} Anthony Cheung quit the party in 2004 and was appointed to the [[Secretary for Transport and Housing]] by [[Leung Chun-ying]] in 2012; Andrew Fung quit the party in 2012 in an unpleasant manner and was appointed government's information coordinator in 2013.\n* '''Young Turks''' \u2013 consisting of the relatively radical, left-wing and pro-grassroots activists and local-level party members including Steve Chan Kwok-leung, [[Tsang Kin-shing]], [[Andrew Cheng]], [[Albert Chan]] and Eric Wong Chung-ki. Led by [[Andrew To]], the Young Turks believed that the party should take struggle over dialogue and mass movements over parliamentary politics as the party's strategy.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=137}} They also suggested adopting more grassroots platform such as [[minimum wage]]. The Young Turks were more like a \"factional clique\" than an organised faction as they were a group of young politicians with poor discipline and only had some vague common ideas, without a clear leader, coherent ideologies or positions.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=153-4}} The Young Turks attempted to challenge the party leadership by nominating [[Lau Chin-shek]] to run for vice-chairman against Anthony Cheung in the 1998 party leadership election.{{sfn|Kuan|2002|p=135-6}} Lau was expelled from the party in 2000 and Andrew To, Tsang Kin-shing and Albert Chan left the party and subsequently formed the left-wing [[League of Social Democrats]] in 2006. \n* '''Reformists''' \u2013 as many original Young Turks left, a new Reformist group emerged as the main opposition faction against the Mainstreamers party leadership, which included [[Chan King-ming]] who contested for chairman in the [[2004 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|2004 election]] and [[2006 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|2006 election]] and Legislative Council member Andrew Cheng. [[New Territories East (constituency)|New Territories East]] was the Reformists' stronghold; Chan King-ming was the Chairman of the New Territories East branch and Andrew Cheng was the legislator from the same constituency. The faction was involved in alleged spying activities of China which led to the intra-party investigation in 2006. Andrew Cheng and other Reformists quit after the party supported the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|controversial electoral reform package]].

RR spectroscopy has found wide application to the analysis of [[bioinorganic]] molecules. The technique measures the [[energy]] required to change the vibrational state of a molecule as does [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared (IR) spectroscopy]]. The mechanism and selection rules are different in each technique, however, band positions are identical and therefore the two methods provide complementary information.\n\n[[Infrared spectroscopy]] involves measuring the direct absorption of [[photon]]s with the appropriate energy to excite [[Covalent bond|molecular bond]] vibrational modes and phonons. The [[wavelength]]s of these photons lie in the [[infrared]] region of the [[spectrum]], hence the name of the technique.  Raman spectroscopy measures the excitation of bond vibrations by an [[inelastic scattering]] process, in which the incident photons are more energetic (usually in the visible, ultraviolet or even X-ray region) and lose (or gain in the case of [[Anti-Stokes line|anti-Stokes Raman scattering]]) only part of their energy to the sample. The two methods are complementary because some vibrational transitions that are observed in IR spectroscopy are not observed in Raman spectroscopy, and vice versa.  RR [[spectroscopy]] is an extension of conventional Raman spectroscopy that can provide increased sensitivity to specific (colored) compounds that are present at low (micro to millimolar) in an otherwise complex mixture of compounds.\n\nAn advantage of resonance Raman spectroscopy over (normal) Raman spectroscopy is that the intensity of bands can be increased by several orders of magnitude. An application that illustrates this advantage is the study of the dioxygen unit in [[cytochrome c oxidase]]. Identification of the band associated with the O\u2013O stretching vibration was confirmed by using <sup>18</sup>O\u2013<sup>16</sup>O and <sup>16</sup>O\u2013<sup>16</sup>O [[isotopologue]]s.<ref> {{cite book |first1=Shinya |last1= Yoshikawa |first2=Atsuhiro |last2=Shimada |first3=Kyoko |last3=Shinzawa-Itoh |editor=Peter M.H.

These frequencies correspond to radiation in the infrared (IR) region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. At any given instant, each molecule in a sample has a certain amount of vibrational energy. However, the amount of vibrational energy that a molecule has continually changes due to collisions and other interactions with other molecules in the sample.\n\nAt room temperature, most molecules are in the lowest [[energy level|energy state]]\u2014known as the ''[[ground state]]''. A few molecules are in higher energy states\u2014known as ''excited states''. The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature can be calculated using the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Performing such a calculation shows that, for relatively low temperatures (such as those used for most routine spectroscopy), most of the molecules occupy the ground vibrational state (except in the case of low-frequency modes). Such a molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy. This is the mechanism by which IR spectroscopy operates: infrared radiation is passed through the sample, and the intensity of the transmitted light is compared with that of the incident light. A reduction in intensity at a given wavelength of light indicates the absorption of energy by a vibrational transition. The energy, <math>E</math>, of a [[photon]] is\n\n:<math>E=h \\nu</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\nu</math> is the [[frequency]] of the [[radiation]]. Thus, the energy required for such transition may be calculated if the frequency of the incident radiation is known.\n\nIt is also possible to observe molecular vibrations by an [[inelastic scattering]] process, Stokes Raman scattering being one such process. A photon is absorbed and then re-emitted (scattered) with lower energy. The difference in energy between the absorbed and re-emitted photons corresponds to the energy required to excite a molecule to a higher vibrational mode. Anti-Stokes Raman scattering is another inelastic scattering process and only occurs from molecules starting in excited vibrational states; it results in light scattered with higher energy. Light scattered elastically (no change in energy between the incoming photons and the re-emitted/scattered photons) is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].\n\nGenerally, the difference in energy is recorded as the difference in [[wavenumber]] (<math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math>) between the laser light and the scattered light which is known as the Raman shift. A Raman spectrum is generated by plotting the intensity of the scattered light versus <math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math>. \n\n<!--However, in molecules that exhibit [[fluorescence]], the Stokes lines may be obscured while the anti-Stokes lines remain unaffected. In such cases, it is necessary to use the anti-Stokes lines despite their lower intensity.-->\n\nLike infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify chemical compounds because the values of <math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math> are indicative of different chemical species (their so-called chemical fingerprint). This is because the frequencies of [[vibrational transition]]s depend on the atomic masses and the bond strengths. Thus, armed with a database of spectra from known compounds, one can unambiguously identify many different known chemical compounds based on a Raman spectrum. The number of vibrational modes scales with the number of atoms in a molecule, which means that the Raman spectra from large molecules is complicated. For example, [[protein]]s typically contain thousands of atoms and therefore have thousands of vibrational modes. If these modes have similar energies (<math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math>), then the spectrum may be incredibly cluttered and complicated.\n\nNot all vibrational transitions are ''Raman active'', meaning that some vibrational transitions do not appear in the Raman spectrum. This is because of the spectroscopic [[selection rule]]s for Raman spectra. In contrast to IR spectroscopy, where a transition can only be seen when that particular vibration causes a net change in [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of the molecule, in Raman spectroscopy only transitions where the [[polarizability]] of the molecule changes along the vibrational coordinate can be observed. This is the fundamental difference in how IR and Raman spectroscopy access the vibrational transitions. In Raman spectroscopy, the incoming photon causes a momentary distortion of the electron distribution around a bond in a molecule, followed by re-emission of the radiation as the bond returns to its normal state. This causes temporary [[Dipolar polarization|polarization]] of the bond and an induced dipole that disappears upon relaxation. In a molecule with a center of symmetry, a change in dipole is accomplished by loss of the center of symmetry, while a change in polarizability is compatible with preservation of the center of symmetry. Thus, in a centrosymmetric molecule, asymmetrical stretching and bending are IR active and Raman inactive, while symmetrical stretching and bending is Raman active and IR inactive. Hence, in a centrosymmetric molecule, [[Rule of mutual exclusion|IR and Raman spectroscopy are mutually exclusive]]. For molecules without a center of symmetry, each vibrational mode may be IR active, Raman active, both, or neither. Symmetrical stretches and bends, however, tend to be Raman active.\n\n== Theory of resonance Raman scattering ==\nIn resonance Raman spectroscopy, the wavelength of the incoming photons coincides with an [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transition]] of the molecule or material. Electronic excitation of a molecule results in structural changes which are reflected in the enhancement of Raman scattering of certain vibrational modes. Vibrational modes that undergo a change in bond length and/or force constant during the electronic excitation can show a large increase in polarizability and hence Raman intensity. This is known as Tsuboi's rule, which gives a qualitative relationship between the nature of an electronic transition and the enhancement pattern in resonance Raman spectroscopy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hirakawa|first=A.

These are the transform theory, developed by [[Andreas Albrecht (chemist)|Albrecht]] and the time-dependent theory developed by [[Eric J. Heller|Heller]].<ref name=\"McHale\">{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy|last=McHale|first=Jeanne L.|publisher=Wiley|year=2002|isbn=0471988472|volume=1|location=Chichester|pages=535\u2013556|chapter=Resonance Raman Spectroscopy}}</ref>\n\n== Applications==\nThe selective enhancement of the Raman scattering from specific modes under resonance conditions means that resonance Raman spectroscopy is especially useful for large biomolecules with [[chromophores]] embedded in their structure. In such chromophores, the resonance scattering from charge-transfer (CT) electronic transitions of the metal complex generally result in enhancement of metal-[[ligand]] stretching modes, as well as some of the modes associated with the ligands alone. Hence, in a biomolecule such as [[hemoglobin]], tuning the laser to near the charge-transfer electronic transition of the iron center results in a spectrum reflecting only the stretching and bending modes associated with the [[tetrapyrrole]]-iron group. Consequently, in a molecule with thousands of vibrational modes, RR spectroscopy allows us to look at relatively few vibrational modes at a time. The Raman spectrum of a protein containing perhaps hundreds of peptide bonds but only a single porphyrin molecule may show only the vibrations associated with the porphyrin. This reduces the complexity of the spectrum and allows for easier identification of an unknown protein. Also, if a protein has more than one chromophore, different chromophores can be studied individually if their CT bands differ in energy. In addition to identifying compounds, RR spectroscopy can also supply structural identification about chromophores in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of RR spectroscopy over non-resonant Raman spectroscopy is the large increase in intensity of the bands in question (by as much as a factor of 10<sup>6</sup>). This allows RR spectra to be obtained with sample concentrations as low as 10<sup>\u22128</sup> M. It also makes it possible to record Raman spectra of short-lived excited state species when [[pulsed laser]]s are used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Steven E.

RR spectra usually exhibit fewer bands than the non resonant Raman spectrum of a compound, and the enhancement seen for each band can vary depending on the electronic transitions with which the laser is resonant. Since typically, RR spectroscopy are obtained with lasers at visible and near-UV wavelengths, spectra are more likely to be affected by fluorescence. Furthermore, photodegradation (photobleaching) and heating of the sample can occur as the sample also absorbs the excitation light, dissipating the energy as heat.\n\n== Instrumentation ==\n{{main|Raman spectroscopy#Instrumentation}}\n[[File:InVia Raman microscope - March 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|Raman microscope]]\nThe instrumentation used for resonance Raman spectroscopy is identical to that used for Raman spectroscopy; specifically, a highly monochromatic [[light source]] (a laser), with an emission wavelength in either the near-infrared, visible, or near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Since the energy of electronic transitions (i.e. the color) varies widely from compound to compound, [[Tunable laser|wavelength-tunable lasers]], which appeared in the early 1970s, are useful as they can be tuned to coincide with an electronic transition (resonance). However, the broadness of electronic transitions means that many laser wavelengths may be necessary and multi-line lasers ([[Ion laser|Argon and Krypton ion]]) are commonly used. The essential point is that the wavelength of the laser emission is coincident with an electronic absorption band of the compound of interest. The spectra obtained contain non-resonant Raman scattering of the matrix (e.g., solvent) also. \n\nSample handling in Raman spectroscopy offers considerable advantages over FTIR spectroscopy in that glass can be used for windows, [[lens (optics)|lenses]], and other [[optical]] components. A further advantage is that whereas [[water]] absorbs strongly in the infrared region, which limits the pathlengths that can be used and masking large region of the spectrum, the intensity of Raman scattering from water is usually weak and direct absorption interferes only when near-infrared lasers (e.g., 1064&nbsp;nm) are used. Therefore, water is an ideal solvent. However, since the laser is focused to a relatively small spot size, rapid heating of samples can occur. When resonance Raman spectra are recorded, however, sample heating and photo-bleaching can cause damage and a change to the Raman spectrum obtained. Furthermore, if the absorbance of the sample is high (> OD 2) over the wavelength range in which the Raman spectrum is recorded then inner-filter effects (reabsorption of the Raman scattering by the sample) can decrease signal intensity dramatically. Typically, the sample is placed into a tube, which can then be spun to decrease the sample's exposure to the laser light, and reduce the effects of photodegradation.  [[Gaseous]], [[liquid]], and [[solid]] samples can all be analyzed using RR spectroscopy.\n\nAlthough scattered light leaves the sample in all directions the collection of the scattered light is achieved only over a relatively small solid angle by a lens and directed to the spectrograph and CCD detector. The laser beam can be at any angle with respect to the optical axis used to collect Raman scattering. In free space systems, the laser path is typically at an angle of 180\u00b0 or 135\u00b0 (a so-called back scattering arrangement). The 180\u00b0 arrangement is typically used in microscopes and fiber optic based Raman probes. Other arrangements involve the laser passing at 90\u00b0 with respect to the optical axis. Detection angles of 90\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 are less frequently used.\n\nThe collected scattered radiation is focused into a [[spectrograph]], in which the light is first collimated and then dispersed by a [[diffraction grating]] and refocused onto a [[CCD camera]]. The entire spectrum is recorded simultaneously and multiple scans can be acquired in a short period of time, which can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum through averaging.

In two-photon absorption, two photons are simultaneously absorbed into a molecule. When that molecule relaxes from this excited state to its ground state, only one photon is emitted. This is a type of fluorescence.\n\nIn resonance Raman spectroscopy, certain parts of molecules can be targeted by adjusting the wavelength of the incident laser beam to the \u201ccolor\u201d (energy between two desired electron quantum levels) of the part of the molecule that is being studied. This is known as resonance fluorescence, hence the addition of the term \u201cresonance\u201d to the name \u201cRaman spectroscopy\u201d. Some excited states can be achieved via single or double photon absorption. In these cases, however, the use of double photon excitation can be used to attain more information about these excited states than would a single photon absorption. There are some limitations and consequences to both resonance Raman and resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy.<ref name=\"Kelley2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Kelley|first1=Anne Myers|title=Hyper-Raman Scattering by Molecular Vibrations|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|volume=61|issue=1|year=2010|pages=41\u201361|issn=0066-426X|doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.012809.103347|pmid=20055673}}</ref>\n\nBoth resonance Raman and resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy employ a tunable laser. The wavelength of a tunable laser can be adjusted by the operator to wavelengths within a particular range. This frequency range, however, is dependent on the laser\u2019s design. Regular resonance Raman spectroscopy, therefore, is only sensitive to the electron energy transitions that match that of the laser used in the experiment. The molecular parts that can be studied by normal resonance Raman spectroscopy is therefore limited to those bonds that happen to have a \u201ccolor\u201d that fits somewhere into the spectrum of \u201ccolors\u201d to which the laser used in that particular device can be tuned. Resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy, on the other hand, can excite atoms to emit light at wavelengths outside the laser\u2019s tunable range, thus expanding the range of possible components of a molecule that can be excited and therefore studied.\n\nResonance hyper Raman spectroscopy is one of the types of \u201cnon-linear\u201d Raman spectroscopy. In linear Raman spectroscopy, the amount of energy that goes into the excitation of an atom is the same amount that leaves the electron cloud of that atom when a photon is emitted and the electron cloud relaxes back down to its ground state. The term non-linear signifies reduced emission energy compared to input energy. In other words, the energy into the system no longer matches the energy out of the system. This is due to the fact that the energy input in hyper-Raman spectroscopy is much larger than that of typical Raman spectroscopy. Non-linear Raman spectroscopy tends to be more sensitive than conventional Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, it can significantly reduce, or even eliminate the effects of fluorescence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Spectroscopy/Vibrational_Spectroscopy/Raman_Spectroscopy/Raman:_Interpretation|title=Raman: Application|date=2 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==X-Ray Raman scattering==\nIn the [[X-ray]] region, enough energy is available for making [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transition]]s possible. At core level resonances, [[X-ray Raman scattering]] can become the dominating part of the [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectrum. This is due to the resonant behavior of the [[Kramers-Heisenberg formula]] in which the denominator is minimized for incident energies that equal a core level. This type of scattering is also known as [[Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering]] (RIXS). In the soft X-ray range, RIXS has been shown to reflect [[crystal field excitation]]s, which are often hard to observe with any other technique. Application of RIXS to [[strongly correlated material]]s is of particular value for gaining knowledge about their [[electronic structure]]. For certain [[wide band materials]] such as [[graphite]], RIXS has been shown to (nearly) conserve [[crystal momentum]] and thus has found use as a complementary [[bandmapping]] technique.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Scattering]]\n*[[Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]]\n*[[Vibronic spectroscopy]]\n*[[Depolarization ratio]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Long |first=Derek A | title=The Raman Effect: A Unified Treatment of the Theory of Raman Scattering by Molecules | publisher=Wiley | date=2002 |isbn=978-0471490289 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Que |editor-first=Lawrence Jr. | title=Physical Methods in Bioinorganic Chemistry: Spectroscopy and Magnetism | location=Sausalito, CA | publisher=University Science Books | date=2000 | isbn=978-1-891389-02-3 | pages=59\u2013120 }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Raman |first=C.V. |last2=Krishnan |first2=K.S. |title=A Change of Wave-Length in Light Scattering |journal=Nature |volume=121 |issue=3051 |pages=619 |year=1928 |doi=10.1038/121619b0 |bibcode=1928Natur.121..619R }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Raman |first=C.V. |last2=Krishnan |first2=K.S. |title=A New Type of Secondary Radiation |journal=Nature |volume=121 |issue=3048 |pages=501\u2013502 |year=1928 |doi=10.1038/121501c0 |url=http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/raman/index.html|bibcode=1928Natur.121..501R }}\n* {{cite book |last=Skoog |first=Douglas A. |last2=Holler |first2=James F. |last3=Nieman |first3=Timothy A. | title=Principles of Instrumental Analysis | edition=5th | publisher=Saunders | date=1998 | isbn=978-0-03-002078-0 | pages=429\u2013443}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Landsberg |first=G.S |last2=Mandelshtam |first2=L.I. |title=Novoye yavlenie pri rasseyanii sveta.

RR spectroscopy has found wide application to the analysis of [[bioinorganic]] molecules. The technique measures the [[energy]] required to change the vibrational state of a molecule as does [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared (IR) spectroscopy]]. The mechanism and selection rules are different in each technique, however, band positions are identical and therefore the two methods provide complementary information.\n\n[[Infrared spectroscopy]] involves measuring the direct absorption of [[photon]]s with the appropriate energy to excite [[Covalent bond|molecular bond]] vibrational modes and phonons. The [[wavelength]]s of these photons lie in the [[infrared]] region of the [[spectrum]], hence the name of the technique.  Raman spectroscopy measures the excitation of bond vibrations by an [[inelastic scattering]] process, in which the incident photons are more energetic (usually in the visible, ultraviolet or even X-ray region) and lose (or gain in the case of [[Anti-Stokes line|anti-Stokes Raman scattering]]) only part of their energy to the sample. The two methods are complementary because some vibrational transitions that are observed in IR spectroscopy are not observed in Raman spectroscopy, and vice versa.  RR [[spectroscopy]] is an extension of conventional Raman spectroscopy that can provide increased sensitivity to specific (colored) compounds that are present at low (micro to millimolar) in an otherwise complex mixture of compounds.\n\nAn advantage of resonance Raman spectroscopy over (normal) Raman spectroscopy is that the intensity of bands can be increased by several orders of magnitude. An application that illustrates this advantage is the study of the dioxygen unit in [[cytochrome c oxidase]].

These frequencies correspond to radiation in the infrared (IR) region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. At any given instant, each molecule in a sample has a certain amount of vibrational energy. However, the amount of vibrational energy that a molecule has continually changes due to collisions and other interactions with other molecules in the sample.\n\nAt room temperature, most molecules are in the lowest [[energy level|energy state]]\u2014known as the ''[[ground state]]''. A few molecules are in higher energy states\u2014known as ''excited states''. The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature can be calculated using the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Performing such a calculation shows that, for relatively low temperatures (such as those used for most routine spectroscopy), most of the molecules occupy the ground vibrational state (except in the case of low-frequency modes). Such a molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy. This is the mechanism by which IR spectroscopy operates: infrared radiation is passed through the sample, and the intensity of the transmitted light is compared with that of the incident light. A reduction in intensity at a given wavelength of light indicates the absorption of energy by a vibrational transition. The energy, <math>E</math>, of a [[photon]] is\n\n:<math>E=h \\nu</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\nu</math> is the [[frequency]] of the [[radiation]]. Thus, the energy required for such transition may be calculated if the frequency of the incident radiation is known.\n\nIt is also possible to observe molecular vibrations by an [[inelastic scattering]] process, Stokes Raman scattering being one such process. A photon is absorbed and then re-emitted (scattered) with lower energy. The difference in energy between the absorbed and re-emitted photons corresponds to the energy required to excite a molecule to a higher vibrational mode. Anti-Stokes Raman scattering is another inelastic scattering process and only occurs from molecules starting in excited vibrational states; it results in light scattered with higher energy. Light scattered elastically (no change in energy between the incoming photons and the re-emitted/scattered photons) is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].\n\nGenerally, the difference in energy is recorded as the difference in [[wavenumber]] (<math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math>) between the laser light and the scattered light which is known as the Raman shift. A Raman spectrum is generated by plotting the intensity of the scattered light versus <math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math>. \n\n<!--However, in molecules that exhibit [[fluorescence]], the Stokes lines may be obscured while the anti-Stokes lines remain unaffected. In such cases, it is necessary to use the anti-Stokes lines despite their lower intensity.-->\n\nLike infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify chemical compounds because the values of <math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math> are indicative of different chemical species (their so-called chemical fingerprint). This is because the frequencies of [[vibrational transition]]s depend on the atomic masses and the bond strengths. Thus, armed with a database of spectra from known compounds, one can unambiguously identify many different known chemical compounds based on a Raman spectrum. The number of vibrational modes scales with the number of atoms in a molecule, which means that the Raman spectra from large molecules is complicated. For example, [[protein]]s typically contain thousands of atoms and therefore have thousands of vibrational modes. If these modes have similar energies (<math>\\Delta \\bar \\nu</math>), then the spectrum may be incredibly cluttered and complicated.\n\nNot all vibrational transitions are ''Raman active'', meaning that some vibrational transitions do not appear in the Raman spectrum. This is because of the spectroscopic [[selection rule]]s for Raman spectra. In contrast to IR spectroscopy, where a transition can only be seen when that particular vibration causes a net change in [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of the molecule, in Raman spectroscopy only transitions where the [[polarizability]] of the molecule changes along the vibrational coordinate can be observed. This is the fundamental difference in how IR and Raman spectroscopy access the vibrational transitions. In Raman spectroscopy, the incoming photon causes a momentary distortion of the electron distribution around a bond in a molecule, followed by re-emission of the radiation as the bond returns to its normal state. This causes temporary [[Dipolar polarization|polarization]] of the bond and an induced dipole that disappears upon relaxation. In a molecule with a center of symmetry, a change in dipole is accomplished by loss of the center of symmetry, while a change in polarizability is compatible with preservation of the center of symmetry. Thus, in a centrosymmetric molecule, asymmetrical stretching and bending are IR active and Raman inactive, while symmetrical stretching and bending is Raman active and IR inactive. Hence, in a centrosymmetric molecule, [[Rule of mutual exclusion|IR and Raman spectroscopy are mutually exclusive]]. For molecules without a center of symmetry, each vibrational mode may be IR active, Raman active, both, or neither. Symmetrical stretches and bends, however, tend to be Raman active.\n\n== Theory of resonance Raman scattering ==\nIn resonance Raman spectroscopy, the wavelength of the incoming photons coincides with an [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transition]] of the molecule or material. Electronic excitation of a molecule results in structural changes which are reflected in the enhancement of Raman scattering of certain vibrational modes. Vibrational modes that undergo a change in bond length and/or force constant during the electronic excitation can show a large increase in polarizability and hence Raman intensity. This is known as Tsuboi's rule, which gives a qualitative relationship between the nature of an electronic transition and the enhancement pattern in resonance Raman spectroscopy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hirakawa|first=A.

In such chromophores, the resonance scattering from charge-transfer (CT) electronic transitions of the metal complex generally result in enhancement of metal-[[ligand]] stretching modes, as well as some of the modes associated with the ligands alone. Hence, in a biomolecule such as [[hemoglobin]], tuning the laser to near the charge-transfer electronic transition of the iron center results in a spectrum reflecting only the stretching and bending modes associated with the [[tetrapyrrole]]-iron group. Consequently, in a molecule with thousands of vibrational modes, RR spectroscopy allows us to look at relatively few vibrational modes at a time. The Raman spectrum of a protein containing perhaps hundreds of peptide bonds but only a single porphyrin molecule may show only the vibrations associated with the porphyrin. This reduces the complexity of the spectrum and allows for easier identification of an unknown protein. Also, if a protein has more than one chromophore, different chromophores can be studied individually if their CT bands differ in energy. In addition to identifying compounds, RR spectroscopy can also supply structural identification about chromophores in some cases.\n\nThe main advantage of RR spectroscopy over non-resonant Raman spectroscopy is the large increase in intensity of the bands in question (by as much as a factor of 10<sup>6</sup>). This allows RR spectra to be obtained with sample concentrations as low as 10<sup>\u22128</sup> M. It also makes it possible to record Raman spectra of short-lived excited state species when [[pulsed laser]]s are used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Steven E. J.|date=1996|title=Tutorial review. Time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy|journal=The Analyst|volume=121|issue=11|pages=107R|doi=10.1039/an996210107r|issn=0003-2654}}</ref> This is in stark contrast to non-resonant Raman spectra, which usually requires concentrations greater than 0.01 M. RR spectra usually exhibit fewer bands than the non resonant Raman spectrum of a compound, and the enhancement seen for each band can vary depending on the electronic transitions with which the laser is resonant. Since typically, RR spectroscopy are obtained with lasers at visible and near-UV wavelengths, spectra are more likely to be affected by fluorescence. Furthermore, photodegradation (photobleaching) and heating of the sample can occur as the sample also absorbs the excitation light, dissipating the energy as heat.\n\n== Instrumentation ==\n{{main|Raman spectroscopy#Instrumentation}}\n[[File:InVia Raman microscope - March 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|Raman microscope]]\nThe instrumentation used for resonance Raman spectroscopy is identical to that used for Raman spectroscopy; specifically, a highly monochromatic [[light source]] (a laser), with an emission wavelength in either the near-infrared, visible, or near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Since the energy of electronic transitions (i.e. the color) varies widely from compound to compound, [[Tunable laser|wavelength-tunable lasers]], which appeared in the early 1970s, are useful as they can be tuned to coincide with an electronic transition (resonance). However, the broadness of electronic transitions means that many laser wavelengths may be necessary and multi-line lasers ([[Ion laser|Argon and Krypton ion]]) are commonly used. The essential point is that the wavelength of the laser emission is coincident with an electronic absorption band of the compound of interest. The spectra obtained contain non-resonant Raman scattering of the matrix (e.g., solvent) also. \n\nSample handling in Raman spectroscopy offers considerable advantages over FTIR spectroscopy in that glass can be used for windows, [[lens (optics)|lenses]], and other [[optical]] components. A further advantage is that whereas [[water]] absorbs strongly in the infrared region, which limits the pathlengths that can be used and masking large region of the spectrum, the intensity of Raman scattering from water is usually weak and direct absorption interferes only when near-infrared lasers (e.g., 1064&nbsp;nm) are used. Therefore, water is an ideal solvent. However, since the laser is focused to a relatively small spot size, rapid heating of samples can occur. When resonance Raman spectra are recorded, however, sample heating and photo-bleaching can cause damage and a change to the Raman spectrum obtained. Furthermore, if the absorbance of the sample is high (> OD 2) over the wavelength range in which the Raman spectrum is recorded then inner-filter effects (reabsorption of the Raman scattering by the sample) can decrease signal intensity dramatically. Typically, the sample is placed into a tube, which can then be spun to decrease the sample's exposure to the laser light, and reduce the effects of photodegradation.  [[Gaseous]], [[liquid]], and [[solid]] samples can all be analyzed using RR spectroscopy.\n\nAlthough scattered light leaves the sample in all directions the collection of the scattered light is achieved only over a relatively small solid angle by a lens and directed to the spectrograph and CCD detector. The laser beam can be at any angle with respect to the optical axis used to collect Raman scattering. In free space systems, the laser path is typically at an angle of 180\u00b0 or 135\u00b0 (a so-called back scattering arrangement). The 180\u00b0 arrangement is typically used in microscopes and fiber optic based Raman probes. Other arrangements involve the laser passing at 90\u00b0 with respect to the optical axis. Detection angles of 90\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 are less frequently used.\n\nThe collected scattered radiation is focused into a [[spectrograph]], in which the light is first collimated and then dispersed by a [[diffraction grating]] and refocused onto a [[CCD camera]]. The entire spectrum is recorded simultaneously and multiple scans can be acquired in a short period of time, which can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum through averaging.

In two-photon absorption, two photons are simultaneously absorbed into a molecule. When that molecule relaxes from this excited state to its ground state, only one photon is emitted. This is a type of fluorescence.\n\nIn resonance Raman spectroscopy, certain parts of molecules can be targeted by adjusting the wavelength of the incident laser beam to the \u201ccolor\u201d (energy between two desired electron quantum levels) of the part of the molecule that is being studied. This is known as resonance fluorescence, hence the addition of the term \u201cresonance\u201d to the name \u201cRaman spectroscopy\u201d. Some excited states can be achieved via single or double photon absorption. In these cases, however, the use of double photon excitation can be used to attain more information about these excited states than would a single photon absorption. There are some limitations and consequences to both resonance Raman and resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy.<ref name=\"Kelley2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Kelley|first1=Anne Myers|title=Hyper-Raman Scattering by Molecular Vibrations|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|volume=61|issue=1|year=2010|pages=41\u201361|issn=0066-426X|doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.012809.103347|pmid=20055673}}</ref>\n\nBoth resonance Raman and resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy employ a tunable laser. The wavelength of a tunable laser can be adjusted by the operator to wavelengths within a particular range. This frequency range, however, is dependent on the laser\u2019s design. Regular resonance Raman spectroscopy, therefore, is only sensitive to the electron energy transitions that match that of the laser used in the experiment. The molecular parts that can be studied by normal resonance Raman spectroscopy is therefore limited to those bonds that happen to have a \u201ccolor\u201d that fits somewhere into the spectrum of \u201ccolors\u201d to which the laser used in that particular device can be tuned. Resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy, on the other hand, can excite atoms to emit light at wavelengths outside the laser\u2019s tunable range, thus expanding the range of possible components of a molecule that can be excited and therefore studied.\n\nResonance hyper Raman spectroscopy is one of the types of \u201cnon-linear\u201d Raman spectroscopy. In linear Raman spectroscopy, the amount of energy that goes into the excitation of an atom is the same amount that leaves the electron cloud of that atom when a photon is emitted and the electron cloud relaxes back down to its ground state. The term non-linear signifies reduced emission energy compared to input energy. In other words, the energy into the system no longer matches the energy out of the system. This is due to the fact that the energy input in hyper-Raman spectroscopy is much larger than that of typical Raman spectroscopy. Non-linear Raman spectroscopy tends to be more sensitive than conventional Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, it can significantly reduce, or even eliminate the effects of fluorescence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Spectroscopy/Vibrational_Spectroscopy/Raman_Spectroscopy/Raman:_Interpretation|title=Raman: Application|date=2 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==X-Ray Raman scattering==\nIn the [[X-ray]] region, enough energy is available for making [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transition]]s possible. At core level resonances, [[X-ray Raman scattering]] can become the dominating part of the [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectrum. This is due to the resonant behavior of the [[Kramers-Heisenberg formula]] in which the denominator is minimized for incident energies that equal a core level. This type of scattering is also known as [[Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering]] (RIXS). In the soft X-ray range, RIXS has been shown to reflect [[crystal field excitation]]s, which are often hard to observe with any other technique. Application of RIXS to [[strongly correlated material]]s is of particular value for gaining knowledge about their [[electronic structure]]. For certain [[wide band materials]] such as [[graphite]], RIXS has been shown to (nearly) conserve [[crystal momentum]] and thus has found use as a complementary [[bandmapping]] technique.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Scattering]]\n*[[Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]]\n*[[Vibronic spectroscopy]]\n*[[Depolarization ratio]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Long |first=Derek A | title=The Raman Effect: A Unified Treatment of the Theory of Raman Scattering by Molecules | publisher=Wiley | date=2002 |isbn=978-0471490289 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Que |editor-first=Lawrence Jr. | title=Physical Methods in Bioinorganic Chemistry: Spectroscopy and Magnetism | location=Sausalito, CA | publisher=University Science Books | date=2000 | isbn=978-1-891389-02-3 | pages=59\u2013120 }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Raman |first=C.V. |last2=Krishnan |first2=K.S. |title=A Change of Wave-Length in Light Scattering |journal=Nature |volume=121 |issue=3051 |pages=619 |year=1928 |doi=10.1038/121619b0 |bibcode=1928Natur.121..619R }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Raman |first=C.V. |last2=Krishnan |first2=K.S. |title=A New Type of Secondary Radiation |journal=Nature |volume=121 |issue=3048 |pages=501\u2013502 |year=1928 |doi=10.1038/121501c0 |url=http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/raman/index.html|bibcode=1928Natur.121..501R }}\n* {{cite book |last=Skoog |first=Douglas A. |last2=Holler |first2=James F. |last3=Nieman |first3=Timothy A. | title=Principles of Instrumental Analysis | edition=5th | publisher=Saunders | date=1998 | isbn=978-0-03-002078-0 | pages=429\u2013443}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Landsberg |first=G.S |last2=Mandelshtam |first2=L.I. |title=Novoye yavlenie pri rasseyanii sveta.
