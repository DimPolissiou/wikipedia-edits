He won several middle-distance running events in his hometown of [[Te Aroha]], although some members of his new school lived in [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]]. He attended [[Mount Albert Grammar School]] in Auckland, where he took up a wide range of team and individual sports, including [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], and [[golf]].

career ==\nBorn in [[Opunake]], Snell moved with his family to [[Waikato]] in 1949 where he attended Te Aroha College and became an all-around sportsman. He won several middle-distance running events in his hometown of [[Te Aroha]], although some members of his new school lived in [[Ngaruawahia]]. He attended [[Mount Albert Grammar School]] in Auckland, where he took up a wide range of team and individual sports, including [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], and [[golf]]. As a teenager, Snell excelled in tennis, and pursued the sport through appearances at the Auckland and New Zealand Junior Tennis Championships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferstle |first1=Jim |title=Peter Snell: Gentleman, Athlete, Scholar |url=http://www.runnersworld.com/elite-runners/peter-snell-gentleman-athlete-scholar |website=runnersworld.com |publisher=[[Rodale Inc.]] |accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt age 19, Snell was motivated to concentrate seriously on running by the comments of his future coach, Arthur Lydiard, who told him, \"Peter, with the sort of speed you've got, if you do the endurance training, you could be one of our best middle-distance runners.\"<ref name=\"lydiard-comment\">Winder, Virginia (2003) [https://web.archive.org/web/20040114092429/http://pukeariki.com/en/stories/sport/snell.asp \"Peter Snell's One-Track Mind\"]. pukeariki.com Retrieved 10 Jan. 2006.</ref> During his early career under the tutelage of Lydiard, he started with New Zealand titles and records for 880 yards and the mile, despite being an unusually large and powerful man by typical middle-distance runner standards.\n\n== Olympic success ==\nSnell came to international attention with his gold medal in the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 800 metres|800 metres]] at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Olympics]] in 1960, setting a new national record.

He joined [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]] as a research fellow in 1981.

Morgan''' (June 1, 1825 \u2013 September 4, 1864) was a  [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]] in the [[American Civil War]].  Morgan never used his middle name of Hunt during the war \u2014 it is a post war appellation.\n\nIn April 1862, he raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, fought at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], and then launched a costly raid in Kentucky, which encouraged [[Braxton Bragg]]'s invasion of that state. He also attacked the supply-lines of General [[William Rosecrans]]. In July 1863, he set out on a 1,000-mile raid into Indiana and Ohio, taking hundreds of prisoners. But after most of his men had been intercepted by Union gunboats, Morgan surrendered at Salineville, Ohio, the northernmost point ever reached by uniformed Confederates. The legendary \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\", which had been carried out against orders, gained no tactical advantage for the Confederacy, while the loss of his regiment proved a serious setback.\n\nMorgan escaped from his Union prison but his credibility was low, and he was restricted to minor operations. He was killed at [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], in September 1864. Morgan was the brother-in-law of Confederate general [[A. P. Hill]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nJohn H. Morgan was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], the eldest of ten children of Calvin and Henrietta (Hunt) Morgan. He was an uncle of geneticist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and a maternal grandson of [[John Wesley Hunt]], an early founder of [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and one of the first [[millionaire]]s west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. He was also the brother-in-law of [[A. P. Hill]] and of [[Basil W. Duke]].<ref name=Eicher397>Eicher, p. 397.</ref> He was said to be a direct descendant of [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general and hero [[Daniel Morgan]].,<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h407.html United States History: Morgan's Raiders]<br />His father claimed to be a descendant of the Revolutionary War hero, Daniel Morgan</ref><ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Brig-Gen-John-Hunt-Morgan-CSA/6000000011154199199 GENi: Brig. General John Hunt Morgan (CSA)]. It is said that he was a lineal descendant of Daniel Morgan, of Revolutionary fame.</ref> whose own great grand-uncle was perhaps history's most successful [[privateer]], [[Henry Morgan]].<ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Gen-Daniel-Morgan-Continental-Army/5384988704340025855 GENi: Gen. Daniel Morgan (Continental Army)]. Daniel Morgan is related to the famous Welsh privateer and pirate, Henry Morgan. Henry was Daniel's great-great-grandfather Edward Morgan's nephew.</ref>\n\nJohn Wesley Hunt, Morgan's grandfather, was a leading landowner and businessman in Kentucky and was the first millionaire west of the Allegheny Mountains. \"His business empire included interest in banking, horse breeding, agriculture and hemp manufacturing. Among his business associates were Henry Clay and John Jacob Astor.\" \n\nMorgan's paternal grandparents were Luther and Anna (Cameron) Morgan. Luther Morgan had settled in Huntsville, but a downturn in the cotton economy forced him to mortgage his holdings. His father, Calvin Morgan, lost his Huntsville home in 1831 when he was unable to pay the property taxes following the failure of his [[pharmacy]]. The family then moved to Lexington, where he would manage one of his father-in-law's sprawling farms.\n\nMorgan grew up on the farm outside of Lexington and attended [[Transylvania College]] for two years, but was suspended in 1844 for [[duel]]ing with a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity brother]]. In 1846, Morgan became a [[Freemason]], at Daviess Lodge #22, [[Lexington, Kentucky]].<ref>Smith, Dwight L. ''Goodly Heritage'' ([[Grand Lodge of Indiana]], 1968) pg.124</ref> Morgan desired a military career, but the small size of the US military severely limited opportunities for officer's commissions.\n\nIn 1846 Morgan enlisted with his brother Calvin and uncle Alexander in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a cavalry [[private (rank)|private]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He was elected second lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant before arriving in Mexico, where he saw combat in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. On his return to Kentucky, he became a [[hemp]] manufacturer and in 1848, he married Rebecca Gratz Bruce, the 18-year-old sister of one of his business partners. Morgan also hired out his slaves and occasionally sold them. After the death of John Wesley Hunt in 1849, his fortunes greatly improved as his mother, Henrietta, began financing his business ventures.\n\nIn 1853, his wife delivered a stillborn son. She contracted [[thrombophlebitis|septic thrombophlebitis]], popularly known as \"milk leg\", an infection of a blood clot in a vein, which eventually led to an amputation. They became increasingly emotionally distant from one another. Known as a gambler and womanizer, Morgan was also known for his generosity. He had at least one slave son, Sidney Morgan, by a slave woman, and was the biological grandfather of African American inventor [[Garrett Morgan]] (1877-1963).<ref>Evans, Harold. ''Who Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine''. Little Brown, 2004.</ref>\n\nMorgan remained interested in the military. He raised a [[militia]] artillery company in 1852, but it was disbanded by the state legislature two years later. In 1857, with the rise of sectional tensions, Morgan raised an independent [[infantry]] company known as the \"Lexington Rifles,\" and spent much of his free time drilling his men.\n\n==Civil War service==\n[[File:Morgan Lexington statue.jpg|thumb|300px|Former location of [[John Hunt Morgan Memorial]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]]]\nLike most Kentuckians, Morgan did not initially support secession. Immediately after Lincoln's election in November 1860, he wrote to his brother, Thomas Hunt Morgan, then a student at [[Kenyon College]] in northern Ohio, \"Our State will not I hope secede I have no doubt but Lincoln will make a good President, at least we ought to give him a fair trial & then if he commits some [[overt act]] all the South will be a unit.\" By the following spring, Tom Morgan (who also had opposed Kentucky's secession) had transferred home to the Kentucky Military Institute and there began to support the Confederacy. Just before the Fourth of July, by way of a steamer from Louisville, he quietly left for Camp Boone, just across the Tennessee border, to enlist in the Kentucky State Guard. John stayed at home in Lexington to tend to his troubled business and his ailing wife. Becky Morgan finally died on July 21, 1861.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=96705438 Find-a-Grave: Rebecca Gratz Bruce], accessed July 2017.</ref>\n\nIn September, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Morgan and his militia company went to Tennessee and joined the [[Confederate States Army]]. Morgan soon raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment and became its [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on April 4, 1862.<ref name=Eicher397/>\n\nMorgan and his cavalrymen fought at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, and he soon became a symbol to [[secession]]ists in their hopes for obtaining Kentucky for the Confederacy. A Louisiana writer, Robert D. Patrick, compared Morgan to [[Francis Marion]] and wrote that \"a few thousands of such men as his would regain us Kentucky and Tennessee.\"\n\nIn his first Kentucky raid, Morgan left [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on July 4, 1862, with almost 900 men and in three weeks swept through Kentucky, deep in the rear of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army. He reported the capture of 1,200 Federal soldiers, whom he paroled, acquired several hundred horses, and destroyed massive quantities of supplies.<ref>[[North & South - The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society]], Volume 11, Number 1, Page 70, [http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf  \"We will have to whip these fellows sure enough\" - John Hunt Morgan], accessed April 16, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714195019/http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf |date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> He unnerved Kentucky's [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military government, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] received so many frantic appeals for help that he complained that \"they are having a stampede in Kentucky.\" Historian [[Kenneth W. Noe]] wrote that Morgan's feat \"in many ways surpassed [[J. E. B. Stuart]]'s celebrated 'Ride around [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]]' and the [[Army of the Potomac]] the previous spring.\" The success of Morgan's raid was one of the key reasons that the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive]] of [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] was launched later that fall, assuming that tens of thousands of Kentuckians would enlist in the Confederate Army if they invaded the state.<ref>Noe, p. 31.</ref>\n\nAs a colonel, he was presented with a Palmetto Armory pistol by the widow of Brigadier General [[Barnard Elliott Bee Jr.]] That pistol is now owned by the Museum of the American Civil War.\n\nMorgan was promoted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] (his highest rank) on December 11, 1862, though the Promotion Orders were not signed by President Davis until December 14, 1862.<ref name=Eicher397/> He received the thanks of the [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]] on May 1, 1863, for his raids on the supply lines of [[Union Army|Union]] Major General [[William S. Rosecrans]] in December and January, most notably his victory at the [[Battle of Hartsville]] on December 7.<ref>Eicher, p. 397. \"...for their varied heroic and invaluable services in Tennessee and Kentucky immediately preceding the battles before Murfreesboro, services which have conferred upon their authors fame as enduring as the records of the struggle which they have so brilliantly illustrated.\"</ref>\n\nOn December 14,1862, Morgan married Martha \"Mattie\" Ready, the daughter of [[Tennessee]] [[United States Representative]] [[Charles Ready]] and a [[cousin]] of [[William T. Haskell]], another former U.S. representative from Tennessee.\n\n===Morgan's Raid===\n{{main|Morgan's Raid}}\n[[File:Morgans Men POW 1863.jpg|thumb|Group of \"Morgan's Men\" while prisoners of war in [[State Correctional Institution \u2013 Pittsburgh|Western Penitentiary, Pennsylvania]]: (l to r) Captain William E.

Morgan 2.jpg|left|thumb|General John H. Morgan]]\n\nHoping to divert Union troops and resources in conjunction with the twin Confederate operations of [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] in the summer of 1863, Morgan set off on the campaign that would become known as \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\". Morgan crossed the Ohio River, and raided across southern Indiana and Ohio. At Corydon, Indiana, the raiders met 450 local Home Guard in [[Battle of Corydon|a battle]] that resulted in eleven Confederates killed and five Home Guard killed.\n\nIn July, at Versailles, IN, while soldiers raided nearby militia and looted county and city treasuries, the jewels of the local masonic lodge were stolen. When Morgan, a [[Freemason]], learned of the theft he recovered the jewels and returned them to the lodge the following day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=John|title=Masonic Facts and Trivia|url=http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|work=Education|publisher=clearwater127.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203203717/http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|archivedate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter several more skirmishes, during which he captured and paroled thousands of Union soldiers{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, Morgan's raid almost ended on July 19, 1863, at [[Battle of Buffington Island|Buffington Island]], [[Ohio]], when approximately 700 of his men were captured while trying to cross the [[Ohio River]] into [[West Virginia]]. Intercepted by Union gunboats, over 300 of his men succeeded in crossing. Most of Morgan's men captured that day spent the rest of the war in the infamous [[Camp Douglas (Chicago)|Camp Douglas]] [[Prisoner of War]] camp in [[Chicago]], which had a very high death rate. On July 26, near [[Salineville, Ohio]], Morgan and his exhausted, hungry and saddlesore soldiers were [[John H. Morgan Surrender Site|finally forced to surrender]]. It was the farthest north that any uniformed Confederate troops would penetrate during the war.<ref name=Dupuy525>Dupuy, p. 525.</ref>\n\nOn November 27, Morgan and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron. Morgan and three of his officers, shortly after midnight, boarded a train from the nearby Columbus train station and arrived in Cincinnati that morning. Morgan and Hines jumped from the train before reaching the depot, and escaped into Kentucky by hiring a skiff to take them across the Ohio River. Through the assistance of sympathizers, they eventually made it to safety in the South. Coincidentally, the same day Morgan escaped, his wife gave birth to a daughter, who died shortly afterwards before Morgan returned home.\n\nThough Morgan's Raid was breathlessly followed by the Northern and Southern press and caused the Union leadership considerable concern, it is now regarded as little more than a showy but ultimately futile sidelight to the war. Furthermore, it was done in direct violation of his orders from General [[Braxton Bragg]] not to cross the river. Despite the raiders' best efforts, Union forces had amassed nearly 110,000 militia in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio; dozens of [[United States Navy]] [[gunboat]]s along the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]; and strong Federal cavalry forces, which doomed the raid from the beginning. The cost of the raid to the Federals was extensive, with claims for compensation still being filed against the U.S. government well into the early 20th century. However, the Confederacy's loss of Morgan's light cavalry far outweighed the benefits.\n\n===Late career and death===\nAfter his return from Ohio, Morgan returned to active duty. However, the men he was assigned were in no way comparable to those he had lost. Morgan once again began raiding into Kentucky. However his men lacked discipline, and he was unwilling or unable to control them, leading to open pillaging along with high casualties. The raids of this season were in risky defiance of a strategic situation in the border states that had changed radically from the year before. Union military occupation of this region, long denied to major Confederate armies, had progressed to the point that even highly mobile raiders could no longer count on easily evading them. Northern public outrage at Morgan's raid across the Ohio River may well have contributed to this state of affairs.\n\nHis \"Last Kentucky Raid\" was carried out in June 1864, the high-water mark of which was the [[Battle of Cynthiana|Second Battle of Cynthiana]]. After winning a minor victory on June 11 against an inferior infantry unit in the engagement known as the Battle of Keller's Bridge on the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]], near [[Cynthiana, Kentucky]], Morgan decided to take a chance the following day on another contest against superior Union mounted forces that were known to be approaching. The result was a disaster for the Confederates, resulting in the destruction of Morgan's force as a cohesive unit, only a small fraction of whom escaped with their lives and liberty as fugitives, including the General and some of his officers.\n\nAfter the flashy but unauthorized 1863 Ohio raid, Morgan was never again trusted by General Bragg. Nevertheless, on August 22, 1864, Morgan was placed in command of the Trans-Allegheny Department, embracing at the time the Confederate forces in eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia. Yet around this time some Confederate authorities were quietly investigating Morgan for charges of criminal banditry,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} likely leading to his removal from command. He began to organize a raid aimed at Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nOn September 4, 1864, he was surprised by a Union raid on [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. While attempting to retreat, he was shot in the back and killed by Union cavalrymen.\n\nMorgan was buried in [[Lexington Cemetery]]. The burial was shortly before the birth of his second child, another daughter.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:John Hunt Morgan Grave.jpg|thumb|200px|Morgan's Grave, in [[Lexington Cemetery]]]]\n* Hart County High School, in [[Munfordville, Kentucky]], the site of the Battle for the Bridge, named their mascot the Raiders, in honor of Morgan's men.

Morgan never used his middle name of Hunt during the war \u2014 it is a post war appellation.\n\nIn April 1862, he raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, fought at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], and then launched a costly raid in Kentucky, which encouraged [[Braxton Bragg]]'s invasion of that state. He also attacked the supply-lines of General [[William Rosecrans]]. In July 1863, he set out on a 1,000-mile raid into Indiana and Ohio, taking hundreds of prisoners. But after most of his men had been intercepted by Union gunboats, Morgan surrendered at Salineville, Ohio, the northernmost point ever reached by uniformed Confederates. The legendary \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\", which had been carried out against orders, gained no tactical advantage for the Confederacy, while the loss of his regiment proved a serious setback.\n\nMorgan escaped from his Union prison but his credibility was low, and he was restricted to minor operations. He was killed at [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], in September 1864. Morgan was the brother-in-law of Confederate general [[A. P. Hill]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nJohn H. Morgan was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], the eldest of ten children of Calvin and Henrietta (Hunt) Morgan. He was an uncle of geneticist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and a maternal grandson of [[John Wesley Hunt]], an early founder of [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and one of the first [[millionaire]]s west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. He was also the brother-in-law of [[A. P. Hill]] and of [[Basil W. Duke]].<ref name=Eicher397>Eicher, p. 397.</ref> He was said to be a direct descendant of [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general and hero [[Daniel Morgan]].,<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h407.html United States History: Morgan's Raiders]<br />His father claimed to be a descendant of the Revolutionary War hero, Daniel Morgan</ref><ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Brig-Gen-John-Hunt-Morgan-CSA/6000000011154199199 GENi: Brig. General John Hunt Morgan (CSA)]. It is said that he was a lineal descendant of Daniel Morgan, of Revolutionary fame.</ref> whose own great grand-uncle was perhaps history's most successful [[privateer]], [[Henry Morgan]].<ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Gen-Daniel-Morgan-Continental-Army/5384988704340025855 GENi: Gen. Daniel Morgan (Continental Army)]. Daniel Morgan is related to the famous Welsh privateer and pirate, Henry Morgan. Henry was Daniel's great-great-grandfather Edward Morgan's nephew.</ref>\n\nJohn Wesley Hunt, Morgan's grandfather, was a leading landowner and businessman in Kentucky and was the first millionaire west of the Allegheny Mountains. \"His business empire included interest in banking, horse breeding, agriculture and hemp manufacturing. Among his business associates were Henry Clay and John Jacob Astor.\" \n\nMorgan's paternal grandparents were Luther and Anna (Cameron) Morgan. Luther Morgan had settled in Huntsville, but a downturn in the cotton economy forced him to mortgage his holdings. His father, Calvin Morgan, lost his Huntsville home in 1831 when he was unable to pay the property taxes following the failure of his [[pharmacy]]. The family then moved to Lexington, where he would manage one of his father-in-law's sprawling farms.\n\nMorgan grew up on the farm outside of Lexington and attended [[Transylvania College]] for two years, but was suspended in 1844 for [[duel]]ing with a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity brother]]. In 1846, Morgan became a [[Freemason]], at Daviess Lodge #22, [[Lexington, Kentucky]].<ref>Smith, Dwight L. ''Goodly Heritage'' ([[Grand Lodge of Indiana]], 1968) pg.124</ref> Morgan desired a military career, but the small size of the US military severely limited opportunities for officer's commissions.\n\nIn 1846 Morgan enlisted with his brother Calvin and uncle Alexander in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a cavalry [[private (rank)|private]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He was elected second lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant before arriving in Mexico, where he saw combat in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. On his return to Kentucky, he became a [[hemp]] manufacturer and in 1848, he married Rebecca Gratz Bruce, the 18-year-old sister of one of his business partners. Morgan also hired out his slaves and occasionally sold them. After the death of John Wesley Hunt in 1849, his fortunes greatly improved as his mother, Henrietta, began financing his business ventures.\n\nIn 1853, his wife delivered a stillborn son. She contracted [[thrombophlebitis|septic thrombophlebitis]], popularly known as \"milk leg\", an infection of a blood clot in a vein, which eventually led to an amputation. They became increasingly emotionally distant from one another. Known as a gambler and womanizer, Morgan was also known for his generosity. He had at least one slave son, Sidney Morgan, by a slave woman, and was the biological grandfather of African American inventor [[Garrett Morgan]] (1877-1963).<ref>Evans, Harold. ''Who Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine''. Little Brown, 2004.</ref>\n\nMorgan remained interested in the military. He raised a [[militia]] artillery company in 1852, but it was disbanded by the state legislature two years later. In 1857, with the rise of sectional tensions, Morgan raised an independent [[infantry]] company known as the \"Lexington Rifles,\" and spent much of his free time drilling his men.\n\n==Civil War service==\n[[File:Morgan Lexington statue.jpg|thumb|300px|Former location of [[John Hunt Morgan Memorial]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]]]\nLike most Kentuckians, Morgan did not initially support secession. Immediately after Lincoln's election in November 1860, he wrote to his brother, Thomas Hunt Morgan, then a student at [[Kenyon College]] in northern Ohio, \"Our State will not I hope secede I have no doubt but Lincoln will make a good President, at least we ought to give him a fair trial & then if he commits some [[overt act]] all the South will be a unit.\" By the following spring, Tom Morgan (who also had opposed Kentucky's secession) had transferred home to the Kentucky Military Institute and there began to support the Confederacy. Just before the Fourth of July, by way of a steamer from Louisville, he quietly left for Camp Boone, just across the Tennessee border, to enlist in the Kentucky State Guard. John stayed at home in Lexington to tend to his troubled business and his ailing wife. Becky Morgan finally died on July 21, 1861.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=96705438 Find-a-Grave: Rebecca Gratz Bruce], accessed July 2017.</ref>\n\nIn September, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Morgan and his militia company went to Tennessee and joined the [[Confederate States Army]]. Morgan soon raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment and became its [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on April 4, 1862.<ref name=Eicher397/>\n\nMorgan and his cavalrymen fought at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, and he soon became a symbol to [[secession]]ists in their hopes for obtaining Kentucky for the Confederacy. A Louisiana writer, Robert D. Patrick, compared Morgan to [[Francis Marion]] and wrote that \"a few thousands of such men as his would regain us Kentucky and Tennessee.\"\n\nIn his first Kentucky raid, Morgan left [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on July 4, 1862, with almost 900 men and in three weeks swept through Kentucky, deep in the rear of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army. He reported the capture of 1,200 Federal soldiers, whom he paroled, acquired several hundred horses, and destroyed massive quantities of supplies.<ref>[[North & South - The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society]], Volume 11, Number 1, Page 70, [http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf  \"We will have to whip these fellows sure enough\" - John Hunt Morgan], accessed April 16, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714195019/http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf |date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> He unnerved Kentucky's [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military government, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] received so many frantic appeals for help that he complained that \"they are having a stampede in Kentucky.\" Historian [[Kenneth W. Noe]] wrote that Morgan's feat \"in many ways surpassed [[J. E. B. Stuart]]'s celebrated 'Ride around [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]]' and the [[Army of the Potomac]] the previous spring.\" The success of Morgan's raid was one of the key reasons that the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive]] of [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] was launched later that fall, assuming that tens of thousands of Kentuckians would enlist in the Confederate Army if they invaded the state.<ref>Noe, p. 31.</ref>\n\nAs a colonel, he was presented with a Palmetto Armory pistol by the widow of Brigadier General [[Barnard Elliott Bee Jr.]] That pistol is now owned by the Museum of the American Civil War.\n\nMorgan was promoted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] (his highest rank) on December 11, 1862, though the Promotion Orders were not signed by President Davis until December 14, 1862.<ref name=Eicher397/> He received the thanks of the [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]] on May 1, 1863, for his raids on the supply lines of [[Union Army|Union]] Major General [[William S. Rosecrans]] in December and January, most notably his victory at the [[Battle of Hartsville]] on December 7.<ref>Eicher, p. 397. \"...for their varied heroic and invaluable services in Tennessee and Kentucky immediately preceding the battles before Murfreesboro, services which have conferred upon their authors fame as enduring as the records of the struggle which they have so brilliantly illustrated.\"</ref>\n\nOn December 14,1862, Morgan married Martha \"Mattie\" Ready, the daughter of [[Tennessee]] [[United States Representative]] [[Charles Ready]] and a [[cousin]] of [[William T. Haskell]], another former U.S. representative from Tennessee.\n\n===Morgan's Raid===\n{{main|Morgan's Raid}}\n[[File:Morgans Men POW 1863.jpg|thumb|Group of \"Morgan's Men\" while prisoners of war in [[State Correctional Institution \u2013 Pittsburgh|Western Penitentiary, Pennsylvania]]: (l to r) Captain William E.

Morgan 2.jpg|left|thumb|General John H. Morgan]]\n\nHoping to divert Union troops and resources in conjunction with the twin Confederate operations of [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] in the summer of 1863, Morgan set off on the campaign that would become known as \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\". Morgan crossed the Ohio River, and raided across southern Indiana and Ohio. At Corydon, Indiana, the raiders met 450 local Home Guard in [[Battle of Corydon|a battle]] that resulted in eleven Confederates killed and five Home Guard killed.\n\nIn July, at Versailles, IN, while soldiers raided nearby militia and looted county and city treasuries, the jewels of the local masonic lodge were stolen. When Morgan, a [[Freemason]], learned of the theft he recovered the jewels and returned them to the lodge the following day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=John|title=Masonic Facts and Trivia|url=http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|work=Education|publisher=clearwater127.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203203717/http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|archivedate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter several more skirmishes, during which he captured and paroled thousands of Union soldiers{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, Morgan's raid almost ended on July 19, 1863, at [[Battle of Buffington Island|Buffington Island]], [[Ohio]], when approximately 700 of his men were captured while trying to cross the [[Ohio River]] into [[West Virginia]]. Intercepted by Union gunboats, over 300 of his men succeeded in crossing. Most of Morgan's men captured that day spent the rest of the war in the infamous [[Camp Douglas (Chicago)|Camp Douglas]] [[Prisoner of War]] camp in [[Chicago]], which had a very high death rate. On July 26, near [[Salineville, Ohio]], Morgan and his exhausted, hungry and saddlesore soldiers were [[John H. Morgan Surrender Site|finally forced to surrender]]. It was the farthest north that any uniformed Confederate troops would penetrate during the war.<ref name=Dupuy525>Dupuy, p. 525.</ref>\n\nOn November 27, Morgan and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron. Morgan and three of his officers, shortly after midnight, boarded a train from the nearby Columbus train station and arrived in Cincinnati that morning. Morgan and Hines jumped from the train before reaching the depot, and escaped into Kentucky by hiring a skiff to take them across the Ohio River. Through the assistance of sympathizers, they eventually made it to safety in the South. Coincidentally, the same day Morgan escaped, his wife gave birth to a daughter, who died shortly afterwards before Morgan returned home.\n\nThough Morgan's Raid was breathlessly followed by the Northern and Southern press and caused the Union leadership considerable concern, it is now regarded as little more than a showy but ultimately futile sidelight to the war. Furthermore, it was done in direct violation of his orders from General [[Braxton Bragg]] not to cross the river. Despite the raiders' best efforts, Union forces had amassed nearly 110,000 militia in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio; dozens of [[United States Navy]] [[gunboat]]s along the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]; and strong Federal cavalry forces, which doomed the raid from the beginning. The cost of the raid to the Federals was extensive, with claims for compensation still being filed against the U.S. government well into the early 20th century. However, the Confederacy's loss of Morgan's light cavalry far outweighed the benefits.\n\n===Late career and death===\nAfter his return from Ohio, Morgan returned to active duty. However, the men he was assigned were in no way comparable to those he had lost. Morgan once again began raiding into Kentucky. However his men lacked discipline, and he was unwilling or unable to control them, leading to open pillaging along with high casualties. The raids of this season were in risky defiance of a strategic situation in the border states that had changed radically from the year before. Union military occupation of this region, long denied to major Confederate armies, had progressed to the point that even highly mobile raiders could no longer count on easily evading them. Northern public outrage at Morgan's raid across the Ohio River may well have contributed to this state of affairs.\n\nHis \"Last Kentucky Raid\" was carried out in June 1864, the high-water mark of which was the [[Battle of Cynthiana|Second Battle of Cynthiana]]. After winning a minor victory on June 11 against an inferior infantry unit in the engagement known as the Battle of Keller's Bridge on the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]], near [[Cynthiana, Kentucky]], Morgan decided to take a chance the following day on another contest against superior Union mounted forces that were known to be approaching. The result was a disaster for the Confederates, resulting in the destruction of Morgan's force as a cohesive unit, only a small fraction of whom escaped with their lives and liberty as fugitives, including the General and some of his officers.\n\nAfter the flashy but unauthorized 1863 Ohio raid, Morgan was never again trusted by General Bragg. Nevertheless, on August 22, 1864, Morgan was placed in command of the Trans-Allegheny Department, embracing at the time the Confederate forces in eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia. Yet around this time some Confederate authorities were quietly investigating Morgan for charges of criminal banditry,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} likely leading to his removal from command. He began to organize a raid aimed at Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nOn September 4, 1864, he was surprised by a Union raid on [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. While attempting to retreat, he was shot in the back and killed by Union cavalrymen.\n\nMorgan was buried in [[Lexington Cemetery]]. The burial was shortly before the birth of his second child, another daughter.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:John Hunt Morgan Grave.jpg|thumb|200px|Morgan's Grave, in [[Lexington Cemetery]]]]\n* Hart County High School, in [[Munfordville, Kentucky]], the site of the Battle for the Bridge, named their mascot the Raiders, in honor of Morgan's men.

Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes.

Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011\u20132012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010}}</ref> In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11216/1164959-57-0.stm |title=Law could restrict school construction projects |author=Kaitlynn Riely |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0330&pn=1459 |author1=Pennsylvania General Assembly |title=SB330 of 2011 |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |title=Property tax reform final piece of state budget |author=Eric Boehm |work=PA Independent |date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704192251/http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006\u20132007 through 2010\u20132011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n*2006\u201307 - 5.3%, Base 3.9%\t\n*2007\u201308 - 4.6%, Base 3.4%\t\n*2008\u201309 - 6.0%, Base 4.4%\t\n*2009\u201310 - 5.6%, Base 4.1%\t\n*2010\u201311 - 4.0%, Base 2.9%\t\n*2011\u201312 - 1.9%, Base 1.4%\n*2012\u201313 - 2.3%, Base 1.7%<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012\u20132013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012</ref>\n\nFor the 2012\u201313 budget year, Upper Darby School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and teacher pension costs.

Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011\u20132012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010}}</ref> In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11216/1164959-57-0.stm |title=Law could restrict school construction projects |author=Kaitlynn Riely |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0330&pn=1459 |author1=Pennsylvania General Assembly |title=SB330 of 2011 |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |title=Property tax reform final piece of state budget |author=Eric Boehm |work=PA Independent |date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704192251/http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006\u20132007 through 2010\u20132011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n*2006\u201307 - 5.3%, Base 3.9%\t\n*2007\u201308 - 4.6%, Base 3.4%\t\n*2008\u201309 - 6.0%, Base 4.4%\t\n*2009\u201310 - 5.6%, Base 4.1%\t\n*2010\u201311 - 4.0%, Base 2.9%\t\n*2011\u201312 - 1.9%, Base 1.4%\n*2012\u201313 - 2.3%, Base 1.7%<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012\u20132013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012</ref>\n\nFor the 2012\u201313 budget year, Upper Darby School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and teacher pension costs.

Working chiefly in [[Siena]], he was first recognized to be working as an artist in 1453 and continued his work nearly until his death in approximately 1518. During his lifetime, he was influenced by many various artists and in the 1480s, Benvenuto's style changed drastically.<ref name=\":0\">Cot\u00e9, Cynthia. \"Benvenuto di Giovanni.\" ''Grove Art Online''.

His son, Girolamo di Giovanni, followed in his footsteps and also became a painter. In fact, there have often been instances in which the work of one the two has been confused for that of the other.<ref>Thomas N. Maytham. \"An Expulsion from Paradise by Benvenuto Di Giovanni.\" ''Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts'' 55, no. 300 (1957): 44-46. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171262.</ref> Nevertheless, Benvenuto left behind significantly more works. Some of his works were both signed and dated, some were only signed, and some were only dated. However, regardless of debate over date or authorship, Benvenuto left behind a significant number of works, both ones that are quite well known as well as others that are more minor in their distinction. His pieces that are signed, dated, and still existing have dates spanning a period of 43 years.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to the works that he left behind, he also left behind a legacy through the artists that he influenced during his lifetime.\n[[File:Benvenuto di Giovanni Washington Septembe 2016-1a.jpg|thumb|660px|The Washington [[predella]] group: ''Agony in the Garden, The Way to Calvary, Crucifixion, Resurrection,'' and Descent into Limbo)''.]]\n\n== Life and influences ==\n[[Image:Annonciation 1470 \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0430, \u0446 \u0441\u0430\u043d \u0411\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e.jpg|thumb|right|''Annunciation'', 1470]]\nBorn to a bricklayer in Siena, Benvenuto remained there for his entire life,  only occasionally venturing to nearby cities for his work. The first records of him as an artist are of his contributions to the [[Siena Baptistery of San Giovanni|Siena Baptistery]] in 1453. His work here was likely in collaboration with [[Vecchietta|il Vecchietta]], as it is believed that Benvenuto was trained in his workshop. Outside of Vecchietta, Benvenuto was also likely to have worked under [[Sano di Pietro]] because they share a number of similarities stylistically.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBenvenuto was commissioned to do a number of works in the [[Siena Cathedral]] during his life that included choral miniatures, pavement designs, and frescoes. However, he was not the only artist requested to work in the cathedral; artists and painters such as [[Matteo di Giovanni]], [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]], and [[Neroccio di Bartolomeo de' Landi]] were also commissioned, or hired, for nearly the same jobs. This commonality led to Benvenuto and the other artists having a significant amount of influence upon one another's style.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOther painters that had works in the Siena Cathedral were [[Liberale da Verona]] and [[Girolamo da Cremona]]. What sets these artists apart is that it is believed that their pieces in the cathedral were what led to Benvenuto's great shift in style in the 1480s. In 1482, he was commissioned to paint ''Donation of the Keys to St. Peter'' in the ''Antiphonary of the Birth of St. John.'' It was at this time that he saw Liberale and Girolamo's recent works in the cathedral that incorporated bright colors and manipulated light. As a result of this, he began to do the same in his paintings. Additionally, not only did his style shift in this way, but he also began to experiment with the concept of spatial distortion that was common in paintings by Vecchietta and [[Donatello]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He used a very naturalistic style for his figures, but paired them with a brightly colored and sharply lit background.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Italian Paintings of the Fifteenth Century|last=Boskovits|first=Miklos|publisher=National Gallery of Art|year=2003|isbn=0-89468-305-5|location=Washington|pages=106\u2013124}}</ref> The combination of his efforts to depict realistic figures, to strategically utilize colors, and to manipulate space in order to give his paintings depth led to a style that was both distinct and uniquely his. These shifts in his style can be seen in paintings such as ''Maest\u00e0'' and ''Ascension.''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOutside of painting, Benvenuto also explored other personal endeavors. In 1466, he married Jacopa di Tommaso de Cetona. After their marriage, he served at least two terms in a public office. Together, they owned a vineyard and also had seven children. The only child that much is known about is Girolamo, as he was Benvenuto's only follower. However, Girolamo is regarded as both less gifted and less influential, largely because he only survived his father by six years.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\"GIROLAMO DI BENVENUTO DI GIOVANNI DEL GUASTA.\" ''Benezit Dictionary of Artists''.

His first ''Annunciation'' is the earliest known painting by him, dated in 1466. Despite this being his first work, there was little evidence of the influence of his teacher, Vecchietta. Rather, this work was very clearly inspired by [[Simone Martini]]'s 1333 painting of the same name. Many other ''Annunciation'' works by other artists during Benvenuto's lifetime prioritized landscapes and backgrounds, but Benvenuto employed a more simple, gold background that was typical in works of the early [[Trecento]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sienese Painting in the Age of the Renaissance|last=Cole|first=Bruce|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-253-18130-5|location=Bloomington|pages=122\u2013128}}</ref> Benvenuto's 1466 version resides in the church of [[San Girolamo, Volterra|St. Girolamo in Volterra]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9ZFAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Benvenuto di Giovanni, Girolamo di Benvenuto: Their Altarpieces in the J.

In 1466, Benvenuto opted for a more subtle coloration in his work. However, in 1470, while many of his contemporaries still utilized softer palettes, Benvenuto chose to paint with rich, deep colors that pleased the viewer's eye. This shift in style is likely to have been inspired by two artists that were quite famous during the latter part of the [[Quattrocento]], Girolamo da Cremona and Liberale da Verona. Additionally, Benvenuto traded in his previous flat gold background for one of detailed scenery, including lush gardens, mountains, and lakes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== ''Expulsion from Paradise'' ===\nThis painting, done by many artists, depicts [[Adam and Eve]] being cast out of the [[Garden of Eden]] by the archangel, [[Jophiel]]. However, Benvenuto's version stands out from the others because his depiction of Eden is far more realistic than that of other artists. He paints Eden as a lush green forest rather than a land full of a myriad of plants and animals. He expertly constructs the figures in a way that makes the subjects come alive through the intermingling of their arms and angling of their bodies.<ref name=\":2\" /> Most likely painted between 1480 and 1500, this exhibits Benvenuto's later style that combines realistic backgrounds and dramatic subjects.\n\nAt this time, nothing is known of this painting's provenance, or ownership, before 1921, when it became a part of the Engel-Gros Collection. In fact, even the validity of who may be the artist of this painting underwent speculation. ''Expulsion from Paradise'' is unsigned and was originally attributed to Benvenuto's son, Girolamo. The credit continued to be given to his son for quite a while, until it was also given to [[Cosimo Tura]], and then finally to Benvenuto, which was settled upon by art historians.<ref>Thomas N. Maytham. \"An Expulsion from Paradise by Benvenuto Di Giovanni.\" Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts 55, no. 300 (1957): 44-46. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171262.</ref>\n\nDespite the credit eventually being given to Benvenuto, it is likely that this confusion arose in the first place due to their probable collaboration on the piece. Towards the end of his life, Benvenuto regularly worked with his son, which this piece seems to exhibit. The design itself appears to be Benvenuto's, but certain aspects point towards the assistance of his son.

After this creation, Bartolo's influence began to be seen in nearly every Sienese painting of the same theme, including Benvenuto's. However, the influence of other artists is evident as well.

Nevertheless, its date is still unclear. In most paintings of this theme, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]]'s child is held in her arms, but Benvenuto depicts him seated in front of her. The child is holding a pomegranate that is representative of both the Church and the blood of Christ. The choice to not place the child in Madonna's arms as well as the inclusion of the pomegranate are both artistic decisions that don't appear in Italian paintings until significantly after 1470, thus, the painting's date has been approximated as c. 1480/1485.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMuch of the confusion with the date of this painting revolves around the fact that it doesn't quite fall into either Benvenuto's early, flat and crisp, style or his later, brightly colored and more detailed, style.

In this painting, the sharpness and intensity of the drapery, figures, and colors point directly towards the influence of Benvenuto's later style.

These characteristics are largely ones pertaining towards Benvenuto's distinct naturalistic depiction of figures, crisp backgrounds, and intentional draping of clothing that are evident in Andrea's works.<ref name=\":4\">Vatne, Diane. 1990. \"Andrea Di Niccolo, c. 1445-c. 1525: Sienese Painter of the Renaissance.\" Order No. 9030434, Indiana University. http://search.proquest.com/docview/303862274.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=[[John Pope-Hennessy|Pope-Hennessy, John]] & Kanter, Laurence B.| title= ''The Robert Lehman Collection I, Italian Paintings'' | location=New York, Princeton | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art in association with Princeton University Press | year=1987| isbn=0870994794 | url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/190122/rec/1}} (see index; plates 69-70)\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Benvenuto di Giovanni|Benvenuto di Giovanni}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Giovanni, Benvenuto Di}}\n[[Category:1430s births]]\n[[Category:1500s deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Siena]]\n[[Category:15th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Italian male painters]]\n[[Category:16th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Sienese painters]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Benvenuto di Giovanni - Saint Francis - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''St [[Francis of Assissi]]'', c. 1475-1478]]\n'''Benvenuto di Giovanni''', also known as Benvenuto di Giovanni di Meo del Guasta (13 September 1436 \u2013 c. 1518) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter and artist known for his choral miniatures, pavement designs, and frescoes. Working chiefly in [[Siena]], he was first recognized to be working as an artist in 1453 and continued his work nearly until his death in approximately 1518. During his lifetime, he was influenced by many various artists and in the 1480s, Benvenuto's style changed drastically.<ref name=\":0\">Cot\u00e9, Cynthia. \"Benvenuto di Giovanni.\" ''Grove Art Online''.

Some of his works were both signed and dated, some were only signed, and some were only dated. However, regardless of debate over date or authorship, Benvenuto left behind a significant number of works, both ones that are quite well known as well as others that are more minor in their distinction. His pieces that are signed, dated, and still existing have dates spanning a period of 43 years.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to the works that he left behind, he also left behind a legacy through the artists that he influenced during his lifetime.\n[[File:Benvenuto di Giovanni Washington Septembe 2016-1a.jpg|thumb|660px|The Washington [[predella]] group: ''Agony in the Garden, The Way to Calvary, Crucifixion, Resurrection,'' and Descent into Limbo)''.]]\n\n== Life and influences ==\n[[Image:Annonciation 1470 \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0430, \u0446 \u0441\u0430\u043d \u0411\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e.jpg|thumb|right|''Annunciation'', 1470]]\nBorn to a bricklayer in Siena, Benvenuto remained there for his entire life,  only occasionally venturing to nearby cities for his work. The first records of him as an artist are of his contributions to the [[Siena Baptistery of San Giovanni|Siena Baptistery]] in 1453. His work here was likely in collaboration with [[Vecchietta|il Vecchietta]], as it is believed that Benvenuto was trained in his workshop. Outside of Vecchietta, Benvenuto was also likely to have worked under [[Sano di Pietro]] because they share a number of similarities stylistically.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBenvenuto was commissioned to do a number of works in the [[Siena Cathedral]] during his life that included choral miniatures, pavement designs, and frescoes. However, he was not the only artist requested to work in the cathedral; artists and painters such as [[Matteo di Giovanni]], [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]], and [[Neroccio di Bartolomeo de' Landi]] were also commissioned, or hired, for nearly the same jobs. This commonality led to Benvenuto and the other artists having a significant amount of influence upon one another's style.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOther painters that had works in the Siena Cathedral were [[Liberale da Verona]] and [[Girolamo da Cremona]]. What sets these artists apart is that it is believed that their pieces in the cathedral were what led to Benvenuto's great shift in style in the 1480s. In 1482, he was commissioned to paint ''Donation of the Keys to St. Peter'' in the ''Antiphonary of the Birth of St. John.'' It was at this time that he saw Liberale and Girolamo's recent works in the cathedral that incorporated bright colors and manipulated light. As a result of this, he began to do the same in his paintings. Additionally, not only did his style shift in this way, but he also began to experiment with the concept of spatial distortion that was common in paintings by Vecchietta and [[Donatello]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He used a very naturalistic style for his figures, but paired them with a brightly colored and sharply lit background.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Italian Paintings of the Fifteenth Century|last=Boskovits|first=Miklos|publisher=National Gallery of Art|year=2003|isbn=0-89468-305-5|location=Washington|pages=106\u2013124}}</ref> The combination of his efforts to depict realistic figures, to strategically utilize colors, and to manipulate space in order to give his paintings depth led to a style that was both distinct and uniquely his. These shifts in his style can be seen in paintings such as ''Maest\u00e0'' and ''Ascension.''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOutside of painting, Benvenuto also explored other personal endeavors. In 1466, he married Jacopa di Tommaso de Cetona. After their marriage, he served at least two terms in a public office. Together, they owned a vineyard and also had seven children. The only child that much is known about is Girolamo, as he was Benvenuto's only follower. However, Girolamo is regarded as both less gifted and less influential, largely because he only survived his father by six years.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\"GIROLAMO DI BENVENUTO DI GIOVANNI DEL GUASTA.\" ''Benezit Dictionary of Artists''.

His first ''Annunciation'' is the earliest known painting by him, dated in 1466. Despite this being his first work, there was little evidence of the influence of his teacher, Vecchietta. Rather, this work was very clearly inspired by [[Simone Martini]]'s 1333 painting of the same name. Many other ''Annunciation'' works by other artists during Benvenuto's lifetime prioritized landscapes and backgrounds, but Benvenuto employed a more simple, gold background that was typical in works of the early [[Trecento]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sienese Painting in the Age of the Renaissance|last=Cole|first=Bruce|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-253-18130-5|location=Bloomington|pages=122\u2013128}}</ref> Benvenuto's 1466 version resides in the church of [[San Girolamo, Volterra|St. Girolamo in Volterra]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9ZFAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Benvenuto di Giovanni, Girolamo di Benvenuto: Their Altarpieces in the J.

In 1466, Benvenuto opted for a more subtle coloration in his work. However, in 1470, while many of his contemporaries still utilized softer palettes, Benvenuto chose to paint with rich, deep colors that pleased the viewer's eye. This shift in style is likely to have been inspired by two artists that were quite famous during the latter part of the [[Quattrocento]], Girolamo da Cremona and Liberale da Verona. Additionally, Benvenuto traded in his previous flat gold background for one of detailed scenery, including lush gardens, mountains, and lakes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== ''Expulsion from Paradise'' ===\nThis painting, done by many artists, depicts [[Adam and Eve]] being cast out of the [[Garden of Eden]] by the archangel, [[Jophiel]]. However, Benvenuto's version stands out from the others because his depiction of Eden is far more realistic than that of other artists. He paints Eden as a lush green forest rather than a land full of a myriad of plants and animals. He expertly constructs the figures in a way that makes the subjects come alive through the intermingling of their arms and angling of their bodies.<ref name=\":2\" /> Most likely painted between 1480 and 1500, this exhibits Benvenuto's later style that combines realistic backgrounds and dramatic subjects.\n\nAt this time, nothing is known of this painting's provenance, or ownership, before 1921, when it became a part of the Engel-Gros Collection. In fact, even the validity of who may be the artist of this painting underwent speculation. ''Expulsion from Paradise'' is unsigned and was originally attributed to Benvenuto's son, Girolamo. The credit continued to be given to his son for quite a while, until it was also given to [[Cosimo Tura]], and then finally to Benvenuto, which was settled upon by art historians.<ref>Thomas N. Maytham. \"An Expulsion from Paradise by Benvenuto Di Giovanni.\" Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts 55, no. 300 (1957): 44-46. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171262.</ref>\n\nDespite the credit eventually being given to Benvenuto, it is likely that this confusion arose in the first place due to their probable collaboration on the piece. Towards the end of his life, Benvenuto regularly worked with his son, which this piece seems to exhibit. The design itself appears to be Benvenuto's, but certain aspects point towards the assistance of his son. The details of the figures' faces, as well as their shaping, is in a style that is typical of Girolamo.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Minor works ==\n=== ''The Adoration of the Magi'' ===\n[[File:The Adoration of the Magi by Benvenuto di Giovanni.jpg|thumb|''The Adoration of the Magi'', c.1470/1475|231x231px]]\nThis theme is one that has been depicted in Italian paintings since the [[Middle Ages]], but it became particularly popular with Sienese painters after [[Bartolo di Fredi]] created his [[triptych]] to decorate the altar of the Three Kings in the Siena Cathedral.
