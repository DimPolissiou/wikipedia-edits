Before that, between the 9th and 10th century, the prevailing religion among the early [[Icelanders]] (mostly [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] settlers fleeing [[Harald Fairhair]]'s monarchical centralisation in 872\u2013930) was the [[Old Norse religion|northern Germanic religion]], which persisted for centuries even after the official Christianisation of the state.\n\nStarting in the 1530s, [[Iceland]], originally [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and under the [[monarchy of Denmark|Danish crown]], formally switched to [[Lutheranism]] with the [[Icelandic Reformation]], which culminated in 1550.{{sfn|name=Lacy|Lacy|2000|p=166: \"The Old Treaty, signed in 1262, that led to Iceland's being first under the Norwegian and later the Danish kings was such a milestone, as was the Reformation in 1550 whereby Lutheranism became, and remains, Iceland's state religion\"}} The Lutheran [[Church of Iceland]] has remained since then the country's [[state church]].{{sfn|name=Lacy|Lacy|2000|p=166: \"The Old Treaty, signed in 1262, that led to Iceland's being first under the Norwegian and later the Danish kings was such a milestone, as was the Reformation in 1550 whereby Lutheranism became, and remains, Iceland's state religion\"}} Freedom of religion has been granted to the Icelanders since 1874. The Church of Iceland is supported by the government, but all registered religions receive support from a [[church tax]] (''s\u00f3knargjald'') paid by taxpayers over the age of sixteen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Republic of Iceland (No. 33, 17 June 1944, as amended 30 May 1984, 31 May 1991, 28 June 1995 and 24 June 1999)|url=http://www.government.is/constitution/|publisher=Government of Iceland}} Section VI deals with religion.<blockquote>Article 62: The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the State Church in Iceland and, as such, it shall be supported and protected by the State.\n\nThis may be amended by law.\n\nArticle 63: All persons have the right to form religious associations and to practice their religion in conformity with their individual convictions. Nothing may however be preached or practised which is prejudicial to good morals or public order.\n\nArticle 64: No one may lose any of his civil or national rights on account of his religion, nor may anyone refuse to perform any generally applicable civil duty on religious grounds.\n\nEveryone shall be free to remain outside religious associations. No one shall be obliged to pay any personal dues to any religious association of which he is not a member.\n\nA person who is not a member of any religious association shall pay to the University of Iceland the dues that he would have had to pay to such an association, if he had been a member. This may be amended by law.</blockquote></ref>\n\nSince the late 20th century, and especially the early 21st century, religious life in Iceland has become more diverse, with a decline of Christianity, the rise of unaffiliated people, and the emergence of new religions, notably [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], in Iceland also called ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', which seeks to reconstruct the Germanic folk religion.

representing the god [[Thor]], c. 1000, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nWhen Iceland was first settled by [[Norwegians]] (but also by some [[Swedes]] and people from the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse settlements in Britain]]{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}) in the mid-9th century, approximately in 870,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}} it was inhabited by a small number of [[Irish people|Irish]] Christian [[anchorite]]s known as ''[[papar]]'' (singular ''papi''). When [[settlement of Iceland|Scandinavians began to arrive in larger numbers]], the anchorites left of their own or were driven out.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}} The migration of Norwegians was partly in response to the politics of [[Harald Fairhair]], who was unifying [[Norway]] under a centralised monarchy.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe first Icelanders, though accustomed to a society in which the monarch was essential for religious life, did not establish a new monarchy in the colony, but rather a yearly assembly of free men, the [[Althing]]. The \"[[thing (assembly)|things]]\" were assemblies of free men who governed Germanic societies, and they were led by a holy kingship. The Icelandic thing developed peculiar characteristics; in place of the loyalty to a holy king, the Icelanders established the loyalty to a law code, first composed by \u00dalflj\u00f3t who studied Norwegian laws.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nIcelandic landowners (''landn\u00e1msmenn''{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}}) were organised into ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' (\"god-word(s)\"), religio-political groups under the leadership of a ''[[gothi|go\u00f0i]]'' (\"god-man\"). The ''go\u00f0ar'' were part-time priests who officiated ritual sacrifices at the local temple and had some qualities of the Germanic kings; they organised local things and represented them at the Althing. \u00dalflj\u00f3t was chosen as the first Lawspeaker (''L\u00f6gs\u00f6guma\u00f0r''), who presided the Althing which met annually at [[Thingvellir]]. The religio-political organisation of early Iceland has been defined as \"pagan and anti-monarchic\", which distinguished it from other Germanic societies. Concerning other religious practices, the Icelanders followed Scandinavian norms; they built temples enshrining images of the gods.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe religion was named ''Go\u00f0atr\u00fa'' or ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\". Icelanders worshipped ''[[landv\u00e6ttir]]'', local land spirits, and the gods of the common [[Old Norse religion|northern Germanic tradition]], within ''[[Heathen hof|hof]]'' and ''[[h\u00f6rgr|h\u00f6rgar]]''. The most popular deity was apparently [[Thor]], whom the Icelanders worshipped in the form of high pillars; poets worshipped [[Odin]], as highlighted by Hallfre\u00f0r Vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1ld, the ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'' and the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]''. Other people worshipped [[Freyr]], as attested in the ''[[V\u00edga-Gl\u00fams saga]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\n===10th\u201311th century: Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianisation of Iceland}}\n{{Further|Germanic Christianity}}\n[[File:(9) \u00fe\u00edngmannakirkja.jpg|thumb|Early Icelandic churches maintained the style of [[Heathen hof]]s, often featuring dragons on the roof, such as in the case of the old church of [[Thingvellir]] (the current one goes back to 1859, while the steeple was rebuilt in 1907), built by initiative of King Olaf of Norway, who provided timber and the bell, to mark the official Christianisation of Iceland in the year 1000.]]\n[[File:Carved figure of Christ from Ufsir.jpg|thumb|Carved statue of [[Jesus Christ]], c. 1200, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nApart from the Irish ''papar'', Christianity had been present in Iceland from the start even among the Germanic settlers. The ''Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k'' gives the names of Christian settlers, including an influential woman named Aud the Deep-Minded. Icelanders generally tended to [[syncretism]], integrating [[Jesus Christ]] among their deities rather than converting to the Christian doctrine. For instance, Aud the Deep-Minded was among the baptised and devout Christians and she established a Christian cross on a hill, where she prayed; her kinsmen later regarded the site as sacred, and they built an ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' temple there.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} These first Christians were probably influenced by contact with Norse people in Britain, where Christianity already had a strong presence.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} Among the first settlers, the vast majority were worshippers of the Germanic gods, and organised Christianity probably died out in one or two generations.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} The syncretic attitude of the Icelanders made possible for the Germanic religion to survive and intermingle with Christianity even in later periods. It is recorded in the ''Eyrbyggja saga'' that as Norway was being Christianised, a pagan temple was dismantled there to be reassembled in Iceland.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=168}}\n\nThe adoption of Christianity\u2014which then was still identical to the [[Catholic Church]]\u2014as the [[state religion]] (''kristnitaka'', literally the \"taking of Christianity\"{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=481}}), and therefore the formal conversion of the entire population, was decided by the Althing in 999/1000,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} pushed by the [[king of Norway]], [[Olaf Tryggvason]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jochens|first=Jenny|title=Late and Peaceful: Iceland's Conversion Through Arbitration in 1000|journal=Speculum|number=74|year=1999|pages=621\u2013655|doi=10.2307/2886763|jstor=2886763}}</ref> In that year, Christianity was still a minority in Iceland, while the belief in the Germanic religion was strong. However, some Christians had acquired high positions in the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' system and therefore considerable power in the Althing.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\nChristian missionaries began to be active in Iceland by 980. One of them was the Icelandic native [[Thorvald Konradsson]], who had been baptised on the continent by the [[Saxons|Saxon]] bishop Fridrek, with whom he preached the gospel in Iceland in 981, converting only Thorvald's father Konrad and his family. They were unsuccessful and even had a clash with pagans at the Althing, killing two men. After the event, in 986 Fridrek returned to [[Saxony]] while Thorvald embarked for [[Viking expansion|Viking expeditions]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. Among the other proselytisers, King Olaf of Norway sent the Icelandic native [[Stefnir Thorgilsson]] in 995\u2013996 and the Saxon priest [[Thangbrand]] in 997\u2013999. Both the missions were unsuccessful: Stefnir violently destroyed temples and ancestral shrines, leading the Althing to enact a law against Christians\u2014who were declared ''fr\u00e6ndaskomm'', a \"disgrace on one's kin\", and could now be denounced\u2014and to outlaw Stefnir, who returned to Norway; Thangbrand, a learnt but violent man, succeeded in converting some important families, but he also had many opponents, and, when he killed a poet\u2014who had composed verses against him\u2014, he was outlawed and he too went back to Norway.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}\n\nAt this point, Olaf Tryggvason suspended Iceland's trade with Norway (a concrete threat for Icelandic economy) and threatened to kill Icelanders residing in Norway (who were for the most part sons and relatives of prominent ''go\u00f0ar'') as long as Iceland remained a pagan country. Iceland sent a delegation, belonging to the Christian faction, to obtain the release of the hostages and promise the conversion of the country to Christianity. Meanwhile, in Iceland the situation was worsening, as the two religious factions had divided the country and a civil war was about to break out. However, the mediation of the Althing, presided by the lawspeaker [[Thorgeir Thorkelsson]], thwarted the conflict.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}} Thorgeir was trusted by both the religious factions, and he was given the responsibility to decide whether Icelanders would have converted to Christianity or would have remained faithful to the Germanic religion of their ancestors. After one day and one night, he decided that, in order to keep peace, the population had to be united under one law and one religion, Christianity, and all the non-Christians among the population would have received baptism. At first, it was maintained the right for people to sacrifice to the old gods in private, though it was punishable if witnesses were provided. A few years later, these provisions allowing private cults were abolished.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=483}}\n\nThe decision of the Althing was a turning point; before that, it was difficult for individuals to convert to Christianity, since it would have meant to abandon the traditions of one's own kin, and would have been seen as ''\u00e6ttarspillar''\u2014\"destruction of kinship\".{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}} Despite the official Christianisation, the old Germanic religion persisted for long time, as proven by the literature produced by [[Snorri Sturluson]]\u2014himself a Christian\u2014and other authors in the 13th century, who composed the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|pp=162, 168}} After the conversion, members of the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' often became Christian priests and bishops. The first consecrated bishop in Iceland was \u00cdsleif Gizursson, who from 1057 to his death in 1080 was the bishop of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]]. He is credited with having instituted a tithe system which made the Icelandic church financially independent and strengthened Christianity.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}}\n\n===16th century: Protestant Reformation===\n{{Main|Icelandic Reformation}}\n{{Further|Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein}}\n[[File:Holar church.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[H\u00f3lar]], and [[H\u00f3lar University College]].]]\n[[File:(Baumg1889) Kirchliche Einteilung (Bist\u00fcmer) Islands im Mittelalter.jpg|thumb|1889 map showing the location in Iceland of the two major Catholic bishoprics, and of the Catholic monasteries under their jurisdiction, before the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]\nThe last two Catholic bishops of Iceland were \u00d8gmundur P\u00e1llson of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]] and J\u00f3n Arason of [[H\u00f3lar]]. J\u00f3n was a poet of some importance and was married with many children, a usual thing among the clergy in Iceland. The two bishops, who were not well versed in theology but were men of great power, were in conflict with one another and threatened open conflict. At the Althing of 1526 they came with their own armed contingents, though they reconciled because of the threat posed by a new, common enemy, the spread of [[Lutheranism]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=154}}\n\nLutheran pamphlets were introduced in Iceland through trade with [[Germany]]. In 1533, the Althing ordained that \"all shall continue in the Holy Faith and the Law of God, which God has given to us, and which the Holy Fathers have confirmed\". Among the first Lutherans there was [[Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson]], who had converted to Lutheranism while living on the continent for many years. When he went back to Iceland, he became the secretary of the bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt and translated the [[New Testament]] into the [[Icelandic language]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nThe most important figure in early Icelandic Lutheranism was, however, [[Gissur Einarsson]], who during a period of study in Germany learned about the Reformation. In 1536, he became assistant at the Sk\u00e1lholt bishopric, though he still did not formally embrace Lutheranism. When Lutheranism became the state religion of [[Denmark]] and Norway under king [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], the king tried to convert Iceland too. In 1538, the \"Church Ordinance\" (the royal invitation to convert) was put before the two bishops \u00d8gmundur and J\u00f3n at the Althing, but it was rejected. Then Christian III ordered the dissolution of the [[monastery|monasteries]]. Bishop \u00d8gmundur, now old and almost blind, chose Gissur Einarsson as his successor. He was examined by theologians in [[Copenhagen]] and in 1540 the king appointed him as the superintendent of Sk\u00e1lholt. Gissur was only 25 years old and it was difficult for him to maintain power, especially as he was opposed by the clergy and even by the old bishop. A royal emissary was sent to uphold the ordinance, and \u00d8gmundur was arrested and died on the way to Denmark. The ordinance was accepted in Sk\u00e1lholt, but rejected by J\u00f3n Arason in H\u00f3lar. Bishop Gissur, who was ordained by the Danish bishop [[Peder Palladius]], reorganised the church in his diocese according to Lutheran principles, including the suppression of Catholic ceremonies and the exhortation of clergy marriage. He entrusted Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson with the translation of German sermons, and he himself translated parts of the [[Old Testament]] and the Church Ordinance.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nGissur Einarsson died in 1548 and J\u00f3n Arason took possession of the Sk\u00e1lholt diocese, even though the clergy opposed him. He also imprisoned Gissur's appointed successor. J\u00f3n Arason was consequently outlawed by the king, he was arrested with two of his sons, and all three were executed in November 1550.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}} In 1552 the H\u00f3lar diocese also accepted the Church Ordinance. Institutional opposition to the Reformation had now vanished, so that church properties were secularised and churches and monasteries were plundered. However, it took many decades for Lutheranism to be firmly established in Iceland. Church manuals and hymnals were in bad Danish translations, and new schools had to be set up in cathedral towns to train the Lutheran clergy. Bishop Palladius was in charge of the development of the Icelandic Lutheran church in those early years. The able and energetic Gudbrandur Thorl\u00e1ksson, bishop of H\u00f3lar from 1571 to 1627, devoted his energies in improving church literature, clergy training and community education. In 1584 the first Icelandic translation of the [[Bible]] was published.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=156}}\n\n===20th\u201321st century: Decline of Christianity and rise of new religions===\n{{Further|Heathenry (new religious movement)|Zuism}}\n[[File:Zuist Church logo (December 2015).svg|thumb|Logo of the Zuist Church used for the protest in December 2015.]]\nSince the end of the 19th century, Iceland has been more open to new religious ideas than many other European countries.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}} In the 19th and early 20th centuries, religious life in Iceland, still mostly within the Christian establishment, was influenced by the spread of [[spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualist]] beliefs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swatos|first1=William H.|last2=Gissurarson|first2=Loftur Reimar|title=Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=1412825776}} ''passim''.</ref> [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was introduced in Iceland around 1900, and in 1920 the Icelandic Theosophists formally organised as an independent branch of the international Theosophical movement, though within the fold of the Lutheran belief and led by a Lutheran pastor, S\u00e9ra Jakob Kristinsson.{{sfn|Fell|1999|p=250}}\n\nSince the late 20th century there has been a rapid diversification of religious life in the country. The most notable phenomenon has been a rise of [[modern Paganism|Neopagan religions]], especially [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], in Iceland also called ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\", the return to Germanic religion. This may have been assisted by the [[Icelandic language]]'s literary tradition that predates the island's conversion to Christianity, the [[Edda]]s and the [[Saga]]s, which are well known by most Icelanders, providing an unbroken link with the pagan past.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}}\n\nIn 1972, four men proposed to found an organisation for the revitalisation of the pre-Christian northern Germanic religion.

In late 2015, the Board of Directors of the Zuist Church was hijacked by people who were unrelated to the movement, and under the new leadership Zuism was turned into a medium for a protest against the state church and the Icelandic church tax (''s\u00f3knargjald''). Zuism, unlike other religions, promised to share among its adherents the money it receives from the tax, so that in a few weeks thousands of people joined the church. After a legal struggle, the original directors were reinstated as the leaders of the movement, and by October 2017, after two years of frozen activity, the case was closed allowing the church to dispose of its taxes.<ref name=zuism.is-24Oct>{{cite web|title=Yfirl\u00fdsing fr\u00e1 \u00c1g\u00fasti Arnari \u00c1g\u00fastsssyni, forst\u00f6\u00f0umanni tr\u00faf\u00e9lagsins Zuism|url=http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220221401/http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|archive-date=20 December 2017}}</ref> This church has kept the principle of funds' redistribution among members, which is called ''amargi''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amargi (Endurgrei\u00f0sla S\u00f3knargjalda)|url=http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229135343/http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|archive-date=29 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Religions and life stances==\n[[File:Sk\u00e1lholt - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]], the first church which converted to [[Lutheranism]] in Iceland.]]\nAs of 2019, 80.17% of the Icelanders were affiliated with some religion officially recognised by the government and listed in the [[Registers Iceland|civil registry]], 13.02% were members of some unspecified other religions not registered within the civil registry, and 6.96% were unaffiliated with any religion.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n===Christianity===\nAs of 2019, 76.84% of the Icelandic people were registered as [[Christians]], most of them belonging to the Church of Iceland and minor Lutheran free churches.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/> Catholics were 3.92%, and a further 7.77% of the Icelanders were adherents of some other Christian denomination.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n====Lutheranism====\n{{Main|Church of Iceland}}\nIn 2019, 65.15% of the Icelanders were registered as members of the national Church of Iceland.

representing the god [[Thor]], c. 1000, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nWhen Iceland was first settled by [[Norwegians]] (but also by some [[Swedes]] and people from the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse settlements in Britain]]{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}) in the mid-9th century, approximately in 870,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}} it was inhabited by a small number of [[Irish people|Irish]] Christian [[anchorite]]s known as ''[[papar]]'' (singular ''papi''). When [[settlement of Iceland|Scandinavians began to arrive in larger numbers]], the anchorites left of their own or were driven out.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}} The migration of Norwegians was partly in response to the politics of [[Harald Fairhair]], who was unifying [[Norway]] under a centralised monarchy.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe first Icelanders, though accustomed to a society in which the monarch was essential for religious life, did not establish a new monarchy in the colony, but rather a yearly assembly of free men, the [[Althing]]. The \"[[thing (assembly)|things]]\" were assemblies of free men who governed Germanic societies, and they were led by a holy kingship. The Icelandic thing developed peculiar characteristics; in place of the loyalty to a holy king, the Icelanders established the loyalty to a law code, first composed by \u00dalflj\u00f3t who studied Norwegian laws.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nIcelandic landowners (''landn\u00e1msmenn''{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}}) were organised into ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' (\"god-word(s)\"), religio-political groups under the leadership of a ''[[gothi|go\u00f0i]]'' (\"god-man\"). The ''go\u00f0ar'' were part-time priests who officiated ritual sacrifices at the local temple and had some qualities of the Germanic kings; they organised local things and represented them at the Althing. \u00dalflj\u00f3t was chosen as the first Lawspeaker (''L\u00f6gs\u00f6guma\u00f0r''), who presided the Althing which met annually at [[Thingvellir]]. The religio-political organisation of early Iceland has been defined as \"pagan and anti-monarchic\", which distinguished it from other Germanic societies. Concerning other religious practices, the Icelanders followed Scandinavian norms; they built temples enshrining images of the gods.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe religion was named ''Go\u00f0atr\u00fa'' or ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\". Icelanders worshipped ''[[landv\u00e6ttir]]'', local land spirits, and the gods of the common [[Old Norse religion|northern Germanic tradition]], within ''[[Heathen hof|hof]]'' and ''[[h\u00f6rgr|h\u00f6rgar]]''. The most popular deity was apparently [[Thor]], whom the Icelanders worshipped in the form of high pillars; poets worshipped [[Odin]], as highlighted by Hallfre\u00f0r Vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1ld, the ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'' and the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]''. Other people worshipped [[Freyr]], as attested in the ''[[V\u00edga-Gl\u00fams saga]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\n===10th\u201311th century: Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianisation of Iceland}}\n{{Further|Germanic Christianity}}\n[[File:(9) \u00fe\u00edngmannakirkja.jpg|thumb|Early Icelandic churches maintained the style of [[Heathen hof]]s, often featuring dragons on the roof, such as in the case of the old church of [[Thingvellir]] (the current one goes back to 1859, while the steeple was rebuilt in 1907), built by initiative of King Olaf of Norway, who provided timber and the bell, to mark the official Christianisation of Iceland in the year 1000.]]\n[[File:Carved figure of Christ from Ufsir.jpg|thumb|Carved statue of [[Jesus Christ]], c. 1200, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nApart from the Irish ''papar'', Christianity had been present in Iceland from the start even among the Germanic settlers. The ''Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k'' gives the names of Christian settlers, including an influential woman named Aud the Deep-Minded. Icelanders generally tended to [[syncretism]], integrating [[Jesus Christ]] among their deities rather than converting to the Christian doctrine. For instance, Aud the Deep-Minded was among the baptised and devout Christians and she established a Christian cross on a hill, where she prayed; her kinsmen later regarded the site as sacred, and they built an ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' temple there.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} These first Christians were probably influenced by contact with Norse people in Britain, where Christianity already had a strong presence.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} Among the first settlers, the vast majority were worshippers of the Germanic gods, and organised Christianity probably died out in one or two generations.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} The syncretic attitude of the Icelanders made possible for the Germanic religion to survive and intermingle with Christianity even in later periods. It is recorded in the ''Eyrbyggja saga'' that as Norway was being Christianised, a pagan temple was dismantled there to be reassembled in Iceland.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=168}}\n\nThe adoption of Christianity\u2014which then was still identical to the [[Catholic Church]]\u2014as the [[state religion]] (''kristnitaka'', literally the \"taking of Christianity\"{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=481}}), and therefore the formal conversion of the entire population, was decided by the Althing in 999/1000,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} pushed by the [[king of Norway]], [[Olaf Tryggvason]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jochens|first=Jenny|title=Late and Peaceful: Iceland's Conversion Through Arbitration in 1000|journal=Speculum|number=74|year=1999|pages=621\u2013655|doi=10.2307/2886763|jstor=2886763}}</ref> In that year, Christianity was still a minority in Iceland, while the belief in the Germanic religion was strong. However, some Christians had acquired high positions in the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' system and therefore considerable power in the Althing.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\nChristian missionaries began to be active in Iceland by 980. One of them was the Icelandic native [[Thorvald Konradsson]], who had been baptised on the continent by the [[Saxons|Saxon]] bishop Fridrek, with whom he preached the gospel in Iceland in 981, converting only Thorvald's father Konrad and his family. They were unsuccessful and even had a clash with pagans at the Althing, killing two men. After the event, in 986 Fridrek returned to [[Saxony]] while Thorvald embarked for [[Viking expansion|Viking expeditions]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. Among the other proselytisers, King Olaf of Norway sent the Icelandic native [[Stefnir Thorgilsson]] in 995\u2013996 and the Saxon priest [[Thangbrand]] in 997\u2013999. Both the missions were unsuccessful: Stefnir violently destroyed temples and ancestral shrines, leading the Althing to enact a law against Christians\u2014who were declared ''fr\u00e6ndaskomm'', a \"disgrace on one's kin\", and could now be denounced\u2014and to outlaw Stefnir, who returned to Norway; Thangbrand, a learnt but violent man, succeeded in converting some important families, but he also had many opponents, and, when he killed a poet\u2014who had composed verses against him\u2014, he was outlawed and he too went back to Norway.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}\n\nAt this point, Olaf Tryggvason suspended Iceland's trade with Norway (a concrete threat for Icelandic economy) and threatened to kill Icelanders residing in Norway (who were for the most part sons and relatives of prominent ''go\u00f0ar'') as long as Iceland remained a pagan country. Iceland sent a delegation, belonging to the Christian faction, to obtain the release of the hostages and promise the conversion of the country to Christianity. Meanwhile, in Iceland the situation was worsening, as the two religious factions had divided the country and a civil war was about to break out. However, the mediation of the Althing, presided by the lawspeaker [[Thorgeir Thorkelsson]], thwarted the conflict.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}} Thorgeir was trusted by both the religious factions, and he was given the responsibility to decide whether Icelanders would have converted to Christianity or would have remained faithful to the Germanic religion of their ancestors. After one day and one night, he decided that, in order to keep peace, the population had to be united under one law and one religion, Christianity, and all the non-Christians among the population would have received baptism. At first, it was maintained the right for people to sacrifice to the old gods in private, though it was punishable if witnesses were provided. A few years later, these provisions allowing private cults were abolished.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=483}}\n\nThe decision of the Althing was a turning point; before that, it was difficult for individuals to convert to Christianity, since it would have meant to abandon the traditions of one's own kin, and would have been seen as ''\u00e6ttarspillar''\u2014\"destruction of kinship\".{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}} Despite the official Christianisation, the old Germanic religion persisted for long time, as proven by the literature produced by [[Snorri Sturluson]]\u2014himself a Christian\u2014and other authors in the 13th century, who composed the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|pp=162, 168}} After the conversion, members of the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' often became Christian priests and bishops. The first consecrated bishop in Iceland was \u00cdsleif Gizursson, who from 1057 to his death in 1080 was the bishop of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]]. He is credited with having instituted a tithe system which made the Icelandic church financially independent and strengthened Christianity.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}}\n\n===16th century: Protestant Reformation===\n{{Main|Icelandic Reformation}}\n{{Further|Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein}}\n[[File:Holar church.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[H\u00f3lar]], and [[H\u00f3lar University College]].]]\n[[File:(Baumg1889) Kirchliche Einteilung (Bist\u00fcmer) Islands im Mittelalter.jpg|thumb|1889 map showing the location in Iceland of the two major Catholic bishoprics, and of the Catholic monasteries under their jurisdiction, before the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]\nThe last two Catholic bishops of Iceland were \u00d8gmundur P\u00e1llson of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]] and J\u00f3n Arason of [[H\u00f3lar]]. J\u00f3n was a poet of some importance and was married with many children, a usual thing among the clergy in Iceland. The two bishops, who were not well versed in theology but were men of great power, were in conflict with one another and threatened open conflict. At the Althing of 1526 they came with their own armed contingents, though they reconciled because of the threat posed by a new, common enemy, the spread of [[Lutheranism]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=154}}\n\nLutheran pamphlets were introduced in Iceland through trade with [[Germany]]. In 1533, the Althing ordained that \"all shall continue in the Holy Faith and the Law of God, which God has given to us, and which the Holy Fathers have confirmed\". Among the first Lutherans there was [[Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson]], who had converted to Lutheranism while living on the continent for many years. When he went back to Iceland, he became the secretary of the bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt and translated the [[New Testament]] into the [[Icelandic language]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nThe most important figure in early Icelandic Lutheranism was, however, [[Gissur Einarsson]], who during a period of study in Germany learned about the Reformation. In 1536, he became assistant at the Sk\u00e1lholt bishopric, though he still did not formally embrace Lutheranism. When Lutheranism became the state religion of [[Denmark]] and Norway under king [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], the king tried to convert Iceland too. In 1538, the \"Church Ordinance\" (the royal invitation to convert) was put before the two bishops \u00d8gmundur and J\u00f3n at the Althing, but it was rejected. Then Christian III ordered the dissolution of the [[monastery|monasteries]]. Bishop \u00d8gmundur, now old and almost blind, chose Gissur Einarsson as his successor. He was examined by theologians in [[Copenhagen]] and in 1540 the king appointed him as the superintendent of Sk\u00e1lholt. Gissur was only 25 years old and it was difficult for him to maintain power, especially as he was opposed by the clergy and even by the old bishop. A royal emissary was sent to uphold the ordinance, and \u00d8gmundur was arrested and died on the way to Denmark. The ordinance was accepted in Sk\u00e1lholt, but rejected by J\u00f3n Arason in H\u00f3lar. Bishop Gissur, who was ordained by the Danish bishop [[Peder Palladius]], reorganised the church in his diocese according to Lutheran principles, including the suppression of Catholic ceremonies and the exhortation of clergy marriage. He entrusted Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson with the translation of German sermons, and he himself translated parts of the [[Old Testament]] and the Church Ordinance.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nGissur Einarsson died in 1548 and J\u00f3n Arason took possession of the Sk\u00e1lholt diocese, even though the clergy opposed him. He also imprisoned Gissur's appointed successor. J\u00f3n Arason was consequently outlawed by the king, he was arrested with two of his sons, and all three were executed in November 1550.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}} In 1552 the H\u00f3lar diocese also accepted the Church Ordinance. Institutional opposition to the Reformation had now vanished, so that church properties were secularised and churches and monasteries were plundered. However, it took many decades for Lutheranism to be firmly established in Iceland. Church manuals and hymnals were in bad Danish translations, and new schools had to be set up in cathedral towns to train the Lutheran clergy. Bishop Palladius was in charge of the development of the Icelandic Lutheran church in those early years. The able and energetic Gudbrandur Thorl\u00e1ksson, bishop of H\u00f3lar from 1571 to 1627, devoted his energies in improving church literature, clergy training and community education. In 1584 the first Icelandic translation of the [[Bible]] was published.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=156}}\n\n===20th\u201321st century: Decline of Christianity and rise of new religions===\n{{Further|Heathenry (new religious movement)|Zuism}}\n[[File:Zuist Church logo (December 2015).svg|thumb|Logo of the Zuist Church used for the protest in December 2015.]]\nSince the end of the 19th century, Iceland has been more open to new religious ideas than many other European countries.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}} In the 19th and early 20th centuries, religious life in Iceland, still mostly within the Christian establishment, was influenced by the spread of [[spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualist]] beliefs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swatos|first1=William H.|last2=Gissurarson|first2=Loftur Reimar|title=Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=1412825776}} ''passim''.</ref> [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was introduced in Iceland around 1900, and in 1920 the Icelandic Theosophists formally organised as an independent branch of the international Theosophical movement, though within the fold of the Lutheran belief and led by a Lutheran pastor, S\u00e9ra Jakob Kristinsson.{{sfn|Fell|1999|p=250}}\n\nSince the late 20th century there has been a rapid diversification of religious life in the country. The most notable phenomenon has been a rise of [[modern Paganism|Neopagan religions]], especially [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], in Iceland also called ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\", the return to Germanic religion. This may have been assisted by the [[Icelandic language]]'s literary tradition that predates the island's conversion to Christianity, the [[Edda]]s and the [[Saga]]s, which are well known by most Icelanders, providing an unbroken link with the pagan past.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}}\n\nIn 1972, four men proposed to found an organisation for the revitalisation of the pre-Christian northern Germanic religion. They founded ''[[\u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0]]'' (the \u00c1satr\u00fa Society) and asked the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs to recognise the new organisation, giving its chief priest the same legal status as a Christian pastor. In the autumn of the same year, they asked to be registered, and by the spring of 1973 ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' had become a recognised religion.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}}\n\nIn the early 2010s, [[Zuism]], a revival of the [[Sumerian religion]], was founded in Iceland and formally registered in 2013. In late 2015, the Board of Directors of the Zuist Church was hijacked by people who were unrelated to the movement, and under the new leadership Zuism was turned into a medium for a protest against the state church and the Icelandic church tax (''s\u00f3knargjald''). Zuism, unlike other religions, promised to share among its adherents the money it receives from the tax, so that in a few weeks thousands of people joined the church. After a legal struggle, the original directors were reinstated as the leaders of the movement, and by October 2017, after two years of frozen activity, the case was closed allowing the church to dispose of its taxes.<ref name=zuism.is-24Oct>{{cite web|title=Yfirl\u00fdsing fr\u00e1 \u00c1g\u00fasti Arnari \u00c1g\u00fastsssyni, forst\u00f6\u00f0umanni tr\u00faf\u00e9lagsins Zuism|url=http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220221401/http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|archive-date=20 December 2017}}</ref> This church has kept the principle of funds' redistribution among members, which is called ''amargi''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amargi (Endurgrei\u00f0sla S\u00f3knargjalda)|url=http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229135343/http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|archive-date=29 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Religions and life stances==\n[[File:Sk\u00e1lholt - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]], the first church which converted to [[Lutheranism]] in Iceland.]]\nAs of 2019, 80.17% of the Icelanders were affiliated with some religion officially recognised by the government and listed in the [[Registers Iceland|civil registry]], 13.02% were members of some unspecified other religions not registered within the civil registry, and 6.96% were unaffiliated with any religion.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n===Christianity===\nAs of 2019, 76.84% of the Icelandic people were registered as [[Christians]], most of them belonging to the Church of Iceland and minor Lutheran free churches.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/> Catholics were 3.92%, and a further 7.77% of the Icelanders were adherents of some other Christian denomination.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n====Lutheranism====\n{{Main|Church of Iceland}}\nIn 2019, 65.15% of the Icelanders were registered as members of the national Church of Iceland.

These three structural domains include an N-terminal uncharacterized protein family 0004 (UPF0004) domain that contains the auxiliary Fe-S cluster, a central radical SAM motif that contains the central active Fe-S motif, an a C-terminal \"TRAM\" domain that is thought to be involved in substrate recognition<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Of the two Fe-S clusters, the central cluster binds the SAM that is used to generate the 5'-dA while the auxiliary cluster has a less studied functionality. Most research suggests that this auxiliary cluster functions as the direct donor of the sulfur during catalysis or it functions to coordinate an exogenous source of sulfur for use during catalysis<ref name=\":3\" />. In the comparatively well studied methylthiotransferase MiaB, the auxiliary cluster is thought to directly donate the sulfur of the methylthio group during catalysis.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Bo|last2=Arcinas|first2=Arthur J.|last3=Radle|first3=Matthew I.|last4=Silakov|first4=Alexey|last5=Booker|first5=Squire J.|last6=Krebs|first6=Carsten|date=2020-01-29|title=First Step in Catalysis of the Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Methylthiotransferase MiaB Yields an Intermediate with a [3Fe-4S]0-Like Auxiliary Cluster|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=142|issue=4|pages=1911\u20131924|doi=10.1021/jacs.9b11093|issn=0002-7863|pmc=7008301|pmid=31899624}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed Mechanism of Methylthiotransferases ==\nMethylthiotransferases catalyze the addition of a methylthio group to various biochemical products. Transferring methylthio groups is a complicated reaction requiring multiple Fe-S clusters. Previous literature proposed that the enzymes would function sequentially, first adding a sulfur to the substrate and then adding a methyl group derived from the second SAM molecule<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fontecave|first=M.|last2=Mulliez|first2=E.|last3=Atta|first3=M.|date=2008-03-21|title=New Light on Methylthiolation Reactions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552108000847|journal=Chemistry & Biology|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=209\u2013210|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.02.011|pmid=18355719|issn=1074-5521}}</ref>. This mechanism has not been supported by recent works. Studies now propose that a methyl group from the first SAM molecule is transferred to a sulfur within the auxilary [4Fe-4S] cluster to form a methylthio group that is then transferred to the product via a radical mechanism coordinated with the 5'-dA molecule produced from the cleavage of the second SAM molecule<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Landgraf|first=Bradley J.|last2=Arcinas|first2=Arthur J.|last3=Lee|first3=Kyung-Hoon|last4=Booker|first4=Squire J.|date=2013-10-16|title=Identification of an Intermediate Methyl Carrier in the Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Methylthiotransferases RimO and MiaB|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=135|issue=41|pages=15404\u201315416|doi=10.1021/ja4048448|issn=0002-7863|pmc=4023531|pmid=23991893}}</ref>. The proposed mechanisms for MiaB and RimO slightly differ, with MiaB using a coordinated sulfur as the methylthio group<ref name=\":3\" /> and RimO using an external sulfur attached to the unique iron atom within the cluster as the methylthio group<ref name=\":5\" />. Despite this difference, both use the same basic principles for the mechanism; create a methylthiolated intermediate using the auxilary [4Fe-4S] cluster and then add the methylthio group to the substrate.\n\n== Known Methylthiotransferases ==\n\n=== MiaB ===\n[[File:MiaB_Methylthiotransferase_Mechanism.png|thumb|'''Formation of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> auxiliary cluster of MiaB''' via the nucleophilic attack of a \u03bc<sub>3</sub>-bridging sulfide.

When compared to MiaB and RimO, MtaB is much less studied but is still potentially involved in various cellular processes. One potential application of studying this specific MTTase is that it is encoded by the gene [[CDKAL1]] in humans, which is known to increase the reduction of insulin secretion when mutated or downregulated thus leading to a higher risk of the person developing type 2 diabetes<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" />.\n<br />\n\n=== RimO ===\n[[File:RimO_thiomethyltransferase_mechanism.png|thumb|'''Mechanism of RimO''' catalyzed addition of a methylthio group to the \u03b2-carbon of aspartate.

[[Animal]] species such as [[cat]]s that walk on their toes are described as being ''[[digitigrade]]''. [[Human]]s, and other animals that walk on the soles of their feet, are described as being ''[[plantigrade]]''; ''[[unguligrade]]'' animals are those that walk on [[hoof|hooves]] at the tips of their toes\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Gray269.png|thumb|Bones of the right [[foot]]. [[Plantar]] surface.]]\n[[File:Female feet.jpg|thumb|Female toes.]]\n[[File:Toe ring (1).jpg|thumb|The underside of a woman's toes wearing a [[toe ring]] on the second toe.]]\n\nThere are five toes present on each human foot. Each toe consists of three [[phalanx bone]]s, the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal, middle and distal]], with the exception of the big toe ({{lang-la|Hallux}}). For a minority of people, the little toe also is missing a middle bone. The hallux only contains two phalanx bones, the proximal and distal. The joints between each phalanx are the [[Interphalangeal joints of foot|interphalangeal joints]]. The proximal phalanx bone of each toe articulates with the [[metatarsal]] bone of the foot at the [[Metatarsophalangeal joints|metatarsophalangeal joint]]. Each toe is surrounded by skin, and present on all five toes is a [[toenail]].\n\nThe toes are, from [[Medial (anatomy)|medial to lateral]]: \n\n* the first toe, also known as the hallux (\"big toe\", \"great toe\", \"thumb toe\"), the innermost toe;\n* the second toe, (\"long toe\", \"pointer toe\", \"index toe\");\n* the third toe, (\"middle toe\", \"long toe\");\n* the fourth toe, (\"fore toe\"); and\n* the fifth toe, (\"baby toe\", \"little toe\", \"pinky toe\" \"small toe\", \"tiny toe\", \"wee toe\"), the outermost toe.\n\n===Muscles===\n{{See also|Foot#Muscles}}\nToe movement is generally [[Anatomical terms of movement#Flexion and extension|flexion and extension]] via muscular [[tendon]]s that attach to the toes on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and superior|anterior and superior]] surfaces of the phalanx bones.<ref name=\"GRAYS2005\">{{cite book|title=Gray's anatomy for students|last=Drake|first=Richard L.|author2=Vogl, Wayne|author3=Tibbitts, Adam W.M.

[[Dorsal interossei of the foot|Muscles between the toes]] on their top and bottom also help to abduct and adduct the toes.<ref name=GRAYS2005 />{{rp|579}} The hallux and little toe have unique muscles:\n* The hallux is primarily flexed by the [[flexor hallucis longus muscle]], located in the deep [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] of the lower leg, via the [[flexor hallucis longus]] [[tendon]]. Additional flexion control is provided by the [[flexor hallucis brevis]]. It is extended by the [[abductor hallucis muscle]] and the [[adductor hallucis muscle]]. \n* The little toe has a separate set of control muscles and tendon attachments, the [[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor]] and [[abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor]] digiti minimi. Numerous other [[:Category:Foot muscles|foot muscles]] contribute to fine motor control of the foot. The connective tendons between the minor toes account for the inability to actuate individual toes.\n\n===Blood supply===\nThe toes receive blood from the digital branches of the [[plantar metatarsal artery|plantar metatarsal arteries]] and drain blood into the [[dorsal venous arch]] of the foot.<ref name=GRAYS2005 />{{rp|580\u201381}}\n\n===Nerve supply===\nSensation to the skin of the toes is provided by five nerves. The [[superficial fibular nerve]] supplies sensation to the top of the toes, except between the hallux and second toe, which is supplied by the [[deep fibular nerve]], and the outer surface of the fifth toe, supplied by the [[sural nerve]]. Sensation to the bottom of the toes is supplied by the [[medial plantar nerve]], which supplies sensation to the great toe and inner three-and-a-half toes, and the [[lateral plantar nerve]], which supplies sensation to the little toe and half of the sensation of the fourth toe.\n\nIn [[human]]s, the hallux is usually longer than the second toe, but in some individuals, it may not be the longest toe. There is an [[Mendelian inheritance|inherited]] trait in humans, where the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[gene]] causes a longer second toe (\"[[Morton's toe]]\" or \"Greek foot\") while the [[Zygosity|homozygous]] recessive [[genotype]] presents with the more common trait: a longer hallux.<ref>{{OMIM|189200|Toes&nbsp;\u2013 relative lengths of first and second}}</ref> People with the rare genetic disease [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]] characteristically have a short hallux which appears to turn inward, or medially, in relation to the foot.\n\n===Variation===\nHumans usually have five toes on each foot. When more than five toes are present, this is known as [[polydactyly]]. Other variants may include [[syndactyly]] or [[arachnodactyly]].

Hammer toe can be described as an abnormal contraction or \u201cbuckling\u201d of a toe. This is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints, which form the toes. Since the toes are deformed further, these may press against a shoe and cause pain. Deformities of the foot can also be caused by [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[diabetes mellitus]]. Deformities may predispose to [[ulcer]]s and pain, especially when shoe-wearing.\n\nA common problem involving the big toe is the formation of [[bunion]]s.

The various cartilaginous or bony radii that are found in large numbers in each fin correspond to the fingers of toes of the higher Vertebrates. The several joints of each fin-radius correspond to the various parts of the toe. Even in the Dipneusta the fin is of the same construction as in the fishes; it was afterwards gradually evolved into the five-toed form, which we first encounter in the Amphibia. The reduction of the number of toes to six, and then to five, probably took place in the second half of the Devonian period - at the latest, in the subsequent Carboniferous period - in those Dipneusta which we regard as the ancestors of the Amphibia. [...] The fact that the toes number five is of great importance, because they have clearly been transmitted from the Amphibia to all the higher Vertebrates. Man entirely resembles his amphibian ancestors in this respect, and indeed in the whole structure of the bony skeleton of his five-toed extremities. A careful comparison of the skeleton of the frog with our own is enough to show this. [...] There is absolutely no reason why there should be five toes in the fore and hind feet in the lowest Amphibia, the reptiles, and the higher Vertebrates, unless we ascribe it to inheritance from a common stem-form. Heredity alone can explain it. It is true that we find less than five toes in many of the Amphibia and of the higher Vertebrates. But in all these cases we can prove that some of the toes atrophied, and were in time lost altogether.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\nIn [[bird]]s with [[anisodactyl]] or [[heterodactyl]] feet, the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching.\n\nWhile the thumb is often mentioned{{by whom?|date=August 2019}} as one of the signature characteristics in humans, this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all [[primates]].

It is extended by the [[abductor hallucis muscle]] and the [[adductor hallucis muscle]]. \n* The little toe has a separate set of control muscles and tendon attachments, the [[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor]] and [[abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor]] digiti minimi. Numerous other [[:Category:Foot muscles|foot muscles]] contribute to fine motor control of the foot. The connective tendons between the minor toes account for the inability to actuate individual toes.\n\n===Blood supply===\nThe toes receive blood from the digital branches of the [[plantar metatarsal artery|plantar metatarsal arteries]] and drain blood into the [[dorsal venous arch]] of the foot.<ref name=GRAYS2005 />{{rp|580\u201381}}\n\n===Nerve supply===\nSensation to the skin of the toes is provided by five nerves. The [[superficial fibular nerve]] supplies sensation to the top of the toes, except between the hallux and second toe, which is supplied by the [[deep fibular nerve]], and the outer surface of the fifth toe, supplied by the [[sural nerve]]. Sensation to the bottom of the toes is supplied by the [[medial plantar nerve]], which supplies sensation to the great toe and inner three-and-a-half toes, and the [[lateral plantar nerve]], which supplies sensation to the little toe and half of the sensation of the fourth toe.\n\nIn [[human]]s, the hallux is usually longer than the second toe, but in some individuals, it may not be the longest toe. There is an [[Mendelian inheritance|inherited]] trait in humans, where the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[gene]] causes a longer second toe (\"[[Morton's toe]]\" or \"Greek foot\") while the [[Zygosity|homozygous]] recessive [[genotype]] presents with the more common trait: a longer hallux.<ref>{{OMIM|189200|Toes&nbsp;\u2013 relative lengths of first and second}}</ref> People with the rare genetic disease [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]] characteristically have a short hallux which appears to turn inward, or medially, in relation to the foot.\n\n===Variation===\nHumans usually have five toes on each foot. When more than five toes are present, this is known as [[polydactyly]]. Other variants may include [[syndactyly]] or [[arachnodactyly]].

The various cartilaginous or bony radii that are found in large numbers in each fin correspond to the fingers of toes of the higher Vertebrates. The several joints of each fin-radius correspond to the various parts of the toe. Even in the Dipneusta the fin is of the same construction as in the fishes; it was afterwards gradually evolved into the five-toed form, which we first encounter in the Amphibia. The reduction of the number of toes to six, and then to five, probably took place in the second half of the Devonian period - at the latest, in the subsequent Carboniferous period - in those Dipneusta which we regard as the ancestors of the Amphibia. [...] The fact that the toes number five is of great importance, because they have clearly been transmitted from the Amphibia to all the higher Vertebrates. Man entirely resembles his amphibian ancestors in this respect, and indeed in the whole structure of the bony skeleton of his five-toed extremities. A careful comparison of the skeleton of the frog with our own is enough to show this. [...] There is absolutely no reason why there should be five toes in the fore and hind feet in the lowest Amphibia, the reptiles, and the higher Vertebrates, unless we ascribe it to inheritance from a common stem-form. Heredity alone can explain it. It is true that we find less than five toes in many of the Amphibia and of the higher Vertebrates. But in all these cases we can prove that some of the toes atrophied, and were in time lost altogether.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\nIn [[bird]]s with [[anisodactyl]] or [[heterodactyl]] feet, the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching.\n\nWhile the thumb is often mentioned{{by whom?|date=August 2019}} as one of the signature characteristics in humans, this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all [[primates]].

{"title_page": "Army", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{army units}}\nAn '''army''' (from Latin ''arma'' \"arms, weapons\" via Old French ''arm\u00e9e'', \"armed\" [feminine]), '''ground force''' or '''land force''' is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based [[military branch]], service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national [[military]] force, the word army may also mean a [[field army]].\n\nIn some countries, such as France and China, the term \"army\", especially in its plural form \"armies\", has the broader meaning of [[armed forces]] as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called [[French Army|''Arm\u00e9e de terre'']], meaning '''Land Army''', and the air force is called [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']], meaning '''Air Army'''. The naval force, although not using the term \"army\", is also included in the broad sense of the term \"armies\" \u2014 thus the [[French Navy]] is an integral component of the collective French Armies ([[French Armed Forces]]) under the [[Ministry of the Armies (France)|Ministry of the Armies]]. A similar pattern is seen in China, with the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) being the overall military, the \"actual army\" being the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLA Ground Force]], and so forth for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLA Air Force]], the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLA Navy]], and other branches.\n\nThe current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the PLA Ground Force of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto \"non-statutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for \u2013 or restricted to \u2013 homeland defence)\n\n==History==\n{{for|the magazine ''Army History''|United States Army Center of Military History#Fellowships and publications|l1=United States Army Center of Military History \u00a7 Fellowships and publications}}\n\n===India===\nIndia's armies were among the first in the world.

Boys were sent to a [[barracks]] at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan [[serf]]s or ''[[helot]]s'', did the manual labor.\n\nThis allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.The Spartans were one of the most fearless warriors that would have to the army sent at the age of 6 they would be sent to the army.

After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the [[Late Roman Empire]], these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n[[File:Belagerung von Calais 1346-1347.JPG|thumb|Armies of the Middle Ages consisted of noble knights, rendering service to their [[suzerain]], and hired footsoldiers]]\nIn the earliest [[Middle Ages]] it was the obligation of every [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.\n\nInitially, the words \"knight\" and \"noble\" were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them. While the nobility did fight upon horseback, they were also supported by lower class citizens \u2013 and mercenaries and criminals \u2013 whose only purpose was participating in warfare because, most often than not, they held brief employment during their lord's engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strong of Body, Brave and Noble: Chivalry and Society in Medieval France|last=Bouchard|first=Constance Brittain|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801430976|location=Ithaca|pages=13}}</ref> As the Middle Ages progressed and [[feudalism]] developed in a legitimate social and economic system, knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat: they were still in debt to their lord. No longer primarily driven by economic need, the newly established vassal class were, instead, driven by fealty and [[chivalry]].\n\nAs central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the [[peasantry]] began to be the central recruiting tool. England was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.\n\nIn theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Bob|title=Medieval Warfare|date=2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781781592243|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large [[mercenary]] market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.\n\nAs the Middle Ages progressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.\n\nIn 1439 the French legislature, known as the  [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] (French: ''\u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the ''[[taille]]'' that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as ''[[Compagnie d'ordonnance|compagnies d'ordonnance]]'' on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s,  eventually led to the [[Battle of Castillon|French victory at Castillon]] in 1453, and the conclusion of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the ''grande ordonnance'' and the garrison force known as the ''petite ordonnance''.<ref>Vale, M.G.A. (1992). ''Charles VII''. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries]] and German [[Landsknechts]] fighting for glory, fame and money at the [[Battle of Marignan]] (1515). The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]\n\nFirst [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.\n\nThe [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.\n\nAs late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.\n\nThe newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].\n\nIn many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.\n\nHowever, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.\n\nAs any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).<ref>Mackinnon, Daniel.

However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].\n\nBefore then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.\n\nPrior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or \"gentlemen pensioners\", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by France in 1558).\n\nTroops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.\n\nUntil 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]\u2013[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97 97]|isbn=0-674-02385-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97}}</ref> To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]].

In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.<ref name=blum>Jerome Blum (1971) \"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466</ref> The term of service in the 18th century was for life.

They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.\n\nFrom the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The \"recruits\" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.\n\nChina organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|Indian Army personnel during [[Operation Crusader]] in Egypt, 1941]]\n[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which successfully battled European professional armies.\n\nConscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.\n\nCanada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.\n\nIn developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in Switzerland (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).\n\n==Armies as armed services==\nWestern armies are usually subdivided as follows:\n*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].\n*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.\n*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.\n*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3\u20135 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads.

A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a general or lieutenant general.\n\n===Formations===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[2nd Armored Division (United States)]] -->\n[[File:Army Nato.svg|thumb|Standard map symbol for a numbered Army, the 'X's are not substituting the army's number]]\n\nA particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).\n\nArmies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], \"Armies\" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized \"[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]\" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s ''Inside the Soviet Army'' describes how [[Cold War]] era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and [[Military deception|deception]] ('maskirovika') reasons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Army aviation]]\n* [[World War I|First world war]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of armies by country]]\n* [[List of numbered armies]]\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Military history]]\n* [[Military organization]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Military]]\n* [[Paramilitary]]\n* [[Soldier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Army|army}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Military branches}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Armies| ]]\n[[Category:Military]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{army units}}\nAn '''army''' (from Latin ''arma'' \"arms, weapons\" via Old French ''arm\u00e9e'', \"armed\" [feminine]), '''ground force''' or '''land force''' is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based [[military branch]], service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national [[military]] force, the word army may also mean a [[field army]].\n\nIn some countries, such as France and China, the term \"army\", especially in its plural form \"armies\", has the broader meaning of [[armed forces]] as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called [[French Army|''Arm\u00e9e de terre'']], meaning '''Land Army''', and the air force is called [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']], meaning '''Air Army'''. The naval force, although not using the term \"army\", is also included in the broad sense of the term \"armies\" \u2014 thus the [[French Navy]] is an integral component of the collective French Armies ([[French Armed Forces]]) under the [[Ministry of the Armies (France)|Ministry of the Armies]]. A similar pattern is seen in China, with the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) being the overall military, the \"actual army\" being the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLA Ground Force]], and so forth for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLA Air Force]], the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLA Navy]], and other branches.\n\nThe current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the PLA Ground Force of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto \"non-statutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for \u2013 or restricted to \u2013 homeland defence)\n\n==History==\n{{for|the magazine ''Army History''|United States Army Center of Military History#Fellowships and publications|l1=United States Army Center of Military History \u00a7 Fellowships and publications}}\n\n===India===\nIndia's armies were among the first in the world.

By the [[Warring States period]], the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret, with bronze bolts which could pierce any armor.

Boys were sent to a [[barracks]] at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan [[serf]]s or ''[[helot]]s'', did the manual labor.\n\nThis allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.The Spartans were one of the most fearless warriors that have fought at the age of 6 they would be sent to the army.

[[Marian Reforms|Reforms]] turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens, but these citizens [[career soldier|served continuously]] for 25 years before being discharged.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knighton |first1=Andrew |title=The Roman Army \u2013 The Development Of One Of The Most Powerful Military Forces In The Ancient World |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/ancient-history/roman-army-development-military.html |website=War History Online |accessdate=4 September 2018 |date=May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans were also noted for making use of [[Auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]], non-Romans who served with the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as [[skirmisher|light skirmish troops]] and [[heavy cavalry]]. After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the [[Late Roman Empire]], these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n[[File:Belagerung von Calais 1346-1347.JPG|thumb|Armies of the Middle Ages consisted of noble knights, rendering service to their [[suzerain]], and hired footsoldiers]]\nIn the earliest [[Middle Ages]] it was the obligation of every [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.\n\nInitially, the words \"knight\" and \"noble\" were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them. While the nobility did fight upon horseback, they were also supported by lower class citizens \u2013 and mercenaries and criminals \u2013 whose only purpose was participating in warfare because, most often than not, they held brief employment during their lord's engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strong of Body, Brave and Noble: Chivalry and Society in Medieval France|last=Bouchard|first=Constance Brittain|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801430976|location=Ithaca|pages=13}}</ref> As the Middle Ages progressed and [[feudalism]] developed in a legitimate social and economic system, knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat: they were still in debt to their lord. No longer primarily driven by economic need, the newly established vassal class were, instead, driven by fealty and [[chivalry]].\n\nAs central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the [[peasantry]] began to be the central recruiting tool. England was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.\n\nIn theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Bob|title=Medieval Warfare|date=2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781781592243|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large [[mercenary]] market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.\n\nAs the Middle Ages progressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.\n\nIn 1439 the French legislature, known as the  [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] (French: ''\u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the ''[[taille]]'' that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as ''[[Compagnie d'ordonnance|compagnies d'ordonnance]]'' on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s,  eventually led to the [[Battle of Castillon|French victory at Castillon]] in 1453, and the conclusion of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the ''grande ordonnance'' and the garrison force known as the ''petite ordonnance''.<ref>Vale, M.G.A. (1992). ''Charles VII''. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries]] and German [[Landsknechts]] fighting for glory, fame and money at the [[Battle of Marignan]] (1515). The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]\n\nFirst [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.\n\nThe [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.\n\nAs late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.\n\nThe newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].\n\nIn many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.\n\nHowever, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.\n\nAs any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).<ref>Mackinnon, Daniel.

However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].\n\nBefore then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.\n\nPrior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or \"gentlemen pensioners\", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by France in 1558).\n\nTroops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.\n\nUntil 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]\u2013[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97 97]|isbn=0-674-02385-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97}}</ref> To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]].

An early example of [[total war]]s.]]\n\n[[Russian tsar]]s before [[Peter the Great|Peter I of Russia]] maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps ([[streltsy]] in Russian) that were highly unreliable and undisciplined. In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.<ref name=blum>Jerome Blum (1971) \"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466</ref> The term of service in the 18th century was for life.

They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.\n\nFrom the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The \"recruits\" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.\n\nChina organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|Indian Army personnel during [[Operation Crusader]] in Egypt, 1941]]\n[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which successfully battled European professional armies.\n\nConscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.\n\nCanada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.\n\nIn developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in Switzerland (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).\n\n==Armies as armed services==\nWestern armies are usually subdivided as follows:\n*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].\n*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.\n*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.\n*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3\u20135 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads. (Terminology is nationality and even unit specific.)<ref name=\"definitions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |title=Subdivisions of the army |accessdate=2007-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116031246/http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |archivedate=2006-11-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Field army==\nA [[field army]] is composed of a headquarters, army [[troops]], a variable number of [[corps]], typically between three and four, and a variable number of [[Division (military)|divisions]], also between three and four. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a general or lieutenant general.\n\n===Formations===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[2nd Armored Division (United States)]] -->\n[[File:Army Nato.svg|thumb|Standard map symbol for a numbered Army, the 'X's are not substituting the army's number]]\n\nA particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).\n\nArmies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], \"Armies\" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized \"[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]\" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s ''Inside the Soviet Army'' describes how [[Cold War]] era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and [[Military deception|deception]] ('maskirovika') reasons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Army aviation]]\n* [[World War I|First world war]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of armies by country]]\n* [[List of numbered armies]]\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Military history]]\n* [[Military organization]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Military]]\n* [[Paramilitary]]\n* [[Soldier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Army|army}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Military branches}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Armies| ]]\n[[Category:Military]]\n", "name_user": "Stratosk2027", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSparta:I just added a bit of history", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army"}

(Attributing, considering, or portraying Allah's knowledge or might to being those of anyone else)\n\nOther interpretations also derived from the [[Quran]] and the prophetic tradition ([[Sunnah]]) divide ''shirk'' into three main categories. ''Shirk'' can be committed by acting against the three different categories.\n\n====Rub\u016bb\u012byah (Lordship)====\nThis category of ''shirk'' refers to either the belief that others share Allah's lordship over creation as his equal or near equal, or to the belief that there exists no lord over creation at all.\n; ''Shirk'' by association: This is the ''shirk'' concerned with associating \"others\" with Allah.\n; ''Shirk'' by negation: This is ''shirk'' in Rub\u016bb\u012byah (Lordship).\n\n====al-Asma wa's-Sifat (names and attributes)====\n''Shirk'' in this category includes both the non-believer practices of giving Allah the attributes of his creation as well as the act of giving created beings Allah's names and attributes.\n; ''Shirk'' by humanization: In this aspect of ''shirk'', Allah is given the form and qualities of human beings and animals. Due to man's superiority over animals, the human form is more commonly used by idolaters to represent Allah in creation.

Due to man's superiority over animals, the human form is more commonly used by idolaters to represent Allah in creation. Consequently, the image of the creator is often painted, moulded or carved in the shape of human beings possessing the physical features of those who worship them.\n; ''Shirk'' by deification: This form of ''shirk'' relates to cases where created beings or things are given or claim Allah's names or his attributes. For example, it was the practice of the ancient Arabs to worship idols whose names were derived from the names of Allah. Their main three idols were; [[Al-l\u0101t]] (taken from Allah's name al-Elah), [[al-'Uzza]] (taken from al-'Aziz), and [[Man\u0101t|al-Manat]] (taken from al-Mannan).

The line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet.\n\nAs well as the usual goods and passenger facilities the station housed the company offices. A single track [[engine shed]] stood at Whitehall, a short distance to the south.{{sfn|Griffiths|Smith|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=278-279, 340 & 344}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westsomersetmineralrailway.org.uk/welcome/sites-to-explore/watchet/ |title=The station and town |website=West Somerset Mineral Railway Project}}</ref>\n\nAll station buildings on the line except {{rws|Gupworthy}} and Watchet were built to a common design. Watchet station was larger and laid out differently, with no obvious \"family resemblance\" to the others.{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=281-285}}\n\n==Services==\nThe stone-built station opened for goods traffic in 1857. A passenger service began in September 1865, connecting Watchet with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried up a [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=6}}\n\nThe initial passenger service consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], their fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two [[Mixed train|mixed trains]] a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Colton mine|Colton mine]] and starting a new bore at [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Timwood tunnel|Timwood]]. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907{{sfn|Scott-Morgan|1980|p=10}} no passenger service was provided. The venture collapsed in March 1910.\n\n==Abandonment==\nAfter closure in 1910 the line was subject to minimal maintenance{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=339-340, 349 & 360}} until its metals were requisitioned for the war effort in 1917.\n\nWith neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}\n\nEvocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=66-67 & 76-77}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nSince closure the station building in Market Street has been converted into a private house complete with part of the platform. In 2016 the former locomotive shed was converted into use as a car repair workshop and the former goods shed stands<ref>{{cite web |url=https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/railway-goods-shed-and-warehouse-in-england/the-railway-goods-shed-and-warehouse.pdf/ |title=Watchet WSMR goods shed |website=Historic England }}</ref> in modern-day use.\n\nIn 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images.

[[West Somerset Mineral Railway]] (WSMR), which was built primarily to carry [[iron ore]] from [[Mining on the Brendon Hills|mines]] to [[Watchet harbour]] in [[Somerset]], England. The line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet.\n\nAs well as the usual goods and passenger facilities the station housed the company offices. A single track [[engine shed]] stood at Whitehall, a short distance to the south.{{sfn|Griffiths|Smith|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=278-279, 340 & 344}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westsomersetmineralrailway.org.uk/welcome/sites-to-explore/watchet/ |title=The station and town |website=West Somerset Mineral Railway Project}}</ref>\n\nAll station buildings on the line except {{rws|Gupworthy}} and Watchet were built to a common design. Watchet station was larger and laid out differently, with no obvious \"family resemblance\" to the others.{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=281-285}}\n\n==Services==\nThe stone-built station opened for goods traffic in 1857. A passenger service began in September 1865, connecting Watchet with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried up a [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=6}}\n\nThe initial passenger service consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], their fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two [[Mixed train|mixed trains]] a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Colton mine|Colton mine]] and starting a new bore at [[Mining on the Brendon Hills#Timwood tunnel|Timwood]]. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907{{sfn|Scott-Morgan|1980|p=10}} no passenger service was provided. The venture collapsed in March 1910.\n\n==Abandonment==\nAfter closure in 1910 the line was subject to minimal maintenance{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=339-340, 349 & 360}} until its metals were requisitioned for the war effort in 1917.\n\nWith neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}\n\nEvocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp.66-67 & 76-77}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nSince closure the station building in Market Street has been converted into a private house complete with part of the platform. In 2016 the former locomotive shed was converted into use as a car repair workshop and the former goods shed stands<ref>{{cite web |url=https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/railway-goods-shed-and-warehouse-in-england/the-railway-goods-shed-and-warehouse.pdf/ |title=Watchet WSMR goods shed |website=Historic England }}</ref> in modern-day use.\n\nIn 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images.

The term ''phreak'' is a [[sensational spelling]] of the word ''[[freak]]'' with the ''ph-'' from ''[[telephone|phone]]'', and may also refer to the use of various audio [[frequencies]] to manipulate a phone system. ''Phreak'', ''phreaker'', or ''phone phreak'' are names used for and by individuals who participate in phreaking.\n\nThe term first referred to groups who had [[reverse engineer]]ed the system of tones used to route long-distance calls. By re-creating these tones, phreaks could switch calls from the phone handset, allowing free calls to be made around the world. To ease the creation of these tones, electronic tone generators known as [[blue box]]es became a staple of the phreaker community, a group of people that included future [[Apple Inc.]] cofounders [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].\n\nThe blue box era came to an end with the ever-increasing use of computerized phone systems, which sent dialing information on a separate, inaccessible channel. By the 1980s, much of the system in the US and Western Europe had been converted. Phreaking has since become closely linked with [[hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sterling |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Sterling |title=[[The Hacker Crackdown]] |origyear=1993 |year=2002 |publisher=IndyPublish.com |location=McLean, Virginia |isbn=1-4043-0641-2 }}</ref> This is sometimes called the H/P culture (with ''H'' standing for ''hacking'' and ''P'' standing for ''phreaking'').{{CN|date=September 2017}}\n\n==History==\nPhone phreaking got its start in the late 1950s in the United States. Its golden age was the late 1960s and early 1970s. Phone phreaks spent a lot of time dialing around the telephone network to understand how the phone system worked, engaging in activities such as listening to the pattern of tones to figure out how calls were routed, reading obscure telephone company technical journals, learning how to impersonate operators and other telephone company personnel, digging through telephone company trash bins to find \"secret\" documents, sneaking into telephone company buildings at night and wiring up their own telephones, building electronic devices called [[Blue box (phreaking)|blue boxes]], [[Black box (phreaking)|black boxes]], and [[Red box (phreaking)|red boxes]] to help them explore the network and make free phone calls, hanging out on early conference call circuits and \"loop arounds\" to communicate with one another and writing their own newsletters to spread information.\n\nBefore 1984, long-distance telephone calls were a premium item in the United States, with strict regulations. In some locations, calling across the street counted as long distance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hung Up Glenpool Has Long-Distance Woes In Making Calls Across the Street |last=Stott |first= Kim |url=http://newsok.com/hung-up-glenpool-has-long-distance-woes-in-making-calls-across-the-street/article/2032985 |work=NewsOK |date=22 July 1983 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref> To report that a phone call was long-distance meant an elevated importance universally accepted because the calling party is paying by the minute to speak to the called party; transact business quickly.\n\nPhreaking consists of techniques to evade long-distance charges. This evasion is illegal; the crime is called \"toll fraud\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bizfon.com/pdfs/tollfraud.pdf |title= Notice to our customers regarding Toll Fraud |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher= BizFon |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref> In 1990, the [[pager cloning]] technique arose and was used by [[law enforcement]].<ref name=\"Castellano2017\">{{cite book|author=John M. Castellano|title=Prosecutor's Manual for Arrest, Search and Seizure, Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvEACwAAQBAJ&pg=PT13466&dq=pager+cloning+arrest|date=15 September 2017|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-1-63284-068-4|page=1346}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK the situation was rather different due to the difference in technology between the American and British systems, the main difference being the absence of tone dialing and signalling, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe tone system in the United States has been almost entirely replaced, but in some countries, in addition to new systems, the tone system is still available, for example in Italy.\n\n===Switch hook and tone dialer===\nPossibly one of the first phreaking methods was switch-hooking, which allows placing calls from a phone where the rotary dial or keypad has been disabled by a key lock or other means to prevent unauthorized calls from that phone. It is done by rapidly pressing and releasing the switch hook to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial. Even most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware.<ref>{{cite web|author=SoftCab |url=http://www.modemspy.com/pulse_dialling.modem |title=Phone Call Recorder |publisher=Modemspy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref>\n\nBy rapidly clicking the hook for a variable number of times at roughly 5 to 10 clicks per second, separated by intervals of roughly one second, the caller can dial numbers as if they were using the rotary dial. The pulse counter in the exchange counts the pulses or clicks and interprets them in two possible ways. Depending on continent and country, one click with a following interval can be either \"one\" or \"zero\" and subsequent clicks before the interval are additively counted. This renders ten consecutive clicks being either \"zero\" or \"nine\", respectively. Some exchanges allow using additional clicks for special controls, but numbers 0-9 now fall in one of these two standards. One special code, \"flash\", is a very short single click, possible but hard to simulate. Back in the day of rotary dial, very often technically identical phone sets were marketed in multiple areas of the world, only with plugs matched by country and the dials being bezeled with the local standard numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSuch key-locked telephones, if wired to a modern [[DTMF]] capable exchange, can also be exploited by a tone dialer that generates the DTMF tones used by modern keypad units. These signals are now very uniformly standardized worldwide. It is notable that the two methods can be combined: Even if the exchange does not support DTMF, the key lock can be circumvented by switch-hooking, and the tone dialer can be then used to operate automated DTMF controlled services that can't be used with rotary dial.\n\n=== UK network ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nBecause the UK network was run by the Post Office was reliant on [[Strowger switch]]es, the techniques used in the UK were different. The exchanges worked on pulses received from each subscriber's phone, so tone signaling was of no use. The techniques primarily relied on the quirks of the exchange wiring, or facilities put in by the engineering staff. Some typical tricks used between the 1950s and 1970s included:\n\n;9-1-11: By dialing an exchange local to the caller's phone (preferably a call box phone), dialing 9-1-10 then at the right moment tapping the phone rest to add an extra pulse, this could give irregular [[Subscriber Trunk Dialling]] (STD) access.\n\nSometimes it was possible to find a nearby local exchange which when the caller dialed the local code, then added 0, they would get free STD access. For those in the know{{vague|date=March 2017}}, it was possible to modify the Post Office phone (preferably the 700 series) by fitting a suitable diode and push button. This allowed one to receive a call but prevent the charging relay from operating, hence not charging the calling party. The drawbacks were that the caller only got 5 or 6 minutes before the system would drop the call thinking it had not been completed. It was also advisable to contact the recipient to ensure he was expecting the caller before making the call.\n\nSome other techniques were deliberately put in by exchange staff, the most popular being the use of an unused number. When the number was dialed the \"number unobtainable\" tone would be returned, but after a minute or two it would clear and give STD access.\nOther techniques were used but the technicians involved always had to be wary of the Post Office Special Investigation Branch.\n\nAs the UK network phased out Strowger and moved over to System \"X\" these practices vanished.\n\n===2600 hertz===\n{{Main article|2600 hertz}}The origins of phone phreaking trace back at least to [[Bell System#Nationwide Monopoly|AT&T]]'s implementation of fully automatic [[telephone switches|switches]]. These switches used [[tone dialing]], a form of [[in-band signaling]], and included some tones which were for internal telephone company use.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} One internal-use tone is a tone of [[2600 Hz]] which causes a telephone switch to think the call had ended, leaving an open carrier line, which can be exploited to provide free long-distance, and international calls.  At that time, long-distance calls were more expensive.<ref name=\"robson\"/><!-- Sterling also has a description of this somewhere -->\n\nThe tone was discovered in approximately 1957,<ref name=\"robson\">{{cite web|url=https://garydrobson.com/2014/06/03/the-origins-of-phreaking/ |first=Gary D. |last=Robson |publisher=Blacklisted! 411 |date=April 2004 |title=The Origins of Phreaking}}</ref> by [[Joybubbles|Joe Engressia]], a blind seven-year-old boy. Engressia had [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]], and discovered that whistling the [[piano key frequencies|fourth E above middle C]] (a frequency of 2637.02&nbsp;Hz) would stop a dialed phone recording. Unaware of what he had done, Engressia called the phone-company and asked why the recordings had stopped. Joe Engressia is considered to be the father of phreaking.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://delontin1.wordpress.com/tag/hacking/| title=COMPLETE HISTORY OF HACKING| last1=DELON| date=February 27, 2008| website=Hacking &#124; LEMNISCATE| accessdate= 2014-12-25}}</ref>\n\nOther early phreaks, such as \"Bill from New York\" (William \"Bill\" Acker 1953-2015), began to develop a rudimentary understanding of how phone networks worked. Bill discovered that a [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] he owned could also play the tone at 2600&nbsp;Hz with the same effect. [[John Draper]] discovered through his friendship with Engressia that the free whistles given out in [[Cap'n Crunch]] cereal boxes also produced a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone when blown (providing his nickname, \"Captain Crunch\"). This allows control of phone systems that work on [[Single-frequency signaling|single frequency]] (SF) controls. One can sound a long whistle to reset the line, followed by groups of whistles (a short tone for a \"1\", two for a \"2\", etc.) to dial numbers.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapsley | first = Phil | title = Exploding the Phone: The Untold Story of the Teenagers and Outlaws who Hacked Ma Bell | publisher = Grove/Atlantic, corporated \n | date = 2013-11-02  | location = New York | isbn =  080212061X}}</ref>\n\n===Multi frequency===\n{{Main|Multi-frequency}}\n\nWhile single-frequency worked on certain phone routes, the most common signaling on the then long-distance network was [[multi-frequency]] (MF) controls. The slang term for these tones and their use was \"Marty Freeman.\" The specific frequencies required were unknown to the general public until 1954, when the [[Bell System]] published the information in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in an article describing the methods and frequencies used for inter-office signalling. The journal was intended for the company's engineers; however, it found its way to various college campuses across the United States. With this one article, the Bell System accidentally gave away the \"keys to the kingdom,\" and the intricacies of the phone system were at the disposal of people with a knowledge of electronics.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Bell System Technical Journal |date=September 1964 |volume=43 |issue=5 |url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol43-1964/bstj-vol43-issue05.html |accessdate=24 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314023659/http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol43-1964/bstj-vol43-issue05.html |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |title=Bell System Technical Journal, v43: i5 September 1964}}</ref>\n\nThe second generation of phreaks arose at this time, including the [[New York City|New York]]ers \"Evan Doorbell\", \"Ben Decibel\" and Neil R. Bell and [[California]]ns Mark Bernay, Chris Bernay, and \"Alan from Canada\". Each conducted their own independent exploration and experimentation of the telephone network, initially on an individual basis, and later within groups as they discovered each other in their travels. \"Evan Doorbell,\" \"Ben\" and \"Neil\" formed a group of phreaks, known as Group Bell. Mark Bernay initiated a similar group named the Mark Bernay Society. Both Mark and Evan received fame amongst today's phone phreakers for Internet publication of their collection of telephone exploration recordings. These recordings, conducted in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s are available at Mark's website ''Phone Trips.''<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wideweb.com/phonetrips |title = Phone Trips |accessdate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Blue boxes===\n[[File:Blue Box at the Powerhouse Museum.jpg|thumbnail|Blue Box]]\n{{Main|Blue box}}\n\nIn October 1971, phreaking was introduced to the masses when [[Esquire Magazine]] published a story called \"Secrets of the Little Blue Box\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenbaum |first=Ron |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_spectator/2011/10/the_article_that_inspired_steve_jobs_secrets_of_the_little_blue_.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103003732/http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_spectator/2011/10/the_article_that_inspired_steve_jobs_secrets_of_the_little_blue_.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |title=The article that inspired Steve Jobs: \"Secrets of the Little Blue Box\" |publisher=Slate.com |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lospadres.info/thorg/lbb.html |title = Secrets of the Little Blue Box |accessdate = 2010-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_spectator/2011/10/steve_jobs_and_the_little_blue_box_how_ron_rosenbaum_s_1971_arti.html |title = Steve Jobs and Me: He said my 1971 article inspired him.

These BBSes became popular for computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] and others interested in the technology, and served as a medium for previously scattered independent phone phreaks to share their discoveries and experiments. This not only led to unprecedented collaboration between phone phreaks, but also spread the notion of phreaking to others who took it upon themselves to study, experiment with, or exploit the telephone system. This was also at a time when the telephone company was a popular subject of discussion in the US, as the [[monopoly]] of [[AT&T Corporation]] was forced into divestiture. During this time, exploration of telephone networks diminished, and phreaking focused more on toll fraud. Computer hackers began to use phreaking methods to find the telephone numbers for modems belonging to businesses, which they could exploit later. Groups then formed around the BBS hacker/phreaking (H/P) community such as the famous [[Masters of Deception]] ([[Phiber Optik]]) and [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]] ([[Erik Bloodaxe (hacker)|Erik Bloodaxe]]) groups. In 1985, an underground e-zine called [[Phrack]] (a combination of the words Phreak and Hack) began circulation among BBSes, and focused on hacking, phreaking, and other related technological subjects.\n\nIn the early 1990s, H/P groups like Masters of Deception and Legion of Doom were shut down by the [[US Secret Service]]'s [[Operation Sundevil]]. Phreaking as a subculture saw a brief dispersion in fear of criminal prosecution in the 1990s, before the popularity of the [[internet]] initiated a reemergence of phreaking as a subculture in the US and spread phreaking to international levels.\n\nInto the turn of the 21st century, phreaks began to focus on the exploration and playing with the network, and the concept of toll fraud became widely frowned on among serious phreakers, primarily under the influence of the website Phone Trips, put up by second generation phreaks [[Isaac_Kashdan#Family|Mark Bernay]] and [[Evan Doorbell]].{{Relevance inline|discuss=Self promotion?|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Toll fraud===\nThe [[Bell System divestiture|1984 AT&T breakup]] gave rise to many small companies intent upon competing in the long-distance market. These included the then-fledgling [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] and [[MCI Inc.|MCI]], both of whom had only recently entered the marketplace. At the time, there was no way to switch a phone line to have calls automatically carried by non-AT&T companies. Customers of these small long-distance operations would be required to dial a local access number, enter their calling card number, and finally enter the area code and phone number they wish to call. Because of the relatively lengthy process for customers to complete a call, the companies kept the calling card numbers short \u2013 usually 6 or 7 digits. This opened up a huge vulnerability to phone phreaks with a computer.\n\n6-digit calling card numbers only offer 1 million combinations. 7-digit numbers offer just 10 million. If a company had 10,000 customers, a person attempting to \"guess\" a card number would have a good chance of doing so correctly once every 100 tries for a 6-digit card and once every 1000 tries for a 7-digit card. While this is almost easy enough for people to do manually, computers made the task far easier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0306/S00026.htm |title=W32.Bugbear.B Worm Identified As Targeting Banks &#124; Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=2003-06-09 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Angela Moscaritolo |url=http://www.scmagazine.com/att-sues-two-over-scheme-to-steal-customer-data/article/209763/ |title=AT&T sues two over scheme to steal customer data |publisher=SC Magazine |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref> \"Code hack\" programs were developed for computers with modems. The modems would dial the long-distance access number, enter a random calling card number (of the proper number of digits), and attempt to complete a call to a computer bulletin board system (BBS). If the computer connected successfully to the BBS, it proved that it had found a working card number, and it saved that number to disk. If it did not connect to the BBS in a specified amount of time (usually 30 or 60 seconds), it would hang up and try a different code. Using this method, code hacking programs would turn up hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of working calling card numbers per day. These would subsequently be shared amongst fellow phreakers.\n\nThere was no way for these small phone companies to identify the culprits of these hacks. They had no access to local phone company records of calls into their access numbers, and even if they had access, obtaining such records would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. While there was some advancement in tracking down these code hackers in the early 1990s, the problem did not completely disappear until most long-distance companies were able to offer standard 1+ dialing without the use of an access number.\n\n===Diverters===\n\nAnother method of obtaining free phone calls involves the use of so-called \"diverters\". Call forwarding was not an available feature for many business phone lines in the late 1980s and early 1990s, so they were forced to buy equipment that could do the job manually between two phone lines. When the business would close, they would program the call diverting equipment to answer all calls, pick up another phone line, call their answering service, and bridge the two lines together. This gave the appearance to the caller that they were directly forwarded to the company's answering service.  The switching equipment would typically reset the line after the call had hung up and timed out back to dial tone, so the caller could simply wait after the answering service had disconnected, and would eventually get a usable dial tone from the second line. Phreakers recognized the opportunity this provided, and they would spend hours manually dialing businesses after hours, attempting to identify faulty diverters. Once a phreaker had access to one of these lines, they could use it for one of many purposes. In addition to completing phone calls anywhere in the world at the businesses' expense, they could also dial [[1-900]] phone sex/entertainment numbers, as well as use the phone line to harass their enemies without fear of being traced. Victimized small businesses were usually required to foot the bill for the long-distance calls, as it was their own private equipment (not phone company security flaws) that allowed such fraud to occur. By 1993, call forwarding was offered to nearly every business line subscriber, making these diverters obsolete. As a result, hackers stopped searching for the few remaining ones, and this method of toll fraud died. Many (different type) of diverters still exist and are actively \"phreaked\" in the United States as of 2020, It is rare to find a diverter solely used for Answering Service forwarding anymore, But the many other types such as phone-company test numbers and remote PBX DISAs are still used as diverters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Voice mail boxes and bridges===\nBefore the BBS era of the 1980s phone phreaking was more of a solitary venture as it was difficult for phreaks to connect with one another.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to communicating over BBSs phone phreaks discover [[voice mail]] boxes and [[Party line (telephony)|party lines]] as ways to network and keep in touch over the telephone. They usually appropriate unused boxes that are part of business or cellular phone systems. Once a vulnerable mailbox system is discovered, word would spread around the phreak community, and scores of them would take residence on the system. They use these systems as a [[dead drop|\"home base\"]] for communication with one another until the rightful owners would discover the intrusion and wipe them off. Voice mailboxes also provide a safe phone number for phreaks to give out to one another as home phone numbers and personal cellular numbers would allow the phreak's identity (and home address) to be discovered. This is especially important given that phone phreaks are breaking the law.\n\nPhreakers also use \"bridges\" to communicate live with one another. The term \"bridge\" originally referred to a group of telephone company test lines that were bridged together giving the effect of a party-line. Eventually, all party-lines, whether bridges or not, came to be known as bridges if primarily populated by hackers and/or phreakers.\n\nThe popularity of the Internet in the mid-1990s, along with the better awareness of voice mail by business and cell phone owners, made the practice of stealing voice mailboxes less popular. To this day bridges are still very popular with phreakers yet, with the advent of VoIP, the use of telephone company owned bridges has decreased slightly in favor of phreaker-owned conferences.\n\n===Cell phones===\n\nBy the late 1990s, the fraudulent aspect of phreaking all but vanished. Most [[cellular phones]] offered unlimited domestic long-distance calling for the price of standard airtime (often totally unlimited on weekends), and flat-rate long-distance plans appeared offering unlimited home phone long-distance for as little as $25 per month. Rates for international calls had also decreased significantly. Between the much higher risk of being caught (due to advances in technology) and the much lower gain of making free phone calls, toll fraud started to become a concept associated very little with phreaking.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\n===End of multi-frequency in the U.S.===\nThe end of [[multi-frequency]] (MF) phreaking in the lower 48 United States occurred on June 15, 2006, when the last exchange in the contiguous [[United States]] to use a \"phreakable\" MF-signalled trunk replaced the aging (yet still well kept) [[N-carrier|N2 carrier]] with a [[T-carrier|T1 carrier]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This exchange, located in [[Wawina Township, Minnesota]], was run by the [[Northern Telephone Company of Minnesota]].\n\n==2600 Hz==\n{{Listen|filename=2600 Hz.ogg|title=2600 Hz|description=A 2600 Hz sine wave tone|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nIn the original analog networks, short-distance telephone calls were completed by sending relatively high-power electrical signals through the wires to the [[end office]], which then switched the call. This technique could not be used for long-distance connections, because the signals would be filtered out due to [[capacitance]] in the wires. Long-distance switching remained a manual operation years after short-distance calls were automated, requiring operators at either end of the line to set up the connections.\n\nBell automated this process by sending \"in-band\" signals. Since the one thing the long-distance trunks were definitely able to do was send voice-frequency signals, the Bell System used a selection of tones sent over the trunks to control the system. When calling long-distance, the local end-office switch would first route the call to a special switch which would then convert further dialing into tones and send them over an appropriately selected trunk line (selected with the area code). A similar machine at the far end of the trunk would decode the tones back into electrical signals, and the call would complete as normal.\n\nIn addition to dialing instructions, the system also included a number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600&nbsp;Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the [[frequency]] of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user had gone [[on-hook]] (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the remote switch also going on-hook, freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. If the tone was sent manually by the local user into the phone line, it would trigger the remote switch to go on-hook, but critically, the ''local'' switch knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically, not by the tone (which their local switch ignored). The system was now in an inconsistent state, leaving the local user connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the ''phreaks'' learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the remote switch.\n\nNormally, long-distance calls were billed locally. Since the \"trick\" required a long-distance call to be placed in order to connect to the remote switch, it would be billed as usual. However, there were some types of calls that had either no billing, like calls to directory service, or for which the billing was reversed or billed to another number, like [[Wide Area Telephone Service|WATS]] lines (area code 800 numbers). By dialing one of these \"toll-free\" numbers, the caller was connected to a remote switch as normal, but no billing record was made locally. The caller would then play the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone into the line to return the remote switch to on-hook, and then use a [[blue box]] to dial the number to which they really wanted to connect. The local Bell office would have no record of the call.\n\nAs knowledge of phreaking spread, a minor culture emerged from the increasing number of phone phreaks. Sympathetic (or easily [[Social engineering (computer security)|social-engineered]]) telephone company employees were persuaded to reveal the various routing codes to use international satellites and trunk lines. At the time it was felt that there was nothing Bell could do to stop this. Their entire network was based on this system, so changing the system in order to stop the phreakers would require a massive infrastructure upgrade.\n\nIn fact, Bell responded fairly quickly, but in a more targeted fashion. Looking on local records for inordinately long calls to directory service or other hints that phreakers were using a particular switch, filters could then be installed to block efforts at that end office. Many phreakers were forced to use pay telephones as the telephone company technicians regularly tracked long-distance toll free calls in an elaborate cat-and-mouse game. AT&T instead turned to the law for help, and a number of phreaks were caught by the government.\n\nEventually, the phone companies in North America did, in fact, replace all their hardware. They didn't do it to stop the phreaks{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}, but simply as a matter of course while moving to fully digital switching systems. Unlike the crossbar switch, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate signaling lines which phreaks could not access. This system is known as [[Common Channel Signaling|Common Channel Interoffice Signaling]]. Classic phreaking with the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s, MF Signalling is still used on various parts of the U.S. Network but is almost always out-of-band.\n\nThe last 2600&nbsp;Hz-controlled trunk in the contiguous United States was operated by the independent [[Northern Telephone Company of Minnesota|Northern Telephone Company]] with an [[N-carrier|N2 Carrier]] system serving [[Wawina, Minnesota]] until June 15, 2006, when it was replaced by [[T-carrier|T1 carrier]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phworld.org/sounds/wawina/ |title=Telephone World - Sounds & Recordings from Wawina, MN |publisher=Phworld.org |accessdate=2013-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064451/http://www.phworld.org/sounds/wawina/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref>  The last 2600&nbsp;Hz-controlled trunks in North America were located in [[Livengood, Alaska]], survived another 5 years, and were finally retired in March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.binrev.com/forums/index.php/topic/44301-the-death-of-livengood/ |title=The death of Livengood - Old Skool Phreaking - Binary Revolution Forums |publisher=Binrev.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{In popular culture|date=March 2018}}\n*In the movie ''[[WarGames]]'' (1983), a young hacker, David Lightman (Matthew Broderick), uses a pull-tab from an aluminum can, found on the ground at a truck stop, to make a free long-distance call via payphone to his friend (Ally Sheedy). \n*In the movie ''[[The Core]]'', the hacker known as \"Rat\" uses phreaking to give Doctor Josh Keyes unlimited long-distance for life to prove his skills.\n*In the ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' episode ''Aletheia'', main character [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] uses phreaking to call someone in [[Paris]] in 1979 as a prank.

The term ''phreak'' is a [[sensational spelling]] of the word ''[[freak]]'' with the ''ph-'' from ''[[telephone|phone]]'', and may also refer to the use of various audio [[frequencies]] to manipulate a phone system. ''Phreak'', ''phreaker'', or ''phone phreak'' are names used for and by individuals who participate in phreaking.\n\nThe term first referred to groups who had [[reverse engineer]]ed the system of tones used to route long-distance calls. By re-creating these tones, phreaks could switch calls from the phone handset, allowing free calls to be made around the world. To ease the creation of these tones, electronic tone generators known as [[blue box]]es became a staple of the phreaker community, a group of people that included future [[Apple Inc.]] cofounders [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].\n\nThe blue box era came to an end with the ever-increasing use of computerized phone systems, which sent dialing information on a separate, inaccessible channel. By the 1980s, much of the system in the US and Western Europe had been converted. Phreaking has since become closely linked with [[hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sterling |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Sterling |title=[[The Hacker Crackdown]] |origyear=1993 |year=2002 |publisher=IndyPublish.com |location=McLean, Virginia |isbn=1-4043-0641-2 }}</ref> This is sometimes called the H/P culture (with ''H'' standing for ''hacking'' and ''P'' standing for ''phreaking'').{{CN|date=September 2017}}\n\n==History==\nPhone phreaking got its start in the late 1950s in the United States. Its golden age was the late 1960s and early 1970s. Phone phreaks spent a lot of time dialing around the telephone network to understand how the phone system worked, engaging in activities such as listening to the pattern of tones to figure out how calls were routed, reading obscure telephone company technical journals, learning how to impersonate operators and other telephone company personnel, digging through telephone company trash bins to find \"secret\" documents, sneaking into telephone company buildings at night and wiring up their own telephones, building electronic devices called [[Blue box (phreaking)|blue boxes]], [[Black box (phreaking)|black boxes]], and [[Red box (phreaking)|red boxes]] to help them explore the network and make free phone calls, hanging out on early conference call circuits and \"loop arounds\" to communicate with one another and writing their own newsletters to spread information.\n\nBefore 1984, long-distance telephone calls were a premium item in the United States, with strict regulations. In some locations, calling across the street counted as long distance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hung Up Glenpool Has Long-Distance Woes In Making Calls Across the Street |last=Stott |first= Kim |url=http://newsok.com/hung-up-glenpool-has-long-distance-woes-in-making-calls-across-the-street/article/2032985 |work=NewsOK |date=22 July 1983 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref> To report that a phone call was long-distance meant an elevated importance universally accepted because the calling party is paying by the minute to speak to the called party; transact business quickly.\n\nPhreaking consists of techniques to evade long-distance charges.

It is done by rapidly pressing and releasing the switch hook to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial. Even most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware.<ref>{{cite web|author=SoftCab |url=http://www.modemspy.com/pulse_dialling.modem |title=Phone Call Recorder |publisher=Modemspy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref>\n\nBy rapidly clicking the hook for a variable number of times at roughly 5 to 10 clicks per second, separated by intervals of roughly one second, the caller can dial numbers as if they were using the rotary dial. The pulse counter in the exchange counts the pulses or clicks and interprets them in two possible ways. Depending on continent and country, one click with a following interval can be either \"one\" or \"zero\" and subsequent clicks before the interval are additively counted. This renders ten consecutive clicks being either \"zero\" or \"nine\", respectively. Some exchanges allow using additional clicks for special controls, but numbers 0-9 now fall in one of these two standards. One special code, \"flash\", is a very short single click, possible but hard to simulate. Back in the day of rotary dial, very often technically identical phone sets were marketed in multiple areas of the world, only with plugs matched by country and the dials being bezeled with the local standard numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSuch key-locked telephones, if wired to a modern [[DTMF]] capable exchange, can also be exploited by a tone dialer that generates the DTMF tones used by modern keypad units. These signals are now very uniformly standardized worldwide. It is notable that the two methods can be combined: Even if the exchange does not support DTMF, the key lock can be circumvented by switch-hooking, and the tone dialer can be then used to operate automated DTMF controlled services that can't be used with rotary dial.\n\n=== UK network ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nBecause the UK network was run by the Post Office was reliant on [[Strowger switch]]es, the techniques used in the UK were different. The exchanges worked on pulses received from each subscriber's phone, so tone signaling was of no use. The techniques primarily relied on the quirks of the exchange wiring, or facilities put in by the engineering staff. Some typical tricks used between the 1950s and 1970s included:\n\n;9-1-11: By dialing an exchange local to the caller's phone (preferably a call box phone), dialing 9-1-10 then at the right moment tapping the phone rest to add an extra pulse, this could give irregular [[Subscriber Trunk Dialling]] (STD) access.\n\nSometimes it was possible to find a nearby local exchange which when the caller dialed the local code, then added 0, they would get free STD access. For those in the know{{vague|date=March 2017}}, it was possible to modify the Post Office phone (preferably the 700 series) by fitting a suitable diode and push button. This allowed one to receive a call but prevent the charging relay from operating, hence not charging the calling party. The drawbacks were that the caller only got 5 or 6 minutes before the system would drop the call thinking it had not been completed. It was also advisable to contact the recipient to ensure he was expecting the caller before making the call.\n\nSome other techniques were deliberately put in by exchange staff, the most popular being the use of an unused number. When the number was dialed the \"number unobtainable\" tone would be returned, but after a minute or two it would clear and give STD access.\nOther techniques were used but the technicians involved always had to be wary of the Post Office Special Investigation Branch.\n\nAs the UK network phased out Strowger and moved over to System \"X\" these practices vanished.\n\n===2600 hertz===\n{{Main article|2600 hertz}}The origins of phone phreaking trace back at least to [[Bell System#Nationwide Monopoly|AT&T]]'s implementation of fully automatic [[telephone switches|switches]]. These switches used [[tone dialing]], a form of [[in-band signaling]], and included some tones which were for internal telephone company use.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} One internal-use tone is a tone of [[2600 Hz]] which causes a telephone switch to think the call had ended, leaving an open carrier line, which can be exploited to provide free long-distance, and international calls.

The journal was intended for the company's engineers; however, it found its way to various college campuses across the United States.

These BBSes became popular for computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] and others interested in the technology, and served as a medium for previously scattered independent phone phreaks to share their discoveries and experiments. This not only led to unprecedented collaboration between phone phreaks, but also spread the notion of phreaking to others who took it upon themselves to study, experiment with, or exploit the telephone system. This was also at a time when the telephone company was a popular subject of discussion in the US, as the [[monopoly]] of [[AT&T Corporation]] was forced into divestiture. During this time, exploration of telephone networks diminished, and phreaking focused more on toll fraud. Computer hackers began to use phreaking methods to find the telephone numbers for modems belonging to businesses, which they could exploit later. Groups then formed around the BBS hacker/phreaking (H/P) community such as the famous [[Masters of Deception]] ([[Phiber Optik]]) and [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]] ([[Erik Bloodaxe (hacker)|Erik Bloodaxe]]) groups. In 1985, an underground e-zine called [[Phrack]] (a combination of the words Phreak and Hack) began circulation among BBSes, and focused on hacking, phreaking, and other related technological subjects.\n\nIn the early 1990s, H/P groups like Masters of Deception and Legion of Doom were shut down by the [[US Secret Service]]'s [[Operation Sundevil]]. Phreaking as a subculture saw a brief dispersion in fear of criminal prosecution in the 1990s, before the popularity of the [[internet]] initiated a reemergence of phreaking as a subculture in the US and spread phreaking to international levels.\n\nInto the turn of the 21st century, phreaks began to focus on the exploration and playing with the network, and the concept of toll fraud became widely frowned on among serious phreakers, primarily under the influence of the website Phone Trips, put up by second generation phreaks [[Isaac_Kashdan#Family|Mark Bernay]] and [[Evan Doorbell]].{{Relevance inline|discuss=Self promotion?|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Toll fraud===\nThe [[Bell System divestiture|1984 AT&T breakup]] gave rise to many small companies intent upon competing in the long-distance market. These included the then-fledgling [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] and [[MCI Inc.|MCI]], both of whom had only recently entered the marketplace. At the time, there was no way to switch a phone line to have calls automatically carried by non-AT&T companies. Customers of these small long-distance operations would be required to dial a local access number, enter their calling card number, and finally enter the area code and phone number they wish to call. Because of the relatively lengthy process for customers to complete a call, the companies kept the calling card numbers short \u2013 usually 6 or 7 digits. This opened up a huge vulnerability to phone phreaks with a computer.\n\n6-digit calling card numbers only offer 1 million combinations. 7-digit numbers offer just 10 million. If a company had 10,000 customers, a person attempting to \"guess\" a card number would have a good chance of doing so correctly once every 100 tries for a 6-digit card and once every 1000 tries for a 7-digit card. While this is almost easy enough for people to do manually, computers made the task far easier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0306/S00026.htm |title=W32.Bugbear.B Worm Identified As Targeting Banks &#124; Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=2003-06-09 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Angela Moscaritolo |url=http://www.scmagazine.com/att-sues-two-over-scheme-to-steal-customer-data/article/209763/ |title=AT&T sues two over scheme to steal customer data |publisher=SC Magazine |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref> \"Code hack\" programs were developed for computers with modems. The modems would dial the long-distance access number, enter a random calling card number (of the proper number of digits), and attempt to complete a call to a computer bulletin board system (BBS). If the computer connected successfully to the BBS, it proved that it had found a working card number, and it saved that number to disk. If it did not connect to the BBS in a specified amount of time (usually 30 or 60 seconds), it would hang up and try a different code. Using this method, code hacking programs would turn up hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of working calling card numbers per day. These would subsequently be shared amongst fellow phreakers.\n\nThere was no way for these small phone companies to identify the culprits of these hacks. They had no access to local phone company records of calls into their access numbers, and even if they had access, obtaining such records would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. While there was some advancement in tracking down these code hackers in the early 1990s, the problem did not completely disappear until most long-distance companies were able to offer standard 1+ dialing without the use of an access number.\n\n===Diverters===\n\nAnother method of obtaining free phone calls involves the use of so-called \"diverters\". Call forwarding was not an available feature for many business phone lines in the late 1980s and early 1990s, so they were forced to buy equipment that could do the job manually between two phone lines. When the business would close, they would program the call diverting equipment to answer all calls, pick up another phone line, call their answering service, and bridge the two lines together. This gave the appearance to the caller that they were directly forwarded to the company's answering service.  The switching equipment would typically reset the line after the call had hung up and timed out back to dial tone, so the caller could simply wait after the answering service had disconnected, and would eventually get a usable dial tone from the second line. Phreakers recognized the opportunity this provided, and they would spend hours manually dialing businesses after hours, attempting to identify faulty diverters. Once a phreaker had access to one of these lines, they could use it for one of many purposes. In addition to completing phone calls anywhere in the world at the businesses' expense, they could also dial [[1-900]] phone sex/entertainment numbers, as well as use the phone line to harass their enemies without fear of being traced. Victimized small businesses were usually required to foot the bill for the long-distance calls, as it was their own private equipment (not phone company security flaws) that allowed such fraud to occur. By 1993, call forwarding was offered to nearly every business line subscriber, making these diverters obsolete. As a result, hackers stopped searching for the few remaining ones, and this method of toll fraud died. Many (different type) of diverters still exist and are actively \"phreaked\" in the United States as of 2020, It is rare to find a diverter solely used for Answering Service forwarding anymore, But the many other types such as phone-company test numbers and remote PBX DISAs are still used as diverters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Voice mail boxes and bridges===\nBefore the BBS era of the 1980s phone phreaking was more of a solitary venture as it was difficult for phreaks to connect with one another.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to communicating over BBSs phone phreaks discover [[voice mail]] boxes and [[Party line (telephony)|party lines]] as ways to network and keep in touch over the telephone. They usually appropriate unused boxes that are part of business or cellular phone systems. Once a vulnerable mailbox system is discovered, word would spread around the phreak community, and scores of them would take residence on the system. They use these systems as a [[dead drop|\"home base\"]] for communication with one another until the rightful owners would discover the intrusion and wipe them off. Voice mailboxes also provide a safe phone number for phreaks to give out to one another as home phone numbers and personal cellular numbers would allow the phreak's identity (and home address) to be discovered. This is especially important given that phone phreaks are breaking the law.\n\nPhreakers also use \"bridges\" to communicate live with one another. The term \"bridge\" originally referred to a group of telephone company test lines that were bridged together giving the effect of a party-line. Eventually, all party-lines, whether bridges or not, came to be known as bridges if primarily populated by hackers and/or phreakers.\n\nThe popularity of the Internet in the mid-1990s, along with the better awareness of voice mail by business and cell phone owners, made the practice of stealing voice mailboxes less popular. To this day bridges are still very popular with phreakers yet, with the advent of VoIP, the use of telephone company owned bridges has decreased slightly in favor of phreaker-owned conferences.\n\n===Cell phones===\n\nBy the late 1990s, the fraudulent aspect of phreaking all but vanished. Most [[cellular phones]] offered unlimited domestic long-distance calling for the price of standard airtime (often totally unlimited on weekends), and flat-rate long-distance plans appeared offering unlimited home phone long-distance for as little as $25 per month. Rates for international calls had also decreased significantly. Between the much higher risk of being caught (due to advances in technology) and the much lower gain of making free phone calls, toll fraud started to become a concept associated very little with phreaking.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\n===End of multi-frequency in the U.S.===\nThe end of [[multi-frequency]] (MF) phreaking in the lower 48 United States occurred on June 15, 2006, when the last exchange in the contiguous [[United States]] to use a \"phreakable\" MF-signalled trunk replaced the aging (yet still well kept) [[N-carrier|N2 carrier]] with a [[T-carrier|T1 carrier]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This exchange, located in [[Wawina Township, Minnesota]], was run by the [[Northern Telephone Company of Minnesota]].\n\n==2600 Hz==\n{{Listen|filename=2600 Hz.ogg|title=2600 Hz|description=A 2600 Hz sine wave tone|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nIn the original analog networks, short-distance telephone calls were completed by sending relatively high-power electrical signals through the wires to the [[end office]], which then switched the call. This technique could not be used for long-distance connections, because the signals would be filtered out due to [[capacitance]] in the wires. Long-distance switching remained a manual operation years after short-distance calls were automated, requiring operators at either end of the line to set up the connections.\n\nBell automated this process by sending \"in-band\" signals. Since the one thing the long-distance trunks were definitely able to do was send voice-frequency signals, the Bell System used a selection of tones sent over the trunks to control the system. When calling long-distance, the local end-office switch would first route the call to a special switch which would then convert further dialing into tones and send them over an appropriately selected trunk line (selected with the area code). A similar machine at the far end of the trunk would decode the tones back into electrical signals, and the call would complete as normal.\n\nIn addition to dialing instructions, the system also included a number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600&nbsp;Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the [[frequency]] of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user had gone [[on-hook]] (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the remote switch also going on-hook, freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. If the tone was sent manually by the local user into the phone line, it would trigger the remote switch to go on-hook, but critically, the ''local'' switch knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically, not by the tone (which their local switch ignored). The system was now in an inconsistent state, leaving the local user connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the ''phreaks'' learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the remote switch.\n\nNormally, long-distance calls were billed locally. Since the \"trick\" required a long-distance call to be placed in order to connect to the remote switch, it would be billed as usual. However, there were some types of calls that had either no billing, like calls to directory service, or for which the billing was reversed or billed to another number, like [[Wide Area Telephone Service|WATS]] lines (area code 800 numbers). By dialing one of these \"toll-free\" numbers, the caller was connected to a remote switch as normal, but no billing record was made locally. The caller would then play the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone into the line to return the remote switch to on-hook, and then use a [[blue box]] to dial the number to which they really wanted to connect. The local Bell office would have no record of the call.\n\nAs knowledge of phreaking spread, a minor culture emerged from the increasing number of phone phreaks. Sympathetic (or easily [[Social engineering (computer security)|social-engineered]]) telephone company employees were persuaded to reveal the various routing codes to use international satellites and trunk lines. At the time it was felt that there was nothing Bell could do to stop this. Their entire network was based on this system, so changing the system in order to stop the phreakers would require a massive infrastructure upgrade.\n\nIn fact, Bell responded fairly quickly, but in a more targeted fashion. Looking on local records for inordinately long calls to directory service or other hints that phreakers were using a particular switch, filters could then be installed to block efforts at that end office. Many phreakers were forced to use pay telephones as the telephone company technicians regularly tracked long-distance toll free calls in an elaborate cat-and-mouse game. AT&T instead turned to the law for help, and a number of phreaks were caught by the government.\n\nEventually, the phone companies in North America did, in fact, replace all their hardware. They didn't do it to stop the phreaks{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}, but simply as a matter of course while moving to fully digital switching systems. Unlike the crossbar switch, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate signaling lines which phreaks could not access. This system is known as [[Common Channel Signaling|Common Channel Interoffice Signaling]]. Classic phreaking with the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s, MF Signalling is still used on various parts of the U.S. Network but is almost always out-of-band.\n\nThe last 2600&nbsp;Hz-controlled trunk in the contiguous United States was operated by the independent [[Northern Telephone Company of Minnesota|Northern Telephone Company]] with an [[N-carrier|N2 Carrier]] system serving [[Wawina, Minnesota]] until June 15, 2006, when it was replaced by [[T-carrier|T1 carrier]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phworld.org/sounds/wawina/ |title=Telephone World - Sounds & Recordings from Wawina, MN |publisher=Phworld.org |accessdate=2013-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064451/http://www.phworld.org/sounds/wawina/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref>  The last 2600&nbsp;Hz-controlled trunks in North America were located in [[Livengood, Alaska]], survived another 5 years, and were finally retired in March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.binrev.com/forums/index.php/topic/44301-the-death-of-livengood/ |title=The death of Livengood - Old Skool Phreaking - Binary Revolution Forums |publisher=Binrev.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{In popular culture|date=March 2018}}\n*In the movie ''[[WarGames]]'' (1983), a young hacker, David Lightman (Matthew Broderick), uses a pull-tab from an aluminum can, found on the ground at a truck stop, to make a free long-distance call via payphone to his friend (Ally Sheedy). \n*In the movie ''[[The Core]]'', the hacker known as \"Rat\" uses phreaking to give Doctor Josh Keyes unlimited long-distance for life to prove his skills.\n*In the ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' episode ''Aletheia'', main character [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] uses phreaking to call someone in [[Paris]] in 1979 as a prank.
