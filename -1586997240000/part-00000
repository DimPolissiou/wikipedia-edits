Jai convinces his father that the story is true and believing it to be so, Malik airs it on his network. The scandal rocks the nation and elections are held in which Mohan Pandey wins.

Amrish, though, cuts a deal with Mohan Pandey and does not air the CD. Purab then tells his boss of his findings on the day his son is getting engaged. Malik goes on air one final time and confesses the wrongdoings of his son, son-in-law and exposes Mohan Pandey. Unable to bear the guilt, Jai commits suicide.

California|Escondido]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Colonial===\nThe pre-colonial history of this area is divided into an early (prior to circa 900 BCE) and a late period.  During the late period, a village complex known as the Westwood Valley complex was located along an intermittent stream bed.  The period of habitation is from around 850 CE to 1790 CE.  The peoples believed to have occupied this site are the [[Kumeyaay]] (formerly known as Diegueno/Ipai), although there are strong traces of [[Luise\u00f1o]] as well.<ref name=\"kyle\" />  The area the village occupied is now under the western section of Ranch Bernardo near Duenda and Poblado Roads.\n===Post-Colonial===\nRancho Bernardo is located on the [[Rancho San Bernardo (Snook)|Rancho San Bernardo]] [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] made in 1842.\n\nIn the 1960s, Rancho Bernardo was annexed by San Diego. The area was developed by [[AVCO]] Community Developers.<ref>{{Cite web| title = History - Rancho Bernardo Historical Society| accessdate = 2016-10-14| url = http://www.rbhistoricalsociety.org/history}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2007, the [[Witch Creek Fire]] burned through Rancho Bernardo and several other populous areas of [[San Diego County]], destroying hundreds of homes, and completely destroying several entire neighborhoods, particularly ones that firefighters had trouble accessing due to rugged terrain and rapidly advancing flames pushed by strong [[Santa Ana winds]]. The highly unpredictable flames pushed into the northeast section of Poway during the day, prompting evacuation of Palomar-Pomerado Hospital.
