Edited by Lena Baunaz, Liliane Haegeman, Karen De Clercq, and Eric Lander. Oxford University Press, 2018.</ref>\n\nDistributed Morphology provides an alternative to [[Lexicalist hypothesis|Lexicalist]] approaches to how the lexicon and syntax interact, that is, with words independently created in the lexicon and then organized using syntax. In Distributed Morphology, the lexicon does not function independently and is instead distributed across many linguistic processes.<ref>Marantz, Alec. 1997a.

Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nThe beginnings of nanosyntax can be traced to a 1993 article by [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser|S. Jay Keyser]] titled \"On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations,\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=Kenneth|first2=S.

Jay|editor-last2=Keyser|pp=53-109|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|ISBN=978-0-262-58124-0}}</ref> which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.\n\n==Nanosyntactic Operations==\nNanosyntax is a theory that seeks to fill in holes left by other theories when they seek to explain phenomena in language. The most notable phenomena that nanosyntax tackles is that of irregular conjugation.<ref name=\":1\"/> For example, \"[[goose]]\" is irregular in that its plural form is not \"gooses\", but rather, \"geese\". This poses a problem to simple syntax, as without additional rules and allowances, \"geese\" should be found to be a suboptimal candidate for the plural of \"goose\" in comparison to \"gooses\".\n\n====Possible Solutions====\n\nThere are three manners by which syntacticians may attempt to resolve this. The first is a word-based treatment. In the above examples, \u201cduck\u201d, \u201cducks\u201d, \u201cgoose\u201d, and \u201cgeese\u201d are all counted as separate heads under the category of [[nouns]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cinque |first1=Guglielmo |last2=Rizzi |first2=Luigi |title=The cartography of syntactic structures |journal=Oxford Handbook of linguistic analysis |date=2010}}</ref>. Whether a word denotes a singular or plural is then marked in the lexical entry, and there does not exist a Number head with which [[affixes]] can be included to modify the root word. This theory requires significant work on the part of the speaker to retrieve the correct word. It is also considered lacking in the face of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] concepts such as that displayed by the [[Wug test]] wherein children are able to correctly conjugate a previously unheard nonsense noun from its singular to its plural.\n\n[[Distributed morphology]] attempts to tackle the question through the process of fusion. Fusion is the process in which a noun head and its numeral head may fuse together under certain parameters to derive an irregular plural<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Halle |last2=Marantz |first2=Alec |title=Distributed morphology and the pieces of inflection.

In the above example, the plural of \u201cduck\u201d would simply select its plural allomorph \u201cducks\u201d, and the plural of \u201cgoose\u201d would select its plural allomorph \u201cgeese\u201d, created through the fusion of \u201cgoose\u201d and \u201c-s\u201d. In this way, distributed morphology is head-based. However, this theory still does not provide a reason as to why \"geese\" is preferable and a more optimal candidate for a plurality of geese over \"gooses\".\n\nNanosyntax goes about this dilemma by suggesting that rather than each word being a head, it is instead a phrase and can therefore be made into a subtree. Within the tree, heads can be assigned to override other heads in specific contexts. For example, if there is a head that says \"-s\" is added to a noun to turn it from a singular noun to a plural noun, but a head overrides it in the case of an irregularly conjugated plural noun such as \"goose\", it will select for the operation of the superseding head. Since it uses a formula and not rote memorisation of lexical items, it bypasses the challenges brought forth by a word-based treatment, and due to the arrangement of heads and their precedence, also provides a solution to the optimality concerns of distributed morphology.\n\nNanosyntax functions based on two principles: phrasal lexicalisation and the Elsewhere principle.\n\n====Phrasal Lexicalisation====\n\nPhrasal lexicalisation is the concept that proposes that only lexical items can constitute terminal nodes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Michal |title=Nanosyntax: A short primer to a new approach to language |journal=Nordlyd |date=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Mical |title=Towards elegant parameters: Language variation reduces to the size of lexically stored trees. |journal=Ms. Troms\u00f8 University. |date=2011}}</ref>. When this principle is applied, we can say that in regular plural nouns, there is no special lexicalisation (denoted in the below example using X) that needs to apply, and so standard pluralisation rules apply. The following is an example using \"duck\" where because there is no additional lexicalisation of the plural noun, an -s is added to pluralise the noun:\n\nX \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK] [ Pl ]]\u2003\nduck \u2194 [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK](8)\u2003s \u2194 Pl\n\nThis principle also allows for a word like \"geese\" to lexicalise [goose[Pl<sup>0</sup>]. When an additional lexicalisation is present, instead of following the standard addition of -s to pluralise the noun, instead the lexicalisation rule takes over in the following manner: \n\ngeese \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> GOOSE] [ Pl ]].\n\n====Elsewhere Principle====\nThe Elsewhere Principle seeks to provide a solution to the question of which lexicalisation applies to the noun in question. In simple terms, the lexicalisation that is more specific will always take precedence over a more general lexicalisation.\n\nAs illustrated, syntactic structure S seeks either lexicalisation from  A \u2194 [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]] or B \u2194 [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]], B will win out over A because B lexicalises in a more specific situation whereas A lexicalises more generally. This solves the problem that distributive morphology faces when determining optimal pluralisation for irregular nouns.\n\n====Observable Consequences====\nCaha proposed that there is a hierarchy in case as follows from broadest to narrowest: Dative, Genetive, Accusative, Nominative<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Caha |first1=Pavel |title=The nanosyntax of case (Ph. D. thesis) |journal=University of Troms\u00f8 |date=2009}}</ref>. Caha also suggested that each of these cases could be broken down into its most basic structures, each of which is a syntactic terminal, as follows:\n\nDative = [<sub>WP</sub> W [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]]\nGenitive = [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]\nAccusative = [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]\nNominative = [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]\n\nThis is further outlined in the Morphological Containment/Nesting portion of this Wikipedia article. \n\nAs each is formed with sets within, it is possible for portions of the tense to be lexicalised by a separate noun. Therefore, there are several possibilities in syncretism patterns, namely AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, AABC, ABBC and ABCC. Some arrangements do not appear as possibilities because of the constraints laid on by the Elsewhere Principle. Notably, once there has been a switch to a separate lexicalisation, the lexicalisations from prior cannot return. In other words, there are no occurrences where once A turns to B or B to C, A or B reappears respectively. The Elsewhere Principle says that narrower lexicalisations win over broader lexicalisations, and once a narrower lexicalisation has been selected for, the broader lexicalisation will not reappear.\n\n==Nanosyntax in Relation to Other Linguistic Aspects==\n\n== Tools of Nanosyntax ==\nNanosyntax uses a handful of tools in order to map out fine-grained elements of the language being analyzed. Beyond Spellout Principles, there are three main tools for this system, who's uses are outlined as such, based of the writings of Baunaz, Haegeman, De Clercq, and Lander in ''Exploring Nanosyntax'' <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-21|editor-last=Baunaz|editor-first=Lena|editor2-last=Haegeman|editor2-first=Liliane|editor3-last=De Clercq|editor3-first=Karen|editor4-last=Lander|editor4-first=Eric|title=Exploring Nanosyntax|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001}}</ref>\n\n====[[Semantics]]====\nThe universal structure of compositionality is used in order for mapping structure within sentences semantically. This deals with mapping which features words are composed of such as which structures a given word is semantically \"constructed on\". Semantic considerations impact the parameters of structural seize of a sentence, based on semantic categories of things such as verbs. This is an important guiding feature on what elements of syntax need to be aligned with semantic markers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====[[Syncretism (linguistics)|Syncretism]]====\nSyncretism has played a central role in the development of Nanosyntax.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Pantcheva|first=Marina|title=Decomposing Path: The Nanosyntax of Directional Expressions|publisher=University of Tromso|oclc=786337774}}</ref> This system combines two distinct morphosyntactic structures on the surface of a sentence: such as two grammar function that are contained within a single lexical form<ref name=\":2\" />. An example of this could be something such as the french \"\u00e0\" which can be used to indicate a location or a goal; this is therefore a Location-Goal syncretism.<ref name=\":4\"/> This observation of a syncratism comes form work investigating patterns of the readings of words such as goal \"to\", route \"via\", and location \"at\" cross-linguistically preformed by linguistics such as Svenonius.<ref>Svenonius, Peter. 2010. \u201cSpatial Prepositions in English.\u201d In ''Mapping Spatial PPs: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures, Vol. 6'', edited by Guglielmo Cinque and Luigi Rizzi, pp. 127\u2013160. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> \n\nCase syncretism have been determined to only be possible with adjacent cases, based off ABA theorem.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bobaljik|first=Jonathan David|title=Universals in Comparative Morphology: Suppletion, Superlatives, and the Structure of Words (Current Studies in Linguistics)|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|oclc=939970944}}</ref> This therefore can be used to target adjacent elements in the ordering of cases, such as nominative and accusative cases in languages such as English<ref name=\":0\" />. Through using syncretism in Nanosyntax, a universal order of cases can be identified, through determining which cases sit beside one another. This finding allows linguists to understand which features are present, as well as their order.  \n\n==== Morphological Containment/Nesting ====\nMorphological containment relates to the hierarchy of linear order in syntactic structures. Syncretism may reveals linear oder, but is unable to determine in which direction the linear order occurs. This is where morphological containment is required. It is used in this context to posit the hierarchy of cases. Syncretism can determine the linear order of cases is COM > INS > DAT > GEN > ACC > NOM ''or'' NOM > ACC > GEN > DAT > INS > COM, but morphological containment decides whether it is [[Nominative case|nominative]] or [[Comitative case|comitative]] initial.<ref name=\":0\" /> These case features can be understood as sets of each other, where features build on top of one another, with the first feature being a singleton, but the next feature is the first and second nested within itself- and so on. These sets can be referred to as the above mentioned features. Alternatively, to simplify the nesting of the features, one can label them as  K<sub>1/etc</sub> as proposed by Pavel Caha<ref name=\":2\">{{cite thesis|type=PhD dissertation|title=The Nanosyntax of Case|author=Pavel Caha|date=July 2009|url= https://munin.uit.no/bitstream/handle/10037/2203/thesis.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref>. Arguments for Nominative case being the simplest and first case can be linked to its simplicity in structure and features.<ref name=\":2\" /> Examples are found in natural language which suggest an order beginning with NOM and ending with COM, such as in West Tocharian, where the ACC plural ending -m is found nested in the GEN/DAT ending -mts .<ref name=\":0\" /> This is a surface representation of the ordering of Case through use of nesting in nanosyntax. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Syntax]]\n[[Category:Linguistic morphology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|An approach to syntax in which the terminal nodes of syntactic parse trees may be reduced to units smaller than a morpheme}}'''Nanosyntax''' is an approach to [[syntax]] where the terminal nodes of [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic parse trees]] may be reduced to units smaller than a [[morpheme]].

The most notable phenomena that nanosyntax tackles is that of irregular conjugation.<ref name=\":1\"/> For example, \"[[goose]]\" is irregular in that its plural form is not \"gooses\", but rather, \"geese\". This poses a problem to simple syntax, as without additional rules and allowances, \"geese\" should be found to be a suboptimal candidate for the plural of \"goose\" in comparison to \"gooses\".\n\n====Possible Solutions====\n\nThere are three manners by which syntacticians may attempt to resolve this. The first is a word-based treatment. In the above examples, \u201cduck\u201d, \u201cducks\u201d, \u201cgoose\u201d, and \u201cgeese\u201d are all counted as separate heads under the category of [[nouns]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cinque |first1=Guglielmo |last2=Rizzi |first2=Luigi |title=The cartography of syntactic structures |journal=Oxford Handbook of linguistic analysis |date=2010}}</ref>. Whether a word denotes a singular or plural is then marked in the lexical entry, and there does not exist a Number head with which [[affixes]] can be included to modify the root word. This theory requires significant work on the part of the speaker to retrieve the correct word. It is also considered lacking in the face of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] concepts such as that displayed by the [[Wug test]] wherein children are able to correctly conjugate a previously unheard nonsense noun from its singular to its plural.\n\n[[Distributed morphology]] attempts to tackle the question through the process of fusion. Fusion is the process in which a noun head and its numeral head may fuse together under certain parameters to derive an irregular plural<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Halle |last2=Marantz |first2=Alec |title=Distributed morphology and the pieces of inflection. Hale, K. & SJ Keyser (eds.), The View from Building 20. |journal=Morphology: Critical Concepts in Linguistics |date=1993 |pages=111-176}}</ref>. In the above example, the plural of \u201cduck\u201d would simply select its plural allomorph \u201cducks\u201d, and the plural of \u201cgoose\u201d would select its plural allomorph \u201cgeese\u201d, created through the fusion of \u201cgoose\u201d and \u201c-s\u201d. In this way, distributed morphology is head-based. However, this theory still does not provide a reason as to why \"geese\" is preferable and a more optimal candidate for a plurality of geese over \"gooses\".\n\nNanosyntax goes about this dilemma by suggesting that rather than each word being a head, it is instead a phrase and can therefore be made into a subtree. Within the tree, heads can be assigned to override other heads in specific contexts. For example, if there is a head that says \"-s\" is added to a noun to turn it from a singular noun to a plural noun, but a head overrides it in the case of an irregularly conjugated plural noun such as \"goose\", it will select for the operation of the superseding head. Since it uses a formula and not rote memorisation of lexical items, it bypasses the challenges brought forth by a word-based treatment, and due to the arrangement of heads and their precedence, also provides a solution to the optimality concerns of distributed morphology.\n\nNanosyntax functions based on two principles: phrasal lexicalisation and the Elsewhere principle.\n\n====Phrasal Lexicalisation====\n\nPhrasal lexicalisation is the concept that proposes that only lexical items can constitute terminal nodes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Michal |title=Nanosyntax: A short primer to a new approach to language |journal=Nordlyd |date=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Mical |title=Towards elegant parameters: Language variation reduces to the size of lexically stored trees. |journal=Ms. Troms\u00f8 University. |date=2011}}</ref>.
