The population was 51,199 according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_QTPL&prodType=table/|title=American FactFinder - Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|website=Factfinder2.census.gov}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\nLocated on the central coast of California, the economy centers predominantly around farming and food processing. It is known for growing strawberries, apples, lettuce and a host of other vegetables.  Watsonville is home to people of varied ethnic backgrounds. There is a large Hispanic population, as well as groups of Croatians, Filipinos, Portuguese, [[Sikhs]], and Japanese who live and work in the city.\n\nThe [[Pajaro Valley]], where Watsonville is located, has a climate that is around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit throughout much of the year. This climate makes Watsonville an attractive coastal environment for the neighboring inland communities with very hot summers. The [[Pajaro Valley Unified School District]] has an attendance of about 18,000 students kindergarten through 12th grades. There are several private religious-based schools in Watsonville such as Notre Dame School, Monte Vista Christian, Salesian Sisters, and St. Francis. There are also several charter schools and the non-religious independent Pre-K through 12th grade Mount Madonna School. These schools provide a wide range of educational options for local families. Watsonville is generally conservative on the political spectrum, and average relative to the neighboring communities of Salinas, Castroville, and Prunedale. It is, however, a self-designated [[sanctuary city]].<ref name=PC>\"Watsonville-Santa Cruz JACL Holds Candlelight Vigil in Observance of Feb. 19,\" ''Pacific Citizen'', March 10\u201323, 2017, p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe larger coastal town directly north of Watsonville is the city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. Santa Cruz is a draw for many young college students who attend [[Cabrillo College]] or [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Because Watsonville and Santa Cruz are beach towns, they draw many visitors from [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and from [[Central Valley (California)|the Central Valley]] areas. Like neighboring [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] in [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]], Watsonville produces a variety of fruits and vegetables, primarily apples, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and [[Agaricus bisporus|table mushrooms]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Watsonville Riots}}\nWatsonville's land was first inhabited by an Indian tribe called the [[Ohlone|Costanoans]]. This tribe settled along the [[Pajaro Dunes]] since the land was fertile and useful for the cultivation of their plants and animals. In 1769, the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] - first European explorers of the area - came to the area from the south, where soldiers described a big bird they saw near a large river. The story survived in the river's name, ''Rio del Pajaro'' (River of the Bird). The Pajaro River today forms a boundary of the city, and also divides Santa Cruz County from Monterey County.\n\nThe Portol\u00e1 expedition continued through the area on its way north, camping at one of the lakes north of town for five nights, on October 10\u201314, 1769. Many of the expedition soldiers were suffering from scurvy, so progress was slow. While the sick recuperated, scouts led by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ortega|Sergeant Ortega]] went ahead to find the best way forward. On the fifth day, [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] missionary [[Juan Crespi]], traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, \"This afternoon the explorers returned. The sergeant reported that he had gone ahead twelve leagues without getting any information of the harbor that we are looking for, and that he went to the foot of a high, white mountain range.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=208\u2013209 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |location= |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library |accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the October 10 march, the explorers first saw the [[Coast redwood]] tree (Spanish: ''palo colorado''). A bronze plaque at Pinto Lake (now a city park) commemorates the event.<ref>{{cite book |last=Koch |first=Margaret |pages=11 |year=1973 |title=Santa Cruz County: Parade of the Past |isbn=9780913548165 |location=Fresno, CA |publisher=Valley Press }}</ref> On October 15, the expedition continued to the northwest past today's community of [[Freedom, California|Freedom]], camping that night at Corralitos Lagoon.\n\nThe area became part of the Spanish colonial province of [[The Californias|Las Californias]], and in 1804 the northern part was split off to form [[Alta California]]. The area's pasture lands were assigned to the [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish mission]] to the south, in Carmel. When Mexico gained independence, it took possession of ''Alta California''. The Spanish missions were secularized in the 1830s, and the future Watsonville area became [[Rancho Bolsa del Pajaro]], a land grant made to Sebastian Rodr\u00edguez in 1837. Under Mexico's more liberal land-ownership laws, immigration to the area from Europe and the United States increased.\n\nIn 1846\u201348, the [[Mexican-American War]] resulted in the cession of California from Mexico to the United States. In 1848, the [[California Gold Rush]] greatly accelerated immigration to California. Judge John H. Watson and D.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Gregory laid out the town in 1852. The community was incorporated as the Town of Watsonville on or about March 30, 1868 and named after Judge Watson. The town became the City of Watsonville about 1889. The voters adopted a charter in 1903.<ref name=\"Watsonville History\">{{cite web|last1=Overmeyer|first1=Kurt|title=Watsonville Growing Opportunities|url=http://growinwatsonville.com/why-watsonville/history-watsonville|website=growinwatsonville.com|publisher=Overmeyer Kurt|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Watsonville Traction Company|Watsonville Railway and Navigation Company]] operated an interurban railway to Port Watsonville on Monterey Bay where it connected with an overnight produce [[packet boat]] to San Francisco from 1904 to 1913.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fabing |first=H.W. |year=1966 |title=Watsonville Transportation Company |journal=The Western Railroader |volume=29 |issue=322 |pages=1\u201315 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:Cold storage beach st.jpg|thumb|Sunrise in an industrial area on Beach Street in Watsonville.]]\nThe main industries in Watsonville are construction, agriculture and manufacturing. Some of the largest companies headquartered in Watsonville are [[Monterey Mushrooms]], [[Driscoll's]] [[Martinelli's]], [[Fox Racing Shox]], Nordic Naturals, [[Graniterock]], [[Granite Construction]], [[West Marine]], California Giant, A&I Transport Inc. and [[Orion Telescopes & Binoculars]].<ref name=WED>{{cite web|title=Watsonville Economic Development|url=http://cityofwatsonville.org/business/economic-profile|website=cityofwatsonville.org|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nWatsonville is known for the production of crops and goods in the agricultural business along the Northern Pacific Coast. The city's economy is dependent on its agro-business market and in the distribution of crops to different parts of the world. The crops that are fundamental to the economy include: strawberries, cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, natural plants, and raspberries. Companies such as [[Driscoll's]] and California Giant spend around $280 million every year in the processing and transportation of fresh food to most cities in the area, such as [[San Jose, California]], [[Castroville, California]], and [[Santa Cruz, California]] where the numbers of these fruits and vegetables are insufficient for the demand of the people. The large investments by big corporations in the city and the labor force, which accounts for 75% of Latino workers, have helped the city to become ranked amongst the top most important farming cities in the United States for its agro-business market. Besides relying mainly on farming goods and practices, the economy also relies on other small private owned businesses in the city because of different industries such as: industries in the fields of electronics, service firms, non-agricultural stores, and other private owned restaurant in the area that contribute to the economy every year. The dominant industries that benefit the economy correspond to the labor forces in the field of construction, farming and manufacturing that account for the majority of the contribution to the labor force and stability of the community in the city.<ref name=\"Economic Profile\" />\n\n===Top employers===\nAccording to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref name=\"cafr2010\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.watsonville.ca.us/departments/finance/0910cafr/CAFR_2009_10.pdf|title=City of Watsonville Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010|website=Ci.watsonville.ca.us|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> the top employers in the city are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! #\n!

In the middle 1800s, American, British, Irish and German immigrants began farming alongside the {{Lang|es|[[Californio]]s}}. Later in that century and into the 1900s, new immigrant workers from China, Japan, Italy, Portugal, the Philippines, and Mexico accounted for the majority of the work force in the city. The new immigrants were important to the growth of the city because the fertile land needed personnel to perform jobs in the industries of farming and construction. These immigrants were able to shape the economy of the city through their labor and settlement in the city. They created more job openings as well as a market for new private owned businesses where these laborers had the opportunity to buy goods and other needed services. Large companies then turned their interest to the city because of the large number of workers and production of crops that could be achieved in a short period of time. When these agricultural companies settled along the boundaries of the city, they created more jobs increasing the population of the city. The market of agriculture served as the main foundation of the city because it was the industry that needed the most workers, this allowed for the creation of a larger market of agriculture where companies could transport large number of crops from city to city and even to different parts of the world. The city is ranked as the 21st largest city in the country with the most Latino workers that account for 75% of the total population in the city.<ref name=\"Community Profile\">{{cite web|title=Watsonville Economical Growth|url=http://cityofwatsonville.org/business/economic-dev-sub|website=cityofwatsonville.org|publisher=City of Watsonville California|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, cannery workers in Watsonville went on strike for 18 months to protest a decrease in their wages and benefits. In the end, they won a new contract. The movement was led by primarily Latina Women, and was noted as a historic labor rights win for the Mexicano/Chicano community.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Tal|date=1987|title=Victory at Watsonville|url=|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=17|issue=5|pages=19|jstor=25795722}}</ref>\n\nSanta Cruz County and Monterey County work together to provide training for workers in new job skills that are needed in the industries of farming and construction in the city. Colleges in the area such as [[California State University, Monterey Bay]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], and [[Cabrillo College]] are important for shaping the training of new workers, these colleges have links with companies that expose students and workers to the real labor force. Since these close links exists between schools and labor companies in the city, the economy is able to create new jobs that stabilize the income and output of the community. The agricultural business is dependent on the contribution of college students and workers with their skills gathered through the training programs at institutions in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County. College students along with expert workers have created new ways of growing and processing food that are useful for the economy and the population of the city. The workforce has changed since the 20th century because companies have created new programs in the heart of the city that better prepare workers with the skills that are requires to perform different jobs in the city. These skills include basic sections in the usage of computers systems, Internet, and other programs that are needed by companies related to jobs in the farming, manufacturing, and construction industries. These programs also include job recruitment, job subsidies, and retention services that are important for the economy and the community.<ref name=\"Economic Profile\">{{cite web|last1=Overmeyer|first1=Kurt|title=Watsonville Growing Opportunities|url=http://growinwatsonville.com/quick-facts-about-watsonville/economic-profile|website=growinwatsonville.com|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''According to the California Employment Department,<ref name=\"Labor Market Information\">{{cite web|title=Employment Development Department|url=http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov|website=CA.gov|publisher=State of California|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> the industry of employment in the Santa Cruz County consists of:'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Considerable population growth occurred since 1980, requiring preparation of a number of [[Environmental Impact Report]]s, with resultant development removing certain lands of the city from productive natural [[habitat]].\n\nMost of the coastal land adjacent to Watsonville is part of the [[Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]], a designation championed by former Congressman [[Leon Panetta]]. Heading away from the coast, the backdrop features the southern end of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].\n\nAnother protected natural resource is the Watsonville [[wetlands]]. Also referred to as the Watsonville [[slough (hydrology)|sloughs]], they are a system of fresh water sloughs with open water and native vegetation which extend from the city to the ocean. This slough system is only one of a few remaining wetland areas of its kind in the California Coastal Region. Not only are the wetlands home to approximately nine species of fish and over 200 species of waterfowl, raptors and song birds,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Watsonville Sloughs|url=http://www.watsonvillewetlandswatch.org/sloughs.htm|work=Website|publisher=Watsonville Wetlands Watch|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife|url=http://wetlandsofwatsonville.org/wildlife.html|work=Wetlands Website|publisher=Wetlands of Watsonville|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref> but they are also a vital stopping off point on the Pacific Flyway for the thousands of migrating birds.\n\nIn 1990 both private and municipal organizations worked together to stop development and protect this important resource.<ref>Santa Cruz Sentinel: \"Conservation victory for Watsonville sloughs\", 09/22/2009</ref> The Watsonville Wetlands Watch was established at that time with the task of restoring and protecting the slough's natural habit. \"Watching the Watsonville Wetlands,\" a book published by the organization and written by Jerry Busch, Gary Kittleson and Christine Johnson-Lyons<ref>Busch, Jerry. \"Watching Watsonville Wetlands\".

Male full-time year-round workers had a median income of $31,758 versus $31,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,407. About 18.6% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.6% of those under age 18 and 15.6% of those age 65 or over.

The Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos had residential sections and opened many businesses to serve their customer base in town during the mid 20th century. The history of East Asians in Watsonville dates back to the late 19th century and are involved in the local agricultural industry. It is presumed that as a result of [[Japanese American Internment|Japanese-American internment]] during WWII, local farm companies began to attract Mexican migrant labor to the area in higher numbers and the town's racial-ethnic composition became more Hispanic in the 1980s and 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There was also medium-sized Sikh population in Watsonville during the late 1990s to early 2000s that were involved mostly in the trucking industry, but most have moved away to [[California's Central Valley]] for cheaper housing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThere were 11,381 households out of which 49.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 16.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.1% were non-families. 17.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

It is known for growing strawberries, apples, lettuce and a host of other vegetables.  Watsonville is home to people of varied ethnic backgrounds. There is a large Hispanic population, as well as groups of Croatians, Filipinos, Portuguese, [[Sikhs]], and Japanese who live and work in the city.\n\nThe [[Pajaro Valley]], where Watsonville is located, has a climate that is around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit throughout much of the year. This climate makes Watsonville an attractive coastal environment for the neighboring inland communities with very hot summers. The [[Pajaro Valley Unified School District]] has an attendance of about 18,000 students kindergarten through 12th grades. There are several private religious-based schools in Watsonville such as Notre Dame School, Monte Vista Christian, Salesian Sisters, and St. Francis. There are also several charter schools and the non-religious independent Pre-K through 12th grade Mount Madonna School. These schools provide a wide range of educational options for local families. Watsonville is generally conservative on the political spectrum, and average relative to the neighboring communities of Salinas, Castroville, and Prunedale. It is, however, a self-designated [[sanctuary city]].<ref name=PC>\"Watsonville-Santa Cruz JACL Holds Candlelight Vigil in Observance of Feb. 19,\" ''Pacific Citizen'', March 10\u201323, 2017, p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe larger coastal town directly north of Watsonville is the city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. Santa Cruz is a draw for many young college students who attend [[Cabrillo College]] or [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Because Watsonville and Santa Cruz are beach towns, they draw many visitors from [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and from [[Central Valley (California)|the Central Valley]] areas. Like neighboring [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] in [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]], Watsonville produces a variety of fruits and vegetables, primarily apples, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and [[Agaricus bisporus|table mushrooms]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Watsonville Riots}}\nWatsonville's land was first inhabited by an Indian tribe called the [[Ohlone|Costanoans]]. This tribe settled along the [[Pajaro Dunes]] since the land was fertile and useful for the cultivation of their plants and animals. In 1769, the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] - first European explorers of the area - came to the area from the south, where soldiers described a big bird they saw near a large river. The story survived in the river's name, ''Rio del Pajaro'' (River of the Bird). The Pajaro River today forms a boundary of the city, and also divides Santa Cruz County from Monterey County.\n\nThe Portol\u00e1 expedition continued through the area on its way north, camping at one of the lakes north of town for five nights, on October 10\u201314, 1769. Many of the expedition soldiers were suffering from scurvy, so progress was slow. While the sick recuperated, scouts led by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ortega|Sergeant Ortega]] went ahead to find the best way forward. On the fifth day, [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] missionary [[Juan Crespi]], traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, \"This afternoon the explorers returned. The sergeant reported that he had gone ahead twelve leagues without getting any information of the harbor that we are looking for, and that he went to the foot of a high, white mountain range.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=208\u2013209 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |location= |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library |accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the October 10 march, the explorers first saw the [[Coast redwood]] tree (Spanish: ''palo colorado''). A bronze plaque at Pinto Lake (now a city park) commemorates the event.<ref>{{cite book |last=Koch |first=Margaret |pages=11 |year=1973 |title=Santa Cruz County: Parade of the Past |isbn=9780913548165 |location=Fresno, CA |publisher=Valley Press }}</ref> On October 15, the expedition continued to the northwest past today's community of [[Freedom, California|Freedom]], camping that night at Corralitos Lagoon.\n\nThe area became part of the Spanish colonial province of [[The Californias|Las Californias]], and in 1804 the northern part was split off to form [[Alta California]]. The area's pasture lands were assigned to the [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish mission]] to the south, in Carmel. When Mexico gained independence, it took possession of ''Alta California''. The Spanish missions were secularized in the 1830s, and the future Watsonville area became [[Rancho Bolsa del Pajaro]], a land grant made to Sebastian Rodr\u00edguez in 1837. Under Mexico's more liberal land-ownership laws, immigration to the area from Europe and the United States increased.\n\nIn 1846-48, the [[Mexican-American War]] resulted in the cession of California from Mexico to the United States. In 1848, the [[California Gold Rush]] greatly accelerated immigration to California. Judge John H. Watson and D.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Gregory laid out the town in 1852. The community was incorporated as the Town of Watsonville on or about March 30, 1868 and named after Judge Watson. The town became the City of Watsonville about 1889. The voters adopted a charter in 1903.<ref name=\"Watsonville History\">{{cite web|last1=Overmeyer|first1=Kurt|title=Watsonville Growing Opportunities|url=http://growinwatsonville.com/why-watsonville/history-watsonville|website=growinwatsonville.com|publisher=Overmeyer Kurt|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Watsonville Traction Company|Watsonville Railway and Navigation Company]] operated an interurban railway to Port Watsonville on Monterey Bay where it connected with an overnight produce [[packet boat]] to San Francisco from 1904 to 1913.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fabing |first=H.W. |year=1966 |title=Watsonville Transportation Company |journal=The Western Railroader |volume=29 |issue=322 |pages=1\u201315 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:Cold storage beach st.jpg|thumb|Sunrise in an industrial area on Beach Street in Watsonville.]]\nThe main industries in Watsonville are construction, agriculture and manufacturing. Some of the largest companies headquartered in Watsonville are [[Monterey Mushrooms]], [[Driscoll's]] [[Martinelli's]], [[Fox Racing Shox]], Nordic Naturals, [[Graniterock]], [[Granite Construction]], [[West Marine]], California Giant, A&I Transport Inc. and [[Orion Telescopes & Binoculars]].<ref name=WED>{{cite web|title=Watsonville Economic Development|url=http://cityofwatsonville.org/business/economic-profile|website=cityofwatsonville.org|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nWatsonville is known for the production of crops and goods in the agricultural business along the Northern Pacific Coast. The city's economy is dependent on its agro-business market and in the distribution of crops to different parts of the world. The crops that are fundamental to the economy include: strawberries, cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, natural plants, and raspberries. Companies such as [[Driscoll's]] and California Giant spend around $280 million every year in the processing and transportation of fresh food to most cities in the area, such as [[San Jose, California]], [[Castroville, California]], and [[Santa Cruz, California]] where the numbers of these fruits and vegetables are insufficient for the demand of the people. The large investments by big corporations in the city and the labor force, which accounts for 75% of Latino workers, have helped the city to become ranked amongst the top most important farming cities in the United States for its agro-business market. Besides relying mainly on farming goods and practices, the economy also relies on other small private owned businesses in the city because of different industries such as: industries in the fields of electronics, service firms, non-agricultural stores, and other private owned restaurant in the area that contribute to the economy every year. The dominant industries that benefit the economy correspond to the labor forces in the field of construction, farming and manufacturing that account for the majority of the contribution to the labor force and stability of the community in the city.<ref name=\"Economic Profile\" />\n\n===Top employers===\nAccording to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref name=\"cafr2010\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.watsonville.ca.us/departments/finance/0910cafr/CAFR_2009_10.pdf|title=City of Watsonville Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010|website=Ci.watsonville.ca.us|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> the top employers in the city are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! #\n!

In the middle 1800s, American, British, Irish and German immigrants began farming alongside the {{Lang|es|[[Californio]]s}}. Later in that century and into the 1900s, new immigrant workers from China, Japan, Italy, Portugal, the Philippines, and Mexico accounted for the majority of the work force in the city. The new immigrants were important to the growth of the city because the fertile land needed personnel to perform jobs in the industries of farming and construction. These immigrants were able to shape the economy of the city through their labor and settlement in the city. They created more job openings as well as a market for new private owned businesses where these laborers had the opportunity to buy goods and other needed services. Large companies then turned their interest to the city because of the large number of workers and production of crops that could be achieved in a short period of time. When these agricultural companies settled along the boundaries of the city, they created more jobs increasing the population of the city. The market of agriculture served as the main foundation of the city because it was the industry that needed the most workers, this allowed for the creation of a larger market of agriculture where companies could transport large number of crops from city to city and even to different parts of the world. The city is ranked as the 21st largest city in the country with the most Latino workers that account for 75% of the total population in the city.<ref name=\"Community Profile\">{{cite web|title=Watsonville Economical Growth|url=http://cityofwatsonville.org/business/economic-dev-sub|website=cityofwatsonville.org|publisher=City of Watsonville California|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, cannery workers in Watsonville went on strike for 18 months to protest a decrease in their wages and benefits.

Colleges in the area such as [[California State University, Monterey Bay]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], and [[Cabrillo College]] are important for shaping the training of new workers, these colleges have links with companies that expose students and workers to the real labor force. Since these close links exists between schools and labor companies in the city, the economy is able to create new jobs that stabilize the income and output of the community. The agricultural business is dependent on the contribution of college students and workers with their skills gathered through the training programs at institutions in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County. College students along with expert workers have created new ways of growing and processing food that are useful for the economy and the population of the city. The workforce has changed since the 20th century because companies have created new programs in the heart of the city that better prepare workers with the skills that are requires to perform different jobs in the city. These skills include basic sections in the usage of computers systems, Internet, and other programs that are needed by companies related to jobs in the farming, manufacturing, and construction industries. These programs also include job recruitment, job subsidies, and retention services that are important for the economy and the community.<ref name=\"Economic Profile\">{{cite web|last1=Overmeyer|first1=Kurt|title=Watsonville Growing Opportunities|url=http://growinwatsonville.com/quick-facts-about-watsonville/economic-profile|website=growinwatsonville.com|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''According to the California Employment Department,<ref name=\"Labor Market Information\">{{cite web|title=Employment Development Department|url=http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov|website=CA.gov|publisher=State of California|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> the industry of employment in the Santa Cruz County consists of:'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Heading away from the coast, the backdrop features the southern end of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].\n\nAnother protected natural resource is the Watsonville [[wetlands]]. Also referred to as the Watsonville [[slough (hydrology)|sloughs]], they are a system of fresh water sloughs with open water and native vegetation which extend from the city to the ocean. This slough system is only one of a few remaining wetland areas of its kind in the California Coastal Region.

The [[population density]] was 6,969.4 people per square mile (2,691.5/km\u00b2). There were 11,695 housing units at an average density of 1,841.3 per square mile (711.1/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 43.00% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.75% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.74% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 3.29% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.12% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 45.92% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 5.18% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 75.12% of the population, with the majority of these being of Mexican origin.\n\nWatsonville also has a large [[Asian-American]] presence consisting of [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese Americans|Japanese]] and [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] despite the fact that the percentage of city residents of Asian descent has dropped since 1960. The Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos had residential sections and opened many businesses to serve their customer base in town during the mid 20th century. The history of East Asians in Watsonville dates back to the late 19th century and are involved in the local agricultural industry. It is presumed that as a result of [[Japanese American Internment|Japanese-American internment]] during WWII, local farm companies began to attract Mexican migrant labor to the area in higher numbers and the town's racial-ethnic composition became more Hispanic in the 1980s and 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There was also medium-sized Sikh population in Watsonville during the late 1990s to early 2000s that were involved mostly in the trucking industry, but most have moved away to [[California's Central Valley]] for cheaper housing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThere were 11,381 households out of which 49.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 16.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.1% were non-families. 17.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.84 and the average family size was 4.26.\n\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 34.0% under the age of 18, 11.8% from 18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 15.1% from 45 to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 27 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.4 males.\n\nThe median [[income]] for a household in the city was $37,617, and the median income for a family was $40,293. Males had a median income of $26,701 versus $22,225 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $13,205. About 15.4% of families and 19.1% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 23.8% of those under age 18 and 8.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Law and government==\n[[File:Watsonville Civic Plaza.jpg|thumb|The Watsonville Civic Plaza and Public Library]]\n[[File:KWVI Watsonville Municipal Airport California.jpg|thumb|Watsonville's municipal airport.]]\n\nThe City of Watsonville was incorporated on March 30, 1868<ref name=incorp/> It adopted its first charter in 1903.

Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. They accept students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far. Then the program will run for students officially from 5th grade on.\n\nThereby, the position of the ''\"Leiter der Spezialklassen\"'' (\"Guidance of the special classes\") would not be needed anymore because the leading of the school is currently separate. This office had been held for a long time by ''R\u00fcdiger Eisenbrand'' who quit his official school service. He is now mayor of the city of [[Apolda]]. If he will return to any office at the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is not sure yet.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Syllabus and Appearance ===\n\nThe curriculum of the ''Spezialschule'' (special school) differs tremendously from those in regular Gymnasiums in [[Thuringia]]. The coverage is, as mentioned earlier above, mainly in the fields mathematics and natural science and goes very deep into the topics. Therefore, there is an abundance of classes related to these topics and a lot of periods to be taken by the students. But since students are very into their subjects, discussions in class are sometimes very intense and are appreciated with high interest by the students even if arguing sometimes runs riot. Classes are kept very small, often from 14-20 students maximum, and are also pretty often separated again (for certain scientific subjects) so that a group of 6-8 people yields a very good learning result.\n\nStudents learn informatics related subjects already in 10th and 9th grade, which is not usual.\n\n=== Projects ===\n\nIn 11th and 12th grade when the ''Kurssystem'' (course system) applies for the students they have to take [[mathematics]] as their major field of study. As the second major field of study they can choose between informatics (what is not usually offered), chemistry, biology or physics.\n\nThe ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper) - a big project work during 11th grade - has to be written about a mathematical or scientific topic only.\n\n9th grade students have to write their first project paper on a topic of their choice - the only restriction is that it has to be scientific. This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level. Tournaments e. g. are the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the ''Bundeswettbewerb Informatik'' (federal informatics contest), the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] or the [[International Biology Olympiad]].\n\nOn some occasions the school also gets to host some of those competitions mentioned above.\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (FSU)]] offers a possibility for the school to catch up with science just in their own town. Furthermore, a lot of students enjoy the opportunity of the convenience to visit professors and doctors of the numerous faculties of the university, which are scattered all over the town. Students can especially gain knowledge by getting help with their scientific projects and works assigned at school (bigger project like the ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper).\n\nA lot of students will take their chance and attain the university after they graduate from school and continue their studies in [[Jena]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cz-gymnasium.jena.de Homepage of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060918230836/http://internat.vacom.de/ Homepage of the boarding school]\n* [http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2007/01/21/biz/878071.html An article in the newspaper \"Berliner Morgenpost\" about the school (in German)]\n\n[[Category:Gymnasiums in Germany]]\n[[Category:Specialist schools in Germany]]\n[[Category:Schools in Thuringia]]\n[[Category:Education in Jena]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jena]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1963]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=November 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n{{original research|date=September 2007}}\n{{Copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox school\n|name                   = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena\n|native_name            =\n|latin_name             =\n|logo                   =\n|seal_image             =\n|image                  = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena.jpg\n|image_size             =\n|alt                    =\n|caption                =\n|motto                  =\n|motto_translation      =\n|location               =\n|streetaddress          = Erich-Kuithan-Str. 7\n|region                 =\n|city                   = [[Jena]]\n|state                  = [[Thuringia]]\n|province               =\n|county                 =\n|postcode               =\n|postalcode             =\n|zipcode                =\n|country                = Germany\n|country1               =\n|coordinates            = {{Coord|50|57|08|N|11|36|33|E|region:DE_type:edu_source:dewiki|display=inline,title}}\n|schooltype             =\n|fundingtype            =\n|type                   = German elite [[Gymnasium school|''Gymnasium'']] for maths, science, and technology\n|religious_affiliation  =\n|religion               =\n|denomination           =\n|patron                 =\n|established            = 1963\n|founded                =\n|opened                 =\n|founder                =\n|status                 =\n|closed                 =\n|locale                 =\n|schoolboard            =\n|district               =\n|LEA                    =\n|authority              =\n|category               =\n|category_label         =\n|oversight              =\n|oversight_label        =\n|authorizer             =\n|superintendent         =\n|trustee                =\n|specialist             =\n|session                =\n|schoolnumber           =\n|school code            =\n|MOE                    =\n|ofsted                 =\n|ceeb                   =\n|president              =\n|chair                  =\n|chairman               =\n|chairperson            =\n|dean                   =\n|administrator          =\n|rector                 =\n|director               =\n|principal              = Dr. Carsten M\u00fcller\n|principal_label        =\n|principal1             =\n|principal2             =\n|principal3             =\n|principal4             =\n|viceprincipal          =\n|viceprincipal_label    =\n|viceprincipal1         =\n|viceprincipal2         =\n|viceprincipal3         =\n|viceprincipal4         =\n|asst principal         =\n|assistant_principals   =\n|campus director        =\n|headmistress           =\n|headmaster             =\n|head of school         =\n|head_teacher           =\n|executive_headteacher  =\n|acting_headteacher     =\n|head                   =\n|head_label             =\n|chaplain               =\n|custodian              =\n|staff                  =\n|faculty                =\n|teaching_staff         =\n|employees              =\n|key_people             =\n|grades                 =\n|years                  =\n|gender                 = [[Coeducational]]\n|lower_age              =\n|upper_age              =\n|age range              =\n|enrollment              = ca. 500\n|website                = {{URL|http://carl-zeiss-gymnasium.de/}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' is a state-funded German elite [[Gymnasium school|Gymnasium]] ''(grammar school)'' for highly gifted students in the fields of math, science, and technology. Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. They accept students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far.

After deliberating for about nine hours, the jury delivered a verdict of guilty of second-degree murder and grand larceny. After a further two hours of deliberation, the jury recommended a 26-year sentence: 25 years for second-degree murder and one year for grand larceny.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brady |first=Erik |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/lacrosse/story/2012-02-22/virginia-lacrosse-trial-verdict-second-degree-murder/53211778/1 |title=George Huguely found guilty of second-degree murder |newspaper=USA Today |date=February 22, 2012}}</ref> The jury ruled out the \"heat of passion\" clause that characterizes voluntary manslaughter. A few of the jurors who spoke to the news media cited the importance of the videotape of Huguely's police interrogation, which was a central part of prosecutor Dave Chapman's case: the jury found that \"pretty much every opportunity he had, he lied first. He was not telling the truth on several occasions.\"\n\nOn May 8, 2012, non-jurors for the first time were able to see George Huguely in a 64-minute video in which he was told of Yeardley Love's death. As he was interrogated by police, Huguely admitted, \"I may have grabbed her neck\" and \"maybe I shook her a little bit.\" Huguely then retells the argument and fight that happened in Love's bedroom, demonstrating how he shook her and kicked her door. Eventually, the detective informs Huguely that Love is dead. Huguely reacts in disbelief and says \"Kill me.\" Because of the raw emotions seen in this tape, the jury is convinced that Love's murder was not premeditated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-huguely-evidence-yeardley-love-virginia_n_1518441|title=George Huguely V's Emotional Police Interrogation Video Shown To Public|last=McLaughlin|first=Michael|date=2012-05-15|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n===Conviction and sentencing===\nOn August 30, 2012, Huguely was formally sentenced to 23 years in prison by Judge Edward Hogshire, with sentences of 23 years for the second-degree murder conviction and one year for the grand larceny conviction to run concurrently.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/19418141/george-huguely-sentencing|title=George Huguely Sentenced to 23 Years|access-date=December 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Appeals process===\nThe [[Court of Appeals of Virginia]] issued a ruling on April 23, 2013, which granted Huguely an appeal based on two key issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/22089721/huguely-granted-hearing-on-appeal-of-murder-conviction|title=Huguely Granted Hearing on Appeal of Murder Conviction|access-date=December 29, 2016}}</ref> The court agreed with the defense's argument that Huguely's right to counsel was violated when one of his attorneys, Rhonda Quagliana, fell ill and missed a day of trial. The court also granted the appeal based on the failure to exclude \"Juror 32\" because of possible doubts about that juror's impartiality. The Court of Appeals then heard oral arguments from Huguely's new lawyer, [[Paul Clement]] (former [[Solicitor General of the United States]]), on December 11, 2013. Clement argued for a new trial, arguing Huguely was denied his right to an attorney when one of his two lawyers fell ill during the trial. Nine days into the trial, Huguely co-counsel Quagliana became visibly ill with stomach flu, but the trial judge refused to grant a continuance, even though Huguely objected: co-counsel Frances Lawrence was asked by the trial judge whether he could proceed without Quagliana and said he could. In addition to raising questions about \"Juror 32\", Huguely's appeal team also objected to the trial judge's refusal to allow \"[[blame the victim]]\" questions of jurors and said the jury was not properly instructed on the definition of \"[[Malice (law)|malice]]\", an element in a second-degree murder conviction.

Marta Murphy waited to speak out in respect for Love's family.

A few of the jurors who spoke to the news media cited the importance of the videotape of Huguely's police interrogation, which was a central part of prosecutor Dave Chapman's case: the jury found that \"pretty much every opportunity he had, he lied first. He was not telling the truth on several occasions.\"\n\nOn May 8, 2012, non-jurors for the first time were able to see George Huguely in a 64-minute video in which he was told of Yeardley Love's death. As he was interrogated by police, Huguely admitted, \"I may have grabbed her neck\" and \"maybe I shook her a little bit.\" Huguely then retells the argument and fight that happened in Love's bedroom, demonstrating how he shook her and kicked her door. Eventually, the detective informs Huguely that Love is dead. Huguely reacts in disbelief and says \"Kill me.\" Because of the raw emotions seen in this tape, the jury is convinced that Love's murder was not premeditated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-huguely-evidence-yeardley-love-virginia_n_1518441|title=George Huguely V's Emotional Police Interrogation Video Shown To Public|last=McLaughlin|first=Michael|date=2012-05-15|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n===Conviction and sentencing===\nOn August 30, 2012, Huguely was formally sentenced to 23 years in prison by Judge Edward Hogshire, with sentences of 23 years for the second-degree murder conviction and one year for the grand larceny conviction to run concurrently.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/19418141/george-huguely-sentencing|title=George Huguely Sentenced to 23 Years|access-date=December 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Appeals process===\nThe [[Court of Appeals of Virginia]] issued a ruling on April 23, 2013, which granted Huguely an appeal based on two key issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/22089721/huguely-granted-hearing-on-appeal-of-murder-conviction|title=Huguely Granted Hearing on Appeal of Murder Conviction|access-date=December 29, 2016}}</ref> The court agreed with the defense's argument that Huguely's right to counsel was violated when one of his attorneys, Rhonda Quagliana, fell ill and missed a day of trial. The court also granted the appeal based on the failure to exclude \"Juror 32\" because of possible doubts about that juror's impartiality. The Court of Appeals then heard oral arguments from Huguely's new lawyer, [[Paul Clement]] (former [[Solicitor General of the United States]]), on December 11, 2013. Clement argued for a new trial, arguing Huguely was denied his right to an attorney when one of his two lawyers fell ill during the trial. Nine days into the trial, Huguely co-counsel Quagliana became visibly ill with stomach flu, but the trial judge refused to grant a continuance, even though Huguely objected: co-counsel Frances Lawrence was asked by the trial judge whether he could proceed without Quagliana and said he could. In addition to raising questions about \"Juror 32\", Huguely's appeal team also objected to the trial judge's refusal to allow \"[[blame the victim]]\" questions of jurors and said the jury was not properly instructed on the definition of \"[[Malice (law)|malice]]\", an element in a second-degree murder conviction.

His writings dealt mainly with life in his native [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] under [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman rule]]. \n\nBorn in [[Travnik]] in the [[Austrian Empire]], modern-day [[Bosnia]], Andri\u0107 attended high school in [[Sarajevo]], where he became an active member of several [[South Slavs|South Slav]] national youth organizations.\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in June 1914, Andri\u0107 was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under [[house arrest]], only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in [[Zagreb]] and [[Graz]], eventually attaining his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the [[invasion of Yugoslavia|German-led invasion of his country]]. Shortly after the invasion, Andri\u0107 returned to German-occupied [[Belgrade]]. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions likened by some biographers to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including ''[[The Bridge on the Drina|Na Drini \u0107uprija]]'' (''The Bridge on the Drina'').\n\nFollowing the war, Andri\u0107 was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had since come under communist rule. In 1961, the [[Nobel Committee]] awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, selecting him over writers such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Robert Frost]], [[John Steinbeck]] and [[E. M. Forster]]. The Committee cited \"the epic force with which he&nbsp;... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history\". Afterwards, Andri\u0107's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andri\u0107's health declined substantially in late 1974 and he died in Belgrade the following March.\n\nIn the years following Andri\u0107's death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former [[Yugoslavia]] also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]] began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is [[Andri\u0107grad|named after Andri\u0107]]. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andri\u0107 was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works were long shunned for nationalist reasons, and even briefly blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution, but were rehabilitated by the literary community at the start of the 21st century. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to [[Serbian literature]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Family===\n[[File:Rodna ku\u0107a Ive Andri\u0107a u Travniku 0.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The house in which Andri\u0107 was born]]\nIvan Andri\u0107{{efn|Ivo is the [[Hypocorism|hypocoristic]] form of Andri\u0107's birth name, Ivan.

Culturally, the city boasted a strong Germanic element, and the curriculum in educational institutions was designed to reflect this. From a total of 83 teachers that worked at Andri\u0107's school over a twenty-year period, only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \"The teaching program,\" biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes, \"was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [Habsburg] Monarchy.\" Andri\u0107 disapproved. \"All that came&nbsp;... at secondary school and university,\" he wrote, \"was rough, crude, automatic, without concern, faith, humanity, warmth or love.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=13}}\n\nAndri\u0107 experienced difficulty in his studies, finding mathematics particularly challenging, and had to repeat the sixth grade. For a time, he lost his scholarship due to poor grades.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}} Hawkesworth attributes Andri\u0107's initial lack of academic success at least partly to his alienation from most of his teachers.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} Nonetheless, he excelled in languages, particularly Latin, Greek and German. Although he initially showed substantial interest in natural sciences, he later began focusing on literature, likely under the influence of his two Croat instructors, writer and politician [[\u0110uro \u0160urmin]] and poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Tugomir Alaupovi\u0107|2=hr|preserve=1}}. Of all his teachers in Sarajevo, Andri\u0107 liked Alaupovi\u0107 best, and the two became lifelong friends.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}}\n\nAndri\u0107 felt he was destined to become a writer. He began writing in secondary school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her one of his first works, she replied: \"Did you write this? What did you do that for?\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} Andri\u0107 published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called ''Bosanska vila'' (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to [[World War I]], his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as ''Vihor'' (Whirlwind), ''Savremenik'' (The Contemporary), ''Hrvatski pokret'' (The Croatian Movement), and ''Knji\u017eevne novine'' (Literary News). One of Andri\u0107's favorite literary forms was [[prose poetry|lyrical reflective prose]], and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian [[Wayne S. Vucinich]] describes Andri\u0107's poetry from this period as \"subjective and mostly melancholic\". Andri\u0107's translations of [[August Strindberg]], [[Walt Whitman]], and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=28}}\n\n===Student activism===\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote=The whole of our society is snoring ungracefully; only the poets and revolutionaries are awake.|source=~ Andri\u0107's view of pre-war Sarajevo.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=230}}}}\n\nIn 1908, Austria-Hungary officially [[Bosnian crisis|annexed]] Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the chagrin of South Slav nationalists like Andri\u0107.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=20}} In late 1911, Andri\u0107 was elected the first president of the Serbo-Croat Progressive Movement ({{lang-sh-Latn|links=no|Srpsko-Hrvatska Napredna Organizacija}}; SHNO),{{efn|The full name of the group was The Croat-Serb or Serb-Croat or Yugoslav Progressive Youth Movement.{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=153}}}} a Sarajevo-based secret society that promoted unity and friendship between Serb and Croat youth and opposed the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Its members were vehemently criticized by both Serb and Croat nationalists, who dismissed them as \"traitors to their nations\".{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=216}} Unfazed, Andri\u0107 continued agitating against the Austro-Hungarians. On 28 February 1912, he spoke before a crowd of 100 student protesters at Sarajevo's railway station, urging them to continue their demonstrations. The Austro-Hungarian police later began harassing and prosecuting SHNO members. Ten were expelled from their schools or penalized in some other way, though Andri\u0107 himself escaped punishment.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|pp=26\u201327}} Andri\u0107 also joined the South Slav student movement known as [[Young Bosnia]], becoming one of its most prominent members.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=41}}{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=90}}\n\nIn 1912, Andri\u0107 registered at the [[University of Zagreb]], having received a scholarship from an educational foundation in Sarajevo.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} He enrolled in the department of mathematics and natural sciences because these were the only fields for which scholarships were offered, but was able to take some courses in Croatian literature. Andri\u0107 was well received by South Slav nationalists there, and regularly participated in on-campus demonstrations. This led to his being reprimanded by the university. In 1913, after completing two semesters in Zagreb, Andri\u0107 transferred to the University of Vienna, where he resumed his studies. While in Vienna, he joined South Slav students in promoting the cause of Yugoslav unity and worked closely with two Yugoslav student societies, the Serbian cultural society ''Zora'' (Dawn) and the Croatian student club ''Zvonimir'', which shared his views on \"integral Yugoslavism\" (the eventual assimilation of all South Slav cultures into one).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=28}}\n\nDespite finding like-minded students in Vienna, the city's climate took a toll on Andri\u0107's health.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been taking part in a protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} For a time, Andri\u0107 had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} He transferred in early 1914.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} Andri\u0107 started his literary career as a poet. In 1914, he was one of the contributors to ''Hrvatska mlada lirika'' (Croatian Youth Lyrics) and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}}\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Ovcarevo monastery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ov\u010darevo monastery, [[Travnik]]]]\n\nOn 28 June 1914, Andri\u0107 learned of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in Sarajevo.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=15}} The assassin was [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Young Bosnian and close friend of Andri\u0107 who had been one of the first to join the SHNO in 1911.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=216}}{{efn|On one occasion, Princip asked Andri\u0107 to examine a poem he had written. Later, when Andri\u0107 inquired about the poem, Princip told him that he had destroyed it.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=194}}}} Upon hearing the news, Andri\u0107 decided to leave Krak\u00f3w and return to Bosnia. He travelled by train to Zagreb, and in mid-July, departed for the coastal city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] with his friend, the poet and fellow South Slav nationalist [[:hr:Vladimir \u010cerina|Vladimir \u010cerina]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} Andri\u0107 and \u010cerina spent the rest of July at the latter's summer home. As the month progressed, the two became increasingly uneasy about the [[July Crisis|escalating political crisis]] that followed the Archduke's assassination and eventually led to the outbreak of World War I. They then went to [[Rijeka]], where \u010cerina left Andri\u0107 without explanation, only saying he urgently needed to go to Italy. Several days later, Andri\u0107 learned that \u010cerina was being sought by the police.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=15}}\n\nBy the time war was declared, Andri\u0107 had returned to Split feeling exhausted and ill. Given that most of his friends had already been arrested for nationalist activities, he was certain the same fate would befall him.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=15}} Despite not being involved in the assassination plot,{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=233}} in late July or early August,{{efn|Disagreement exists as to the exact date. Hawkesworth writes that Andri\u0107 was arrested on 29 July,{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=15}} while Vucinich gives the date as 4 August.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}}}} Andri\u0107 was arrested for \"anti-state activities\", and imprisoned in Split.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} He was subsequently transferred to a prison in [[\u0160ibenik]], then to Rijeka and finally to [[Maribor]], where he arrived on 19 August.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=16}} Plagued by tuberculosis, Andri\u0107 passed the time reading, talking to his cellmates and learning languages.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}}\n\nBy the following year, the case against Andri\u0107 was dropped due to lack of evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=16}} The authorities exiled him to the village of [[Ov\u010darevo]], near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local [[Franciscan]] friars. Andri\u0107 soon befriended the [[friar]] Alojzije Per\u010dinli\u0107 and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} Andri\u0107 lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andri\u0107's mother soon came to visit him and offered to serve as the parish priest's housekeeper.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} \"Mother is very happy,\" Andri\u0107 wrote. \"It has been three whole years since she saw me. And she can't grasp all that has happened to me in that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=16}}\n\nAndri\u0107 was later transferred to a prison in [[Zenica]], where Per\u010dinli\u0107 regularly visited him. The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] declared Andri\u0107 a political threat in March 1917 and exempted him from armed service. He was thus registered with a non-combat unit until February of the following year. On 2 July 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]] declared a general amnesty for all of Austria-Hungary's political prisoners.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} His freedom of movement restored, Andri\u0107 visited Vi\u0161egrad and reunited with several of his school friends. He remained in Vi\u0161egrad until late July, when he was mobilized. Because of his poor health, Andri\u0107 was admitted to a Sarajevo hospital and thus avoided service. He was then transferred to the ''Reservospital'' in Zenica, where he received treatment for several months before continuing to Zagreb.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} There, Andri\u0107 again fell seriously ill and sought treatment at the Sisters of Mercy hospital, which had become a gathering place for dissidents and former political prisoners.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=17}}\n\nIn January 1918, Andri\u0107 joined several South Slav nationalists in editing a short-lived pan-Yugoslav periodical called ''Knji\u017eevni jug'' (Literary South).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} Here and in other periodicals, Andri\u0107 published book reviews, plays, verse, and translations. Over the course of several months in early 1918, Andri\u0107's health began to deteriorate, and his friends believed he was nearing death.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=17}} However, he recovered and spent the spring of 1918 in [[Krapina]] writing ''Ex ponto'', a book of prose poetry that was published in July.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} It was his first book.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}}\n\n==Interwar period==\nThe end of World War I saw the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, which was replaced by a newly established South Slav state, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929).{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=17}} In late 1918, Andri\u0107 re-enrolled at the University of Zagreb and resumed his studies.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} By January 1919, he fell ill again and was back in the hospital. Fellow writer [[Ivo Vojnovi\u0107]] became worried for his friend's life and appealed to Andri\u0107's old schoolteacher Tugomir Alaupovi\u0107 (who had just been appointed the new kingdom's Minister of Religious Affairs) to use his connections and help Andri\u0107 pay for treatment abroad.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}} In February, Andri\u0107 wrote Alaupovi\u0107 and asked for help finding a government job in Belgrade. Eventually, Andri\u0107 chose to seek treatment in Split, where he stayed for the following six months.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}} During his time on the [[Mediterranean]] coast, Andri\u0107 completed a second volume of prose poetry, titled ''Nemiri'' (Unrest),{{efn|\"Unrest\" is Vucinich's translation of the title.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}} Hawkesworth translates it as \"Anxieties\".{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}}}} which was published the following year. By the time Andri\u0107 left, he had almost fully recovered, and quipped that he was cured by the \"air, sun and figs.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}} Troubled by news that his uncle was seriously ill, Andri\u0107 left Split in August and went to him in Vi\u0161egrad.

In a correspondence dated December 1918, Vojnovi\u0107 described the young writer as \"a Catholic&nbsp;... a Serb from Bosnia.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}}{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|loc=p. 304, note 52}} By 1919, Andri\u0107 had acquired his undergraduate degree in South Slavic history and literature at the University of Zagreb.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}} He was perennially impoverished, and earned a meagre sum through his writing and editorial work. By mid-1919, he realized that he would be unable to financially support himself and his aging mother, aunt and uncle for much longer, and his appeals to Alaupovi\u0107 for help securing a government job became more frequent. In September 1919, Alaupovi\u0107 offered him a secretarial position at the Ministry of Religion, which Andri\u0107 accepted.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}}\n\nIn late October, Andri\u0107 left for [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=19}} He became involved in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andri\u0107 disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=20}} At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupovi\u0107 asking for a transfer to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Yugoslavia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. On 20 February, Andri\u0107's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's mission at the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}}\n\nAndri\u0107 left Belgrade soon after, and reported for duty in late February. At this time, he published his first short story, ''Put Alije \u0110erzeleza'' (The Journey of [[\u0110erzelez Alija|Alija \u0110erzelez]]).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} He complained that the consulate was understaffed and that he did not have enough time to write. All evidence suggests he had a strong distaste for the ceremony and pomp that accompanied his work in the diplomatic service, but according to Hawkesworth, he endured it with \"dignified good grace\".{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=20}} Around this time, he began writing in the [[Shtokavian dialect#The yat reflexes|Ekavian dialect]] used in Serbia, and ceased writing in the Ijekavian dialect used in his native Bosnia.{{sfn|Popovi\u0107|1989|p=36}} Andri\u0107 soon requested another assignment, and in November, he was transferred to [[Bucharest]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} Once again, his health deteriorated.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=22}} Nevertheless, Andri\u0107 found his consular duties there did not require much effort, so he focused on writing, contributed articles to a Romanian journal and even had time to visit his family in Bosnia. In 1922, Andri\u0107 requested another reassignment. He was transferred to the consulate in [[Trieste]], where he arrived on 9 December.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} The city's damp climate only caused Andri\u0107's health to deteriorate further, and on his doctor's advice, he transferred to [[Graz]] in January 1923.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=23}} He arrived in the city on 23 January, and was appointed vice-consul.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} Andri\u0107 soon enrolled at the [[University of Graz]], resumed his schooling and began working on his doctoral dissertation in [[Slavic studies]].{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=23}}\n\n===Advancement===\n[[File:Graz University main-front.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Andri\u0107 completed his doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Graz]].]]\n\nIn August 1923, Andri\u0107 experienced an unexpected career setback. A law had been passed stipulating that all civil servants had to have a doctoral degree. As Andri\u0107 had not completed his dissertation, he was informed that his employment would be terminated. Andri\u0107's well-connected friends intervened on his behalf and appealed to Foreign Minister [[Mom\u010dilo Nin\u010di\u0107]], citing Andri\u0107's diplomatic and linguistic abilities. In February 1924, the Foreign Ministry decided to retain Andri\u0107 as a day worker with the salary of a vice-consul. This gave him the opportunity to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. Three months later, on 24 May, Andri\u0107 submitted his dissertation to a committee of examiners at the University of Graz, who gave it their approval.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} This allowed Andri\u0107 to take the examinations necessary for his Ph.D to be confirmed. He passed both his exams, and on 13 July, received his Ph.D. The committee of examiners recommended that Andri\u0107's dissertation be published. Andri\u0107 chose the title ''Die Entwicklung des geistigen Lebens in Bosnien unter der Einwirkung der t\u00fcrkischen Herrschaft'' (The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia Under the Influence of Turkish Rule).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=33}} In it, he characterized the Ottoman occupation as [[:wikt:under the yoke|a yoke]] that still loomed over Bosnia.{{sfn|Carmichael|2015|p=62}} \"The effect of Turkish rule was absolutely negative,\" he wrote. \"The Turks could bring no cultural content or sense of higher mission, even to those [[South Slavic Muslims|South Slavs who accepted Islam]].\"{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=100}}\n\nSeveral days after receiving his Ph.D, Andri\u0107 wrote the Foreign Minister asking to be reinstated and submitted a copy of his dissertation, university documents and a medical certification that deemed him to be in good health. In September, the Foreign Ministry granted his request. Andri\u0107 stayed in Graz until 31 October, when he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's Belgrade headquarters. During the two years he was in Belgrade, Andri\u0107 spent much of his time writing.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=33}} His first collection of short stories was published in 1924, and he received a prize from the Serbian Royal Academy (of which he became a full-fledged member in February 1926). In October 1926, he was assigned to the consulate in [[Marseille]] and again appointed vice-consul.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=24}} On 9 December 1926, he was transferred to the Yugoslav embassy in Paris.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=33}} Andri\u0107's time in France was marked by increasing loneliness and isolation. His uncle had died in 1924, his mother the following year, and upon arriving in France, he was informed that his aunt had died as well. \"Apart from official contacts,\" he wrote Alaupovi\u0107, \"I have no company whatever.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=24}} Andri\u0107 spent much of his time in the Paris archives poring over the reports of the French consulate in Travnik between 1809 and 1814, material he would use in ''Travni\u010dka hronika'' (Travnik Chronicle),{{efn|Hawkesworth and Vucinich translate ''Travni\u010dka hronika'' as \"Bosnian Story\".{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=34}}{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=28}} \"Travnik Chronicle\" is a more accurate translation.{{sfn|Google Translate, Travni\u010dka hronika}}}} one of his future novels.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=33}}\n\nIn April 1928, Andri\u0107 was posted to [[Madrid]] as vice-consul. While there, he wrote essays on [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and [[Francisco Goya]], and began work on the novel ''Prokleta avlija'' (The Damned Yard). In June 1929, he was named secretary of the Yugoslav [[legation]] to Belgium and [[Luxembourg]] in [[Brussels]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=33}} On 1 January 1930, he was sent to Switzerland as part of Yugoslavia's permanent delegation to the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]], and was named deputy delegate the following year. In 1933, Andri\u0107 returned to Belgrade; two years later, he was named head of the political department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]], and a regency council led by Peter's uncle [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]] was established to rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], pledging support for Germany and Italy.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=26}} Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andri\u0107's back, in his capacity as ambassador he was obliged to attend the document's signing in Berlin.{{sfn|Bazdulj|2009|p=225}} Andri\u0107 had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers' demands for as long as possible.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|pp=199\u2013200}} He was highly critical of the move, and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, a group of pro-Western [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrew]] the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted [[Adolf Hitler]] to order Yugoslavia's [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]].{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=26}} Given these circumstances, Andri\u0107's position was an extremely difficult one.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=25}} Nevertheless, he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=26}}\n\nPrior to their invasion of his country, the Germans had offered Andri\u0107 the opportunity to evacuate to neutral Switzerland.

At one point in his youth, Andri\u0107 even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=3}}\n\nMuch of Andri\u0107's work was inspired by the traditions and peculiarities of life in Bosnia, and examines the complexity and cultural contrasts of the region's Muslim, Serb and Croat inhabitants. His two best known novels, ''Na Drini \u0107uprija'' and ''Travni\u010dka hronika'', subtly contrast Ottoman Bosnia's \"oriental\" propensities to the \"Western atmosphere\" first introduced by the French and later the Austro-Hungarians.{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} His works contain many words of Turkish, Arabic or Persian origin that found their way into the languages of the South Slavs during Ottoman rule. According to Vucinich, Andri\u0107 uses these words to \"express oriental nuances and subtleties that cannot be rendered as well in his own Serbo-Croatian\".{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}}\n\nIn the opinion of literary historian [[Nikola Morav\u010devi\u0107|Nicholas Moravcevich]], Andri\u0107's work \"frequently betrays his profound sadness over the misery and waste inherent in the passing of time\".{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} ''Na Drini \u0107uprija'' remains his most famous novel and has received the most scholarly analysis of all his works. Most scholars have interpreted the eponymous bridge as a [[metonym]] for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Wachtel|1998|p=161}} In his Nobel acceptance speech, Andri\u0107 described the country as one \"which, at break-neck speed and at the cost of great sacrifices and prodigious efforts, is trying in all fields, including the field of culture, to make up for those things of which it has been deprived by a singularly turbulent and hostile past.\"{{sfn|Carmichael|2015|p=107}} In Andri\u0107's view, the seemingly conflicting positions of Yugoslavia's disparate ethnic groups could be overcome by knowing one's history. This, he surmised, would help future generations avoid the mistakes of the past, and was in line with his cyclical view of time. Andri\u0107 expressed hope that these differences could be bridged and \"histories demystified\".{{sfn|Wachtel|1998|p=216}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Belgrade Book Fair 3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Andri\u0107 signing books at the [[Belgrade Book Fair]]]]\nShortly before his death, Andri\u0107 stated that he wished for all his possessions to be preserved as part of an endowment to be used for \"general cultural and humanitarian purposes\". In March 1976, an administrative committee decided that the purpose of the endowment would be to promote the study of Andri\u0107's work, as well as art and literature in general. The Ivo Andri\u0107 Endowment has since organized a number of international conferences, made grants to foreign scholars studying the writer's works and offered financial aid to cover the publication costs of books relating to Andri\u0107. An annual yearbook, titled ''Sveske Zadu\u017ebine Ive Andri\u0107a'' (The Journals of the Ivo Andri\u0107 Endowment), is published by the organization. Andri\u0107's [[will and testament]] stipulated that an award be given annually to the author of each subsequent year's best collection of short stories.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=36}} The street that runs beside Belgrade's [[Novi dvor|New Palace]], now the seat of the [[President of Serbia]], was posthumously named ''Andri\u0107ev venac'' (Andri\u0107's Crescent) in his honour. It includes a life-sized statue of the writer. The flat in which Andri\u0107 spent his final years has been turned into a museum.{{sfn|Norris|2008|pp=100, 237}} Opened over a year after Andri\u0107's death, it houses books, manuscripts, documents, photographs and personal belongings.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=36}} Several of Serbia's other major cities, such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Kragujevac]], have streets named after Andri\u0107.<ref>{{harvnb|Google Maps, Novi Sad}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Kragujevac}}</ref> Streets in a number of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Vi\u0161egrad, also carry his name.<ref>{{harvnb|Google Maps, Sarajevo}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Banja Luka}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Tuzla}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Vi\u0161egrad}}</ref>\n\nAndri\u0107 remains the only writer from the former Yugoslavia to have been awarded the Nobel Prize.{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} Given his use of the Ekavian dialect, and the fact that most of his novels and short stories were written in Belgrade, his works have become associated almost exclusively with [[Serbian literature]].{{sfn|Norris|1999|p=61}} The Slavonic studies professor [[Bojan Aleksov]] characterizes Andri\u0107 as one of Serbian literature's two central pillars, the other being Njego\u0161.{{sfn|Aleksov|2009|p=273}} \"The plasticity of his narrative,\" Moravcevich writes, \"the depth of his psychological insight, and the universality of his symbolism remain unsurpassed in all of Serbian literature.\"{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} Due to his self-identification as a Serb, many in the Bosniak and Croat literary establishments have come to \"reject or limit Andri\u0107's association with their literatures\".{{sfn|Norris|1999|p=61}} Following [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia's disintegration]] in the early 1990s, Andri\u0107's works were blacklisted in Croatia under [[President of Croatia|President]] [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]].{{sfn|Perica|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Cornis-Pope|2010|p=569}} The Croatian historian and politician [[Ivo Banac]] characterizes Andri\u0107 as a writer who \"missed the Chetnik train by a very small margin\".{{sfn|Banac|1992|p=xiii}} Though Andri\u0107 remains a controversial figure in Croatia, the Croatian literary establishment largely rehabilitated his works following Tu\u0111man's death in 1999.{{sfn|Primorac 6 September 2012}}\n\nBosniak scholars have objected to the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andri\u0107's works.{{sfn|Snel|2004|p=210}} During the 1950s, his most vocal Bosniak detractors accused him of being a [[plagiarism|plagiarist]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]] and Serbian nationalist. Some went so far as to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away. Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the [[Bosnian War]].{{sfn|Raki\u0107|2000|pp=82\u201387}} In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Vi\u0161egrad destroyed a statue of Andri\u0107 with a sledgehammer.{{sfn|Silber 20 September 1994}} In 2009, Nezim Halilovi\u0107, the [[imam]] of Sarajevo's [[King Fahd Mosque (Sarajevo)|King Fahd Mosque]], derided Andri\u0107 as a \"Chetnik ideologue\" during a sermon.{{sfn|Radio Television of Serbia 9 April 2009}} In 2012, the filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]] and Bosnian Serb [[President of Republika Srpska|President]] [[Milorad Dodik]] unveiled another statue of Andri\u0107 in Vi\u0161egrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town{{efn|An ethno-town or ethno-village is a tourist attraction that is designed to resemble a traditional settlement inhabited by a particular group of people.

His writings dealt mainly with life in his native [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] under [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman rule]]. \n\nBorn in [[Travnik]] in the [[Austrian Empire]], modern-day [[Bosnia]], Andri\u0107 attended high school in [[Sarajevo]], where he became an active member of several [[South Slavs|South Slav]] national youth organizations.\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in June 1914, Andri\u0107 was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under [[house arrest]], only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in [[Zagreb]] and [[Graz]], eventually attaining his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the [[invasion of Yugoslavia|German-led invasion of his country]]. Shortly after the invasion, Andri\u0107 returned to German-occupied [[Belgrade]]. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions likened by some biographers to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including ''[[The Bridge on the Drina|Na Drini \u0107uprija]]'' (''The Bridge on the Drina'').\n\nFollowing the war, Andri\u0107 was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had since come under communist rule. In 1961, the [[Nobel Committee]] awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, selecting him over writers such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Robert Frost]], [[John Steinbeck]] and [[E. M. Forster]]. The Committee cited \"the epic force with which he&nbsp;... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history\". Afterwards, Andri\u0107's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andri\u0107's health declined substantially in late 1974 and he died in Belgrade the following March.\n\nIn the years following Andri\u0107's death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former [[Yugoslavia]] also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]] began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is [[Andri\u0107grad|named after Andri\u0107]]. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andri\u0107 was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works were long shunned for nationalist reasons, and even briefly blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution, but were rehabilitated by the literary community at the start of the 21st century. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to [[Serbian literature]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Family===\n[[File:Rodna ku\u0107a Ive Andri\u0107a u Travniku 0.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The house in which Andri\u0107 was born]]\nIvan Andri\u0107{{efn|Ivo is the [[Hypocorism|hypocoristic]] form of Andri\u0107's birth name, Ivan.

Culturally, the city boasted a strong Germanic element, and the curriculum in educational institutions was designed to reflect this. From a total of 83 teachers that worked at Andri\u0107's school over a twenty-year period, only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \"The teaching program,\" biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes, \"was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [Habsburg] Monarchy.\" Andri\u0107 disapproved. \"All that came&nbsp;... at secondary school and university,\" he wrote, \"was rough, crude, automatic, without concern, faith, humanity, warmth or love.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=13}}\n\nAndri\u0107 experienced difficulty in his studies, finding mathematics particularly challenging, and had to repeat the sixth grade. For a time, he lost his scholarship due to poor grades.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}} Hawkesworth attributes Andri\u0107's initial lack of academic success at least partly to his alienation from most of his teachers.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} Nonetheless, he excelled in languages, particularly Latin, Greek and German. Although he initially showed substantial interest in natural sciences, he later began focusing on literature, likely under the influence of his two Croat instructors, writer and politician [[\u0110uro \u0160urmin]] and poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Tugomir Alaupovi\u0107|2=hr|preserve=1}}. Of all his teachers in Sarajevo, Andri\u0107 liked Alaupovi\u0107 best, and the two became lifelong friends.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}}\n\nAndri\u0107 felt he was destined to become a writer. He began writing in secondary school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her one of his first works, she replied: \"Did you write this? What did you do that for?\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} Andri\u0107 published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called ''Bosanska vila'' (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to [[World War I]], his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as ''Vihor'' (Whirlwind), ''Savremenik'' (The Contemporary), ''Hrvatski pokret'' (The Croatian Movement), and ''Knji\u017eevne novine'' (Literary News). One of Andri\u0107's favorite literary forms was [[prose poetry|lyrical reflective prose]], and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian [[Wayne S. Vucinich]] describes Andri\u0107's poetry from this period as \"subjective and mostly melancholic\". Andri\u0107's translations of [[August Strindberg]], [[Walt Whitman]], and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=28}}\n\n===Student activism===\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote=The whole of our society is snoring ungracefully; only the poets and revolutionaries are awake.|source=~ Andri\u0107's view of pre-war Sarajevo.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=230}}}}\n\nIn 1908, Austria-Hungary officially [[Bosnian crisis|annexed]] Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the chagrin of South Slav nationalists like Andri\u0107.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=20}} In late 1911, Andri\u0107 was elected the first president of the Serbo-Croat Progressive Movement ({{lang-sh-Latn|links=no|Srpsko-Hrvatska Napredna Organizacija}}; SHNO),{{efn|The full name of the group was The Croat-Serb or Serb-Croat or Yugoslav Progressive Youth Movement.{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=153}}}} a Sarajevo-based secret society that promoted unity and friendship between Serb and Croat youth and opposed the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Its members were vehemently criticized by both Serb and Croat nationalists, who dismissed them as \"traitors to their nations\".{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=216}} Unfazed, Andri\u0107 continued agitating against the Austro-Hungarians. On 28 February 1912, he spoke before a crowd of 100 student protesters at Sarajevo's railway station, urging them to continue their demonstrations. The Austro-Hungarian police later began harassing and prosecuting SHNO members. Ten were expelled from their schools or penalized in some other way, though Andri\u0107 himself escaped punishment.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|pp=26\u201327}} Andri\u0107 also joined the South Slav student movement known as [[Young Bosnia]], becoming one of its most prominent members.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=41}}{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=90}}\n\nIn 1912, Andri\u0107 registered at the [[University of Zagreb]], having received a scholarship from an educational foundation in Sarajevo.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} He enrolled in the department of mathematics and natural sciences because these were the only fields for which scholarships were offered, but was able to take some courses in Croatian literature. Andri\u0107 was well received by South Slav nationalists there, and regularly participated in on-campus demonstrations. This led to his being reprimanded by the university. In 1913, after completing two semesters in Zagreb, Andri\u0107 transferred to the University of Vienna, where he resumed his studies. While in Vienna, he joined South Slav students in promoting the cause of Yugoslav unity and worked closely with two Yugoslav student societies, the Serbian cultural society ''Zora'' (Dawn) and the Croatian student club ''Zvonimir'', which shared his views on \"integral Yugoslavism\" (the eventual assimilation of all South Slav cultures into one).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=28}}\n\nDespite finding like-minded students in Vienna, the city's climate took a toll on Andri\u0107's health.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been taking part in a protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} For a time, Andri\u0107 had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} He transferred in early 1914.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=14}} Andri\u0107 started his literary career as a poet. In 1914, he was one of the contributors to ''Hrvatska mlada lirika'' (Croatian Youth Lyrics) and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}}\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Ovcarevo monastery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ov\u010darevo monastery, [[Travnik]]]]\n\nOn 28 June 1914, Andri\u0107 learned of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in Sarajevo.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=15}} The assassin was [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Young Bosnian and close friend of Andri\u0107 who had been one of the first to join the SHNO in 1911.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=216}}{{efn|On one occasion, Princip asked Andri\u0107 to examine a poem he had written.

They then went to [[Rijeka]], where \u010cerina left Andri\u0107 without explanation, only saying he urgently needed to go to Italy. Several days later, Andri\u0107 learned that \u010cerina was being sought by the police.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=15}}\n\nBy the time war was declared, Andri\u0107 had returned to Split feeling exhausted and ill. Given that most of his friends had already been arrested for nationalist activities, he was certain the same fate would befall him.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=15}} Despite not being involved in the assassination plot,{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=233}} in late July or early August,{{efn|Disagreement exists as to the exact date.

He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local [[Franciscan]] friars. Andri\u0107 soon befriended the [[friar]] Alojzije Per\u010dinli\u0107 and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=29}} Andri\u0107 lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andri\u0107's mother soon came to visit him and offered to serve as the parish priest's housekeeper.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} \"Mother is very happy,\" Andri\u0107 wrote. \"It has been three whole years since she saw me.

Like a mother.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=16}}\n\nAndri\u0107 was later transferred to a prison in [[Zenica]], where Per\u010dinli\u0107 regularly visited him. The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] declared Andri\u0107 a political threat in March 1917 and exempted him from armed service. He was thus registered with a non-combat unit until February of the following year. On 2 July 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]] declared a general amnesty for all of Austria-Hungary's political prisoners.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} His freedom of movement restored, Andri\u0107 visited Vi\u0161egrad and reunited with several of his school friends. He remained in Vi\u0161egrad until late July, when he was mobilized. Because of his poor health, Andri\u0107 was admitted to a Sarajevo hospital and thus avoided service. He was then transferred to the ''Reservospital'' in Zenica, where he received treatment for several months before continuing to Zagreb.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} There, Andri\u0107 again fell seriously ill and sought treatment at the Sisters of Mercy hospital, which had become a gathering place for dissidents and former political prisoners.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=17}}\n\nIn January 1918, Andri\u0107 joined several South Slav nationalists in editing a short-lived pan-Yugoslav periodical called ''Knji\u017eevni jug'' (Literary South).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} Here and in other periodicals, Andri\u0107 published book reviews, plays, verse, and translations. Over the course of several months in early 1918, Andri\u0107's health began to deteriorate, and his friends believed he was nearing death.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=17}} However, he recovered and spent the spring of 1918 in [[Krapina]] writing ''Ex ponto'', a book of prose poetry that was published in July.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} It was his first book.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}}\n\n==Interwar period==\nThe end of World War I saw the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, which was replaced by a newly established South Slav state, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929).{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=17}} In late 1918, Andri\u0107 re-enrolled at the University of Zagreb and resumed his studies.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=30}} By January 1919, he fell ill again and was back in the hospital. Fellow writer [[Ivo Vojnovi\u0107]] became worried for his friend's life and appealed to Andri\u0107's old schoolteacher Tugomir Alaupovi\u0107 (who had just been appointed the new kingdom's Minister of Religious Affairs) to use his connections and help Andri\u0107 pay for treatment abroad.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}} In February, Andri\u0107 wrote Alaupovi\u0107 and asked for help finding a government job in Belgrade. Eventually, Andri\u0107 chose to seek treatment in Split, where he stayed for the following six months.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}} During his time on the [[Mediterranean]] coast, Andri\u0107 completed a second volume of prose poetry, titled ''Nemiri'' (Unrest),{{efn|\"Unrest\" is Vucinich's translation of the title.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}} Hawkesworth translates it as \"Anxieties\".{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}}}} which was published the following year.

In a correspondence dated December 1918, Vojnovi\u0107 described the young writer as \"a Catholic&nbsp;... a Serb from Bosnia.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=18}}{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|loc=p. 304, note 52}} By 1919, Andri\u0107 had acquired his undergraduate degree in South Slavic history and literature at the University of Zagreb.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}} He was perennially impoverished, and earned a meagre sum through his writing and editorial work. By mid-1919, he realized that he would be unable to financially support himself and his aging mother, aunt and uncle for much longer, and his appeals to Alaupovi\u0107 for help securing a government job became more frequent. In September 1919, Alaupovi\u0107 offered him a secretarial position at the Ministry of Religion, which Andri\u0107 accepted.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}}\n\nIn late October, Andri\u0107 left for [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=19}} He became involved in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andri\u0107 disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=20}} At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupovi\u0107 asking for a transfer to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Yugoslavia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. On 20 February, Andri\u0107's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's mission at the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=31}}\n\nAndri\u0107 left Belgrade soon after, and reported for duty in late February. At this time, he published his first short story, ''Put Alije \u0110erzeleza'' (The Journey of [[\u0110erzelez Alija|Alija \u0110erzelez]]).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} He complained that the consulate was understaffed and that he did not have enough time to write. All evidence suggests he had a strong distaste for the ceremony and pomp that accompanied his work in the diplomatic service, but according to Hawkesworth, he endured it with \"dignified good grace\".{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=20}} Around this time, he began writing in the [[Shtokavian dialect#The yat reflexes|Ekavian dialect]] used in Serbia, and ceased writing in the Ijekavian dialect used in his native Bosnia.{{sfn|Popovi\u0107|1989|p=36}} Andri\u0107 soon requested another assignment, and in November, he was transferred to [[Bucharest]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} Once again, his health deteriorated.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=22}} Nevertheless, Andri\u0107 found his consular duties there did not require much effort, so he focused on writing, contributed articles to a Romanian journal and even had time to visit his family in Bosnia. In 1922, Andri\u0107 requested another reassignment. He was transferred to the consulate in [[Trieste]], where he arrived on 9 December.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} The city's damp climate only caused Andri\u0107's health to deteriorate further, and on his doctor's advice, he transferred to [[Graz]] in January 1923.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=23}} He arrived in the city on 23 January, and was appointed vice-consul.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} Andri\u0107 soon enrolled at the [[University of Graz]], resumed his schooling and began working on his doctoral dissertation in [[Slavic studies]].{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=23}}\n\n===Advancement===\n[[File:Graz University main-front.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Andri\u0107 completed his doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Graz]].]]\n\nIn August 1923, Andri\u0107 experienced an unexpected career setback. A law had been passed stipulating that all civil servants had to have a doctoral degree. As Andri\u0107 had not completed his dissertation, he was informed that his employment would be terminated. Andri\u0107's well-connected friends intervened on his behalf and appealed to Foreign Minister [[Mom\u010dilo Nin\u010di\u0107]], citing Andri\u0107's diplomatic and linguistic abilities. In February 1924, the Foreign Ministry decided to retain Andri\u0107 as a day worker with the salary of a vice-consul. This gave him the opportunity to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. Three months later, on 24 May, Andri\u0107 submitted his dissertation to a committee of examiners at the University of Graz, who gave it their approval.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=32}} This allowed Andri\u0107 to take the examinations necessary for his Ph.D to be confirmed. He passed both his exams, and on 13 July, received his Ph.D. The committee of examiners recommended that Andri\u0107's dissertation be published. Andri\u0107 chose the title ''Die Entwicklung des geistigen Lebens in Bosnien unter der Einwirkung der t\u00fcrkischen Herrschaft'' (The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia Under the Influence of Turkish Rule).{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=33}} In it, he characterized the Ottoman occupation as [[:wikt:under the yoke|a yoke]] that still loomed over Bosnia.{{sfn|Carmichael|2015|p=62}} \"The effect of Turkish rule was absolutely negative,\" he wrote. \"The Turks could bring no cultural content or sense of higher mission, even to those [[South Slavic Muslims|South Slavs who accepted Islam]].\"{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=100}}\n\nSeveral days after receiving his Ph.D, Andri\u0107 wrote the Foreign Minister asking to be reinstated and submitted a copy of his dissertation, university documents and a medical certification that deemed him to be in good health. In September, the Foreign Ministry granted his request. Andri\u0107 stayed in Graz until 31 October, when he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's Belgrade headquarters. During the two years he was in Belgrade, Andri\u0107 spent much of his time writing.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=33}} His first collection of short stories was published in 1924, and he received a prize from the Serbian Royal Academy (of which he became a full-fledged member in February 1926).

He was decorated by the Presidium of the National Assembly for his services to the Yugoslav people in 1952.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=28}} In 1953, his career as a parliamentary deputy came to an end.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=35}} The following year, Andri\u0107 published the [[novella]] ''Prokleta avlija'' (The Damned Yard), which tells of life in an Ottoman prison in [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=35}} That December, he was admitted into the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], the country's ruling party. According to Hawkesworth, it is unlikely he joined the party out of ideological conviction, but rather to \"serve his country as fully as possible\".{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=28}}\n\nOn 27 September 1958, the 66-year-old Andri\u0107 married Milica Babi\u0107, a costume designer at the [[National Theatre of Serbia]] who was almost twenty years his junior.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=35}} Earlier, he had announced it was \"probably better\" that a writer never marry. \"He was perpetually persecuted by a kind of fear,\" a close friend recalled. \"It seemed as though he had been born afraid, and that is why he married so late. He simply did not dare enter that area of life.\"{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=29}}\n\n===Nobel Prize, international recognition and death===\n[[File:S. Kragujevic, Andric na vest o N. nagradi 1961.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Andri\u0107 with his wife Milica upon learning he had won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\nBy the late 1950s, Andri\u0107's works had been translated into a number of languages. On 26 October 1961, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] by the [[Swedish Academy]].{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=29}} Documents released 50 years later revealed that the [[Nobel Committee]] had selected Andri\u0107 over writers such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Robert Frost]], [[John Steinbeck]] and [[E.M. Forster]].{{sfn|''BBC News'' 6 January 2012}}{{sfn|Flood 5 January 2012}} The Committee cited \"the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country's history\".{{sfn|Frenz|1999|p=561}} Once the news was announced, Andri\u0107's Belgrade apartment was swarmed by reporters, and he publicly thanked the Nobel Committee for selecting him as the winner of that year's prize.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=29}} Andri\u0107 donated the entirety of his prize money, which amounted to some 30 million [[Yugoslav dinar|dinar]]s, and prescribed that it be used to purchase library books in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2001|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\nThe Nobel Prize ensured Andri\u0107 received global recognition. The following March, he fell ill while on a trip to [[Cairo]] and had to return to Belgrade for an operation. He was obliged to cancel all promotional events in Europe and North America, but his works continued to be reprinted and translated into numerous languages. Judging by letters he wrote at the time, Andri\u0107 felt burdened by the attention but did his best not to show it publicly.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=30}} Upon receiving the Nobel Prize, the number of awards and honours bestowed upon him multiplied. He received the Order of the Republic in 1962, as well as 27 July Award of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] Award in 1967, and the [[Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour]] in 1972.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=36}} In addition to being a member of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslav]] and [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Serbian]] academies of sciences and arts, he also became a correspondent of their [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] and [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Slovenian]] counterparts, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]], [[University of Sarajevo|Sarajevo]] and Krak\u00f3w.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=35}}\n\nAndri\u0107's wife died on 16 March 1968. His health deteriorated steadily and he travelled little in his final years. He continued to write until 1974, when his health took another turn for the worse. In December 1974, he was admitted to a Belgrade hospital.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=30}} He soon fell into a coma, and died in the [[Military Medical Academy (Serbia)|Military Medical Academy]] at 1:15&nbsp;a.m. on 13 March 1975, aged 82. His remains were cremated, and on 24 April, the [[urn]] containing his ashes was buried at the Alley of Distinguished Citizens in Belgrade's [[New Cemetery, Belgrade|New Cemetery]].{{sfn|Popovi\u0107|1989|p=112}} The ceremony was attended by about 10,000 residents of Belgrade.{{sfn|Hawkesworth|1984|p=30}}{{sfn|Popovi\u0107|1989|p=112}}\n\n==Influences, style and themes==\n[[File:Cuprija na Drini u Visegradu.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], the eponymous bridge on the Drina]]\nAndri\u0107 was an avid reader in his youth. The young Andri\u0107's literary interests varied greatly, ranging from the Greek and Latin [[Classics]] to the works of past and contemporary literary figures, including German and Austrian writers such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Thomas Mann]], the French writers [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Guy de Maupassant]], and the British writers [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Walter Scott]] and [[Joseph Conrad]]. Andri\u0107 also read the works of the Spanish writer [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the Italian poet and philosopher [[Giacomo Leopardi]], the Russian writer [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], the Norwegian writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], the American writers [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Henry James]], and the Czechoslovak philosopher [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}} Andri\u0107 was especially fond of Polish literature, and later stated that it had greatly influenced him. He held several Serb writers in high esteem, particularly Karad\u017ei\u0107, Njego\u0161, Ko\u010di\u0107 and [[Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}} Andri\u0107 also admired the Slovene poets [[Fran Levstik]], [[Josip Murn]] and [[Oton \u017dupan\u010di\u010d]], and translated some of their works.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|pp=2\u20133}} Kafka appears to have had a significant influence on Andri\u0107's prose, and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]. At one point in his youth, Andri\u0107 even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=3}}\n\nMuch of Andri\u0107's work was inspired by the traditions and peculiarities of life in Bosnia, and examines the complexity and cultural contrasts of the region's Muslim, Serb and Croat inhabitants. His two best known novels, ''Na Drini \u0107uprija'' and ''Travni\u010dka hronika'', subtly contrast Ottoman Bosnia's \"oriental\" propensities to the \"Western atmosphere\" first introduced by the French and later the Austro-Hungarians.{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} His works contain many words of Turkish, Arabic or Persian origin that found their way into the languages of the South Slavs during Ottoman rule. According to Vucinich, Andri\u0107 uses these words to \"express oriental nuances and subtleties that cannot be rendered as well in his own Serbo-Croatian\".{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=2}}\n\nIn the opinion of literary historian [[Nikola Morav\u010devi\u0107|Nicholas Moravcevich]], Andri\u0107's work \"frequently betrays his profound sadness over the misery and waste inherent in the passing of time\".{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} ''Na Drini \u0107uprija'' remains his most famous novel and has received the most scholarly analysis of all his works. Most scholars have interpreted the eponymous bridge as a [[metonym]] for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Wachtel|1998|p=161}} In his Nobel acceptance speech, Andri\u0107 described the country as one \"which, at break-neck speed and at the cost of great sacrifices and prodigious efforts, is trying in all fields, including the field of culture, to make up for those things of which it has been deprived by a singularly turbulent and hostile past.\"{{sfn|Carmichael|2015|p=107}} In Andri\u0107's view, the seemingly conflicting positions of Yugoslavia's disparate ethnic groups could be overcome by knowing one's history. This, he surmised, would help future generations avoid the mistakes of the past, and was in line with his cyclical view of time. Andri\u0107 expressed hope that these differences could be bridged and \"histories demystified\".{{sfn|Wachtel|1998|p=216}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Belgrade Book Fair 3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Andri\u0107 signing books at the [[Belgrade Book Fair]]]]\nShortly before his death, Andri\u0107 stated that he wished for all his possessions to be preserved as part of an endowment to be used for \"general cultural and humanitarian purposes\". In March 1976, an administrative committee decided that the purpose of the endowment would be to promote the study of Andri\u0107's work, as well as art and literature in general. The Ivo Andri\u0107 Endowment has since organized a number of international conferences, made grants to foreign scholars studying the writer's works and offered financial aid to cover the publication costs of books relating to Andri\u0107. An annual yearbook, titled ''Sveske Zadu\u017ebine Ive Andri\u0107a'' (The Journals of the Ivo Andri\u0107 Endowment), is published by the organization. Andri\u0107's [[will and testament]] stipulated that an award be given annually to the author of each subsequent year's best collection of short stories.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=36}} The street that runs beside Belgrade's [[Novi dvor|New Palace]], now the seat of the [[President of Serbia]], was posthumously named ''Andri\u0107ev venac'' (Andri\u0107's Crescent) in his honour. It includes a life-sized statue of the writer. The flat in which Andri\u0107 spent his final years has been turned into a museum.{{sfn|Norris|2008|pp=100, 237}} Opened over a year after Andri\u0107's death, it houses books, manuscripts, documents, photographs and personal belongings.{{sfn|Vucinich|1995|p=36}} Several of Serbia's other major cities, such as [[Novi Sad]] and [[Kragujevac]], have streets named after Andri\u0107.<ref>{{harvnb|Google Maps, Novi Sad}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Kragujevac}}</ref> Streets in a number of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Vi\u0161egrad, also carry his name.<ref>{{harvnb|Google Maps, Sarajevo}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Banja Luka}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Tuzla}}, {{harvnb|Google Maps, Vi\u0161egrad}}</ref>\n\nAndri\u0107 remains the only writer from the former Yugoslavia to have been awarded the Nobel Prize.{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} Given his use of the Ekavian dialect, and the fact that most of his novels and short stories were written in Belgrade, his works have become associated almost exclusively with [[Serbian literature]].{{sfn|Norris|1999|p=61}} The Slavonic studies professor [[Bojan Aleksov]] characterizes Andri\u0107 as one of Serbian literature's two central pillars, the other being Njego\u0161.{{sfn|Aleksov|2009|p=273}} \"The plasticity of his narrative,\" Moravcevich writes, \"the depth of his psychological insight, and the universality of his symbolism remain unsurpassed in all of Serbian literature.\"{{sfn|Moravcevich|1980|p=23}} Due to his self-identification as a Serb, many in the Bosniak and Croat literary establishments have come to \"reject or limit Andri\u0107's association with their literatures\".{{sfn|Norris|1999|p=61}} Following [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia's disintegration]] in the early 1990s, Andri\u0107's works were blacklisted in Croatia under [[President of Croatia|President]] [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]].{{sfn|Perica|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Cornis-Pope|2010|p=569}} The Croatian historian and politician [[Ivo Banac]] characterizes Andri\u0107 as a writer who \"missed the Chetnik train by a very small margin\".{{sfn|Banac|1992|p=xiii}} Though Andri\u0107 remains a controversial figure in Croatia, the Croatian literary establishment largely rehabilitated his works following Tu\u0111man's death in 1999.{{sfn|Primorac 6 September 2012}}\n\nBosniak scholars have objected to the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andri\u0107's works.{{sfn|Snel|2004|p=210}} During the 1950s, his most vocal Bosniak detractors accused him of being a [[plagiarism|plagiarist]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]] and Serbian nationalist. Some went so far as to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away. Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the [[Bosnian War]].{{sfn|Raki\u0107|2000|pp=82\u201387}} In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Vi\u0161egrad destroyed a statue of Andri\u0107 with a sledgehammer.{{sfn|Silber 20 September 1994}} In 2009, Nezim Halilovi\u0107, the [[imam]] of Sarajevo's [[King Fahd Mosque (Sarajevo)|King Fahd Mosque]], derided Andri\u0107 as a \"Chetnik ideologue\" during a sermon.{{sfn|Radio Television of Serbia 9 April 2009}} In 2012, the filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]] and Bosnian Serb [[President of Republika Srpska|President]] [[Milorad Dodik]] unveiled another statue of Andri\u0107 in Vi\u0161egrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town{{efn|An ethno-town or ethno-village is a tourist attraction that is designed to resemble a traditional settlement inhabited by a particular group of people.

Because of the difficulties in making a living, many people have left the rural county to seek work elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==History==\n\nIncorporated in 1836, the city of Lexington was founded by European-American settlers after most of the [[Choctaw people]], who had long occupied this area, were forced to cede their land to the United States and remove to the [[Indian Territory]]. The new settlers initially developed riverfront land along the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] and Black rivers for cotton plantations, primarily worked by enslaved African Americans. The slaves were brought by planters with them from the [[Upper South]] or transported in the domestic [[slave trade]]. In total, more than one million African Americans were transported to the [[Deep South]], breaking up many families. The African-descended slaves soon constituted the majority of the Holmes County population.\n\nOn court days, the town served as a trading center for the county and attracted retail merchants. Lexington was a destination in the 1830s of some German-Jewish immigrants, who often became merchants. They were joined much later in the century by Russian Jewish immigrants. The Jewish community built Temple Beth El in Lexington in 1905; it closed in 2009 because of declining population.<ref name=\"daily\">[http://forward.com/articles/114913/ \"A Final Yom Kippur in the Delta for Mississippi Community Begun in 1830s\"], ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''</ref> During the plantation era, the city was bustling, as planters grew wealthy from the booming demand for [[cotton]] in the North and Europe.\n\nAmong the early settlers in the 1830s was German-Jewish immigrant Jacob Sontheimer, who first worked caring for an elderly planter. After being bequeathed land, Sontheimer later became a merchant in town. His two daughters, Rose and Bettie, also became merchants, managing the Sontheimer business. He was joined by other Jewish immigrants from Germany, totaling about 20 by the late 1870s and 50 by 1900. In the later years Jewish immigrants also came from eastern Europe to Lexington. They developed tailoring and grocery businesses; the Lewis Grocery Store developed into a major wholesaler in the state.<ref name=\"daily\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isjl.org/mississippi-lexington-encyclopedia.html|title=ISJL - Mississippi Lexington Encyclopedia|website=Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, [[freedmen]] in Holmes County, who constituted the majority of the population, joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and elected several county sheriffs and other local officers. They sought education and some became landowners, clearing land in the bottomlands and selling their timber to raise money for purchase. This progress was before 1890, when they were essentially [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|deprived of the vote]] by the state legislature passing a new constitution, which created barriers to voter registration and forced them out of politics for decades into the late 20th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financial recession and lack of political clout meant that many freedmen lost their land; within a generation they had regressed to the status of [[sharecropper]] and [[tenant farmer]].\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[Edmund F. Noel]], an attorney in Lexington, was a son of planters Leland and Margaret Noel, from Virginia and North Carolina, respectively. His father had developed cotton plantations in Holmes County in the antebellum period. The younger Noel became a politician, elected as a state legislator and later as District Attorney. In 1906 he was elected as governor of Mississippi, serving through 1912. His house at North Street is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for its distinctive architecture, and is known as the \"Gov. Edmond F. Noel House\". It was bequeathed to him by his mother.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Mississippi planters recruited Chinese immigrant workers to satisfy the demand for farm labor, and some came to Holmes County. As the area suffered from the [[boll weevil]] infestation, the cotton crops suffered. Agricultural mechanization reduced the need for farm labor, leading to a decline in county and town populations from the 1930s on. Many African Americans left the South for northern and midwestern industrial cities, seeking more opportunities and escape from the violence of [[lynching]]s and oppression of [[Jim Crow]] rules.\n\nIn the 1940s, two lynchings of black men took place in or near Lexington: singer [[B.B. King]] later recounted having seen a youth hanged in the courthouse square during the short time he was living there as a teenager, about 1942\u20131944. The body of 35-year-old Leon McTatie was found on 24 July 1946 in a bayou in nearby Sunflower County. He was beaten to death for allegedly stealing a saddle. Six white men were charged in his lynching but quickly acquitted at trial.<ref name=\"charge\">[http://depts.washington.edu/moves/CRC_genocide.shtml Susan Glenn, \" 'We Charge Genocide': The 1951 Black Lives Matter Campaign\"], ''Mapping American Social Movements through the 20th Century'', University of Washington website; retrieved 9 March 2018</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NoMEb-QV2_8C&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=1945+lynching+of+McTatie&source=bl&ots=Rd4c-DXr3O&sig=0PB_1CNMaMWeJZ-hrBwehpwy5Qg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSo9aV7d_ZAhXOtlMKHYQ2DbwQ6AEIZDAF#v=onepage&q=1945%20lynching%20of%20McTatie&f=false Jason Sokol, ''There Goes My Everything: White Southerners in the Age of Civil Rights, 1945-1975''], Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2008, p. 28</ref>\n\nLexington was distinguished by two nationally known women: [[Arenia Mallory]], an African-American music teacher from Illinois, started teaching at the newly established [[Saints Academy (Mississippi)|Saints Academy]] in Lexington in 1926, which was affiliated with the [[Church of God in Christ]]. She led the school for more than 50 years, expanding its programs to grades 1-12, and establishing a junior college. She developed the school from the early 20th century as a model of academic excellence for African-American students. During her long tenure, she also founded an associated junior college. During the 1960s, she was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to national positions and committees in the federal government.\n\n[[Hazel Brannon Smith]], a white woman from an upper-class family, was based in Lexington, where she owned and published several rural newspapers. She promoted integration and change in the region during the civil rights era, winning a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her editorials in 1964, the year of [[Freedom Summer]] and the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]], organized by African Americans before the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 was passed by Congress.\n\n==Geography==\nLexington is in the center of Holmes County on the north side of the valley of Black Creek, a west-flowing tributary of the [[Yazoo River]].

Because of the difficulties in making a living, many people have left the rural county to seek work elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==History==\n\nIncorporated in 1836, the city of Lexington was founded by European-American settlers after most of the [[Choctaw people]], who had long occupied this area, were forced to cede their land to the United States and remove to the [[Indian Territory]]. The new settlers initially developed riverfront land along the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] and Black rivers for cotton plantations, primarily worked by enslaved African Americans. The slaves were brought by planters with them from the [[Upper South]] or transported in the domestic [[slave trade]]. In total, more than one million African Americans were transported to the [[Deep South]], breaking up many families. The African-descended slaves soon constituted the majority of the Holmes County population.\n\nOn court days, the town served as a trading center for the county and attracted retail merchants. Lexington was a destination in the 1830s of some German-Jewish immigrants, who often became merchants. They were joined much later in the century by Russian Jewish immigrants. The Jewish community built Temple Beth El in Lexington in 1905; it closed in 2009 because of declining population.<ref name=\"daily\">[http://forward.com/articles/114913/ \"A Final Yom Kippur in the Delta for Mississippi Community Begun in 1830s\"], ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''</ref> During the plantation era, the city was bustling, as planters grew wealthy from the booming demand for [[cotton]] in the North and Europe.\n\nAmong the early settlers in the 1830s was German-Jewish immigrant Jacob Sontheimer, who first worked caring for an elderly planter. After being bequeathed land, Sontheimer later became a merchant in town. His two daughters, Rose and Bettie, also became merchants, managing the Sontheimer business. He was joined by other Jewish immigrants from Germany, totaling about 20 by the late 1870s and 50 by 1900. In the later years Jewish immigrants also came from eastern Europe to Lexington. They developed tailoring and grocery businesses; the Lewis Grocery Store developed into a major wholesaler in the state.<ref name=\"daily\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isjl.org/mississippi-lexington-encyclopedia.html|title=ISJL - Mississippi Lexington Encyclopedia|website=Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, [[freedmen]] in Holmes County, who constituted the majority of the population, joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and elected several county sheriffs and other local officers. They sought education and some became landowners, clearing land in the bottomlands and selling their timber to raise money for purchase. This progress was before 1890, when they were essentially [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|deprived of the vote]] by the state legislature passing a new constitution, which created barriers to voter registration and forced them out of politics for decades into the late 20th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financial recession and lack of political clout meant that many freedmen lost their land; within a generation they had regressed to the status of [[sharecropper]] and [[tenant farmer]].\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[Edmund F. Noel]], an attorney in Lexington, was a son of planters Leland and Margaret Noel, from Virginia and North Carolina, respectively. His father had developed cotton plantations in Holmes County in the antebellum period. The younger Noel became a politician, elected as a state legislator and later as District Attorney. In 1906 he was elected as governor of Mississippi, serving through 1912. His house at North Street is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for its distinctive architecture, and is known as the \"Gov. Edmond F. Noel House\". It was bequeathed to him by his mother.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Mississippi planters recruited Chinese immigrant workers to satisfy the demand for farm labor, and some came to Holmes County. As the area suffered from the [[boll weevil]] infestation, the cotton crops suffered. Agricultural mechanization reduced the need for farm labor, leading to a decline in county and town populations from the 1930s on. Many African Americans left the South for northern and midwestern industrial cities, seeking more opportunities and escape from the violence of [[lynching]]s and oppression of [[Jim Crow]] rules.\n\nIn the 1940s, two lynchings of black men took place in or near Lexington: singer [[B.B. King]] later recounted having seen a youth hanged in the courthouse square during the short time he was living there as a teenager, about 1942\u20131944. The body of 35-year-old Leon McTatie was found on 24 July 1946 in a bayou in nearby Sunflower County. He was beaten to death for allegedly stealing a saddle. Six white men were charged in his lynching but quickly acquitted at trial.<ref name=\"charge\">[http://depts.washington.edu/moves/CRC_genocide.shtml Susan Glenn, \" 'We Charge Genocide': The 1951 Black Lives Matter Campaign\"], ''Mapping American Social Movements through the 20th Century'', University of Washington website; retrieved 9 March 2018</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NoMEb-QV2_8C&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=1945+lynching+of+McTatie&source=bl&ots=Rd4c-DXr3O&sig=0PB_1CNMaMWeJZ-hrBwehpwy5Qg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSo9aV7d_ZAhXOtlMKHYQ2DbwQ6AEIZDAF#v=onepage&q=1945%20lynching%20of%20McTatie&f=false Jason Sokol, ''There Goes My Everything: White Southerners in the Age of Civil Rights, 1945-1975''], Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2008, p. 28</ref>\n\nLexington was distinguished by two nationally known women: [[Arenia Mallory]], an African-American music teacher from Illinois, started teaching at the newly established [[Saints Academy (Mississippi)|Saints Academy]] in Lexington in 1926, which was affiliated with the [[Church of God in Christ]]. She led the school for more than 50 years, expanding its programs to grades 1-12, and establishing a junior college. She developed the school from the early 20th century as a model of academic excellence for African-American students. During her long tenure, she also founded an associated junior college. During the 1960s, she was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to national positions and committees in the federal government.\n\n[[Hazel Brannon Smith]], a white woman from an upper-class family, was based in Lexington, where she owned and published several rural newspapers. She promoted integration and change in the region during the civil rights era, winning a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her editorials in 1964, the year of [[Freedom Summer]] and the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]], organized by African Americans before the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 was passed by Congress.\n\n==Geography==\nLexington is in the center of Holmes County on the north side of the valley of Black Creek, a west-flowing tributary of the [[Yazoo River]].

He was released in 1970 and lived his last 20 years with family in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].<ref>[http://www.desototimes.com/opinion/strange-true-story-about-eddie-noel/article_a9b0b986-02dd-5c9c-b81e-a7623d5871b0.html Bill Minor, \"Strange true story about Eddie Noel\"], ''DeSoto Times'', 11 August 2010, accessed 25 November 2015</ref><ref>Allie Povall, ''The Time of Eddie Noel,'' Comfort Publishing, 2010</ref> ...end comment-->\n* [[Lonnie Pitchford]], blues musician born in Lexington\n* [[Monroe Saffold Jr.]], American bodybuilder, first place Masters Mr. America AAU, tall division 1990\n* [[Hazel Brannon Smith]] (1914\u20131994), owner and publisher of the ''Lexington Advertiser'' and other local newspapers; first woman to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] \n* [[Neely Tucker]], journalist, author\n* [[Hattie Winston]], actress in television, film and [[Broadway theatre|theatre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Mississippi}}\n* [http://www.isjl.org/mississippi-lexington-encyclopedia.html \"History of Lexington's Jewish community\"], [[Institute of Southern Jewish Life]]\n* [http://forward.com/articles/114913/ \"A Final Yom Kippur in the Delta for Mississippi Community Begun in 1830s\"], ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''\n* Oliver Laughland, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/in-the-poorest-county-in-americas-poorest-state-a-virus-hits-home-hunger-is-rampant \"In the poorest county, in America\u2019s poorest state, a virus hits home: 'Hunger is rampant,'\" ''The Guardian,'' April 6, 2020.\n\n{{Holmes County, Mississippi}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Cities in Holmes County, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:County seats in Mississippi]]\n", "name_user": "Carrite", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:tag fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Mississippi"}
