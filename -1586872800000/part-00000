There are also special files in [[DOS]], [[OS/2]], and [[Windows]].  These special files allow an application program to interact with a device by using its device driver via standard [[input/output]] [[system call]]s. Using standard system calls simplifies many programming tasks, and leads to consistent user-space I/O mechanisms regardless of device features and functions.\n\nDevice files usually provide simple interfaces to standard devices (such as printers and serial ports), but can also be used to access specific unique resources on those devices, such as [[Disk partitioning|disk partitions]]. Additionally, device files are useful for accessing [[Resource (computer science)|system resources]] that have no connection with any actual device such as [[data sink]]s and [[random number generator]]s.\n\nThere are two general kinds of device files in Unix-like operating systems, known as ''character special files'' and ''block special files''.  The difference between them lies in how much data is read and written by the operating system and hardware. These together can be called '''device special files''' in contrast to [[named pipe]]s, which are not connected to a device but are not ordinary files either.\n\n[[MS-DOS]] borrowed the concept of special files from Unix but renamed them ''devices''.<ref name=\"kb90239\"/> Because early versions of MS-DOS did not support a [[directory (file systems)|directory]] hierarchy, devices were distinguished from regular files by making their names [[reserved word]]s, chosen for a degree of compatibility with [[CP/M]].\n\nIn some Unix-like systems, most device files are managed as part of a [[virtual file system]] traditionally mounted at <code>/dev</code>, possibly associated with a controlling daemon, which monitors hardware addition and removal at run time, making corresponding changes to the '''device file system''' if that's not automatically done by the kernel, and possibly invoking scripts in system or user space to handle special device needs. The [[FreeBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]] implementations have named the virtual device file system <i>devfs</i> and the associated [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] <i>devd</i>. Linux primarily uses a [[user space]] implementation known as <i>[[udev]]</i>, but there are many variants. [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], and operating systems such as [[macOS]] based on it, have a purely kernel-based device file system.\n\nIn Unix systems which support [[chroot]] process isolation, such as [[Solaris Containers]], typically each chroot environment needs its own <code>/dev</code>; these mount points will be visible on the host OS at various nodes in the global file system tree. By restricting the device nodes populated into chroot instances of <code>/dev</code>, hardware isolation can be enforced by the chroot environment (a program can not meddle with hardware that it can neither see nor name\u2014an even stronger form of [[access control]] than Unix [[file system permissions]]).\n\nMS-DOS managed hardware device contention (see [[terminate and stay resident program|TSR]]) by making each device file exclusive open. An application attempting to access a device already in use would discover itself unable to open the device file node. A variety of [[device driver]] semantics are implemented in Unix and Linux concerning [[concurrent access]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Corbet |first=Jonathan |last2= Kroah-Hartman |first2=Greg |last3=Rubini |first3=Alessandro |date=2005 |title=Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition |section=Access Control on a Device File|url=http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-6-sect-6.shtml |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] |page= |isbn= |access-date=28 April 2017 |quote=The next step beyond a single-open device is to let a single user open a device in multiple processes but allow only one user to have the device open at a time.}}</ref>\n\n==Unix and Unix-like systems==\n[[File:Simplified Structure of the Linux Kernel.svg|thumb|A simplified structure of the Linux kernel. File systems are implemented as part of the I/O subsystem.]]\nDevice nodes correspond to resources that an operating system's [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] has already allocated. Unix identifies those resources by a ''major number'' and a ''minor number'',<ref>{{cite book |title=The UNIX Programming Environment |page=[https://archive.org/details/unixprogramminge0000kern/page/66 66] |author-first1=Brian W. |author-last1=Kernighan |author-link1=Brian W.

The assignment of these numbers occurs uniquely in different [[operating system]]s and on different [[computer platform]]s. Generally, the major number identifies the device driver and the minor number identifies a particular device (possibly out of many) that the driver controls:<ref>{{cite web |author=Neil Brown |title=Ghosts of Unix Past: a historical search for design patterns |website=LWN.net |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2014 |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/411845/}}</ref> in this case, the system may pass the minor number to a driver. However, in the presence of [[dynamic number allocation]], this may not be the case (e.g. on [[FreeBSD]] 5 and up).\n\nAs with other special file types, the computer system accesses device nodes using standard system calls and treats them like regular computer files. Two standard types of device files exist; unfortunately their names are rather counter-intuitive for historical reasons, and explanations of the difference between the two are often incorrect as a result.\n\n===Character devices===\n''Character special files'' or ''character devices'' provide unbuffered, direct access to the hardware device. They do not necessarily allow programs to read or write single characters at a time; that is up to the device in question. The character device for a hard disk, for example, will normally require that all reads and writes are aligned to block boundaries and most certainly will not allow reading a single byte.\n\nCharacter devices are sometimes known as ''raw devices'' to avoid the confusion surrounding the fact that a character device for a piece of block-based hardware will typically require programs to read and write aligned blocks.\n\n==={{Anchor|BLOCKDEV}}Block devices===\n''Block special files'' or ''block devices'' provide buffered access to hardware devices, and provide some abstraction from their specifics.<ref>{{cite web|title=IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_79|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> Unlike character devices, block devices will always allow the programmer to read or write a block of any size (including single characters/bytes) and any alignment. The downside is that because block devices are buffered, the programmer does not know how long it will take before written data is passed from the kernel's buffers to the actual device, or indeed in what order two separate writes will arrive at the physical device. Additionally, if the same hardware exposes both character and block devices, there is a risk of data corruption due to clients using the character device being unaware of changes made in the buffers of the block device.\n\nMost systems create both block and character devices to represent hardware like hard disks. FreeBSD and Linux notably do not; the former has removed support for block devices,<ref>{{cite web|title=FreeBSD Architecture Handbook|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/arch-handbook/driverbasics-block.html|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> while the latter creates only block devices. In Linux, to get a character device for a disk one must use the \"raw\" driver, though one can get the same effect as opening a character device by opening the block device with the Linux-specific <code>O_DIRECT</code> flag.\n\n===Pseudo-devices===\nDevice nodes on Unix-like systems do not necessarily have to correspond to [[physical device]]s. Nodes that lack this correspondence form the group of ''pseudo-devices''.  They provide various functions handled by the operating system.  Some of the most commonly used (character-based) pseudo-devices include:\n\n* {{mono|[[/dev/null]]}}{{snd}} accepts and discards all input written to it; provides an [[end-of-file]] indication when read from.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/zero]]}}{{snd}} accepts and discards all input written to it; produces a continuous stream of [[null character]]s (zero-value bytes) as output when read from.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/full]]}}{{snd}} produces a continuous stream of null characters (zero-value bytes) as output when read from, and generates an {{mono|[[errno.h|ENOSPC]]}} (\"disk full\") error when attempting to write to it.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/random]]}}{{snd}} produces bytes generated by the kernel's [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]. Its exact behavior varies by implementation, and sometimes variants such as {{mono|/dev/urandom}} or {{mono|/dev/arandom}} are also provided.\n\nAdditionally, BSD-specific pseudo-devices with an {{mono|[[ioctl]]}} interface may also include:\n* {{mono|[[/dev/pf]]}}{{snd}} allows userland processes to control [[PF (firewall)|PF]] through an {{mono|ioctl}} interface.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/bio]]}}{{snd}} provides {{mono|ioctl}} access to devices otherwise not found as {{mono|/dev}} nodes, used by {{mono|[[bioctl]]}} to implement [[RAID]] management in [[OpenBSD]] and [[NetBSD]].\n* {{mono|[[/dev/sysmon]]}}{{snd}} used by NetBSD's [[envsys|sysmon_envsys]] framework for [[system monitor|hardware monitoring]], accessed in the userland through {{mono|[[proplib(3)]]}} by the {{mono|envstat}} utility.<ref name=envstat>{{cite web |url= http://bxr.su/n/usr.sbin/envstat/envstat.c |title= usr.sbin/envstat/envstat.c |website= BSD Cross Reference |publisher= [[NetBSD]] |lay-url= http://mdoc.su/n/envstat.8}}</ref>\n\n===Node creation===\nNodes are created by the ''mknod'' [[system call]]. The command-line program for creating nodes is also called mknod. Nodes can be moved or deleted by the usual filesystem system calls ([[rename (computing)|rename]], [[unlink (Unix)|unlink]]) and [[command (computing)|commands]] ([[mv]], [[rm (Unix)|rm]]).\n\nSome Unix versions include a script named ''makedev'' or ''MAKEDEV'' to create all necessary devices in the directory <code>/dev</code>. It only makes sense on systems whose devices are statically assigned major numbers (e.g. by means of hardcoding it in their kernel module).\n\n=== Naming conventions ===\nThe following prefixes are used for the names of some devices in the <code>/dev</code> hierarchy, to identify the type of device:\n\n* <code>lp</code>: [[line printer]]s (compare [[lp (Unix)|lp]])\n* <code>pt</code>: [[Pseudo terminal|pseudo-terminal]]s (virtual terminals)\n* <code>tty</code>: [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s\n\nSome additional prefixes have come into common use in some operating systems:\n\n* <code>fb</code>: [[frame buffer]]\n* <code>fd</code>: (platform) [[floppy disk]]s, though this same abbreviation is also commonly used to refer to [[file descriptor]]\n* <code>hd</code>: (\u201cclassic\u201d) [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] driver (previously used for ATA [[hard disk drive]], ATAPI [[optical disc drive]]s, etc.)\n** <code>hda</code>: the master device on the first [[ATA channel]] (usually identified by major number 3 and minor number 0)\n** <code>hdb</code>: the slave device on the first ATA channel\n** <code>hdc</code>: the master device on the second ATA channel\n** <code>hdd</code>: the slave device on the second ATA channel\n* <code>parport</code>, <code>pp</code>: [[parallel port]]s\n* [[NVM Express|NVMe]] driver\n** <code>nvme0</code>: first registered device's device controller (character device)\n** <code>nvme0n1</code>: first registered device's first namespace (block device)\n** <code>nvme0n1p1</code>: first registered device's first namespace's first partition (block device)\n* [[SCSI]] driver, also used by [[libATA]] (modern [[Parallel ATA|PATA]]/[[Serial ATA|SATA]] driver), [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[IEEE 1394]], etc.\n** <code>sd</code>: mass-storage driver\n*** <code>sda</code>: first registered device\n*** <code>sdb, sdc</code>, etc.: second, third, etc. registered devices\n** <code>ses</code>: Enclosure driver\n** <code>sg</code>: generic SCSI layer\n** <code>sr</code>: \u201cROM\u201d driver (data-oriented optical disc drives; scd is just a secondary alias)\n** <code>st</code>: [[magnetic tape]] driver\n* <code>tty</code>: [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s\n** <code>ttyS</code>: (platform) [[serial port]] driver\n** <code>ttyUSB</code>: USB serial converters, modems, etc.\n\nThe canonical list of the prefixes used in Linux can be found in the Linux Device List, the official registry of allocated device numbers and <code>/dev</code> directory nodes for the Linux operating system.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devices.txt | title = Linux allocated devices (2.6+ version) | work = [[Linux kernel]] (Documentation/devices.txt) | author = [[Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority]] | date = 2009-04-06 | accessdate = 2013-06-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160424173724/https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devices.txt | archive-date = 24 April 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFor most devices, this prefix is followed by a number uniquely identifying the particular device. For hard drives, a letter is used to identify devices and is followed by a number to identify [[Disk partitioning|partitions]]. Thus a file system may \"know\" an area on a disk as <code>/dev/sda3</code>, for example, or \"see\" a networked terminal session as associated with <code>/dev/pts/14</code>.\n\nOn disks using the typical PC [[master boot record]], the device numbers of primary and the optional extended partition are numbered 1 through 4, while the indexes of any logical partitions are 5 and onwards, regardless of the layout of the former partitions (their parent extended partition does not need to be the fourth partition on the disk, nor do all four primary partitions have to exist).\n\nDevice names are usually not portable between different Unix-like system variants, for example, on some [[BSD]] systems, the IDE devices are named /dev/wd0, /dev/wd1, etc.\n\n=== {{Anchor|DEVFS}}devfs ===\n''devfs'' is a specific implementation of a device file system on Unix-like operating systems, used for presenting device files.  The underlying mechanism of implementation may vary, depending on the OS.\n\nMaintaining these special files on a ''physically'' implemented file system (i.e. harddrive) is inconvenient, and as it needs kernel assistance anyway, the idea arose of a special-purpose ''logical'' file system that is not physically stored.\n\nAlso defining when devices are ready to appear is not entirely trivial. The 'devfs' approach is for the device driver to request creation and deletion of 'devfs' entries related to the devices it enables and disables.\n\n===={{anchor|DEV}}Implementations====\n<!-- N.B.

There are also special files in [[DOS]], [[OS/2]], and [[Windows]].  These special files allow an application program to interact with a device by using its device driver via standard [[input/output]] [[system call]]s. Using standard system calls simplifies many programming tasks, and leads to consistent user-space I/O mechanisms regardless of device features and functions.\n\nDevice files usually provide simple interfaces to standard devices (such as printers and serial ports), but can also be used to access specific unique resources on those devices, such as [[Disk partitioning|disk partitions]]. Additionally, device files are useful for accessing [[Resource (computer science)|system resources]] that have no connection with any actual device such as [[data sink]]s and [[random number generator]]s.\n\nThere are two general kinds of device files in Unix-like operating systems, known as ''character special files'' and ''block special files''.  The difference between them lies in how much data is read and written by the operating system and hardware. These together can be called '''device special files''' in contrast to [[named pipe]]s, which are not connected to a device but are not ordinary files either.\n\n[[MS-DOS]] borrowed the concept of special files from Unix but renamed them ''devices''.<ref name=\"kb90239\"/> Because early versions of MS-DOS did not support a [[directory (file systems)|directory]] hierarchy, devices were distinguished from regular files by making their names [[reserved word]]s, chosen for a degree of compatibility with [[CP/M]].\n\nIn some Unix-like systems, most device files are managed as part of a [[virtual file system]] traditionally mounted at <code>/dev</code>, possibly associated with a controlling daemon, which monitors hardware addition and removal at run time, making corresponding changes to the '''device file system''' if that's not automatically done by the kernel, and possibly invoking scripts in system or user space to handle special device needs. The [[FreeBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]] implementations have named the virtual device file system <i>devfs</i> and the associated [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] <i>devd</i>. Linux primarily uses a [[user space]] implementation known as <i>[[udev]]</i>, but there are many variants. [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], and operating systems such as [[macOS]] based on it, have a purely kernel-based device file system.\n\nIn Unix systems which support [[chroot]] process isolation, such as [[Solaris Containers]], typically each chroot environment needs its own <code>/dev</code>; these mount points will be visible on the host OS at various nodes in the global file system tree. By restricting the device nodes populated into chroot instances of <code>/dev</code>, hardware isolation can be enforced by the chroot environment (a program can not meddle with hardware that it can neither see nor name\u2014an even stronger form of [[access control]] than Unix [[file system permissions]]).\n\nMS-DOS managed hardware device contention (see [[terminate and stay resident program|TSR]]) by making each device file exclusive open. An application attempting to access a device already in use would discover itself unable to open the device file node. A variety of [[device driver]] semantics are implemented in Unix and Linux concerning [[concurrent access]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Corbet |first=Jonathan |last2= Kroah-Hartman |first2=Greg |last3=Rubini |first3=Alessandro |date=2005 |title=Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition |section=Access Control on a Device File|url=http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-6-sect-6.shtml |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] |page= |isbn= |access-date=28 April 2017 |quote=The next step beyond a single-open device is to let a single user open a device in multiple processes but allow only one user to have the device open at a time.}}</ref>\n\n==Unix and Unix-like systems==\n[[File:Simplified Structure of the Linux Kernel.svg|thumb|A simplified structure of the Linux kernel. File systems are implemented as part of the I/O subsystem.]]\nDevice nodes correspond to resources that an operating system's [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] has already allocated. Unix identifies those resources by a ''major number'' and a ''minor number'',<ref>{{cite book |title=The UNIX Programming Environment |page=[https://archive.org/details/unixprogramminge0000kern/page/66 66] |author-first1=Brian W. |author-last1=Kernighan |author-link1=Brian W.

The assignment of these numbers occurs uniquely in different [[operating system]]s and on different [[computer platform]]s. Generally, the major number identifies the device driver and the minor number identifies a particular device (possibly out of many) that the driver controls:<ref>{{cite web |author=Neil Brown |title=Ghosts of Unix Past: a historical search for design patterns |website=LWN.net |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2014 |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/411845/}}</ref> in this case, the system may pass the minor number to a driver. However, in the presence of [[dynamic number allocation]], this may not be the case (e.g. on [[FreeBSD]] 5 and up).\n\nAs with other special file types, the computer system accesses device nodes using standard system calls and treats them like regular computer files. Two standard types of device files exist; unfortunately their names are rather counter-intuitive for historical reasons, and explanations of the difference between the two are often incorrect as a result.\n\n===Character devices===\n''Character special files'' or ''character devices'' provide unbuffered, direct access to the hardware device. They do not necessarily allow programs to read or write single characters at a time; that is up to the device in question. The character device for a hard disk, for example, will normally require that all reads and writes are aligned to block boundaries and most certainly will not allow reading a single byte.\n\nCharacter devices are sometimes known as ''raw devices'' to avoid the confusion surrounding the fact that a character device for a piece of block-based hardware will typically require programs to read and write aligned blocks.\n\n==={{Anchor|BLOCKDEV}}Block devices===\n''Block special files'' or ''block devices'' provide buffered access to hardware devices, and provide some abstraction from their specifics.<ref>{{cite web|title=IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_79|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> Unlike character devices, block devices will always allow the programmer to read or write a block of any size (including single characters/bytes) and any alignment. The downside is that because block devices are buffered, the programmer does not know how long it will take before written data is passed from the kernel's buffers to the actual device, or indeed in what order two separate writes will arrive at the physical device. Additionally, if the same hardware exposes both character and block devices, there is a risk of data corruption due to clients using the character device being unaware of changes made in the buffers of the block device.\n\nMost systems create both block and character devices to represent hardware like hard disks. FreeBSD and Linux notably do not; the former has removed support for block devices,<ref>{{cite web|title=FreeBSD Architecture Handbook|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/arch-handbook/driverbasics-block.html|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> while the latter creates only block devices. In Linux, to get a character device for a disk one must use the \"raw\" driver, though one can get the same effect as opening a character device by opening the block device with the Linux-specific <code>O_DIRECT</code> flag.\n\n===Pseudo-devices===\nDevice nodes on Unix-like systems do not necessarily have to correspond to [[physical device]]s. Nodes that lack this correspondence form the group of ''pseudo-devices''.  They provide various functions handled by the operating system.  Some of the most commonly used (character-based) pseudo-devices include:\n\n* {{mono|[[/dev/null]]}}{{snd}} accepts and discards all input written to it; provides an [[end-of-file]] indication when read from.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/zero]]}}{{snd}} accepts and discards all input written to it; produces a continuous stream of [[null character]]s (zero-value bytes) as output when read from.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/full]]}}{{snd}} produces a continuous stream of null characters (zero-value bytes) as output when read from, and generates an {{mono|[[errno.h|ENOSPC]]}} (\"disk full\") error when attempting to write to it.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/random]]}}{{snd}} produces bytes generated by the kernel's [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]. Its exact behavior varies by implementation, and sometimes variants such as {{mono|/dev/urandom}} or {{mono|/dev/arandom}} are also provided.\n\nAdditionally, BSD-specific pseudo-devices with an {{mono|[[ioctl]]}} interface may also include:\n* {{mono|[[/dev/pf]]}}{{snd}} allows userland processes to control [[PF (firewall)|PF]] through an {{mono|ioctl}} interface.\n* {{mono|[[/dev/bio]]}}{{snd}} provides {{mono|ioctl}} access to devices otherwise not found as {{mono|/dev}} nodes, used by {{mono|[[bioctl]]}} to implement [[RAID]] management in [[OpenBSD]] and [[NetBSD]].\n* {{mono|[[/dev/sysmon]]}}{{snd}} used by NetBSD's [[envsys|sysmon_envsys]] framework for [[system monitor|hardware monitoring]], accessed in the userland through {{mono|[[proplib(3)]]}} by the {{mono|envstat}} utility.<ref name=envstat>{{cite web |url= http://bxr.su/n/usr.sbin/envstat/envstat.c |title= usr.sbin/envstat/envstat.c |website= BSD Cross Reference |publisher= [[NetBSD]] |lay-url= http://mdoc.su/n/envstat.8}}</ref>\n\n===Node creation===\nNodes are created by the ''mknod'' [[system call]]. The command-line program for creating nodes is also called mknod. Nodes can be moved or deleted by the usual filesystem system calls ([[rename (computing)|rename]], [[unlink (Unix)|unlink]]) and [[command (computing)|commands]] ([[mv]], [[rm (Unix)|rm]]).\n\nSome Unix versions include a script named ''makedev'' or ''MAKEDEV'' to create all necessary devices in the directory <code>/dev</code>. It only makes sense on systems whose devices are statically assigned major numbers (e.g. by means of hardcoding it in their kernel module).\n\n=== Naming conventions ===\nThe following prefixes are used for the names of some devices in the <code>/dev</code> hierarchy, to identify the type of device:\n\n* <code>lp</code>: [[line printer]]s (compare [[lp (Unix)|lp]])\n* <code>pt</code>: [[Pseudo terminal|pseudo-terminal]]s (virtual terminals)\n* <code>tty</code>: [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s\n\nSome additional prefixes have come into common use in some operating systems:\n\n* <code>fb</code>: [[frame buffer]]\n* <code>fd</code>: (platform) [[floppy disk]]s, though this same abbreviation is also commonly used to refer to [[file descriptor]]\n* <code>hd</code>: (\u201cclassic\u201d) [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] driver (previously used for ATA [[hard disk drive]], ATAPI [[optical disc drive]]s, etc.)\n** <code>hda</code>: the master device on the first [[ATA channel]] (usually identified by major number 3 and minor number 0)\n** <code>hdb</code>: the slave device on the first ATA channel\n** <code>hdc</code>: the master device on the second ATA channel\n** <code>hdd</code>: the slave device on the second ATA channel\n* <code>parport</code>, <code>pp</code>: [[parallel port]]s\n* [[NVM Express|NVMe]] driver\n** <code>nvme0</code>: first registered device's device controller (character device)\n** <code>nvme0n1</code>: first registered device's first namespace (block device)\n** <code>nvme0n1p1</code>: first registered device's first namespace's first partition (block device)\n* [[SCSI]] driver, also used by [[libATA]] (modern [[Parallel ATA|PATA]]/[[Serial ATA|SATA]] driver), [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[IEEE 1394]], etc.\n** <code>sd</code>: mass-storage driver\n*** <code>sda</code>: first registered device\n*** <code>sdb, sdc</code>, etc.: second, third, etc. registered devices\n** <code>ses</code>: Enclosure driver\n** <code>sg</code>: generic SCSI layer\n** <code>sr</code>: \u201cROM\u201d driver (data-oriented optical disc drives; scd is just a secondary alias)\n** <code>st</code>: [[magnetic tape]] driver\n* <code>tty</code>: [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s\n** <code>ttyS</code>: (platform) [[serial port]] driver\n** <code>ttyUSB</code>: USB serial converters, modems, etc.\n\nThe canonical list of the prefixes used in Linux can be found in the Linux Device List, the official registry of allocated device numbers and <code>/dev</code> directory nodes for the Linux operating system.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devices.txt | title = Linux allocated devices (2.6+ version) | work = [[Linux kernel]] (Documentation/devices.txt) | author = [[Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority]] | date = 2009-04-06 | accessdate = 2013-06-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160424173724/https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devices.txt | archive-date = 24 April 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFor most devices, this prefix is followed by a number uniquely identifying the particular device. For hard drives, a letter is used to identify devices and is followed by a number to identify [[Disk partitioning|partitions]]. Thus a file system may \"know\" an area on a disk as <code>/dev/sda3</code>, for example, or \"see\" a networked terminal session as associated with <code>/dev/pts/14</code>.\n\nOn disks using the typical PC [[master boot record]], the device numbers of primary and the optional extended partition are numbered 1 through 4, while the indexes of any logical partitions are 5 and onwards, regardless of the layout of the former partitions (their parent extended partition does not need to be the fourth partition on the disk, nor do all four primary partitions have to exist).\n\nDevice names are usually not portable between different Unix-like system variants, for example, on some [[BSD]] systems, the IDE devices are named /dev/wd0, /dev/wd1, etc.\n\n=== {{Anchor|DEVFS}}devfs ===\n''devfs'' is a specific implementation of a device file system on Unix-like operating systems, used for presenting device files.  The underlying mechanism of implementation may vary, depending on the OS.\n\nMaintaining these special files on a ''physically'' implemented file system (i.e. harddrive) is inconvenient, and as it needs kernel assistance anyway, the idea arose of a special-purpose ''logical'' file system that is not physically stored.\n\nAlso defining when devices are ready to appear is not entirely trivial. The 'devfs' approach is for the device driver to request creation and deletion of 'devfs' entries related to the devices it enables and disables.\n\n===={{anchor|DEV}}Implementations====\n<!-- N.B.

The [[GUI]] tree is instantiated at initialization time (called the Definition Phase in the standard) in the CDS, using the definition contained in the DF.\n* the communication at runtime between the User Applications (UA) and the CDS. This communication protocol is typically used for UAs to send widgets modifications to the CDS, and return user events (such as buttons selection) from CDS to UA.\n\nIn order to be compliant with the standard, a CDS must have a kernel that can create the [[Widget (computing)|widgets]] tree during CDS initialization, using the Definition File, and communicate with UA in both ways using the runtime protocol.\n\nARINC 661 does not imply the use of a particular Data bus structure to perform the low-level communication between CDS and UA. For example, an [[ARINC 429]] or [[Ethernet]] protocol such as [[ARINC 664]] can be used, but it is not mandatory.\n\n=== GUI Structure ===\n* The [[Cockpit display system|Cockpit Display System]] ('''CDS''') is the graphic Server which is responsible to show and manage the GUI\n* A User Application ('''UA''') is one system application which communicates with the CDS. The CDS manage one ore more Definition Files for each User Application. At run-time, messages are exchanged between UAs and the CDS.\n* A Definition File ('''DF''') specifies the GUI definition associated with one User Application (note that a User Application may be associated by more than one DF). A Definition File contains the definition of one or more Layers\n* A Layer (also named  ''User Application Layer Definition'' or '''UALD''') is a GUI [[Collection (abstract data type)|container]] for widgets\n* A [[Graphical widget|widget]] is the basic building block of the GUI\n\n{{Image frame|width=550|content=[[File:ARINC 661 structure.png|550px]]|caption=ARINC 661 structure|align=center}}\n\n== GUI definition ==\nEach DF binary file specifies the GUI definition for one User Application (UA) User interface. Several UA user interface trees can be combined to constitute the CDS display definition.\n\nA DF is composed of two parts : an optional symbol definition, and a widgets definition. The widget library is similar to [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]] used in computing. There are [[Container (data_structure)#Graphic containers|Containers]], [[List box|Lists]], ScrollPanes, [[Button (computing)|Buttons]], [[Menu bar|Menus]], [[Label (control)|Labels]], [[Text box|EditBoxes]], etc...\n\nAlthough the DF File is binary, the standard has also defined an associated XML definition, which is easier to manipulate in tools.\n\n== Relationship with other UI languages ==\nThe concepts used by ARINC 661 are close to those used in [[User interface markup language]]s, except that the UI language is binary and not [[XML]] based.<ref>The standard also specifies an XML format for the UI language, but it is mainly used to ease DF production by specification tools. The kernel is initialized with the binary version of DFs</ref>\n\nMain similarities from other [[User interface markup language]]s:\n* The interface definition is not hard-coded in the CDS. Instead, the CDS use a kernel which instantiate the widget tree at initialization, using a predefined widget library\n* The widget list and the structure of the widget tree are similar to what can be found in common [[Widget toolkit]]s\n* The [[Look and feel]] is separated from the definition of the interface\n\nMain differences from other [[User interface markup language]]s :\n* The widget library defined in the standard does not really take advantage of its object nature, contrary to other [[User interface markup language]]s. For example, there is no notion of inheritance in the standard, although the same properties can be used more than once for several widgets.\n* Some [[Widget toolkit]]s or [[User interface markup language]]s have the ability to lay out widgets automatically in a container (see for example the box model in [[XUL]], or the layouts in [[Swing (Java)|Java Swing]]). Widgets position and size in their container must always be defined exactly in an ARINC 661 definition. However, the supplement 3 of the standard has added a limited sort of \"relative\" layout capability between widgets (see [[Layout manager]]).\n* There is no mechanism for defining the presentation and interactive behavior of elements equivalent to [[XBL]] used in [[XUL]] (or [[sXBL]] used in [[SVG]]). There are symbols that can be reused, but they are mainly shapes that cannot have behaviors (apart from defining their position, rotation, and color), or specific bindings.\n* There is no equivalent of [[CSS]], as they are used in [[XUL]] or [[SVG]] for example. Instead, the [[Look and feel]] of the interface is hard-coded in the ARINC 661 kernel. However, supplement 5 introduced a way to specify the Look of widgets.\n* The standard does not have an equivalent of [[JavaScript]], as used in [[SVG]] and [[XUL]], so all specific behavior associated with the widgets must be performed by the UAs.\n* The standard has defined specific \"Map\" widgets which allows to present elements such as [[Flight plan]]s in CDS.\n\n==Example==\nThe following example presents the XML Definition File for a Layer containing a [[Panel (computer software)|panel]] enclosing a [[Label (control)|label]], which shows the text \"Hello World!\". Note that contrary to most [[widget toolkit]]s, ARINC 661 [[GUI widget|widgets]] origins are relative to the lower left-hand corner of their parent [[Container (data structure)#Graphic_containers|container]], and screen units are not in [[pixel]] but in 1/100 of millimeters.\n\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n  <!DOCTYPE a661_df SYSTEM \"a661.dtd\">\n  <a661_df library_version=\"0\" supp_version=\"2\">\n    <model>\n      <prop name=\"ApplicationId\" value=\"1\"/>\n    </model>\n    <a661_layer>\n      <model>\n        <prop name=\"LayerId\" value=\"5\"/>\n        <prop name=\"ContextNumber\" value=\"23\"/>\n        <prop name=\"Height\" value=\"10000\"/>\n        <prop name=\"Width\" value=\"10000\"/>\n      </model>\n      <a661_widget name=\"SamplePanel\" type=\"A661_PANEL\">\n        <model>\n          <prop name=\"WidgetIdent\" value=\"1\"/>\n          <prop name=\"Enable\" value=\"A661_TRUE\" />\n          <prop name=\"Visible\" value=\"A661_TRUE\" />\n          <prop name=\"PosX\" value=\"0\"/>\n          <prop name=\"PosY\" value=\"0\"/>\n          <prop name=\"SizeX\" value=\"10000\"/>\n          <prop name=\"SizeY\" value=\"10000\"/>\n          <prop name=\"StyleSet\" value=\"STYLESET_DEFAULT\" />\n        </model>\n        <a661_widget name=\"Hello World Label\" type=\"A661_LABEL\">\n           <model>\n             <prop name=\"WidgetIdent\" value=\"2\"/>\n             <prop name=\"Anonymous\" value=\"A661_FALSE\" />\n             <prop name=\"Visible\" value=\"A661_TRUE\" />\n             <prop name=\"PosX\" value=\"5000\" />\n             <prop name=\"PosY\" value=\"5000\" />\n             <prop name=\"SizeX\" value=\"1500\" />\n             <prop name=\"SizeY\" value=\"1000\" />\n             <prop name=\"RotationAngle\" value=\"0.0\" />\n             <prop name=\"StyleSet\" value=\"0\" />\n             <prop name=\"MaxStringLength\" value=\"20\" />\n             <prop name=\"MotionAllowed\" value=\"A661_TRUE\" />\n             <prop name=\"Font\" value=\"T4\" />\n             <prop name=\"ColorIndex\" value=\"black\" />\n             <prop name=\"Alignment\" value=\"A661_CENTER\" />\n             <prop name=\"LabelString\" value=\"Hello World!\" />\n           </model>\n        </a661_widget>\n      </a661_widget>\n    </a661_layer>\n  </a661_df>\n</source>\n\n==Development and tools support==\nARINC 661 [[GUI]] development includes tools for the specification of definition files and the kernel that use these files:\n* Thanks to ARINC 661 concepts, the specification tools have no dependency on the execution platform,\n* The kernel itself depends on the execution platform.\n\n[[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] specification tools for DF specification currently include SCADE Solutions for ARINC 661 Compliant Systems, DiSTI's GL Studio ARINC 661 Toolkit and Presagis VAPS XT 661 Toolkit.\n\n[[Esterel Technologies]] announced on October 13, 2010, the availability of [http://www.esterel-technologies.com/products/scade-arinc-661/ SCADE Solutions for ARINC 661] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.esterel-technologies.com/news-events/press-releases/2010/Esterel-Technologies-Introduces-SCADE-ARINC-661-Solutions%20for-Interactive-Cockpit-Displays-Development\n |title       = Esterel Technologies Introduces SCADE ARINC 661 Solutions for Interactive Cockpit Displays Development\n |publisher   = [[Esterel Technologies]]\n |date        = 2010-10-13\n |accessdate  = 2010-11-07\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101121083137/http://esterel-technologies.com/news-events/press-releases/2010/Esterel-Technologies-Introduces-SCADE-ARINC-661-Solutions%20for-Interactive-Cockpit-Displays-Development\n |archivedate = 21 November 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\nSCADE Solutions for ARINC 661 allow creating both ARINC 661-compliant CDS and UA.

The [[GUI]] tree is instantiated at initialization time (called the Definition Phase in the standard) in the CDS, using the definition contained in the DF.\n* the communication at runtime between the User Applications (UA) and the CDS. This communication protocol is typically used for UAs to send widgets modifications to the CDS, and return user events (such as buttons selection) from CDS to UA.\n\nIn order to be compliant with the standard, a CDS must have a kernel that can create the [[Widget (computing)|widgets]] tree during CDS initialization, using the Definition File, and communicate with UA in both ways using the runtime protocol.\n\nARINC 661 does not imply the use of a particular Data bus structure to perform the low-level communication between CDS and UA. For example, an [[ARINC 429]] or [[Ethernet]] protocol such as [[ARINC 664]] can be used, but it is not mandatory.\n\n=== GUI Structure ===\n* The [[Cockpit display system|Cockpit Display System]] ('''CDS''') is the graphic Server which is responsible to show and manage the GUI\n* A User Application ('''UA''') is one system application which communicates with the CDS. The CDS manage one ore more Definition Files for each User Application. At run-time, messages are exchanged between UAs and the CDS.\n* A Definition File ('''DF''') specifies the GUI definition associated with one User Application (note that a User Application may be associated by more than one DF). A Definition File contains the definition of one or more Layers\n* A Layer (also named  ''User Application Layer Definition'' or '''UALD''') is a GUI [[Collection (abstract data type)|container]] for widgets\n* A [[Graphical widget|widget]] is the basic building block of the GUI\n\n{{Image frame|width=550|content=[[File:ARINC 661 structure.png|550px]]|caption=ARINC 661 structure|align=center}}\n\n== GUI definition ==\nEach DF binary file specifies the GUI definition for one User Application (UA) User interface. Several UA user interface trees can be combined to constitute the CDS display definition.\n\nA DF is composed of two parts : an optional symbol definition, and a widgets definition. The widget library is similar to [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]] used in computing. There are [[Container (data_structure)#Graphic containers|Containers]], [[List box|Lists]], ScrollPanes, [[Button (computing)|Buttons]], [[Menu bar|Menus]], [[Label (control)|Labels]], [[Text box|EditBoxes]], etc...\n\nAlthough the DF File is binary, the standard has also defined an associated XML definition, which is easier to manipulate in tools.\n\n== Relationship with other UI languages ==\nThe concepts used by ARINC 661 are close to those used in [[User interface markup language]]s, except that the UI language is binary and not [[XML]] based.<ref>The standard also specifies an XML format for the UI language, but it is mainly used to ease DF production by specification tools.

Instead, the CDS use a kernel which instantiate the widget tree at initialization, using a predefined widget library\n* The widget list and the structure of the widget tree are similar to what can be found in common [[Widget toolkit]]s\n* The [[Look and feel]] is separated from the definition of the interface\n\nMain differences from other [[User interface markup language]]s :\n* The widget library defined in the standard does not really take advantage of its object nature, contrary to other [[User interface markup language]]s.

Widgets position and size in their container must always be defined exactly in an ARINC 661 definition. However, the supplement 3 of the standard has added a limited sort of \"relative\" layout capability between widgets (see [[Layout manager]]).\n* There is no mechanism for defining the presentation and interactive behavior of elements equivalent to [[XBL]] used in [[XUL]] (or [[sXBL]] used in [[SVG]]). There are symbols that can be reused, but they are mainly shapes that cannot have behaviors (apart from defining their position, rotation, and color), or specific bindings.\n* There is no equivalent of [[CSS]], as they are used in [[XUL]] or [[SVG]] for example.

MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995.\n\nDozens of other operating systems also use the acronym \"DOS\", beginning with the mainframe [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360]] from 1966.

Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft [[Z-80 SoftCard]], which allowed CP/M to run on an [[Apple II]]).<ref name=\"rolander\">{{cite interview |url=http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |title=The rest of the story: How Bill Gates beat Gary Kildall in OS war, Part 1 |author-last=Rolander |author-first=Tom |author-link=Tom Rolander |interviewer-first=Robert |interviewer-last=Scoble |work=The Scoble Show |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104052350/http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |archivedate=2007-11-04}}</ref> IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \"PC&nbsp;DOS\". Digital Research founder [[Gary Kildall]] refused, and IBM withdrew.<ref name=\"rolander\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Just Say No to Microsoft |url=https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove |url-access=registration |author-last=Bove |author-first=Tony |publisher=[[No Starch Press]] |date=2005 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove/page/9 9]\u201311 |isbn=1-59327-064-X }}</ref>\n\nIBM again approached Bill Gates. Gates in turn approached [[Seattle Computer Products]]. There, programmer [[Tim Paterson]] had developed a variant of [[CP/M-80]], intended as an internal product for testing SCP's new 16-bit [[Intel 8086]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] card for the [[S-100 bus]]. The system was initially named [[Seattle Computer Products|QDOS]] (Quick and Dirty Operating System), before being made commercially available as [[86-DOS]].

IBM continued to develop their version, [[PC&nbsp;DOS]], for the IBM PC.<ref name=\"mshist\"/> Digital Research became aware that an operating system similar to CP/M was being sold by IBM (under the same name that IBM insisted upon for CP/M), and threatened legal action. IBM responded by offering an agreement: they would give PC consumers a choice of PC&nbsp;DOS or [[CP/M-86]], Kildall's 8086 version. Side-by-side, CP/M cost {{currency|amount=200|code=USD|linked=no}} more than PC&nbsp;DOS, and sales were low. CP/M faded, with MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS becoming the marketed operating system for PCs and PC compatibles.<ref name=\"rolander\"/>\n\nMicrosoft originally sold MS-DOS only to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). One major reason for this was that not all early PCs were 100% [[IBM PC compatible]]. DOS was structured such that there was a separation between the system specific device driver code ([[IO.SYS]]) and the DOS kernel ([[MSDOS.SYS]]). Microsoft provided an OEM Adaptation Kit (OAK) which allowed OEMs to customize the device driver code to their particular system. By the early 1990s, most PCs adhered to IBM PC standards so Microsoft began selling MS-DOS in retail with MS-DOS 5.0.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Microsoft developed a [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)|multitasking version of DOS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |title=Did you know that OS/2 wasn't Microsoft's first non Unix multi-tasking operating system? |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092239/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |archive-date=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |title=Larry Osterman\u2019s Biography |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602232429/http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |archive-date=2013-06-02}}</ref> This version of DOS is generally referred to as \"European MS-DOS 4\" because it was developed for [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] and licensed to several European companies. This version of DOS supports preemptive multitasking, shared memory, device helper services and [[New Executable]] (\"NE\") format executables. None of these features were used in later versions of DOS, but they were used to form the basis of the OS/2 1.0 kernel. This version of DOS is distinct from the widely released PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 which was developed by IBM and based upon DOS 3.3.\n\nDigital Research attempted to regain the market lost from CP/M-86, initially with [[Concurrent DOS]], [[FlexOS]] and [[DOS Plus]] (both compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software), later with [[Multiuser DOS]] (compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software) and [[DR&nbsp;DOS]] (compatible with MS-DOS software). Digital Research was bought by [[Novell]], and DR&nbsp;DOS became [[PalmDOS]] and [[Novell DOS]]; later, it was part of [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] (under the names [[OpenDOS]] and [[DR-DOS 7.02]]/[[DR-DOS 7.03|7.03]]), [[Lineo]], and [[DeviceLogics]].\n\n[[Gordon Letwin]] wrote in 1995 that \"DOS was, when we first wrote it, a one-time throw-away product intended to keep IBM happy so that they'd buy our languages\".{{r|letwin19950817}} Microsoft expected that it would be an interim solution before Xenix.

With Windows 95 and 98, but not ME, the MS-DOS component could be run without starting Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/95win/95win21/95win21.asp&guid= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040707000544/http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2Farchive%2F95win%2F95win21%2F95win21.asp&guid= |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-07-07 |title=Finding The DOS In Windows 95 |work=Smart Computing |date=March 1996 |access-date=2008-07-12}}</ref><ref name=\"various-77715\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/24/6849530.aspx |title=What was the role of MS-DOS in Windows 95? |author-first=Raymond |author-last=Chen |author-link=Raymond Chen (Microsoft) |work=The Old New Thing - Site Home - MSDN Blogs |date=2007-12-24 |access-date=2014-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205100822/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/24/6849530.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-05 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"various-42623\">{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/138996 |title=Description of Restarting Computer in MS-DOS Mode |work=support.microsoft.com |date=2007-01-19 |access-date=2014-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205101959/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/138996 |archive-date=2014-02-05 |url-status=live}}</ref> With DOS no longer required to use Windows, the majority of users stopped using it directly.\n\n=== Continued use ===\n[[File:DOSBox screenshot.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[DOSBox]]]]\nAvailable DOS systems in 2012 are [[FreeDOS]], [[DR-DOS]], [[ROM-DOS]], [[PTS-DOS]], [[RxDOS]] and [[REAL/32]].

Machine-dependent versions of MS-DOS were produced for many non-IBM-compatible [[x86]]-based machines, with variations from relabelling of the [[Microsoft]] distribution under the manufacturer's name, to versions specifically designed to work with non-IBM-PC-compatible hardware. As long as application programs used DOS APIs instead of direct hardware access, they could run on both IBM-PC-compatible and incompatible machines. The original [[FreeDOS]] kernel, [[DOS-C]], was derived from [[DOS/NT]] for the Motorola 68000 series of CPUs in the early 1990s. While these systems loosely resembled the DOS architecture, applications were not binary compatible due to the incompatible instruction sets of these non-x86-CPUs. However, applications written in high-level languages could be ported easily.\n\nDOS is a single-user, single-tasking operating system with basic [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] functions that are [[reentrant (subroutine)|non-reentrant]]: only one program at a time can use them and DOS itself has no functionality to allow more than one program to execute at a time. The DOS kernel provides [[DOS API|various functions for programs]] (an ''application program interface''), like character I/O, file management, memory management, program loading and termination.\n\nDOS provides the ability for [[shell script]]ing via [[batch file]]s (with the [[filename extension]] <code>.BAT</code>). Each line of a batch file is interpreted as a program to run. Batch files can also make use of internal commands, such as [[GOTO]] and [[Conditional (programming)|conditional statements]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhope.com/batch.htm |title=Batch File Help |access-date=2008-09-10 |publisher=computerhope.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907080213/http://computerhope.com/batch.htm |archive-date=2008-09-07}}</ref>\n\nThe operating system offers an application programming interface that allows development of character-based applications, but not for accessing most of the [[computer hardware|hardware]], such as [[Video card|graphics card]]s, [[computer printer|printer]]s, or [[computer mouse|mice]]. This required programmers to access the hardware directly, usually resulting in each application having its own set of [[device driver]]s for each hardware peripheral. Hardware manufacturers would release specifications to ensure device drivers for popular applications were available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |title=ZINGTECH - Guide to the New Game Programmer |access-date=2008-09-02 |author-last=Matczynski |author-first=Michael |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061919/http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |archive-date=2008-12-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Boot sequence ===\n* The [[bootstrap loader]] on PC-compatible computers, the [[master boot record]], is located beginning at the [[boot sector]], the first sector on the first track ([[track0|track zero]]), of the boot disk. The [[BIOS|ROM BIOS]] will load this sector into memory at address {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}}, and typically check for a signature \"{{mono|55h AAh}}\" at offset {{mono|+1FEh}}. If the sector is not considered to be valid, the ROM BIOS will try the next physical disk in the row, otherwise it will jump to the load address with certain registers set up.\n*If the loaded boot sector happens to be a [[Master Boot Record]] (MBR), as found on partitioned media, it will relocate itself to {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}} in memory,<ref name=\"dewassoc_com-master_boot_record\">{{cite web |title=The Master Boot Record (MBR) and What it Does |url=http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527211902/http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |archive-date=2013-05-27}} 090912 dewassoc.com</ref> otherwise this step is skipped. The MBR code will scan the partition table, which is located within this sector, for an active partition (modern MBRs check if bit 7 is set at offset {{mono|+1BEh+10h*n}}, whereas old MBRs simply check for a value of {{mono|80h}}), and, if found, load the first sector of the corresponding partition, which holds the [[Volume Boot Record]] (VBR) of that volume, into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} in the similar fashion as it had been loaded by the ROM BIOS itself. The MBR will then pass execution to the loaded portion with certain registers set up.\n* The sector content loaded at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} constitutes a VBR now. VBRs are operating system specific and cannot be exchanged between different DOS versions in general, as the exact behaviour differs between different DOS versions. In very old versions of DOS such as DOS 1.x, the VBR would load the whole IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}}.<ref name=\"pagetable-165\">{{cite web |title=Reverse-Engineering DOS 1.0 &#8211; Part 1: The Boot Sector &laquo; pagetable.com |url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511101728/http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |archive-date=2009-05-11}} 090912 pagetable.com</ref> For this to work, these sectors had to be stored in consecutive order on disk by SYS. In later issues,<!-- at least DOS 3.31 and higher, but probably much earlier --> it would locate and store the contents of the first two entries in the root directory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}} and if they happen to reflect the correct boot files as recorded in the VBR, the VBR would load the first 3 consecutive sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0070h}}:{{mono|0000h}}. The VBR also has to take care to preserve the contents of the [[Disk Parameter Table]] (DPT).<!-- to be detailed at a later time, as this is very OS specific --> Finally, it passes control to the loaded portion by jumping to its entry point with certain registers set up (with considerable differences between different DOS versions).\n* In modern DOS versions, where the VBR has loaded only the first 3 sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory, the loaded portion contains another boot loader, which will then load the remainder of itself into memory, using the root directory information stored at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}}. For most versions, the file contents still need to be stored in consecutive order on disk.<!-- this differs between DOS versions and may need to be detailed --> In older versions of DOS, which were still loaded as a whole, this step is skipped.\n* The DOS system initialization code will initialize its built-in device drivers and then load the DOS kernel, located in [[MSDOS.SYS]] on MS-DOS systems, into memory as well. In Windows 9x, the DOS system initialization code and built-in device drivers and the DOS kernel are combined into a single IO.SYS file while MSDOS.SYS is used as a text configuration file.\n* The [[CONFIG.SYS]] file is then read to [[Parsing#Programming languages|parse]] configuration parameters. The {{mono|SHELL}} variable specifies the location of the [[shell (computing)|shell]] which defaults to [[COMMAND.COM]].\n* The shell is loaded and executed.\n* The startup batch file [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] is then run by the shell.<ref name=\"evergreen_edu-config-sys\">{{cite web |title=CONFIG.SYS Commands |url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502033350/http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |archive-date=2009-05-02}} 090913 academic.evergreen.edu</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |title=The DOS Boot Process |work=The PC Guide |author-last=Kozierok |author-first=Charles |date=2001 |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719191224/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |archive-date=19 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe DOS system files loaded by the boot sector must be [[Fragmentation (computer)|contiguous]] and be the first two [[FAT directory table|directory entries]].<ref name=\"wustl_edu-misc\">{{cite web |title=misc.txt |url=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629152149/http://arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |archive-date=2010-06-29}} 090912 arl.wustl.edu</ref> As such, removing and adding this file is likely to render the media unbootable. It is, however, possible to replace the shell at will, a method that can be used to start the execution of dedicated applications faster.\nThis limitation does not apply to any version of DR&nbsp;DOS, where the system files can be located anywhere in the root directory and do not need to be contiguous. Therefore, system files can be simply copied to a disk provided that the boot sector is DR&nbsp;DOS compatible already.\n\nIn PC&nbsp;DOS and DR&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and above, the DOS system files are named [[IBMBIO.COM]] instead of [[IO.SYS]] and [[IBMDOS.COM]] instead of [[MSDOS.SYS]]. Older versions of DR&nbsp;DOS used DRBIOS.SYS and DRBDOS.SYS instead.\n\nStarting with [[MS-DOS 7.0]] the binary system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS were combined into a single file IO.SYS whilst MSDOS.SYS became a configuration file similar to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. If the MSDOS.SYS [[BootGUI]] directive is set to <code>0</code>, the boot process will stop with the command processor (typically COMMAND.COM) loaded, instead of executing WIN.COM automatically.\n\n=== File system ===\n\nDOS uses a filesystem which supports [[8.3 filename]]s: 8 characters for the filename and 3 characters for the extension. Starting with DOS 2 hierarchical directories are supported. Each directory name is also 8.3 format but the maximum directory path length is 64 characters due to the internal current directory structure (CDS) tables that DOS maintains. Including the drive name, the maximum length of a fully qualified filename that DOS supports is 80 characters using the format drive:\\path\\filename.ext followed by a null byte.\n\nDOS uses the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) filesystem. This was originally [[FAT12]] which supported up to 4078 clusters per drive. DOS 3.0 added support for [[FAT16]] which used 16-bit allocation entries and supported up to 65518 clusters per drive. [[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]] added support for [[FAT16B]] which removed the 32&nbsp;MB drive limit and could support up to 512&nbsp;MB. Finally MS-DOS 7.1 (the DOS component of Windows 9x) added support for [[FAT32]] which used 32-bit allocation entries and could support hard drives up to 137 GB<!-- LBA-28 --> and beyond<!-- LBA-48 -->.\n\nStarting with DOS 3.1, file redirector support was added to DOS. This was initially used to support networking but was later used to support CD-ROM drives with [[MSCDEX]]. IBM PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 also had preliminary installable file system (IFS) support but this was unused and removed in DOS 5.0. DOS also supported Block Devices (\"Disk Drive\" devices) loaded from CONFIG.SYS that could be used under the DOS file system to support network devices.\n\n==== Drive naming scheme ====\n\n{{Main|Drive letter assignment}}\nIn DOS, drives are referred to by identifying letters. Standard practice is to reserve \"A\" and \"B\" for [[floppy drives]]. On systems with only one floppy drive DOS assigns both letters to the drive, prompting the user to swap disks as programs alternate access between them. This facilitates copying from floppy to floppy or having a program run from one floppy while accessing its data on another. [[Hard drives]] were originally assigned the letters \"C\" and \"D\". DOS could only support one active partition per drive. As support for more hard drives became available, this developed into first assigning a drive letter to each drive's active [[primary partition]], then making a second pass over the drives to allocate letters to logical drives in the [[extended partition]], then a third pass to give any other non-active [[primary partition]]s their names (where such additional partitions existed and contained a DOS-supported file system). Lastly, DOS allocates letters for [[optical disc drive]]s, [[RAM disk]]s, and other hardware. Letter assignments usually occur in the order the drivers are loaded, but the drivers can instruct DOS to assign a different letter; drivers for network drives, for example, typically assign letters nearer the end of the alphabet.<ref name=\"driveletter\">{{cite web |url=http://pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |title=Drive Letter Assignment and Choosing Primary vs. Logical Partitions |work=The PC Guide |date=2001-04-17 |access-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417184135/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |archive-date=2012-04-17}}</ref>\n\nBecause DOS applications use these drive letters directly (unlike the /dev directory in [[Unix-like]] systems), they can be disrupted by adding new hardware that needs a drive letter. An example is the addition of a new hard drive having a primary partition where a pre-existing hard drive contains logical drives in extended partitions; the new drive will be assigned a letter that was previously assigned to one of the extended partition logical drives. Moreover, even adding a new hard drive having only logical drives in an extended partition would still disrupt the letters of RAM disks and optical drives.\nThis problem persisted through Microsoft's DOS-based 9x versions of Windows until they were replaced by versions based on the NT line, which preserves the letters of existing drives until the user changes them.<ref name=\"driveletter\"/>\nUnder DOS, this problem can be worked around by defining a SUBST drive and installing the DOS program into this logical drive. The assignment of this drive would then be changed in a batch job whenever the application starts. Under some versions of [[Concurrent DOS]], as well as under [[Multiuser DOS]], System Manager and [[REAL/32]], the reserved drive letter L: will automatically be assigned to the corresponding [[load drive]] whenever an application starts.\n\n==== Reserved device names ====\n{{Main|Device file}}\nThere are reserved device names in DOS that cannot be used as filenames regardless of extension as they are occupied by built-in character devices. These restrictions also affect several Windows versions, in some cases causing crashes and security vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |title=Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Device Name DoS Vulnerability |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725163840/http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |archive-date=2011-07-25}}</ref>\n\nMany device file names are unavailable as file/folder names in Windows, because female computers find them objectionable or offensive. One of the reserved words, Con, has gained notoriety for being the only English word to be a reserved file name. That word is simply one of a kind. That is why Con is yellow pee. If the user attempts to name a folder Con, an error message will pop up saying the specified device name is invalid.

Colons are not necessary to be typed in some cases, for example:\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nECHO This achieves nothing > NUL\n</source>\n\nIt is still possible to create files or directories using these reserved device names, such as through direct editing of directory data structures in disk sectors. Such naming, such as starting a file name with a space, has sometimes been used by viruses or hacking programs to obscure files from users who do not know how to access these locations.\n\n{{Further|Parallel port|COM (hardware interface){{!}}Serial port}}\n\n=== Memory management ===\n{{main|DOS memory management}}\nDOS was originally designed for the Intel 8086/8088 processor and therefore could only directly access a maximum of 1 MB of RAM. Due to PC architecture only a maximum of 640 KB (known as [[conventional memory]]) is available as the upper 384 KB is reserved.\n\nSpecifications were developed to allow access to additional memory. The first was the [[Expanded Memory Specification]] (EMS) which originally allowed memory on an add-on card to be accessed via a 64 KB page frame in the reserved upper memory area. 80386 and later systems could use a [[virtual 8086 mode]] (V86) mode memory manager like [[EMM386]] to create expanded memory from extended memory without the need of an add-on card. The second specification was the [[Extended Memory Specification]] (XMS) for 80286 and later systems. This provided a way to copy data to and from extended memory, access to the 65520-byte [[High Memory Area]] (HMA) directly above the first megabyte of memory and the [[Upper Memory Block]] (UMB) area. Generally XMS support was provided by [[HIMEM.SYS]] or a V86 mode memory manager like [[QEMM]] or [[386MAX]] which also supported EMS.\n\nStarting with DOS 5, DOS could directly take advantage of the HMA by loading its kernel code and disk buffers there via the DOS=HIGH statement in CONFIG.SYS. DOS 5+ also allowed the use of available UMBs via the DOS=UMB statement in CONFIG.SYS.\n\n=== DOS under OS/2 and Windows ===\n{{See also|Virtual DOS Machine}}\n\nThe DOS emulation in OS/2 and Windows runs in much the same way as native applications do. They can access all of the drives and services, and can even use the host's clipboard services. Because the drivers for file systems and such forth reside in the host system, the DOS emulation needs only provide a DOS API translation layer which converts DOS calls to OS/2 or Windows system calls. The translation layer generally also converts BIOS calls and virtualizes common I/O port accesses which many DOS programs commonly use.\n\nIn Windows 3.1 and 9x, the DOS virtual machine is provided by WINOLDAP. WinOldAp creates a virtual machine based on the program's PIF file, and the system state when Windows was loaded. The DOS graphics mode, both character and graphic, can be captured and run in the window. DOS applications can use the Windows clipboard by accessing extra published calls in WinOldAp, and one can paste text through the WinOldAp graphics.\n\nThe emulated DOS in OS/2 and Windows NT is based upon DOS 5. Although there is a default configuration (config.sys and autoexec.bat), one can use alternate files on a session-by-session basis. It is possible to load drivers in these files to access the host system, although these are typically third-party.\n\nUnder OS/2 2.x and later, the DOS emulation is provided by DOSKRNL. This is a file that represents the combined IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM, the system calls are passed through to the OS/2 windowing services. DOS programs run in their own environment, the bulk of the DOS utilities are provided by bound DOS / OS2 applications in the \\OS2 directory. OS/2 can run Windows 3.1 applications by using a modified copy of Windows (Win-OS/2). The modifications allow Windows 3.1 programs to run seamlessly on the OS/2 desktop, or one can start a WinOS/2 desktop, similar to starting Windows from DOS.\n\nOS/2 allows for 'DOS from Drive A:', (VMDISK). This is a real DOS, like MS-DOS 6.22 or PC&nbsp;DOS 5.00. One makes a bootable floppy disk of the DOS, adds a number of drivers from OS/2, and then creates a special image. The DOS booted this way has full access to the system, but provides its own drivers for hardware. One can use such a disk to access cdrom drives for which there is no OS/2 driver.\n\nIn all 32-bit (IA-32) editions of the Windows NT family since 1993, DOS emulation is provided by way of a [[virtual DOS machine]] (NTVDM). 64-bit (IA-64) versions of Windows do not support NTVDM and cannot run 16-bit DOS applications directly; third-party emulators such as DOSbox can be used to run DOS programs on those machines.\n\n== User interface ==\nDOS systems use a [[command-line interface]]. A program is started by entering its filename at the command prompt. DOS systems include utility programs and provide internal commands that don't correspond to programs.<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=7\u201312 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to provide a more user-friendly environment, numerous software manufacturers wrote [[file manager|file management programs]] that provided users with menu- and/or icon-based interfaces. Microsoft Windows is a notable example, eventually resulting in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]] becoming a self-contained program loader, and replacing DOS as the most-used PC-compatible program loader. [[Text user interface]] programs included [[Norton Commander]], [[DOS Navigator]], [[Volkov Commander]], Quarterdesk [[DESQview]], and [[Borland Sidekick|Sidekick]]. [[Graphical user interface]] programs included Digital Research's [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] (originally written for CP/M) and [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]].\n\nEventually, the manufacturers of major DOS systems began to include their own environment managers. MS-DOS/IBM DOS 4 included [[DOS Shell]];<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=71 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318124401/http://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |archive-date=2015-03-18}}</ref> DR DOS 5.0, released the following year, included [[ViewMAX]], based upon GEM.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dvorak's Guide to DOS and PC Performance |author-last1=Dvorak |author-first1=John Charles |author-link1=John Charles Dvorak |author-first2=Nick |author-last2=Anis |pages=442\u2013444 |publisher=[[Osborne McGraw-Hill]] |date=1991}}</ref>\n\n=== Terminate and Stay Resident ===\n{{main|Terminate and Stay Resident}}\nDOS is not a multitasking operating system. DOS did however provide a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis. The PRINT command did this to implement background print spooling. [[Borland Sidekick]], a popup [[personal information manager]] (PIM), also used this technique.\n\nTerminate and Stay Resident programs were also used to provide additional features not available by default. Programs like CED and [[DOSKEY]] provided command line editing facilities beyond what was available in COMMAND.COM. Programs like the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) provided access to files on CD-ROM disks.\n\nSome TSRs could even perform a rudimentary form of task switching. For example, the [[shareware]] program Back and Forth (1990)<ref>Version 1.47 is archived at {{cite web |url=http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |title=Back and Forth 1.47 |access-date=2013-08-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062838/http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |archive-date=2013-11-05}} and says \"(C) 1990 by Progressive Solutions, Inc.\"</ref> had a hotkey to save the state of the currently-running program to disk, load another program, and switch to it, hence it was possible to switch \"back and forth\" between programs, albeit slowly due to the disk access required. Back and Forth could not enable [[background process]]ing however; that needed [[DESQview]] (on at least a [[Intel 80386|386]]).\n\n==Software==\n{{Further|:Category:DOS software}}\n[[File:Arachne VESA Mode.png|thumb|right|250px|Arachne web browser]]\n\n* [[Arachne (web browser)|Arachne]], a 16-bit graphical [[web browser]]\n* [[dBase]], [[database]] program\n* [[Harvard Graphics]], a [[presentation]] graphics design program\n* [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a [[spreadsheet]] has been credited with the success of the IBM PC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18818026 |author-last=Darrow |author-first=Barbara |title=Whatever Happened To Lotus 1-2-3? |date=2002-02-01 |access-date=2008-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109203535/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18818026 |archive-date=2009-01-09}}</ref>\n* [[Norton Commander]] and [[XTree]], file management utilities\n* [[PKZIP]], the compression utility that quickly became the standard in file compression\n* [[ProComm]], [[Qmodem]], and [[Telix]], [[modem]] communication programs\n* [[Borland Sidekick|Sidekick]], personal information manager that could be used from within other programs\n* [[WordPerfect]], a [[word processor]] that was dominant in the 1980s\n* [[WordStar]], word processor originally for CP/M that became popular on the IBM PC\n\n===Development tools===\n* [[BASIC]] language interpreters.

Later compatible systems from other manufacturers include [[DR&nbsp;DOS]]<!-- still written without hyphen in 1988 --> (1988), [[ROM-DOS]] (1989), [[PTS-DOS]] (1993), and [[FreeDOS]] (1998). MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995.\n\nDozens of other operating systems also use the acronym \"DOS\", beginning with the mainframe [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360]] from 1966. Others include [[Apple DOS]], [[Apple ProDOS]], [[Atari DOS]], [[Commodore DOS]], [[TRSDOS]], and [[AmigaDOS]].\n\n== History ==\n{{further|Comparison of DOS operating systems|Timeline of DOS operating systems}}\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[IBM PC&nbsp;DOS]] (and the separately sold [[MS-DOS]]) and its predecessor, [[86-DOS]], was based on [[Digital Research]]'s [[CP/M]]\u2014the dominant disk operating system for [[8-bit]] [[Intel 8080]] and [[Zilog Z80]] microcomputers\u2014but instead ran on [[Intel 8086]] [[16-bit]] processors.\n\nWhen IBM introduced the [[IBM PC]], built with the [[Intel 8088]] microprocessor, they needed an operating system. Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft [[Z-80 SoftCard]], which allowed CP/M to run on an [[Apple II]]).<ref name=\"rolander\">{{cite interview |url=http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |title=The rest of the story: How Bill Gates beat Gary Kildall in OS war, Part 1 |author-last=Rolander |author-first=Tom |author-link=Tom Rolander |interviewer-first=Robert |interviewer-last=Scoble |work=The Scoble Show |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104052350/http://www.podtech.net/home/3801/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |archivedate=2007-11-04}}</ref> IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \"PC&nbsp;DOS\". Digital Research founder [[Gary Kildall]] refused, and IBM withdrew.<ref name=\"rolander\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Just Say No to Microsoft |url=https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove |url-access=registration |author-last=Bove |author-first=Tony |publisher=[[No Starch Press]] |date=2005 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/justsaynotomicro00bove/page/9 9]\u201311 |isbn=1-59327-064-X }}</ref>\n\nIBM again approached Bill Gates. Gates in turn approached [[Seattle Computer Products]]. There, programmer [[Tim Paterson]] had developed a variant of [[CP/M-80]], intended as an internal product for testing SCP's new 16-bit [[Intel 8086]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] card for the [[S-100 bus]]. The system was initially named [[Seattle Computer Products|QDOS]] (Quick and Dirty Operating System), before being made commercially available as [[86-DOS]]. Microsoft purchased 86-DOS, allegedly for {{currency|amount=50000|code=USD|linked=no}}.

Microsoft later required the use of the MS-DOS name, with the exception of the IBM variant. IBM continued to develop their version, [[PC&nbsp;DOS]], for the IBM PC.<ref name=\"mshist\"/> Digital Research became aware that an operating system similar to CP/M was being sold by IBM (under the same name that IBM insisted upon for CP/M), and threatened legal action. IBM responded by offering an agreement: they would give PC consumers a choice of PC&nbsp;DOS or [[CP/M-86]], Kildall's 8086 version. Side-by-side, CP/M cost {{currency|amount=200|code=USD|linked=no}} more than PC&nbsp;DOS, and sales were low. CP/M faded, with MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS becoming the marketed operating system for PCs and PC compatibles.<ref name=\"rolander\"/>\n\nMicrosoft originally sold MS-DOS only to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). One major reason for this was that not all early PCs were 100% [[IBM PC compatible]]. DOS was structured such that there was a separation between the system specific device driver code ([[IO.SYS]]) and the DOS kernel ([[MSDOS.SYS]]). Microsoft provided an OEM Adaptation Kit (OAK) which allowed OEMs to customize the device driver code to their particular system. By the early 1990s, most PCs adhered to IBM PC standards so Microsoft began selling MS-DOS in retail with MS-DOS 5.0.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Microsoft developed a [[MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)|multitasking version of DOS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |title=Did you know that OS/2 wasn't Microsoft's first non Unix multi-tasking operating system? |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104092239/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/03/22/94209.aspx |archive-date=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |title=Larry Osterman\u2019s Biography |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602232429/http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/05/larry-osterman-s-biography.aspx |archive-date=2013-06-02}}</ref> This version of DOS is generally referred to as \"European MS-DOS 4\" because it was developed for [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] and licensed to several European companies. This version of DOS supports preemptive multitasking, shared memory, device helper services and [[New Executable]] (\"NE\") format executables. None of these features were used in later versions of DOS, but they were used to form the basis of the OS/2 1.0 kernel. This version of DOS is distinct from the widely released PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 which was developed by IBM and based upon DOS 3.3.\n\nDigital Research attempted to regain the market lost from CP/M-86, initially with [[Concurrent DOS]], [[FlexOS]] and [[DOS Plus]] (both compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software), later with [[Multiuser DOS]] (compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software) and [[DR&nbsp;DOS]] (compatible with MS-DOS software). Digital Research was bought by [[Novell]], and DR&nbsp;DOS became [[PalmDOS]] and [[Novell DOS]]; later, it was part of [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] (under the names [[OpenDOS]] and [[DR-DOS 7.02]]/[[DR-DOS 7.03|7.03]]), [[Lineo]], and [[DeviceLogics]].\n\n[[Gordon Letwin]] wrote in 1995 that \"DOS was, when we first wrote it, a one-time throw-away product intended to keep IBM happy so that they'd buy our languages\".{{r|letwin19950817}} Microsoft expected that it would be an interim solution before Xenix.

Machine-dependent versions of MS-DOS were produced for many non-IBM-compatible [[x86]]-based machines, with variations from relabelling of the [[Microsoft]] distribution under the manufacturer's name, to versions specifically designed to work with non-IBM-PC-compatible hardware. As long as application programs used DOS APIs instead of direct hardware access, they could run on both IBM-PC-compatible and incompatible machines. The original [[FreeDOS]] kernel, [[DOS-C]], was derived from [[DOS/NT]] for the Motorola 68000 series of CPUs in the early 1990s. While these systems loosely resembled the DOS architecture, applications were not binary compatible due to the incompatible instruction sets of these non-x86-CPUs. However, applications written in high-level languages could be ported easily.\n\nDOS is a single-user, single-tasking operating system with basic [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] functions that are [[reentrant (subroutine)|non-reentrant]]: only one program at a time can use them and DOS itself has no functionality to allow more than one program to execute at a time. The DOS kernel provides [[DOS API|various functions for programs]] (an ''application program interface''), like character I/O, file management, memory management, program loading and termination.\n\nDOS provides the ability for [[shell script]]ing via [[batch file]]s (with the [[filename extension]] <code>.BAT</code>). Each line of a batch file is interpreted as a program to run. Batch files can also make use of internal commands, such as [[GOTO]] and [[Conditional (programming)|conditional statements]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhope.com/batch.htm |title=Batch File Help |access-date=2008-09-10 |publisher=computerhope.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907080213/http://computerhope.com/batch.htm |archive-date=2008-09-07}}</ref>\n\nThe operating system offers an application programming interface that allows development of character-based applications, but not for accessing most of the [[computer hardware|hardware]], such as [[Video card|graphics card]]s, [[computer printer|printer]]s, or [[computer mouse|mice]]. This required programmers to access the hardware directly, usually resulting in each application having its own set of [[device driver]]s for each hardware peripheral. Hardware manufacturers would release specifications to ensure device drivers for popular applications were available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |title=ZINGTECH - Guide to the New Game Programmer |access-date=2008-09-02 |author-last=Matczynski |author-first=Michael |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061919/http://www.zingtech.com/features/gamedev/gnewprog.htm |archive-date=2008-12-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Boot sequence ===\n* The [[bootstrap loader]] on PC-compatible computers, the [[master boot record]], is located beginning at the [[boot sector]], the first sector on the first track ([[track0|track zero]]), of the boot disk. The [[BIOS|ROM BIOS]] will load this sector into memory at address {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}}, and typically check for a signature \"{{mono|55h AAh}}\" at offset {{mono|+1FEh}}. If the sector is not considered to be valid, the ROM BIOS will try the next physical disk in the row, otherwise it will jump to the load address with certain registers set up.\n*If the loaded boot sector happens to be a [[Master Boot Record]] (MBR), as found on partitioned media, it will relocate itself to {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}} in memory,<ref name=\"dewassoc_com-master_boot_record\">{{cite web |title=The Master Boot Record (MBR) and What it Does |url=http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527211902/http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/master_boot_record.htm |archive-date=2013-05-27}} 090912 dewassoc.com</ref> otherwise this step is skipped. The MBR code will scan the partition table, which is located within this sector, for an active partition (modern MBRs check if bit 7 is set at offset {{mono|+1BEh+10h*n}}, whereas old MBRs simply check for a value of {{mono|80h}}), and, if found, load the first sector of the corresponding partition, which holds the [[Volume Boot Record]] (VBR) of that volume, into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} in the similar fashion as it had been loaded by the ROM BIOS itself. The MBR will then pass execution to the loaded portion with certain registers set up.\n* The sector content loaded at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|7C00h}} constitutes a VBR now. VBRs are operating system specific and cannot be exchanged between different DOS versions in general, as the exact behaviour differs between different DOS versions. In very old versions of DOS such as DOS 1.x, the VBR would load the whole IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0600h}}.<ref name=\"pagetable-165\">{{cite web |title=Reverse-Engineering DOS 1.0 &#8211; Part 1: The Boot Sector &laquo; pagetable.com |url=http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511101728/http://www.pagetable.com/?p=165 |archive-date=2009-05-11}} 090912 pagetable.com</ref> For this to work, these sectors had to be stored in consecutive order on disk by SYS. In later issues,<!-- at least DOS 3.31 and higher, but probably much earlier --> it would locate and store the contents of the first two entries in the root directory at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}} and if they happen to reflect the correct boot files as recorded in the VBR, the VBR would load the first 3 consecutive sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at {{mono|0070h}}:{{mono|0000h}}. The VBR also has to take care to preserve the contents of the [[Disk Parameter Table]] (DPT).<!-- to be detailed at a later time, as this is very OS specific --> Finally, it passes control to the loaded portion by jumping to its entry point with certain registers set up (with considerable differences between different DOS versions).\n* In modern DOS versions, where the VBR has loaded only the first 3 sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory, the loaded portion contains another boot loader, which will then load the remainder of itself into memory, using the root directory information stored at {{mono|0000h}}:{{mono|0500h}}. For most versions, the file contents still need to be stored in consecutive order on disk.<!-- this differs between DOS versions and may need to be detailed --> In older versions of DOS, which were still loaded as a whole, this step is skipped.\n* The DOS system initialization code will initialize its built-in device drivers and then load the DOS kernel, located in [[MSDOS.SYS]] on MS-DOS systems, into memory as well. In Windows 9x, the DOS system initialization code and built-in device drivers and the DOS kernel are combined into a single IO.SYS file while MSDOS.SYS is used as a text configuration file.\n* The [[CONFIG.SYS]] file is then read to [[Parsing#Programming languages|parse]] configuration parameters. The {{mono|SHELL}} variable specifies the location of the [[shell (computing)|shell]] which defaults to [[COMMAND.COM]].\n* The shell is loaded and executed.\n* The startup batch file [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] is then run by the shell.<ref name=\"evergreen_edu-config-sys\">{{cite web |title=CONFIG.SYS Commands |url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502033350/http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/biophysics/technotes/program/config-sys.txt |archive-date=2009-05-02}} 090913 academic.evergreen.edu</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |title=The DOS Boot Process |work=The PC Guide |author-last=Kozierok |author-first=Charles |date=2001 |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719191224/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structBoot-c.html |archive-date=19 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe DOS system files loaded by the boot sector must be [[Fragmentation (computer)|contiguous]] and be the first two [[FAT directory table|directory entries]].<ref name=\"wustl_edu-misc\">{{cite web |title=misc.txt |url=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629152149/http://arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cse306-s04/resources/helppc/misc.txt.html |archive-date=2010-06-29}} 090912 arl.wustl.edu</ref> As such, removing and adding this file is likely to render the media unbootable. It is, however, possible to replace the shell at will, a method that can be used to start the execution of dedicated applications faster.\nThis limitation does not apply to any version of DR&nbsp;DOS, where the system files can be located anywhere in the root directory and do not need to be contiguous. Therefore, system files can be simply copied to a disk provided that the boot sector is DR&nbsp;DOS compatible already.\n\nIn PC&nbsp;DOS and DR&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and above, the DOS system files are named [[IBMBIO.COM]] instead of [[IO.SYS]] and [[IBMDOS.COM]] instead of [[MSDOS.SYS]]. Older versions of DR&nbsp;DOS used DRBIOS.SYS and DRBDOS.SYS instead.\n\nStarting with [[MS-DOS 7.0]] the binary system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS were combined into a single file IO.SYS whilst MSDOS.SYS became a configuration file similar to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. If the MSDOS.SYS [[BootGUI]] directive is set to <code>0</code>, the boot process will stop with the command processor (typically COMMAND.COM) loaded, instead of executing WIN.COM automatically.\n\n=== File system ===\n\nDOS uses a filesystem which supports [[8.3 filename]]s: 8 characters for the filename and 3 characters for the extension. Starting with DOS 2 hierarchical directories are supported. Each directory name is also 8.3 format but the maximum directory path length is 64 characters due to the internal current directory structure (CDS) tables that DOS maintains. Including the drive name, the maximum length of a fully qualified filename that DOS supports is 80 characters using the format drive:\\path\\filename.ext followed by a null byte.\n\nDOS uses the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) filesystem. This was originally [[FAT12]] which supported up to 4078 clusters per drive. DOS 3.0 added support for [[FAT16]] which used 16-bit allocation entries and supported up to 65518 clusters per drive. [[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]] added support for [[FAT16B]] which removed the 32&nbsp;MB drive limit and could support up to 512&nbsp;MB. Finally MS-DOS 7.1 (the DOS component of Windows 9x) added support for [[FAT32]] which used 32-bit allocation entries and could support hard drives up to 137 GB<!-- LBA-28 --> and beyond<!-- LBA-48 -->.\n\nStarting with DOS 3.1, file redirector support was added to DOS. This was initially used to support networking but was later used to support CD-ROM drives with [[MSCDEX]]. IBM PC&nbsp;DOS 4.0 also had preliminary installable file system (IFS) support but this was unused and removed in DOS 5.0. DOS also supported Block Devices (\"Disk Drive\" devices) loaded from CONFIG.SYS that could be used under the DOS file system to support network devices.\n\n==== Drive naming scheme ====\n\n{{Main|Drive letter assignment}}\nIn DOS, drives are referred to by identifying letters. Standard practice is to reserve \"A\" and \"B\" for [[floppy drives]]. On systems with only one floppy drive DOS assigns both letters to the drive, prompting the user to swap disks as programs alternate access between them. This facilitates copying from floppy to floppy or having a program run from one floppy while accessing its data on another. [[Hard drives]] were originally assigned the letters \"C\" and \"D\". DOS could only support one active partition per drive. As support for more hard drives became available, this developed into first assigning a drive letter to each drive's active [[primary partition]], then making a second pass over the drives to allocate letters to logical drives in the [[extended partition]], then a third pass to give any other non-active [[primary partition]]s their names (where such additional partitions existed and contained a DOS-supported file system). Lastly, DOS allocates letters for [[optical disc drive]]s, [[RAM disk]]s, and other hardware. Letter assignments usually occur in the order the drivers are loaded, but the drivers can instruct DOS to assign a different letter; drivers for network drives, for example, typically assign letters nearer the end of the alphabet.<ref name=\"driveletter\">{{cite web |url=http://pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |title=Drive Letter Assignment and Choosing Primary vs. Logical Partitions |work=The PC Guide |date=2001-04-17 |access-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417184135/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/partLetter-c.html |archive-date=2012-04-17}}</ref>\n\nBecause DOS applications use these drive letters directly (unlike the /dev directory in [[Unix-like]] systems), they can be disrupted by adding new hardware that needs a drive letter. An example is the addition of a new hard drive having a primary partition where a pre-existing hard drive contains logical drives in extended partitions; the new drive will be assigned a letter that was previously assigned to one of the extended partition logical drives. Moreover, even adding a new hard drive having only logical drives in an extended partition would still disrupt the letters of RAM disks and optical drives.\nThis problem persisted through Microsoft's DOS-based 9x versions of Windows until they were replaced by versions based on the NT line, which preserves the letters of existing drives until the user changes them.<ref name=\"driveletter\"/>\nUnder DOS, this problem can be worked around by defining a SUBST drive and installing the DOS program into this logical drive. The assignment of this drive would then be changed in a batch job whenever the application starts. Under some versions of [[Concurrent DOS]], as well as under [[Multiuser DOS]], System Manager and [[REAL/32]], the reserved drive letter L: will automatically be assigned to the corresponding [[load drive]] whenever an application starts.\n\n==== Reserved device names ====\n{{Main|Device file}}\nThere are reserved device names in DOS that cannot be used as filenames regardless of extension as they are occupied by built-in character devices. These restrictions also affect several Windows versions, in some cases causing crashes and security vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |title=Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Device Name DoS Vulnerability |access-date=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725163840/http://www.juniper.net/security/auto/vulnerabilities/vuln1043.html |archive-date=2011-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe reserved names are:\n\n* <code>CON</code>, for console\n* <code>AUX</code>, for auxiliary\n* <code>PRN</code>, for printer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=DOS+device+names&i=41766,00.asp|title=DOS device names definition|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929150356/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3DDOS+device+names%26i%3D41766%2C00.asp|archive-date=2008-09-29|access-date=2008-09-02}}</ref>\n* <code>LST</code>, for lister; introduced with [[86-DOS]] 0.74<!-- 1981-04-15 -->.<ref name=\"Microsoft_Built-in_devices\">{{cite web |title=MS-DOS Device Driver Names Cannot be Used As File Names |date=2003-05-12 |version=Revision 2.0 |id=KB74496, Q74496 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/74496/en-us |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.is/8xCo |archive-date=2012-07-21}}</ref>\n* <code>NUL</code>, for [[Null device|null devices]]; added in [[86-DOS]] 1.10 and [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 1.0.\n\nThese names (except for NUL) continued to be supported in all versions of MS-DOS, PC&nbsp;DOS and DR-DOS ever since.<ref name=\"Microsoft_Built-in_devices\" /> <code>LST</code> was also available in some OEM versions of MS-DOS 1.25,<!-- f.e.

Colons are not necessary to be typed in some cases, for example:\n<source lang=\"dos\">\nECHO This achieves nothing > NUL\n</source>\n\nIt is still possible to create files or directories using these reserved device names, such as through direct editing of directory data structures in disk sectors. Such naming, such as starting a file name with a space, has sometimes been used by viruses or hacking programs to obscure files from users who do not know how to access these locations.\n\n{{Further|Parallel port|COM (hardware interface){{!}}Serial port}}\n\n=== Memory management ===\n{{main|DOS memory management}}\nDOS was originally designed for the Intel 8086/8088 processor and therefore could only directly access a maximum of 1 MB of RAM. Due to PC architecture only a maximum of 640 KB (known as [[conventional memory]]) is available as the upper 384 KB is reserved.\n\nSpecifications were developed to allow access to additional memory. The first was the [[Expanded Memory Specification]] (EMS) which originally allowed memory on an add-on card to be accessed via a 64 KB page frame in the reserved upper memory area. 80386 and later systems could use a [[virtual 8086 mode]] (V86) mode memory manager like [[EMM386]] to create expanded memory from extended memory without the need of an add-on card. The second specification was the [[Extended Memory Specification]] (XMS) for 80286 and later systems. This provided a way to copy data to and from extended memory, access to the 65520-byte [[High Memory Area]] (HMA) directly above the first megabyte of memory and the [[Upper Memory Block]] (UMB) area. Generally XMS support was provided by [[HIMEM.SYS]] or a V86 mode memory manager like [[QEMM]] or [[386MAX]] which also supported EMS.\n\nStarting with DOS 5, DOS could directly take advantage of the HMA by loading its kernel code and disk buffers there via the DOS=HIGH statement in CONFIG.SYS. DOS 5+ also allowed the use of available UMBs via the DOS=UMB statement in CONFIG.SYS.\n\n=== DOS under OS/2 and Windows ===\n{{See also|Virtual DOS Machine}}\n\nThe DOS emulation in OS/2 and Windows runs in much the same way as native applications do. They can access all of the drives and services, and can even use the host's clipboard services. Because the drivers for file systems and such forth reside in the host system, the DOS emulation needs only provide a DOS API translation layer which converts DOS calls to OS/2 or Windows system calls. The translation layer generally also converts BIOS calls and virtualizes common I/O port accesses which many DOS programs commonly use.\n\nIn Windows 3.1 and 9x, the DOS virtual machine is provided by WINOLDAP. WinOldAp creates a virtual machine based on the program's PIF file, and the system state when Windows was loaded. The DOS graphics mode, both character and graphic, can be captured and run in the window. DOS applications can use the Windows clipboard by accessing extra published calls in WinOldAp, and one can paste text through the WinOldAp graphics.\n\nThe emulated DOS in OS/2 and Windows NT is based upon DOS 5. Although there is a default configuration (config.sys and autoexec.bat), one can use alternate files on a session-by-session basis. It is possible to load drivers in these files to access the host system, although these are typically third-party.\n\nUnder OS/2 2.x and later, the DOS emulation is provided by DOSKRNL. This is a file that represents the combined IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM, the system calls are passed through to the OS/2 windowing services. DOS programs run in their own environment, the bulk of the DOS utilities are provided by bound DOS / OS2 applications in the \\OS2 directory. OS/2 can run Windows 3.1 applications by using a modified copy of Windows (Win-OS/2). The modifications allow Windows 3.1 programs to run seamlessly on the OS/2 desktop, or one can start a WinOS/2 desktop, similar to starting Windows from DOS.\n\nOS/2 allows for 'DOS from Drive A:', (VMDISK). This is a real DOS, like MS-DOS 6.22 or PC&nbsp;DOS 5.00. One makes a bootable floppy disk of the DOS, adds a number of drivers from OS/2, and then creates a special image. The DOS booted this way has full access to the system, but provides its own drivers for hardware. One can use such a disk to access cdrom drives for which there is no OS/2 driver.\n\nIn all 32-bit (IA-32) editions of the Windows NT family since 1993, DOS emulation is provided by way of a [[virtual DOS machine]] (NTVDM). 64-bit (IA-64) versions of Windows do not support NTVDM and cannot run 16-bit DOS applications directly; third-party emulators such as DOSbox can be used to run DOS programs on those machines.\n\n== User interface ==\nDOS systems use a [[command-line interface]]. A program is started by entering its filename at the command prompt. DOS systems include utility programs and provide internal commands that don't correspond to programs.<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=7\u201312 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to provide a more user-friendly environment, numerous software manufacturers wrote [[file manager|file management programs]] that provided users with menu- and/or icon-based interfaces. Microsoft Windows is a notable example, eventually resulting in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]] becoming a self-contained program loader, and replacing DOS as the most-used PC-compatible program loader. [[Text user interface]] programs included [[Norton Commander]], [[DOS Navigator]], [[Volkov Commander]], Quarterdesk [[DESQview]], and [[Borland Sidekick|Sidekick]]. [[Graphical user interface]] programs included Digital Research's [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] (originally written for CP/M) and [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]].\n\nEventually, the manufacturers of major DOS systems began to include their own environment managers. MS-DOS/IBM DOS 4 included [[DOS Shell]];<ref>{{cite book |title=DOS the Easy Way |author-last=Murdock |author-first=Everett |pages=71 |publisher=EasyWay Downloadable Books |isbn=0-923178-02-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318124401/http://books.google.com/books?id=vrsSflB2o5sC |archive-date=2015-03-18}}</ref> DR DOS 5.0, released the following year, included [[ViewMAX]], based upon GEM.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dvorak's Guide to DOS and PC Performance |author-last1=Dvorak |author-first1=John Charles |author-link1=John Charles Dvorak |author-first2=Nick |author-last2=Anis |pages=442\u2013444 |publisher=[[Osborne McGraw-Hill]] |date=1991}}</ref>\n\n=== Terminate and Stay Resident ===\n{{main|Terminate and Stay Resident}}\nDOS is not a multitasking operating system. DOS did however provide a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis. The PRINT command did this to implement background print spooling. [[Borland Sidekick]], a popup [[personal information manager]] (PIM), also used this technique.\n\nTerminate and Stay Resident programs were also used to provide additional features not available by default. Programs like CED and [[DOSKEY]] provided command line editing facilities beyond what was available in COMMAND.COM. Programs like the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) provided access to files on CD-ROM disks.\n\nSome TSRs could even perform a rudimentary form of task switching. For example, the [[shareware]] program Back and Forth (1990)<ref>Version 1.47 is archived at {{cite web |url=http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |title=Back and Forth 1.47 |access-date=2013-08-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062838/http://archives.scovetta.com/pub/fehq/DOSUtils/b_f_147.zip |archive-date=2013-11-05}} and says \"(C) 1990 by Progressive Solutions, Inc.\"</ref> had a hotkey to save the state of the currently-running program to disk, load another program, and switch to it, hence it was possible to switch \"back and forth\" between programs, albeit slowly due to the disk access required. Back and Forth could not enable [[background process]]ing however; that needed [[DESQview]] (on at least a [[Intel 80386|386]]).\n\n==Software==\n{{Further|:Category:DOS software}}\n[[File:Arachne VESA Mode.png|thumb|right|250px|Arachne web browser]]\n\n* [[Arachne (web browser)|Arachne]], a 16-bit graphical [[web browser]]\n* [[dBase]], [[database]] program\n* [[Harvard Graphics]], a [[presentation]] graphics design program\n* [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a [[spreadsheet]] has been credited with the success of the IBM PC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18818026 |author-last=Darrow |author-first=Barbara |title=Whatever Happened To Lotus 1-2-3? |date=2002-02-01 |access-date=2008-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109203535/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18818026 |archive-date=2009-01-09}}</ref>\n* [[Norton Commander]] and [[XTree]], file management utilities\n* [[PKZIP]], the compression utility that quickly became the standard in file compression\n* [[ProComm]], [[Qmodem]], and [[Telix]], [[modem]] communication programs\n* [[Borland Sidekick|Sidekick]], personal information manager that could be used from within other programs\n* [[WordPerfect]], a [[word processor]] that was dominant in the 1980s\n* [[WordStar]], word processor originally for CP/M that became popular on the IBM PC\n\n===Development tools===\n* [[BASIC]] language interpreters.

In the front row are the main [[Gauls|Gaulish]] characters, plus [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cleopatra]].]]\nThis is a list of characters in the ''[[Asterix]]'' comics.\n\n==Main characters==\nAsterix, Obelix and Dogmatix are the first characters with short descriptions usually listed at the beginning of each of the ''Asterix'' books (after the map of Gaul). They each have separate articles containing more information. Unless otherwise stated, this article uses the names chosen for the English translations of the books.\n\n===Asterix===\n{{Main|Asterix (character)}}\nAsterix is the main character. He is a brave, intelligent and shrewd warrior of somewhat diminutive size, who eagerly volunteers for all perilous missions.\n* {{lang-fr|Ast\u00e9rix}} (from ''{{lang|fr|ast\u00e9risque}}'', meaning \"[[asterisk]]\", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Hellenic (Greek) word \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (''aster''), meaning a \"star\"). As the titular character, he is usually the star of the story. His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s: for example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks'', although in Turkish he was first named ''B\u00fcc\u00fcr'' meaning \"shorty\", but the name was then changed. \n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is known as ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'' (\"Rich of love\").\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Soora Pappa}}) could be interpreted as 'heroic grandfather'.\n\n===Obelix===\n{{Main|Obelix}}\nObelix is Asterix's closest friend and works as a [[menhir]] sculptor and delivery man. He is a tall, [[obese]] man (he refers to himself as \"well-padded\" or \"man with a slipped chest\" and will immediately knock out anyone who calls him \"fat\") with two notable attributes: his permanently phenomenal strength and his voracious appetite for food, especially [[wild boar]]. His strength results from having fallen into Getafix's magic potion cauldron as a baby. As a consequence, Getafix will not let him take additional potion for fear of side effects (for example, turning into stone, as shown in ''Asterix and Obelix all at Sea''), something that Obelix finds immensely unfair. The only exception was in ''Asterix and Cleopatra'' when they were trapped in a [[pyramid]] and Getafix allows him to have three drops of the magic potion. Obelix's size is often the brunt of many jokes. In ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', a druid mistakes Obelix for a patient with an [[eating disorder]]. At the end of the book, Obelix decides to go on a diet, but quickly goes back to eating huge quantities of boar.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ob\u00e9lix'': meaning either ''ob\u00e9lisque'' \"[[obelisk]]\", a massive monument, or the [[dagger (typography)|typographical symbol]] (<big>\u2020</big>) (also called an ''obelus'' in English) which is sometimes used to indicate a second footnote if the first footnote is indicated by an asterisk. His name is also almost never changed in official translations (not counting orthographical variations such as ''Obeliks'' in e.g. [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]). Obelix can also mean \"man of the boars\" since the Hellenic (Greek) word \u039f\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (Obelias/Ovelias) means pig or boar.\n* In Icelandic, his name is ''Steinr\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"rich in stone\", due to Obelix's fascination with stones.\n* Early [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] editions called him ''Hopdediks'', after ''{{lang|tr|Hop dedik!}}'', which is a phrase uttered when someone overdoes something. In more recent albums he is ''Oburiks'', after ''{{lang|tr|obur}}'', which means \"gluttonous\".\n\n===Dogmatix===\n\n{{Main|Dogmatix}}\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' (book 5 in France), page 8.\nDogmatix is Obelix's pet dog. Unlike his immense master, Dogmatix is very tiny, but he can have a nasty temper. Dogmatix loves nature and hates to see trees suffer. (Obelix once mentions that this is because Dogmatix likes to urinate on them.) Dogmatix met Asterix and Obelix in Lutetia (in ''Asterix and the Banquet'') and followed them all the way around Gaul until Obelix finally noticed him when they reached the village and Dogmatix barked behind him. Since then, Obelix has become very affectionate toward Dogmatix. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', Obelix gets angry with hungry people who try to take Dogmatix's bone and insists they will be punished if they try to take advantage of his dog. Dogmatix is relatively intelligent, and is particularly good as a hunting dog.  His most noteworthy moments were rescuing Asterix, Obelix and Getafix from entrapment in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra|Cleopatra]]'', finding the captured Asterix in ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing|Great Crossing]]'', and locating the much needed desert petroleum in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold|Black Gold]]''.\n\n* {{lang-fr|Id\u00e9fix}} (''{{lang|fr|id\u00e9e fixe}}'', a \"fixed idea\" or \"obsession\", also a \"prejudice\"). Most translations use some variant of this original name (e.g. ''Ideafix'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Idefiks'' in [[Esperanto]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], and ''\u0130defiks'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Idefix''\n*In [[English language|English]], ''Dogmatix'' comes from ''[[dogma]]tic''&nbsp;\u2014 clinging to an unchanging set of beliefs. The pun is extended because the name also contains the word \"dog\".\n*[[Hindi language|Hindi]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the \u092e\u0927\u0941 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0928 (''[[Madhu Muskan]]'') translations, Dogmatix has been called ''Kutta Bhaunkix'' (\"the dog who barks\")\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is known as ''Gnoyartumix'' (\u0997\u09cb\u0981\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8)&nbsp;\u2014 compare the Bengali term ''{{lang|bn-Latn|gNyoyartumi}}'', which means \"being dogmatic\".\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''Snupix'' (reference to Snoopy) and Fidofiks, and in newest translation as Malix (\"the little one\").\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Mavrix'') means \"bright\".\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], it is ''Mirnixdirnix'' (quickly, immediately; a winged German loan word/expression), ''T\u00f6pszlix'' which refers to his small size, or ''Idefix'', ca. \"here for sure\" referring to fetching.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], it is \u0418\u0434\u0435\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Idefiks''&nbsp;\u2014 directly taken from the French ''Id\u00e9fix'') or \u0413\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Garoviks'', from ''{{lang|sr|garov}}'', a common name for a dog of indeterminable breed)\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] early translations, he was called ''Katrulix'' (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03be) meaning \"he who pees himself\". However, this was considered too demeaning by the readers, and thus was changed to ''Idefix'' (\u0399\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03af\u03be)\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Ideiafix'', a Portuguese variation (''Ideia Fixa'') of the original French name\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} {{transl|si|Chuti Kuku}} which is a name for a dog\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]]&nbsp;\u2014 ''Idefix'' but in the movie ''Asterix and Cleopatra'' he is called ''Ercolino'' (\"Little Hercules\")\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]&nbsp;\u2014 ''Kr\u00edlr\u00edkur''\n\n==Major recurring characters==\nAt the beginning of most of the Asterix books, immediately after the map of Gaul, and before the narrative starts, there is a standard description of the main characters above, as well as Getafix, Cacofonix and Vitalstatistix (regardless of their importance in that particular book).\n\n:The first appearance of all the major characters is in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' unless otherwise noted. Notes are given for languages which have translations of 90% or more of the albums&nbsp;\u2014 primarily European languages along with [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] also falls in this category, but it leaves the French names unchanged. Languages which do not use the \"x\" (such as those of [[Eastern Europe]] like [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Baltic languages]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Esperanto]]) substitute \"ks\" in translations; \"c\" is also not used in some (such as Polish, Greek and Basque) which substitute \"k\" or \"z\" for hard and soft \"c\" respectively in names that are otherwise unaltered.\n\n===Getafix===\n[[File:Getafix the druid.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Asterix and Getafix]]\nGetafix is the village [[druid]]. In appearance, he is tall with a long white [[beard]], white robe, red cloak. He is usually seen in possession of a small golden [[sickle]]. While his age is never stated, in the story of Asterix's birth (in which all but the oldest villagers are seen as small children), he appears unchanged. In ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', the druid Psychoanalytix (who appears quite old) refers to him as his elder and teacher. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'', as a gag, Getafix at 50 years older appears to be frail and old, while in the other books, he appeared healthy.\n\nAlthough known for his strength-enhancing magic potion, he has many other magical and medicinal potions at his disposal, including a potion to make hair grow quickly, a potion to counteract poison, one that neutralizes a drug that would kill in a matter of days, and a potion that restores a person to full health after injury (although this potion also causes the person who takes it to lose their recent memories while also interacting badly with the magic potion). Aside from making the potion, he also acts as the village doctor and occasional teacher. Asterix (and most other villagers) will consult him whenever anything strange occurs. He does not engage normally himself in combat, whereas most of the villagers enjoy a good punch-up (even with each other). One exception is one of the stories explaining Gaulish women, using Mrs. Geriatrix as an example, in which he involves himself in a fight sparked by Impedimenta. The final cut is shown with all the male villagers and two females, Impedimenta and Bacteria included, with Getafix running to stop the fight, with a piece of fish flying towards him. His most notable brawl is when, masquerading as a cook in ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide|The Great Divide]]'', he makes and partakes of the magic potion (passing it off as soup) to free the enslaved men from the divided village, captured by the Romans&nbsp;\u2014 and doing a test run on the slaves who were present&nbsp;\u2014 and then starts distributing slaps with obvious enjoyment.\n\nAs the only individual able to produce the \"magic potion\" upon which the villagers rely for their strength, he is the focus of many stories, ranging from the Romans attempting to put him out of commission in some manner to requesting that Asterix and Obelix help him find some missing ingredient, and the conscience of the village. On a few occasions, he has refused to make the potion when the villagers become too selfish, including in ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he refused to provide the potion for anyone while the village was divided by an upcoming vote for a new chief, only to provide them with it once again when Vitalstatistix asked Getafix to provide the potion for Orthopedix, the man he had been running against for chief. He has also occasionally been taken prisoner by hostile forces to get access to the potion, only to be freed again thanks to Asterix and Obelix. The full recipe of the magic potion itself has never been revealed, but known ingredients are mistletoe (which must be cut with a golden sickle [''[[Asterix and the Golden Sickle]]'']), a whole lobster (an optional ingredient that improves the flavour), fresh fish, salt, and petroleum (called rock oil in the book), which is later replaced by beetroot juice. Replenishing the stores of ingredients for the magic potion has led to some adventures for Asterix and Obelix, including ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\nGetafix is very similar to many [[wise old man|wise old men]] who act as mentors and father-figures to the heroes, such as [[Merlin]] or [[Gandalf]]. In the earlier books however, Getafix came across more as just a friend of the protagonists rather than a wise old counselor. He was also, from the very beginning, shown as a figure of fun and had a wonderful sense of humour: in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', he keeps cutting his finger while using his [[sickle]] and roars with uncontrollable laughter at Asterix's teasing of the Roman Centurion; in ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', he was shown as going literally crazy; and he's not above making the occasional bad pun (such as in ''Asterix and the Great Divide'', when one of the village's frequent \"stale fish\" fights prompts him to observe that the villagers may soon discover nuclear \"fish-ion\").\n\n*[[French language|French]]: ''Panoramix'' (From Hellenic/Greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1/Panorama which means wide view, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03be/Panoramix or \"he who sees everything\")&nbsp;\u2014 in most European translations this name is used, including [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Asturian and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"getting a fix\"&nbsp;\u2014 obtaining a dose of a recreational drug, and a reference to the magic potion he produces; the phrase can also mean to perceive or to get a solid sense of something. In the short-lived American version of the series, he was called ''Magigimmix'' (\"magic gimmicks\"). He was called ''[[RMC Group|Readymix]]'' (the name of a British cement firm) in newspaper comics during the 1970s, as ''Getafix'' was considered inappropriate for children. In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he is referred to by his original French name of ''Panoramix'' and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Vitamix''.\n*In [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is known as ''Miraculix'', from Latin ''miraculum'' (''miracle'').\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is known as \u0410\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aspiriniks''), from the drug [[Aspirin]]. Also in certain translations is known as \u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Panoramiks'').\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''\u010cudomiks'', from ''{{lang|hr|\u010dudo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|hr|miks}}'' (\"mix\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Akvavitix'', from \"[[akvavit]]\", a [[Scandinavia]]n [[distilled beverage]] (derived from ''[[Aqua vitae]]'').\n*In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], his name is ''Crudemix'', \"Cruden\" being [[herbs]] and [[spices]], his name thus means \"Spice mix\".\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Miraklomiks'', from ''{{lang|eo|miraklo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|eo|mikso}}'' (\"mix\")\n*In [[Hindi Language|Hindi]], he is \u0939\u0915\u0940\u092e \u0935\u0948\u0927\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Hakeem Vaidhix''), Hindi for a \"village doctor\".\n*In [[Hungarian Language|Hungarian]], he is ''Magicoturmix'', which is a composition of \"magic\" and \"shake\", thus meaning \"Shake of Magic\". Actually, this is a reference to the potion he is brewing, which gives the villagers their wondrous superhuman strength.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is ''Etashetamix'' (\u098f\u099f\u09be\u09b8\u09c7\u099f\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), meaning \"mix this and that\".\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is ''Sj\u00f3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"one who boils\". In comparison, Asterix is ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'', \"one who loves\".\n*In [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], \u05d0\u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Ashafix''), meaning \"master of the craft\".\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Crycymalix'', a pun on the phrase ''{{lang|cy|cryd cymalau}}'', which means \"arthritis\" or \"rheumatism\", referring to his old age.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Vedha Pappa}}) which means a \"[[druid]]\" or \"[[witch]]\".\n*In Malaysia, the English version that was released in the newspapers, he was \"Medix\" due to the strict laws in the country against drug abuse.\n*In [[Russian Language|Russian]], he is ''\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (''Pochinix''), meaning \"he who repairs things\". The name was translated from the English version, not the French, but the pun about \"getting a fix\" was lost in translation. However, the druid is named \"\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (\"Panoramix\") in all live-action films and Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods.\n*In [[Scots language|Scots]], he is named ''Kensawthetrix'', meaning \"knows all the tricks\".\n\n===Vitalstatistix===\n\nChief Vitalstatistix is the chief of the [[Gaul]]ish village. He is a middle-aged, bigbellied man with red hair, [[pigtail]]s and a huge [[moustache]]. He is generally reasonable, well-informed, fearless, (comparatively) even-tempered and unambitious&nbsp;\u2014 the last much to the chagrin of his wife [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]. His major failings are his love of good food and drink (it is unlikely to be a coincidence that his wife is the best cook in the village)&nbsp;\u2014 which has led to health problems&nbsp;\u2014 and his pride. As a Gaulish chief, he prefers to travel on a [[shield]], carried by two shield bearers (they say pride comes before a fall... and he finds creative new ways to fall off the shield in almost every book). The names of the shield bearers are never mentioned.\n\nVitalstatistix fought at the [[battle of Alesia]] where Caesar (almost) completed his conquest of Gaul, before becoming chief of the village. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', it was revealed that the shield he is carried on originally belonged to the legendary Gaulish warrior chief [[Vercingetorix]].<ref>Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield, p. 5</ref> His father was the village chief before him. He has a brother, Doublehelix, in Lutetia who has a young daughter and a son, [[#Gauls|Justforkix]].\n\nThe introduction to each story states that Vitalstatistix has only one fear \"that the sky may fall on his head tomorrow\"; however, he rarely alludes to this in an actual story, and then only as a rallying cry: ''\"We have nothing to fear but ...\"''.  This characteristic is based on a real historical account where Gallic chieftains were asked by Alexander the Great what they were most afraid of in all the world, and replied that their worst fear was that the sky might fall on their heads.<ref>Arrian, Campaigns of Alexander, p. 49</ref>\n\nAlthough the chief of the village, his role in most plots is usually minor, commonly featuring him granting Asterix and Obelix permission to go on their latest missions, although he has shown a greater involvement in stories such as ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' when he had to battle a rival chieftain, ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'' when he traveled to a health spa on Getafix's orders to cure a liver complaint and to lose weight, ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'', where he traveled to Belgium to defend his honor when Caesar apparently proclaimed that the Belgians were the bravest of all the Gaulish peoples, or ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he ran against a new arrival in the village for the position of chief.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Abraracourcix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 bras raccourcis}}''&nbsp;literally \u2014 \"with shortened arms\" from the French phrase ''{{lang|fr|tomber sur quelqu'un \u00e0 bras raccourcis}}'' \u2013 \"to attack someone with violence\")&nbsp;\u2014 this is the same in Italian, Portuguese, Spanish (also called Abrazopartidix in some editions) and (original) Dutch (although the \"o\" is usually dropped).\n*In [[English language|English]], his name is a pun on [[Vital statistics (government records)|Vital statistics]]&nbsp;\u2014 the government birth and death records of a region and also an expression for a person's measurements (a comment on [[BWH|his size]]). In the American translation, he was ''Macroeconomix'' from [[macroeconomics]]. NOTE: In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he also appears to have been called ''Tonabrix'', and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Bombastix''.\n*In Catalan, he is ''Copdegarr\u00f2tix''  (''{{lang|ca|cop de garrot}}''&nbsp;\u2014 \"club hit\").\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], He is Vrhovnix, from {{lang|hr|vrh}} means \"supreme\" (vrhovni,najvi\u0161i) and -ix.\n*In [[German language|German]], Greek, [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], he is ''Majestix'' from \"majestic\"; similarly in new Dutch translations he is ''Heroix'' from \"heroic\".\n* In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Mo\u015dtiks'' (''{{lang|eo|via mo\u015dto}}''&nbsp;\u2014 ''your highness'').\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Aladobix'', referring to ''{{lang|fi|aladobi}}'', a Finnish jelly-like dish containing meat (from the French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 la daube}}'').\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Hasarengazfix'', which means \"His belly surely shakes\".\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Asparanoiks'', referring to [[paranoia]], the fear of the sky falling on his head.\n*In Turkish, ''Toptoriks'', alluding to his roundness (''top'' meaning ball in Turkish).\n*In Brazilian Portuguese, his name is usually shortened to ''Abracurcix''.\n*In Hindi translation, his name is mentioned as \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092e\u094b\u091f\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Mukhiya Motumallix''), which literally means 'The Fat Chief'.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the chief has a name phonetically similar to some extent to his English one: ''Bishalakritix'' (\u09ac\u09bf\u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), taken from the root ''bishalakriti'', which aptly means \"of huge proportions\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], his name is \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''lokhem-amix''), meaning \"brave warrior\".\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Drmatoriks''), from ''{{lang|sr|drmator}}'', a slang term for Communist era movers and shakers (''{{lang|sr|drmati}}'' means \"to shake\"). Also in certain translations is known as \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tandarabriks'')\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Einharweinix'', from ''ein harweinydd'' (our leader).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] film variations he was called \u03a7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Khontrobalix''), from \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 (''khontrobal\u00e1s'', dubbing a man \"fat ball\"), but is currently referred to as \u039c\u03b1\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Mazestix'', from French ''{{lang|fr|majestueux}}'': \"majestic\"). He was also formerly called \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03be (''Monarchix'') from the word \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''mon\u00e1rch\u0113s'': \"monarch\") but the name changed in the later book translations after 1991.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Loku Pappa}}) which means big or head/leader.\n*In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], he is ''Ataaufbix''. ''{{lang|sv|Ata}}'' means \"dad\" or \"father\" and ''{{lang|sv|aufbiks}}'' is a folk invitation to a fight.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], he is ''Bra\u021bscurtarix''.<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''{{lang|ro|bra\u021b}}'' meaning \"arm\" and ''{{lang|ro|scurt}}'' meaning \"short\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Zhiznestatistiks). \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\" means \"life\", and \"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\" means \"statistics\". In the \"Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods\" the chief is named \"\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (Avtoritarix). In the \"Asterix & Obelix Take on Caesar\" he is named \"\u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (broken version of the French name).\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Naidobrix), derived from \"\u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u044a\u0440\", simply meaning \"the best one\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Majestatix'', derived from word ''Majest\u00e1tn\u00ed'' meaning majestic.\n*In Icelandic he is A\u00f0alr\u00edkur.\n\n====Chief's shieldbearers====\n\nFrom ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'' onwards, Vitalstatistix has had the same (unnamed) bearers carry (and drop) him; prior to that, he had different bearers in each album. In ''[[Asterix in Switzerland]]'', he fires both his shield bearers after he tells them that it is a lovely day, and they look up, tipping the shield back and dropping the chief in the process. He then goes and hires new shield bearers including Asterix, Geriatrix, Fulliautomatix and Obelix (in these cases the shield is horribly tilted so he is forced to stand on a slant, and Obelix carried him with one hand like a waiter). The introduction page varies between showing the bearers straining under Vitalstatistix' not inconsiderable bulk as he looks into the distance in some of the books, while in others he looks at them in good humour as they look up to him in respect.\n\n====Impedimenta====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' (but not named until ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'').\nImpedimenta is the matriarchal wife of [[#Vitalstatistix|chief Vitalstatistix]], leader of the village wives and the best cook in the village. She is often disappointed with the other villagers (calling them barbarians) and wishes Vitalstatistix was more ambitious. Consequently, she zealously defends and flaunts every privilege due to her as first lady of the village, such as skipping the queue at the fishmongers. She frequently says she wants to go back to [[Lutetia]] and live with her successful merchant brother, [[#Gauls|Homeopathix]] \u2014 the one member of the family her husband openly dislikes.\n\nShe nicknamed Vitalstatistix \"Piggywiggy\" when they were courting, and starts doing this again in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'' as a plan to make Asterix and Obelix erupt in hysterical laughter when she calls him by that name in front of them, thus irritating him and making him punish them by forcing them to stay in the village, away from the soothsayer.<ref>''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', p. 15</ref>\n\nOn occasion she has an antagonistic rivalry with Mrs. Geriatrix that has erupted into violence.  One such occasion was in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' where the two beat each other with fish from Unhygenix's store over the fakir Watziznehm's carpet.\n\nWhile usually presented in the books as a nag to her embarrassed husband, she has on occasion fought the Romans side by side with the men, typically using her rolling pin as a weapon.  In emergencies, she's famous for remaining in control, as in [[Asterix and Son]] where during a Roman attack she fearlessly led the women and children out of the burning village.\n\nHer name appears to derive either from the Latin military term \"impedimenta,\" meaning \"baggage,\" or from the English word \"impediment,\" meaning obstruction or hindrance.\n\n*In [[French language|French]]: ''Bonnemine'' (''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}'', meaning \"good countenance\", derived from the French expression \"faire bonne mine\" for \"putting on a brave face\") \u2014 also used in Swedish or Esperanto; chief Abraracourcix calls her ''Mimine''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Bonemina'' \u2014 and sometimes \"Mimina\" \n*In [[English language|English]], the name is derived from ''[[wiktionary:impediment|impediment]]'', an obstacle, but possibly also a reference to the Latin ''impedimenta'', meaning ''baggage''; (in the American translations: ''Belladonna'' \u2014 a poisonous plant used in cosmetics whose name means ''beautiful lady'').\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], she is ''Beniamina'', more often \"Mimina\".\n*In Spanish, she is ''Karabella '' (meaning \"beautiful face\").\n*In Portuguese, she is called Bonemine in some stories and Caralinda in others (Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|cara linda}}'', \"beautiful face\").\n*In the Brazilian translation she is ''[[naphthalene|Naftalina]]''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Bellefleur'' (a name for a type of red apple; \"beautiful flower\" in French).\n*In [[German language|German]], she is ''Gutemine''; Danish and Norwegian, ''Godemine'', presumably from the old saying ''{{lang|de|Gute Miene zum b\u00f6sen Spiel machen}}'' (German), ''{{lang|da|At holde gode miner til slet spil}}'' (Danish): \"To keep up appearances in the face of bad deeds\", literally: \"To show a happy face along a bad game\"), and mirroring the French ''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}''.\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], she is ''Hengerlice''; which means \"tumbler pigeon\", a pun on her being a little fat.\n*In Turkish, she is ''Dedi\u011fimdediks''. ''{{lang|tr|Dedi\u011fim dedik}}'' refers to someone who insists on getting their way.\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], she is ''A\u00f0albj\u00f6rg'' (an ancient Icelandic name which means \"noble female protector\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], she is ''Smirgeline'' (a pun on the Finnish word ''{{lang|fi|smirgeli}}'' meaning both \"emery\" and \"bench grinder\", by way of the Finnish [[dysphemism]] for a \"shrew\" being a grinder)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], she is ''Dobromina'' (most likely a pun on the Polish saying ''{{lang|pl|robi\u0107 dobr\u0105 min\u0119 do z\u0142ej gry}}'', which has the same meaning as the German/Danish/Norwegian translation above, and the [[old Polish]] female given name ''Dobromira'' (\"the one who values goodness and peace\") or ''Dobromi\u0142a'' (\"the one who is good and nice\").\n*In Catalan, she is sometimes called ''Bonemina'', but more usually ''Karabella''.\n*In Hindi, she is referred to as \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0930\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e (''Pyari Sirdarda''), the beloved, who causes Headache.\n*In Hebrew, she is called \u05d6\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (''Zivpanim''), meaning \"bright face\".\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: {{lang|si|\u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4 \u0dc4\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dda}} ({{transl|si|loku hamine}})\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], she is ''Bombona'', literally meaning \"candy\", but also something lovely and well-arranged.\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], she is ''\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e\u043c\u043e\u044f'' (Dushomoya). \"\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e \u043c\u043e\u044f\" is a common pet name in Bulgaria used by husbands when addressing their wives (usually with older couples). Literally translates as \"my soul\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], she is ''Bledul\u00edna'' meaning \"pale skinned\".\n*In the new [[Scots language|Scots]] translations, she is ''Boniquine'' meaning \"beautiful woman\".\n\n===Cacofonix===\n\nCacofonix is the village bard. He is usually only a supporting character, but has a major part in the plots of some albums (see ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'', ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'', and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''). He loves singing and playing his [[lyre]], and jumps at every opportunity to do so. He also plays the [[bagpipes]], [[drum]] and a Celtic [[trumpet]] resembling a boar called a [[Carnyx]]. While he can accompany traditional dances, and conducts a village band, his singing is unbearable. In ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'' it is so unbearable that it teaches the fearless Normans the meaning of fear. In later albums his music is so spectacularly horrible that it actually starts thunderstorms (even indoors), because of an old French saying that bad singing causes rain.\n\nFor his part, Cacofonix considers himself a genius and a superb singer, and he is angrily offended when people criticize his singing, to the point of dismissing them as barbarians. He is slightly effeminate, often seen smoothing back his hair and holding his head up high.\n\nSome villagers go to extreme lengths to avoid hearing Cacofonix's music. Most notably, Fulliautomatix, the village smith, bangs him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song, and has destroyed his lyre on a number of occasions, at one point being called the \"ancestor of music critics\". As a [[running gag]], Cacofonix is generally tied up and gagged during the banquet at the end of most albums to allow the other villagers to have a good time without having to keep him from singing. He is nonetheless well liked when not singing.\n\nIn contrast to the villagers, some of the younger generations whom Cacofonix has met do appreciate his \"talent\": Justforkix (in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'') actually encouraged Cacofonix to think seriously about moving to [[Lutetia]] where he claimed the bard's way with music would be enjoyed; Pepe (in ''[[Asterix in Spain]]'') liked it because it reminded him of home (the goats bleating in his village); and Princess Orinjade (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') expressed similar enthusiasm, though it was perhaps in gratitude for his music having saved her from being sacrificed. Similarly, the village youths express a liking for his unconventional music in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n\nUnlike the other villagers, whose [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s are on the ground, Cacofonix's hut is perched up in a tree. Ostensibly this is so that he can act as a lookout to warn the other villagers of imminent invasion, but the real reason is to let him practise his music as far from everyone as possible. It has been felled several times, often by Obelix, but has been replanted, or restored by Getafix's magic acorns (in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'').\n\nIn the English and American adaptations of the series, he speaks in an effeminate voice.\n\nIn the animated ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', Cacofonix is seen playing a rock song trying to restore Getafix's memory, one occasion where Fulliautomatix and Unhygienix are not annoyed or angry with him.\n\nHe and Getafix are the village's teachers, as only bards and druids are allowed to teach in school. He is rarely seen fighting the Romans (not even joining fish-fights that often) except when his personal honour is impugned and appear to be more [[Pacifism|\npacifistic]] than the rest of the villagers. His voice apparently does not mix well with the magic potion, although in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' it actually restores him to full voice.  The fact that he is incredibly arrogant may also be partly to blame, as in at least one volume (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'') he is shown to have not even noticed the other villagers are fighting the Romans and is actually shown asking Getafix what's going on (however, he had been suffering from a lost voice earlier in this volume and may have simply been staying in his hut while waiting to recover). In ''[[Asterix and the Missing Scroll]]'' it is revealed that he is the second stage of the village's 'emergency measure' if they are attacked while Getafix is absent; the first stage involves a secret supply of potion in the chief's hut, while the second stage involves Cacofonix blowing on a very loud horn to set up a signal to alert Getafix to danger, Vitalstatistix noting that this is the main reason the village still puts up with Cacofonix.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Assurancetourix'' (''{{lang|fr|Assurance tous risques}}'' meaning \"comprehensive insurance\") \u2013 also in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Asuranceturix''), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''Asseguran\u00e7at\u00f3rix''), [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and original [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations.\n*In [[English language|English]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''Cacofonix'' is derived from [[cacophony|cacophonic]] (describing \"harsh and unpleasant sounds\"), from Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (''kakos'', meaning \"bad\") and \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae (''phon\u0113'', meaning \"voice\"). In the American version of the series, he was called ''Malacoustix'', which refers to \"bad acoustics\". In the English dub of the film ''Asterix the Gaul'' he is called ''Stopthemusix'' (a pun on the phrase \"stop the music\") and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Franksinatrix'' (a pun on [[Frank Sinatra]]).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039a\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03be (''Kakofonix'') and similarly ''Kakofonix, Kakofoniks'' in Polish, Turkish and in new Dutch translations.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], his name is \u0422\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tamburiks''). The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Serbia]]. ''Tamburati'' (\"to play tambura\") is Serbian slang meaning \"to beat someone up\". At the end of many albums, ''Tamburiks'' often gets beaten up, gagged and tied to a tree.\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], his name is Tamburix. The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Croatia]].\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Troubadix''; in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Trubadurix'', and in [[Czech Language|Czech]] ''Trubadix''. These are puns on \"[[troubadour]]\", a word for \"bard\".\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Chatotorix'' (meaning \"annoying\" or \"the very dull one\").\n*In [[Hindi language|Hindi]], he is \u0917\u0935\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0901 \u092c\u0947\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Gavaiya\u00f1 Besurix'') meaning \"one who sings out of tune\".\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], this bard is known as ''Kawlorobix'' (\u0995\u09b2\u09b0\u09ac\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8) \u2013 the root being ''{{lang|bn-Latn|kawlorob}}'' \u2013 meaning \"making a lot of noise for no purpose\"\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] translation he is ''Hangjanix'', which means \"He absolutely has no voice\".\n*Similarly, the [[Esperanto]] name ''Malmuziks'' means \"the contrary of music\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Khamshirix'') which can be literally translated back as ''Limerix'' (from \"[[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]\").\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] he is ''\u00d3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', originally meaning \"rich in odes\" but can also be interpreted as \"rich in madness\". A music-making competition in one of Iceland's most prestigious pre-colleges is named in his honour.\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Odlgymix'', from ''{{lang|cy|odl gymysg}}'' (\"mixed rhyme\", a metre of Welsh verse).\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] he is {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Caco Pappa}}), similar to ''Cacofonix''.\n*In [[Latin Language|Latin]], he is ''Cantorix'', from ''{{lang|la|cantor}}'' \"singer\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Vsebezrix). Most likely derived from \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\", meaning \"always without risk\", which is somewhat close to his original French name, but it can also be interpreted as \"\u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0430\", meaning \"looks into himself\", which might be a reference to him being an artist.\n*In [[Irish language|Irish]], his name is ''D\u00e1nd\u00edrix'' \u2013 [[D\u00e1n D\u00edreach]] is a style of Irish poetry designed to be accompanied by a harp.\n*In Scots, he is ''Magonaglix'' - after the notoriously incompetent Scottish poet William McGonagall.\n\n===Geriatrix===\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''<ref>Asterix the Gladiator</ref> but first named in ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]''\nGeriatrix is the oldest inhabitant of Asterix's village: he is mentioned as 93 years old in  ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]'' (while drunk, he says he feels ten years younger, to which Asterix replies, \"Well, that makes you 83, and it's time you were in bed\"). Some translations make him no more than 80.\n\nAs an elder, Geriatrix demands respect (generally more than he is given). Nonetheless he dislikes being treated as old and will attack anyone who comments to that effect. In particular he often beats up the village blacksmith Fulliautomatix for refusing to fight back due to his age, and actually cries out to be attacked. Geriatrix is seen to sit on the village council at times, on the face of it an entitlement deriving from being the oldest in the community. An example is on p.&nbsp;11 of ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]'' where he sits with Vitalstatistix, Cacofonix and Getafix, in deciding on Asterix's punishment for having violated their honor code. In ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' he acquires a club which he later uses to knock down ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''.\n\nGeriatrix is against foreigners who are not from his village. He is a veteran of the [[Battle of Gergovia]] and the [[Battle of Alesia]], and refers to them when excited (\"It'll be just like Gergovia all over!\") or distraught (\"It's just like Alesia all over again!\").\nHe has an eye for the young ladies and has a very young and beautiful wife (who appears to be in her twenties) of whom he is very possessive \u2014 particularly when Obelix is around.\n\nIn [[prequels]] such as ''[[How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy]]'', in which most of the characters are children and Vitalstatistix is a slim young man, Geriatrix, along with Getafix, is unchanged.\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Agecanonix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00c2ge canonique}}'', meaning \"very old age\") (also in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as ''Decanonix'' \u2014 from ''{{lang|pt|Decano}}'', \"dean\").\n*In [[English language|English]], the name comes from [[Geriatrics]], the branch of medicine dealing with old age. He is also known as ''Arthritix'' in the American translations.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), from \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 (''[[Methuselah]]'').\n*In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], he is ''Edadepiedrix'' and ''Edatdep\u00e8drix'' in Catalan (meaning \"Stone Age\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and  [[North Germanic languages|the Scandinavian languages]], he is ''Senilix'' (from [[senile]]).\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], he is ''Matusalemix'', from ''Matusalem'' ([[Methuselah]]), the biblical \"old man\", similarly in [[German language|German]], ''Methusalix'' and in [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), formerly \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03be (''Palaiontologix'').\n* In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Dedoviks''), from Serbian ''{{lang|sr|deda}}'' (\"grandfather\").\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05d0\u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05e7\u05e9\u05d9\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Methushelakhix'', ''Ashmaix'' (Asterix at the Olympic Games), ''Kashishnix'' (Animated films)).\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Nestorix'' (after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Metuzalemix, from [[Methuselah]] and -ix.\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Dojeniks'' (from ''{{lang|eo|dojeno}}'' \u2014 doyen, wise old man)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Ramoliks'' (\"grumpy old man\") or ''D\u0142ugowieczniks'' (\"long living\").\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Sokadikix'' (\"umpteenth decade\") or ''Tatix'' (from ''{{lang|hu|tata}}'', an informal way to address old men) or ''Rozogav\u00e9nix'' (\"rickety old\") or  ''Matuzs\u00e1lemix'' (Methuselah)\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Veteranix''.\n*In the [[Hindi]] translation he is \u092c\u0941\u0921\u094d\u0922\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Buddhix''), which means \"the old man\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] he is ''Eskitopraks'' meaning \"old timer\".\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] he is ''Capeloyonix'' which loosely translates to \"old hunched man who is easily tired\". (Cape \u2013 pronounced as Chapeh: meaning tired; Loyo; meaning weak)\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Starix), from the word \"\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\", meaning \"old timer\" or \"old geezer\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Archaix'' based on word \"archaic\". In some cases he is called ''Kmetix'' based on word \"kme\u0165\" meaning very old man.\n\n====Mrs. Geriatrix====\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Geriatrix enjoys her husband's devotion and also her status as wife of the village's most senior inhabitant, which makes her one of the inner circle of village wives. Her youthful appearance suggests that she is less than half her husband's age; she is also a lot taller. Although as ambitious and gossip-prone as the other wives, she has also shown herself to be very quick-witted. She is an excellent seamstress but has Geriatrix do most of the housework. She rules her home and marriage, and regularly tells her husband what to do even in direct contradiction of his own stated opinions. She does seem to be happily married, however, and the only serious conflict in her marriage is her occasional apparent interest in [[Obelix]] which makes her husband insanely jealous. On one occasion, she is offered the magic potion. She does not appear to be interested and says that it's very fattening, while staring at Obelix. She appears to be in favour of women's rights, as shown in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She eagerly accepted the radical changes in the village that occurred in this story. She and Impedimenta cause a gigantic fight in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#Mini Midi Maxi|Mini Midi Maxi]]\".\n\n* She has never been officially named and is always referred to by [[Mrs#Traditional usage|the local title for wife]] and the translation of her husband's name ([[Uderzo]] has stated she is partially based on his own wife and he wishes to retain an air of mystery). In ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', Impedimenta appears to address her as ''Myopia'' (which, given her choice of spouse would be extremely appropriate), but, as explained in this page\u2019s note, this is an invocation to a Gaulish Goddess (of short-sightedness) thus a [[double entendre]].\n\n===Unhygienix===\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nUnhygienix is the village [[fishmonger]], as was his father Unhealthix before him (as seen in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''). His fish do not come from the sea near the village even though he has a fishing boat; instead they are transported all the way from [[Paris|Lutetia]] (and from [[Marseilles|Massilia]] in the German translations) as he believes they are of finer quality. He does not notice their smell, but most of the other villagers do and a lot of fights are caused by his stale fish, as when the blacksmith Fulliautomatix says: \"Anyway, it [the fight] wouldn't have happened if they [the fish] were fresh!\" and then Unhygenix slaps him with his fish.\nHe regularly has fights about his fish with his friend [[#Fulliautomatix|Fulliautomatix]], the village blacksmith, which often escalate to involve most of the village. Fulliautomatix says the fish are stale, Unhygienix throws a fish at him, he throws it back, it hits someone else, etc., and the whole village gets into a fight. This rivalry is a family tradition \u2014 their fathers also fought, and their children are continuing it. Despite this, his catch phrase is a scream to his wife, \"Bacteria! Get the fish inside!\" or \"Save the sales!\", in fights on the village he doesn't want to enter (i.e. fights that are not about his fish), when villagers buy or steal his fish to fight with. \n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ordralfab\u00e9tix'' (''{{lang|fr|Ordre alphab\u00e9tique}}'', meaning \"alphabetical order\") \u2014 this is essentially the same in Spanish (Ordenalfab\u00e9tix), Portuguese, Catalan and Italian (''Ordinalfabetix''), as well as Hebrew (\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, ''Lefisederalphabetix'')\n*In [[English language|English]], he is ''Unhygienix'' (\"unclean\" from \"[[hygiene|unhygienic]]\"), and in the American dub of ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', he is called Fishstix (from [[Fish finger|fish sticks]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Abecedix from [[alphabet]] and -ix.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Kostunrix'' (\"costs a riks\", ''{{lang|nl|riks}}'' being short for ''[[rijksdaalder]]'', 2\u00bd [[Dutch guilder|guilders]])\n*In [[German language|German]], he is ''Verleihnix''  (''{{lang|de|Verleih' nichts}}'' \u2014 \"(I) do not lend anything\", especially not fish because, as Bacteria puts it, people are so careless and return the fish in poor condition).\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Crabbofix'' (close to \"crab and fish\")\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], he is ''H\u00f8rmetix'' (''{{lang|da|H\u00f8rme}}'' means \"to stink\")\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is ''Hermetix'' (''{{lang|no|Hermetikk}}'' refers to the food contained in [[hermetic seal|hermetic]] [[tin can]]s)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Szykalfabetiks'' (\"alphabetical order\") or ''Ahigieniks'' (\"unhygienic\")\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Messesaglix'' (\"stinks far\")\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aerobiks'') \u2014 a pun on the word \"[[aerobics]]\"\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], he is \"Ordenalfabetix\" (\"alphabetic order\")\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Fi\u015da\u0109iks'' [\"fishachix\"] (''{{lang|eo|fi\u015da\u0109o}}'' \u2014 ''rotten fish'')\n*In [[Hebrew]], his name is ''\u05d1\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1'' [\"beseder-alephbetix\"] meaning in lexicographical order.\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Amaryllix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u0391\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Alfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"alphabet\" \u2014 formerly \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Katalfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"in alphabetical order\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Palamutiks''.

In addition to being a direct translation of the original French name, this could also be a reference to the first published Bulgarian schoolbook, which taught children the alphabet and featured a picture of a whale at the end of it, giving it the nickname \"The Fish Schoolbook\" (despite whales being mammals, not fish).\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Alfabetix'' based on English word \"alphabet\".\n*in [[Scots language|Scots]], he is ''Minginhaddix'', the play being ''mingin' haddocks''. ''Minging'' is a colloquialism used in various regions of the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Scotland]], meaning ''disgusting.'' \n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' based on \"Anti sanitation\".\n\n====Bacteria====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nBacteria is the wife of Unhygienix. She is one of the inner circle of village wives. She is quiet and easy-going, but doesn't hesitate to say exactly what she thinks. She helps her husband run his shop, selling fish of dubious quality, and is unperturbed by the bizarre uses to which they are sometimes put. They have two sons (whose names have not been mentioned) \u2014 one with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and the other with red hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\nIn ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' the blonde son is seen having taken over the shop but rather than to import the fish from Lutetia, he gets the fish he sells from the nearby sea. This displeases his father who fears that the \"good name of the shop will go to waste\" that way.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''I\u00e9losubmarine'' (a pun on \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\") \u2014 a variant of this is used in most translations.\n*In [[English language|English]], [[bacteria]] is the name for a [[biological kingdom|kingdom]] of microorganisms, some of which are responsible for various diseases, keeping the same unsanitary character as her husband's name.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Forentientje'' (''{{lang|nl|voor een tientje}}'', \"for ten guilders\", matching the monetary theme of her husband's name).\n*In [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], she is ''Remouladine''. (After the dressing, [[remoulade]], popular in Scandinavia and often eaten along with fish.){{citation needed |date=June 2011 |reason=but her name is never used in Swedish!}}\n* In [[Polish language|Polish]] she is ''Jelousubmarina'', which is \"yellow submarine\" written according to Polish pronunciation and with a female ending. Similar in [[German language|German]]: Jellosubmarine.\n\n===Fulliautomatix===\nFulliautomatix is the village [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]. His father, Semiautomatix, was the village smith before him. He is tall and [[wikt:robust|robust]], and very [[wikt:strong|strong]] \u2014 he is one of the strongest characters, perhaps second only to Obelix, and a bit of a ruffian, especially to Cacofonix. Fulliautomatix's first appearance was in the first volume, ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', where the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] spy was amazed that he used his fists to forge [[iron]]. However, he is subsequently shown using a normal [[hammer]] and is now rarely seen without one.\nA very different looking Fulliautomatix appeared in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' in which he and Obelix argue as to who should be entitled to punch the Roman that they are both engaged in hitting anyway.\n\nFulliautomatix often interacts with [[#Unhygienix|Unhygienix]], the fishmonger, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. Fulliautomatix claims the [[fish]] he sells are stale, and this often results in Unhygienix throwing a fish at his face, causing a fight (sometimes the other villagers join in just for fun).<ref>Asterix in Belgium</ref>\nFulliautomatix also takes great pleasure in abusing, breaking the lyre of [[#Cacofonix|Cacofonix]] the bard, threatening him and hitting him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song (the songs are so bad that the other villagers do not object) \u2014 this happens so frequently that Cacofonix only protests about it if he hadn't intended to sing in the first place (such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where it turned out Cacofonix just wanted to tell Fulliautomatix that he was standing on Cacofonix's toes, which Fulliautomatix was unaware of due to the current snow covering their feet). It has been stated that he is perhaps the ancestor of all music critics. On the other hand, he is occasionally beaten up with a cane by [[#Geriatrix|Geriatrix]] when he is provoked by some comment the smith makes. When this happens he will often take out his frustration on the nearest convenient bystander (Cacofonix for preference) on the grounds that he does not feel he can fight back against someone so old, which only helps to further incense the old man.\n\nFulliautomatix also has two unnamed children who have appeared in separate comics \u2014 a son with blond hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and a daughter with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. In ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide]]'' he is shown as having an [[apprentice]], though it is not specified if he's a relative; some speculate that he is the young son grown to teenage years, while in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]'' a young man resembling him is introduced as his eldest son. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' Fulliautomatix is seen as an elderly man with his now adult son having taken over business; the scene begins with his son making steel dentures for Fulliautomatix, who has gone toothless over the years.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''C\u00e9tautomatix'' (''{{lang|fr|c'est automatique}}'', meaning \"it is automatic\") \u2014 the languages of Iberia follow fairly literally: ''Esautom\u00e1tix'' in Spanish, ''Esautom\u00e0tix'' in Catalan and ''Zetautomatix'' in Basque; in Portuguese ''Ceutautomatix'' or ''\u00c9automatix''.\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"fully automatic\"\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Poluautomatix means \"Semiautomatix\".\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] he is simply ''Automatix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Automatix'').\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Automatiks'', or ''Tenautomatiks''.\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Automatix'', or ''Kovomatix'' where \"kovo\" means metallic.\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Tuta\u016dtomatiks''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Hoefnix'' \u2014 a double pun: ''{{lang|nl|hoef}}'' means \"hoof\" and the phrase ''{{lang|nl|ik hoef niks}}'' means \"I don't need/want anything\" referring to Unhygienix's fish.\n*In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], he is just ''Automatix.''\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Latin]], he is ''Armamix'' \u2014 in Latin, ''{{lang|la|armo}}'' means to provide arms, to equip with weapons.\n*In Icelandic versions, he is ''Ry\u00f0r\u00edkur''. Ironically, ''{{lang|is|Ry\u00f0}}'' means \"[[rust]]\" in Icelandic.\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] versions, ''Smidefix'' (as a pun on the words \"smith\" and \"fix\")\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Tamotomatiks'', meaning \"fully automatic\".\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Caravellix'', possibly as a pun on the boat model Karaveli, meaning [[Caravel]].\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Metaloplastiks''), as a pun on the words \"[[metal]]\" and \"[[plastics]]\", but also on the name of the famous [[team handball|handball]] team [[RK Metaloplastika|Metaloplastika]] from [[\u0160abac]]\n*In Hindi translation, he is \u092c\u0926\u092c\u094b\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0932\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094b\u0921\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Badbolix Lohatodix''), which means \"ill-spoken iron-breaker\"\n*In Hebrew, \u05e0\u05e9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Neshek-Otomatix'') means \"automatic weapon\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Udarnix), derived from \"\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\", which could translate as either \"hammer\" or \"striker\". \"\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\" by itself also means \"to hit\".\n\n====Mrs. Fulliautomatix====\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Fulliautomatix is one of the inner circle of village wives. One of the shortest women in the village, and possessing of a steep and pointy nose, she takes no nonsense and dominates her much larger husband as well as getting into a brawl with the wife of Chief Vitalstatistix in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''. Although she appears often, she has never been named in the stories. She has been known to beat up Cacofonix on occasion as well, in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She has a brother, as mentioned by her husband in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\n===Julius Caesar===\n:''Main article: [[Julius Caesar]]'' (historical)\nJulius Caesar (Jules C\u00e9sar) is the Roman dictator and conqueror of Gaul. Many of the stories involve his schemes to finally conquer this last Gaulish village holding out against his legions. At other times, the village has (indirectly) come to his aid, but more often it is a major embarrassment to him in the [[Roman senate]] \u2014 in at least one book, the entire senate is laughing at him after a failed plan. Despite this, Caesar is also shown to be a man of honour, since whenever Asterix and Obelix somehow end up helping Caesar, Caesar always grants them any favour they ask. He goes so far as to rebuild the entire Gaulish village when it was destroyed by [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] who was trying to kidnap Caesar's son, whom Asterix returned safely to his family (''[[Asterix and Son]]''). The appearance of Caesar is based on portraits found on ancient Roman coins.\n\n===The Pirates===\n[[File:Redbeard vs asterix.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Asterix'' parodies on the left, ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' originals at right]]\n\nIn the course of their travels, Asterix and Obelix regularly cross paths with \u2014 and beat up \u2014 a group of [[pirate]]s. The Gauls then proceed to sink their ship, causing the pirates severe financial difficulties. The pirates make their first appearance in the fourth album (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''), and feature in almost every subsequent album.\n\nThe main pirates are based on the Belgian comic series ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' (1959 and continuing). The adventures of Barbe Rouge (Redbeard) and his son Eric were published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, where Asterix's adventures were also published prior to appearing in book form.\n\nAlthough Barbe Rouge is a popular character in his own right in continental Europe, the popularity of Asterix's pirates is one of the few occasions when parody figures have overshadowed their originals.\n\nOn one occasion (in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'') after the wreck the pirates were depicted in a scene similar to [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]''. In the English version of this scene, the captain also refers to an ancient Gaulish artist called \"Jericho\", an alternative spelling of the name G\u00e9ricault.\n\nSuch is the fear that the pirates have for the Gauls that, having unknowingly taken them aboard\u2014Asterix and his companions boarded the ship in the night when it was too dark for either side to see the other properly, with the pirates only learning the truth when they sneaked into their guests' cabin to rob them\u2014they fled their own ship in the middle of the night while the subjects of their fear were sound asleep (''[[Asterix in Corsica]]''). At other times, it is Asterix and Obelix who have boarded the pirates' vessel and captured booty, thus reversing their roles of hunter and prey. This has happened mainly in the quest for food in an empty ocean (''[[Asterix in Spain]]''). On another occasion, Asterix and Obelix take all the food on the ship, leaving the pirates with a single sausage for the Captain's birthday; the pirates decide to look on the bright side and note that their ship didn't sink (''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]''). It happened again (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') with Asterix leaving a single coin for payment after Obelix threw all of their recently recovered treasure overboard while searching for food; the Captain told his depressed crew that it was better than nothing and that at least they still had the ship, but then their lookout proudly announced that he had upheld their honour and scuttled the ship himself. The other pirates were not impressed.\n\nThis \"honorable suicide-sinking\" has actually happened in earlier Asterix adventures, such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' when the captain himself sank the ship after learning that the Gauls were on a nearby Egyptian vessel, reasoning that that would be the eventual outcome and doing it themselves would spare them a punch-up. Curiously enough, at the end of the same adventure, he and his crew were having to work as rowers aboard the very [[galley]] taking the Gauls back home and he announced with unusual determination that he will hunt them down and get his revenge. On another occasion, the pirates destroyed their ship simply at the sight of Asterix and all his fellow villagers in another vessel taking them to the [[Asterix at the Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. In this event, though, the villagers did not attack since the captain of their ship announced that attacking the pirates would cost them extra. At the end of [[Asterix in Britain]], The captain, In a panic, orders his men to row as fast as they can in order to get away from Asterix and Obelix. Only for them to run aground on a beach. But the captain states that this is better than being sunk again.\n\nOn two occasions, Asterix also forced the Captain to spend all his hard-won loot on the merchandise of Ekonomikrisis the Phoenician merchant (''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''). On one occasion (''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'') the Pirates appear on land, as part of the group of slaves (later freed) in the story. However, in one story so far\u2014''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''\u2014they end up happy for a change when a cauldron full of money that Asterix has been chasing throughout the story is tipped over a cliff and lands in their laps.\n\nThe main pirates are:\n* Redbeard (''Barbe Rouge'') \u2014 captain of the pirates.\n* Pegleg (''Triple Patte'') \u2014 an old pirate with a wooden leg who makes classical quotations in Latin.\n* {{anchor|Flaturtha}}<!-- \"Flaturtha\" redirects here. Please do not change the anchor unless you also change the redirect. TIA -->Pirate Lookout (''Baba'') \u2014 the [[Africa]]n pirate in the [[crow's nest]]. He also has a cousin who is a gladiator (see ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''). In the original French and some other language versions he fails to pronounce the letters 'R' and 'L', leaving blanks in his speech. Early English translations also had him speaking something that resembled [[Jamaican Patois]] but this has been replaced by standard [[British English]] in re-editions, his manner of speaking no longer being a source of humour. He is sometimes confused with Flaturtha the Numidian, leader of the slaves in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''. However, these are actually two separate characters;  Flaturtha has a different hairstyle, face shape, and physique.\n* Erix \u2014 the captain's son. Seen in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'', he is mentioned in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' as being left as a deposit on a new ship.\n\nIn addition a number of members of the pirate crew are [[sight gag]]s, some of whom have appeared on more than one occasion such as [[Frankenstein|Frankenstein's Monster]] and a [[Mongols|Mongol warrior]].\n\nIt should also be noted that in the films where the pirates are seen, Erix replaces Pegleg on the [[jetsam]] with Redbeard.\n\n==Minor recurring characters==\n:Original (''[[France|French]]'') name is given in parentheses when different.\n\n===Historical figures===\n\n[[File:Siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] to Caesar, by [[Lionel-No\u00ebl Royer]].]]\n* [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Queen Cleopatra]] (''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'') \u2014 Queen of Egypt. Other characters often make remarks about her beautiful nose. She appears on the cover of ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where Asterix, Obelix and Getafix are asked for aid from an Egyptian architect to build a palace in three months, as Cleopatra has a bet with Caesar to show the greatness of the Egyptians and has threatened to feed the architect to the [[crocodile]]s if he fails. She is also in ''[[Asterix and Son]]''\u2014where she sends her son by Caesar to Asterix for safekeeping as Brutus has tried to kill him\u2014and ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'', where she is in Rome with Caesar. In ''Asterix and Son'', she has fairer skin and a shorter, differently shaped nose, while in ''All At Sea'' she has darker skin than her first appearance and the smaller nose of her second appearance. Her appearance in the comic is seemingly based on [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s screen depiction of the historical figure.\n* [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] \u2014 Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar's adopted son. Constantly plays with a knife, a reference to him being one of [[assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's assassins]] in real life. This is alluded to in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', where a [[Divination|soothsayer]] tells Caesar that if he keeps Brutus near he will come to no harm. The series includes numerous other references to the future assassination, such as Brutus muttering resentfully to himself, after being slighted by Caesar, \"one of these days I'll.....\" (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''), or, Caesar thinking to himself \"That Brutus... I can see I'm going to have trouble with him.\" (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'').  Caesar often uses the [[Shakespeare]]an quote: \"{{lang|la|[[Et tu, Brute?]]}}\" to him for various purposes. Brutus appears in minor roles in various books, and has a major role in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', where his plot to kill Caesar and Cleopatra's infant son to secure his place as Caesar's heir prompts him to attack the village when Cleopatra sends her son there for safety, causing Caesar to send him to Upper [[Germania]]. Brutus's physical appearance is arguably different in each of his appearances.\n* [[Pompey]] (''Pomp\u00e9e'') \u2014 Caesar's greatest enemy and a former [[consul of Rome]]. He is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' and appears in person in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'', where he is the book's antagonist, seeking valuable pieces of armour that have been given to Asterix and Obelix as birthday presents.\n* [[Metellus Scipio]] (''Scipion'') \u2014 Another of Caesar's enemies, allied to Pompey. Caesar defeated him in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], as depicted in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]''. Note that Pompey doesn't make an appearance there, as he was assassinated before these events took place (though he anachronistically surfaces in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'' later).\n* [[Caesarion]] \u2014 Caesar and Cleopatra's baby boy. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'' where he is sent to the village for safety. He drinks the magic potion twice, causing trouble for the villagers and the Romans sent to capture him, but it has worn off by the end and he is reunited with his family. He shows a liking for sleeping under trees.\n* [[Spartacus]] \u2014 Gladiator and rebellion leader, resembling [[Kirk Douglas]] in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'' although in the album he is a Greek named ''Spartakis'', and is accompanied by a group of multi-national slaves after stealing Caesar's own galley. By the end the slaves have decided to stay in [[Atlantis]], and become children like most of the other inhabitants due to the magic of the Priest there.\n* [[Vercingetorix]] \u2014 [[Arverni]]an chieftain, who is shown as a historical figure surrendering Gaul in various books by throwing his arms ''on'' the feet of Caesar, which comically hurt Caesar's feet. His shield is at the centre of ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', and his fictional daughter Adrenalin in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n* [[Cassivellaunus]] \u2014 British chieftain who resists the Roman invasion.<ref>''Asterix in Britain'', p. 3</ref> Appears in ''[[Asterix in Britain]]''.\n\n===Villagers===\n* Monosyllabix and Polysyllabix (''Petit\u00e9l\u00e9grafix'') \u2014 Villagers that appear together, first in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]'', where they appear on the cover. They also appear in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\n* Obese lady \u2014 another of [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]'s inner circle of village wives, however unlike the others her husband and name are unknown.\n* Soporifix (''Plantaquatix'') \u2014 father of Panacea who is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'', but not seen until ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]''.\n*''Other villagers'' mentioned by name (and ''presumed'' to be recurring part of crowd scenes):\n**Operatix (''Boulimix''), Acoustix (''Aventur\u00e9pix''), Harmonix (''Allegorix''), Polyfonix (''Porquepix'') and Polytechnix (''El\u00e8vedelix'') in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]''\n**Pacifix (''Linguistix''), Atlantix (''Arrierboutix''), Baltix (''Harenbaltix''), Adriatix (''Choucroutgarnix'') and Analgesix (''Analg\u00e9six'') in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]''\n**Bucolix (''D\u00e9bo\u00eetemendumenix'') and Photogenix (''Bellodalix'') in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', and briefly in ''Obelix and Co.''<ref>Obelix and Co, p. 8</ref>\n**Tenansix (''C\u00e9tyounix'') in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' \u2013 named for the old pre-1970s British monetary amount of 10\u00bd shillings (written as 10s6d or 10/6, spoken as 'Ten and Six'). [[Decimal Day|Decimalisation of UK currency]] didn't happen until early 1971, well after the first Asterix story was published.\n**[[Pick 'n' mix|Picanmix]] (''Keskonrix''), a youngster in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''. Named for the method of buying confectionery from sweet shops in Britain. Also appears in Asterix and Cleopatra<ref>Asterix and Cleopatra p. 48</ref>\n**Pectine, a young girl, seen only in ''[[Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion]]''.  \n**Scarlatina (''Galantine'') in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#For Gaul Lang Syne|For Gaul Lang Syne]]\"\n*Chanticleerix (''Chanteclairix'') \u2014 the village's [[rooster]].

In the front row are the main [[Gauls|Gaulish]] characters, plus [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cleopatra]].]]\nThis is a list of characters in the ''[[Asterix]]'' comics.\n\n==Main characters==\nAsterix, Obelix and Dogmatix are the first characters with short descriptions usually listed at the beginning of each of the ''Asterix'' books (after the map of Gaul). They each have separate articles containing more information. Unless otherwise stated, this article uses the names chosen for the English translations of the books.\n\n===Asterix===\n{{Main|Asterix (character)}}\nAsterix is the main character. He is a brave, intelligent and shrewd warrior of somewhat diminutive size, who eagerly volunteers for all perilous missions.\n* {{lang-fr|Ast\u00e9rix}} (from ''{{lang|fr|ast\u00e9risque}}'', meaning \"[[asterisk]]\", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Hellenic (Greek) word \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (''aster''), meaning a \"star\"). As the titular character, he is usually the star of the story. His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s: for example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks'', although in Turkish he was first named ''B\u00fcc\u00fcr'' meaning \"shorty\", but the name was then changed. \n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is known as ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'' (\"Rich of love\").\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Soora Pappa}}) could be interpreted as 'heroic grandfather'.\n\n===Obelix===\n{{Main|Obelix}}\nObelix is Asterix's closest friend and works as a [[menhir]] sculptor and delivery man. He is a tall, [[obese]] man (he refers to himself as \"well-padded\" or \"man with a slipped chest\" and will immediately knock out anyone who calls him \"fat\") with two notable attributes: his permanently phenomenal strength and his voracious appetite for food, especially [[wild boar]]. His strength results from having fallen into Getafix's magic potion cauldron as a baby. As a consequence, Getafix will not let him take additional potion for fear of side effects (for example, turning into stone, as shown in ''Asterix and Obelix all at Sea''), something that Obelix finds immensely unfair. The only exception was in ''Asterix and Cleopatra'' when they were trapped in a [[pyramid]] and Getafix allows him to have three drops of the magic potion. Obelix's size is often the brunt of many jokes. In ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', a druid mistakes Obelix for a patient with an [[eating disorder]]. At the end of the book, Obelix decides to go on a diet, but quickly goes back to eating huge quantities of boar.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ob\u00e9lix'': meaning either ''ob\u00e9lisque'' \"[[obelisk]]\", a massive monument, or the [[dagger (typography)|typographical symbol]] (<big>\u2020</big>) (also called an ''obelus'' in English) which is sometimes used to indicate a second footnote if the first footnote is indicated by an asterisk. His name is also almost never changed in official translations (not counting orthographical variations such as ''Obeliks'' in e.g. [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]). Obelix can also mean \"man of the boars\" since the Hellenic (Greek) word \u039f\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (Obelias/Ovelias) means pig or boar.\n* In Icelandic, his name is ''Steinr\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"rich in stone\", due to Obelix's fascination with stones.\n* Early [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] editions called him ''Hopdediks'', after ''{{lang|tr|Hop dedik!}}'', which is a phrase uttered when someone overdoes something. In more recent albums he is ''Oburiks'', after ''{{lang|tr|obur}}'', which means \"gluttonous\".\n\n===Dogmatix===\n\n{{Main|Dogmatix}}\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' (book 5 in France), page 8.\nDogmatix is Obelix's pet dog. Unlike his immense master, Dogmatix is very tiny, but he can have a nasty temper. Dogmatix loves nature and hates to see trees suffer. (Obelix once mentions that this is because Dogmatix likes to urinate on them.) Dogmatix met Asterix and Obelix in Lutetia (in ''Asterix and the Banquet'') and followed them all the way around Gaul until Obelix finally noticed him when they reached the village and Dogmatix barked behind him. Since then, Obelix has become very affectionate toward Dogmatix. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', Obelix gets angry with hungry people who try to take Dogmatix's bone and insists they will be punished if they try to take advantage of his dog. Dogmatix is relatively intelligent, and is particularly good as a hunting dog.  His most noteworthy moments were rescuing Asterix, Obelix and Getafix from entrapment in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra|Cleopatra]]'', finding the captured Asterix in ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing|Great Crossing]]'', and locating the much needed desert petroleum in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold|Black Gold]]''.\n\n* {{lang-fr|Id\u00e9fix}} (''{{lang|fr|id\u00e9e fixe}}'', a \"fixed idea\" or \"obsession\", also a \"prejudice\"). Most translations use some variant of this original name (e.g. ''Ideafix'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Idefiks'' in [[Esperanto]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], and ''\u0130defiks'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Idefix''\n*In [[English language|English]], ''Dogmatix'' comes from ''[[dogma]]tic''&nbsp;\u2014 clinging to an unchanging set of beliefs. The pun is extended because the name also contains the word \"dog\".\n*[[Hindi language|Hindi]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the \u092e\u0927\u0941 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0928 (''[[Madhu Muskan]]'') translations, Dogmatix has been called ''Kutta Bhaunkix'' (\"the dog who barks\")\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is known as ''Gnoyartumix'' (\u0997\u09cb\u0981\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8)&nbsp;\u2014 compare the Bengali term ''{{lang|bn-Latn|gNyoyartumi}}'', which means \"being dogmatic\".\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''Snupix'' and Fidofiks.\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Mavrix'') means \"bright\".\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], it is ''Mirnixdirnix'' (quickly, immediately; a winged German loan word/expression), ''T\u00f6pszlix'' which refers to his small size, or ''Idefix'', ca. \"here for sure\" referring to fetching.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], it is \u0418\u0434\u0435\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Idefiks''&nbsp;\u2014 directly taken from the French ''Id\u00e9fix'') or \u0413\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Garoviks'', from ''{{lang|sr|garov}}'', a common name for a dog of indeterminable breed)\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] early translations, he was called ''Katrulix'' (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03be) meaning \"he who pees himself\". However, this was considered too demeaning by the readers, and thus was changed to ''Idefix'' (\u0399\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03af\u03be)\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Ideiafix'', a Portuguese variation (''Ideia Fixa'') of the original French name\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} {{transl|si|Chuti Kuku}} which is a name for a dog\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]]&nbsp;\u2014 ''Idefix'' but in the movie ''Asterix and Cleopatra'' he is called ''Ercolino'' (\"Little Hercules\")\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]&nbsp;\u2014 ''Kr\u00edlr\u00edkur''\n\n==Major recurring characters==\nAt the beginning of most of the Asterix books, immediately after the map of Gaul, and before the narrative starts, there is a standard description of the main characters above, as well as Getafix, Cacofonix and Vitalstatistix (regardless of their importance in that particular book).\n\n:The first appearance of all the major characters is in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' unless otherwise noted. Notes are given for languages which have translations of 90% or more of the albums&nbsp;\u2014 primarily European languages along with [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] also falls in this category, but it leaves the French names unchanged. Languages which do not use the \"x\" (such as those of [[Eastern Europe]] like [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Baltic languages]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Esperanto]]) substitute \"ks\" in translations; \"c\" is also not used in some (such as Polish, Greek and Basque) which substitute \"k\" or \"z\" for hard and soft \"c\" respectively in names that are otherwise unaltered.\n\n===Getafix===\n[[File:Getafix the druid.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Asterix and Getafix]]\nGetafix is the village [[druid]]. In appearance, he is tall with a long white [[beard]], white robe, red cloak. He is usually seen in possession of a small golden [[sickle]]. While his age is never stated, in the story of Asterix's birth (in which all but the oldest villagers are seen as small children), he appears unchanged. In ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', the druid Psychoanalytix (who appears quite old) refers to him as his elder and teacher. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'', as a gag, Getafix at 50 years older appears to be frail and old, while in the other books, he appeared healthy.\n\nAlthough known for his strength-enhancing magic potion, he has many other magical and medicinal potions at his disposal, including a potion to make hair grow quickly, a potion to counteract poison, one that neutralizes a drug that would kill in a matter of days, and a potion that restores a person to full health after injury (although this potion also causes the person who takes it to lose their recent memories while also interacting badly with the magic potion). Aside from making the potion, he also acts as the village doctor and occasional teacher. Asterix (and most other villagers) will consult him whenever anything strange occurs. He does not engage normally himself in combat, whereas most of the villagers enjoy a good punch-up (even with each other). One exception is one of the stories explaining Gaulish women, using Mrs. Geriatrix as an example, in which he involves himself in a fight sparked by Impedimenta. The final cut is shown with all the male villagers and two females, Impedimenta and Bacteria included, with Getafix running to stop the fight, with a piece of fish flying towards him. His most notable brawl is when, masquerading as a cook in ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide|The Great Divide]]'', he makes and partakes of the magic potion (passing it off as soup) to free the enslaved men from the divided village, captured by the Romans&nbsp;\u2014 and doing a test run on the slaves who were present&nbsp;\u2014 and then starts distributing slaps with obvious enjoyment.\n\nAs the only individual able to produce the \"magic potion\" upon which the villagers rely for their strength, he is the focus of many stories, ranging from the Romans attempting to put him out of commission in some manner to requesting that Asterix and Obelix help him find some missing ingredient, and the conscience of the village. On a few occasions, he has refused to make the potion when the villagers become too selfish, including in ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he refused to provide the potion for anyone while the village was divided by an upcoming vote for a new chief, only to provide them with it once again when Vitalstatistix asked Getafix to provide the potion for Orthopedix, the man he had been running against for chief. He has also occasionally been taken prisoner by hostile forces to get access to the potion, only to be freed again thanks to Asterix and Obelix. The full recipe of the magic potion itself has never been revealed, but known ingredients are mistletoe (which must be cut with a golden sickle [''[[Asterix and the Golden Sickle]]'']), a whole lobster (an optional ingredient that improves the flavour), fresh fish, salt, and petroleum (called rock oil in the book), which is later replaced by beetroot juice. Replenishing the stores of ingredients for the magic potion has led to some adventures for Asterix and Obelix, including ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\nGetafix is very similar to many [[wise old man|wise old men]] who act as mentors and father-figures to the heroes, such as [[Merlin]] or [[Gandalf]]. In the earlier books however, Getafix came across more as just a friend of the protagonists rather than a wise old counselor. He was also, from the very beginning, shown as a figure of fun and had a wonderful sense of humour: in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', he keeps cutting his finger while using his [[sickle]] and roars with uncontrollable laughter at Asterix's teasing of the Roman Centurion; in ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', he was shown as going literally crazy; and he's not above making the occasional bad pun (such as in ''Asterix and the Great Divide'', when one of the village's frequent \"stale fish\" fights prompts him to observe that the villagers may soon discover nuclear \"fish-ion\").\n\n*[[French language|French]]: ''Panoramix'' (From Hellenic/Greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1/Panorama which means wide view, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03be/Panoramix or \"he who sees everything\")&nbsp;\u2014 in most European translations this name is used, including [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Asturian and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"getting a fix\"&nbsp;\u2014 obtaining a dose of a recreational drug, and a reference to the magic potion he produces; the phrase can also mean to perceive or to get a solid sense of something. In the short-lived American version of the series, he was called ''Magigimmix'' (\"magic gimmicks\"). He was called ''[[RMC Group|Readymix]]'' (the name of a British cement firm) in newspaper comics during the 1970s, as ''Getafix'' was considered inappropriate for children. In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he is referred to by his original French name of ''Panoramix'' and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Vitamix''.\n*In [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is known as ''Miraculix'', from Latin ''miraculum'' (''miracle'').\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is known as \u0410\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aspiriniks''), from the drug [[Aspirin]]. Also in certain translations is known as \u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Panoramiks'').\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''\u010cudomiks'', from ''{{lang|hr|\u010dudo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|hr|miks}}'' (\"mix\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Akvavitix'', from \"[[akvavit]]\", a [[Scandinavia]]n [[distilled beverage]] (derived from ''[[Aqua vitae]]'').\n*In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], his name is ''Crudemix'', \"Cruden\" being [[herbs]] and [[spices]], his name thus means \"Spice mix\".\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Miraklomiks'', from ''{{lang|eo|miraklo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|eo|mikso}}'' (\"mix\")\n*In [[Hindi Language|Hindi]], he is \u0939\u0915\u0940\u092e \u0935\u0948\u0927\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Hakeem Vaidhix''), Hindi for a \"village doctor\".\n*In [[Hungarian Language|Hungarian]], he is ''Magicoturmix'', which is a composition of \"magic\" and \"shake\", thus meaning \"Shake of Magic\". Actually, this is a reference to the potion he is brewing, which gives the villagers their wondrous superhuman strength.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is ''Etashetamix'' (\u098f\u099f\u09be\u09b8\u09c7\u099f\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), meaning \"mix this and that\".\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is ''Sj\u00f3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"one who boils\". In comparison, Asterix is ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'', \"one who loves\".\n*In [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], \u05d0\u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Ashafix''), meaning \"master of the craft\".\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Crycymalix'', a pun on the phrase ''{{lang|cy|cryd cymalau}}'', which means \"arthritis\" or \"rheumatism\", referring to his old age.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Vedha Pappa}}) which means a \"[[druid]]\" or \"[[witch]]\".\n*In Malaysia, the English version that was released in the newspapers, he was \"Medix\" due to the strict laws in the country against drug abuse.\n*In [[Russian Language|Russian]], he is ''\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (''Pochinix''), meaning \"he who repairs things\". The name was translated from the English version, not the French, but the pun about \"getting a fix\" was lost in translation. However, the druid is named \"\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (\"Panoramix\") in all live-action films and Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods.\n*In [[Scots language|Scots]], he is named ''Kensawthetrix'', meaning \"knows all the tricks\".\n\n===Vitalstatistix===\n\nChief Vitalstatistix is the chief of the [[Gaul]]ish village. He is a middle-aged, bigbellied man with red hair, [[pigtail]]s and a huge [[moustache]]. He is generally reasonable, well-informed, fearless, (comparatively) even-tempered and unambitious&nbsp;\u2014 the last much to the chagrin of his wife [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]. His major failings are his love of good food and drink (it is unlikely to be a coincidence that his wife is the best cook in the village)&nbsp;\u2014 which has led to health problems&nbsp;\u2014 and his pride. As a Gaulish chief, he prefers to travel on a [[shield]], carried by two shield bearers (they say pride comes before a fall... and he finds creative new ways to fall off the shield in almost every book). The names of the shield bearers are never mentioned.\n\nVitalstatistix fought at the [[battle of Alesia]] where Caesar (almost) completed his conquest of Gaul, before becoming chief of the village. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', it was revealed that the shield he is carried on originally belonged to the legendary Gaulish warrior chief [[Vercingetorix]].<ref>Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield, p. 5</ref> His father was the village chief before him. He has a brother, Doublehelix, in Lutetia who has a young daughter and a son, [[#Gauls|Justforkix]].\n\nThe introduction to each story states that Vitalstatistix has only one fear \"that the sky may fall on his head tomorrow\"; however, he rarely alludes to this in an actual story, and then only as a rallying cry: ''\"We have nothing to fear but ...\"''.  This characteristic is based on a real historical account where Gallic chieftains were asked by Alexander the Great what they were most afraid of in all the world, and replied that their worst fear was that the sky might fall on their heads.<ref>Arrian, Campaigns of Alexander, p. 49</ref>\n\nAlthough the chief of the village, his role in most plots is usually minor, commonly featuring him granting Asterix and Obelix permission to go on their latest missions, although he has shown a greater involvement in stories such as ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' when he had to battle a rival chieftain, ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'' when he traveled to a health spa on Getafix's orders to cure a liver complaint and to lose weight, ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'', where he traveled to Belgium to defend his honor when Caesar apparently proclaimed that the Belgians were the bravest of all the Gaulish peoples, or ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he ran against a new arrival in the village for the position of chief.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Abraracourcix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 bras raccourcis}}''&nbsp;literally \u2014 \"with shortened arms\" from the French phrase ''{{lang|fr|tomber sur quelqu'un \u00e0 bras raccourcis}}'' \u2013 \"to attack someone with violence\")&nbsp;\u2014 this is the same in Italian, Portuguese, Spanish (also called Abrazopartidix in some editions) and (original) Dutch (although the \"o\" is usually dropped).\n*In [[English language|English]], his name is a pun on [[Vital statistics (government records)|Vital statistics]]&nbsp;\u2014 the government birth and death records of a region and also an expression for a person's measurements (a comment on [[BWH|his size]]). In the American translation, he was ''Macroeconomix'' from [[macroeconomics]]. NOTE: In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he also appears to have been called ''Tonabrix'', and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Bombastix''.\n*In Catalan, he is ''Copdegarr\u00f2tix''  (''{{lang|ca|cop de garrot}}''&nbsp;\u2014 \"club hit\").\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], He is Vrhovnix, from {{lang|hr|vrh}} means \"supreme\" (vrhovni,najvi\u0161i) and -ix.\n*In [[German language|German]], Greek, [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], he is ''Majestix'' from \"majestic\"; similarly in new Dutch translations he is ''Heroix'' from \"heroic\".\n* In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Mo\u015dtiks'' (''{{lang|eo|via mo\u015dto}}''&nbsp;\u2014 ''your highness'').\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Aladobix'', referring to ''{{lang|fi|aladobi}}'', a Finnish jelly-like dish containing meat (from the French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 la daube}}'').\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Hasarengazfix'', which means \"His belly surely shakes\".\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Asparanoiks'', referring to [[paranoia]], the fear of the sky falling on his head.\n*In Turkish, ''Toptoriks'', alluding to his roundness (''top'' meaning ball in Turkish).\n*In Brazilian Portuguese, his name is usually shortened to ''Abracurcix''.\n*In Hindi translation, his name is mentioned as \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092e\u094b\u091f\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Mukhiya Motumallix''), which literally means 'The Fat Chief'.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the chief has a name phonetically similar to some extent to his English one: ''Bishalakritix'' (\u09ac\u09bf\u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), taken from the root ''bishalakriti'', which aptly means \"of huge proportions\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], his name is \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''lokhem-amix''), meaning \"brave warrior\".\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Drmatoriks''), from ''{{lang|sr|drmator}}'', a slang term for Communist era movers and shakers (''{{lang|sr|drmati}}'' means \"to shake\"). Also in certain translations is known as \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tandarabriks'')\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Einharweinix'', from ''ein harweinydd'' (our leader).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] film variations he was called \u03a7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Khontrobalix''), from \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 (''khontrobal\u00e1s'', dubbing a man \"fat ball\"), but is currently referred to as \u039c\u03b1\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Mazestix'', from French ''{{lang|fr|majestueux}}'': \"majestic\"). He was also formerly called \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03be (''Monarchix'') from the word \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''mon\u00e1rch\u0113s'': \"monarch\") but the name changed in the later book translations after 1991.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Loku Pappa}}) which means big or head/leader.\n*In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], he is ''Ataaufbix''. ''{{lang|sv|Ata}}'' means \"dad\" or \"father\" and ''{{lang|sv|aufbiks}}'' is a folk invitation to a fight.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], he is ''Bra\u021bscurtarix''.<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''{{lang|ro|bra\u021b}}'' meaning \"arm\" and ''{{lang|ro|scurt}}'' meaning \"short\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Zhiznestatistiks). \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\" means \"life\", and \"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\" means \"statistics\". In the \"Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods\" the chief is named \"\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (Avtoritarix). In the \"Asterix & Obelix Take on Caesar\" he is named \"\u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (broken version of the French name).\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Naidobrix), derived from \"\u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u044a\u0440\", simply meaning \"the best one\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Majestatix'', derived from word ''Majest\u00e1tn\u00ed'' meaning majestic.\n*In Icelandic he is A\u00f0alr\u00edkur.\n\n====Chief's shieldbearers====\n\nFrom ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'' onwards, Vitalstatistix has had the same (unnamed) bearers carry (and drop) him; prior to that, he had different bearers in each album. In ''[[Asterix in Switzerland]]'', he fires both his shield bearers after he tells them that it is a lovely day, and they look up, tipping the shield back and dropping the chief in the process. He then goes and hires new shield bearers including Asterix, Geriatrix, Fulliautomatix and Obelix (in these cases the shield is horribly tilted so he is forced to stand on a slant, and Obelix carried him with one hand like a waiter). The introduction page varies between showing the bearers straining under Vitalstatistix' not inconsiderable bulk as he looks into the distance in some of the books, while in others he looks at them in good humour as they look up to him in respect.\n\n====Impedimenta====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' (but not named until ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'').\nImpedimenta is the matriarchal wife of [[#Vitalstatistix|chief Vitalstatistix]], leader of the village wives and the best cook in the village. She is often disappointed with the other villagers (calling them barbarians) and wishes Vitalstatistix was more ambitious. Consequently, she zealously defends and flaunts every privilege due to her as first lady of the village, such as skipping the queue at the fishmongers. She frequently says she wants to go back to [[Lutetia]] and live with her successful merchant brother, [[#Gauls|Homeopathix]] \u2014 the one member of the family her husband openly dislikes.\n\nShe nicknamed Vitalstatistix \"Piggywiggy\" when they were courting, and starts doing this again in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'' as a plan to make Asterix and Obelix erupt in hysterical laughter when she calls him by that name in front of them, thus irritating him and making him punish them by forcing them to stay in the village, away from the soothsayer.<ref>''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', p. 15</ref>\n\nOn occasion she has an antagonistic rivalry with Mrs. Geriatrix that has erupted into violence.  One such occasion was in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' where the two beat each other with fish from Unhygenix's store over the fakir Watziznehm's carpet.\n\nWhile usually presented in the books as a nag to her embarrassed husband, she has on occasion fought the Romans side by side with the men, typically using her rolling pin as a weapon.  In emergencies, she's famous for remaining in control, as in [[Asterix and Son]] where during a Roman attack she fearlessly led the women and children out of the burning village.\n\nHer name appears to derive either from the Latin military term \"impedimenta,\" meaning \"baggage,\" or from the English word \"impediment,\" meaning obstruction or hindrance.\n\n*In [[French language|French]]: ''Bonnemine'' (''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}'', meaning \"good countenance\", derived from the French expression \"faire bonne mine\" for \"putting on a brave face\") \u2014 also used in Swedish or Esperanto; chief Abraracourcix calls her ''Mimine''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Bonemina'' \u2014 and sometimes \"Mimina\" \n*In [[English language|English]], the name is derived from ''[[wiktionary:impediment|impediment]]'', an obstacle, but possibly also a reference to the Latin ''impedimenta'', meaning ''baggage''; (in the American translations: ''Belladonna'' \u2014 a poisonous plant used in cosmetics whose name means ''beautiful lady'').\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], she is ''Beniamina'', more often \"Mimina\".\n*In Spanish, she is ''Karabella '' (meaning \"beautiful face\").\n*In Portuguese, she is called Bonemine in some stories and Caralinda in others (Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|cara linda}}'', \"beautiful face\").\n*In the Brazilian translation she is ''[[naphthalene|Naftalina]]''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Bellefleur'' (a name for a type of red apple; \"beautiful flower\" in French).\n*In [[German language|German]], she is ''Gutemine''; Danish and Norwegian, ''Godemine'', presumably from the old saying ''{{lang|de|Gute Miene zum b\u00f6sen Spiel machen}}'' (German), ''{{lang|da|At holde gode miner til slet spil}}'' (Danish): \"To keep up appearances in the face of bad deeds\", literally: \"To show a happy face along a bad game\"), and mirroring the French ''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}''.\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], she is ''Hengerlice''; which means \"tumbler pigeon\", a pun on her being a little fat.\n*In Turkish, she is ''Dedi\u011fimdediks''. ''{{lang|tr|Dedi\u011fim dedik}}'' refers to someone who insists on getting their way.\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], she is ''A\u00f0albj\u00f6rg'' (an ancient Icelandic name which means \"noble female protector\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], she is ''Smirgeline'' (a pun on the Finnish word ''{{lang|fi|smirgeli}}'' meaning both \"emery\" and \"bench grinder\", by way of the Finnish [[dysphemism]] for a \"shrew\" being a grinder)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], she is ''Dobromina'' (most likely a pun on the Polish saying ''{{lang|pl|robi\u0107 dobr\u0105 min\u0119 do z\u0142ej gry}}'', which has the same meaning as the German/Danish/Norwegian translation above, and the [[old Polish]] female given name ''Dobromira'' (\"the one who values goodness and peace\") or ''Dobromi\u0142a'' (\"the one who is good and nice\").\n*In Catalan, she is sometimes called ''Bonemina'', but more usually ''Karabella''.\n*In Hindi, she is referred to as \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0930\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e (''Pyari Sirdarda''), the beloved, who causes Headache.\n*In Hebrew, she is called \u05d6\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (''Zivpanim''), meaning \"bright face\".\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: {{lang|si|\u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4 \u0dc4\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dda}} ({{transl|si|loku hamine}})\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], she is ''Bombona'', literally meaning \"candy\", but also something lovely and well-arranged.\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], she is ''\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e\u043c\u043e\u044f'' (Dushomoya). \"\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e \u043c\u043e\u044f\" is a common pet name in Bulgaria used by husbands when addressing their wives (usually with older couples). Literally translates as \"my soul\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], she is ''Bledul\u00edna'' meaning \"pale skinned\".\n*In the new [[Scots language|Scots]] translations, she is ''Boniquine'' meaning \"beautiful woman\".\n\n===Cacofonix===\n\nCacofonix is the village bard. He is usually only a supporting character, but has a major part in the plots of some albums (see ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'', ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'', and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''). He loves singing and playing his [[lyre]], and jumps at every opportunity to do so. He also plays the [[bagpipes]], [[drum]] and a Celtic [[trumpet]] resembling a boar called a [[Carnyx]]. While he can accompany traditional dances, and conducts a village band, his singing is unbearable. In ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'' it is so unbearable that it teaches the fearless Normans the meaning of fear. In later albums his music is so spectacularly horrible that it actually starts thunderstorms (even indoors), because of an old French saying that bad singing causes rain.\n\nFor his part, Cacofonix considers himself a genius and a superb singer, and he is angrily offended when people criticize his singing, to the point of dismissing them as barbarians. He is slightly effeminate, often seen smoothing back his hair and holding his head up high.\n\nSome villagers go to extreme lengths to avoid hearing Cacofonix's music. Most notably, Fulliautomatix, the village smith, bangs him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song, and has destroyed his lyre on a number of occasions, at one point being called the \"ancestor of music critics\". As a [[running gag]], Cacofonix is generally tied up and gagged during the banquet at the end of most albums to allow the other villagers to have a good time without having to keep him from singing. He is nonetheless well liked when not singing.\n\nIn contrast to the villagers, some of the younger generations whom Cacofonix has met do appreciate his \"talent\": Justforkix (in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'') actually encouraged Cacofonix to think seriously about moving to [[Lutetia]] where he claimed the bard's way with music would be enjoyed; Pepe (in ''[[Asterix in Spain]]'') liked it because it reminded him of home (the goats bleating in his village); and Princess Orinjade (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') expressed similar enthusiasm, though it was perhaps in gratitude for his music having saved her from being sacrificed. Similarly, the village youths express a liking for his unconventional music in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n\nUnlike the other villagers, whose [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s are on the ground, Cacofonix's hut is perched up in a tree. Ostensibly this is so that he can act as a lookout to warn the other villagers of imminent invasion, but the real reason is to let him practise his music as far from everyone as possible. It has been felled several times, often by Obelix, but has been replanted, or restored by Getafix's magic acorns (in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'').\n\nIn the English and American adaptations of the series, he speaks in an effeminate voice.\n\nIn the animated ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', Cacofonix is seen playing a rock song trying to restore Getafix's memory, one occasion where Fulliautomatix and Unhygienix are not annoyed or angry with him.\n\nHe and Getafix are the village's teachers, as only bards and druids are allowed to teach in school. He is rarely seen fighting the Romans (not even joining fish-fights that often) except when his personal honour is impugned and appear to be more [[Pacifism|\npacifistic]] than the rest of the villagers. His voice apparently does not mix well with the magic potion, although in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' it actually restores him to full voice.  The fact that he is incredibly arrogant may also be partly to blame, as in at least one volume (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'') he is shown to have not even noticed the other villagers are fighting the Romans and is actually shown asking Getafix what's going on (however, he had been suffering from a lost voice earlier in this volume and may have simply been staying in his hut while waiting to recover). In ''[[Asterix and the Missing Scroll]]'' it is revealed that he is the second stage of the village's 'emergency measure' if they are attacked while Getafix is absent; the first stage involves a secret supply of potion in the chief's hut, while the second stage involves Cacofonix blowing on a very loud horn to set up a signal to alert Getafix to danger, Vitalstatistix noting that this is the main reason the village still puts up with Cacofonix.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Assurancetourix'' (''{{lang|fr|Assurance tous risques}}'' meaning \"comprehensive insurance\") \u2013 also in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Asuranceturix''), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''Asseguran\u00e7at\u00f3rix''), [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and original [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations.\n*In [[English language|English]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''Cacofonix'' is derived from [[cacophony|cacophonic]] (describing \"harsh and unpleasant sounds\"), from Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (''kakos'', meaning \"bad\") and \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae (''phon\u0113'', meaning \"voice\"). In the American version of the series, he was called ''Malacoustix'', which refers to \"bad acoustics\". In the English dub of the film ''Asterix the Gaul'' he is called ''Stopthemusix'' (a pun on the phrase \"stop the music\") and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Franksinatrix'' (a pun on [[Frank Sinatra]]).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039a\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03be (''Kakofonix'') and similarly ''Kakofonix, Kakofoniks'' in Polish, Turkish and in new Dutch translations.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], his name is \u0422\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tamburiks''). The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Serbia]]. ''Tamburati'' (\"to play tambura\") is Serbian slang meaning \"to beat someone up\". At the end of many albums, ''Tamburiks'' often gets beaten up, gagged and tied to a tree.\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], his name is Tamburix. The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Croatia]].\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Troubadix''; in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Trubadurix'', and in [[Czech Language|Czech]] ''Trubadix''. These are puns on \"[[troubadour]]\", a word for \"bard\".\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Chatotorix'' (meaning \"annoying\" or \"the very dull one\").\n*In [[Hindi language|Hindi]], he is \u0917\u0935\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0901 \u092c\u0947\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Gavaiya\u00f1 Besurix'') meaning \"one who sings out of tune\".\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], this bard is known as ''Kawlorobix'' (\u0995\u09b2\u09b0\u09ac\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8) \u2013 the root being ''{{lang|bn-Latn|kawlorob}}'' \u2013 meaning \"making a lot of noise for no purpose\"\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] translation he is ''Hangjanix'', which means \"He absolutely has no voice\".\n*Similarly, the [[Esperanto]] name ''Malmuziks'' means \"the contrary of music\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Khamshirix'') which can be literally translated back as ''Limerix'' (from \"[[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]\").\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] he is ''\u00d3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', originally meaning \"rich in odes\" but can also be interpreted as \"rich in madness\". A music-making competition in one of Iceland's most prestigious pre-colleges is named in his honour.\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Odlgymix'', from ''{{lang|cy|odl gymysg}}'' (\"mixed rhyme\", a metre of Welsh verse).\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] he is {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Caco Pappa}}), similar to ''Cacofonix''.\n*In [[Latin Language|Latin]], he is ''Cantorix'', from ''{{lang|la|cantor}}'' \"singer\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Vsebezrix). Most likely derived from \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\", meaning \"always without risk\", which is somewhat close to his original French name, but it can also be interpreted as \"\u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0430\", meaning \"looks into himself\", which might be a reference to him being an artist.\n*In [[Irish language|Irish]], his name is ''D\u00e1nd\u00edrix'' \u2013 [[D\u00e1n D\u00edreach]] is a style of Irish poetry designed to be accompanied by a harp.\n*In Scots, he is ''Magonaglix'' - after the notoriously incompetent Scottish poet William McGonagall.\n\n===Geriatrix===\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''<ref>Asterix the Gladiator</ref> but first named in ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]''\nGeriatrix is the oldest inhabitant of Asterix's village: he is mentioned as 93 years old in  ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]'' (while drunk, he says he feels ten years younger, to which Asterix replies, \"Well, that makes you 83, and it's time you were in bed\"). Some translations make him no more than 80.\n\nAs an elder, Geriatrix demands respect (generally more than he is given). Nonetheless he dislikes being treated as old and will attack anyone who comments to that effect. In particular he often beats up the village blacksmith Fulliautomatix for refusing to fight back due to his age, and actually cries out to be attacked. Geriatrix is seen to sit on the village council at times, on the face of it an entitlement deriving from being the oldest in the community. An example is on p.&nbsp;11 of ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]'' where he sits with Vitalstatistix, Cacofonix and Getafix, in deciding on Asterix's punishment for having violated their honor code. In ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' he acquires a club which he later uses to knock down ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''.\n\nGeriatrix is against foreigners who are not from his village. He is a veteran of the [[Battle of Gergovia]] and the [[Battle of Alesia]], and refers to them when excited (\"It'll be just like Gergovia all over!\") or distraught (\"It's just like Alesia all over again!\").\nHe has an eye for the young ladies and has a very young and beautiful wife (who appears to be in her twenties) of whom he is very possessive \u2014 particularly when Obelix is around.\n\nIn [[prequels]] such as ''[[How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy]]'', in which most of the characters are children and Vitalstatistix is a slim young man, Geriatrix, along with Getafix, is unchanged.\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Agecanonix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00c2ge canonique}}'', meaning \"very old age\") (also in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as ''Decanonix'' \u2014 from ''{{lang|pt|Decano}}'', \"dean\").\n*In [[English language|English]], the name comes from [[Geriatrics]], the branch of medicine dealing with old age. He is also known as ''Arthritix'' in the American translations.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), from \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 (''[[Methuselah]]'').\n*In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], he is ''Edadepiedrix'' and ''Edatdep\u00e8drix'' in Catalan (meaning \"Stone Age\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and  [[North Germanic languages|the Scandinavian languages]], he is ''Senilix'' (from [[senile]]).\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], he is ''Matusalemix'', from ''Matusalem'' ([[Methuselah]]), the biblical \"old man\", similarly in [[German language|German]], ''Methusalix'' and in [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), formerly \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03be (''Palaiontologix'').\n* In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Dedoviks''), from Serbian ''{{lang|sr|deda}}'' (\"grandfather\").\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05d0\u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05e7\u05e9\u05d9\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Methushelakhix'', ''Ashmaix'' (Asterix at the Olympic Games), ''Kashishnix'' (Animated films)).\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Nestorix'' (after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Metuzalemix, from [[Methuselah]] and -ix.\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Dojeniks'' (from ''{{lang|eo|dojeno}}'' \u2014 doyen, wise old man)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Ramoliks'' (\"grumpy old man\") or ''D\u0142ugowieczniks'' (\"long living\").\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Sokadikix'' (\"umpteenth decade\") or ''Tatix'' (from ''{{lang|hu|tata}}'', an informal way to address old men) or ''Rozogav\u00e9nix'' (\"rickety old\") or  ''Matuzs\u00e1lemix'' (Methuselah)\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Veteranix''.\n*In the [[Hindi]] translation he is \u092c\u0941\u0921\u094d\u0922\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Buddhix''), which means \"the old man\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] he is ''Eskitopraks'' meaning \"old timer\".\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] he is ''Capeloyonix'' which loosely translates to \"old hunched man who is easily tired\". (Cape \u2013 pronounced as Chapeh: meaning tired; Loyo; meaning weak)\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Starix), from the word \"\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\", meaning \"old timer\" or \"old geezer\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Archaix'' based on word \"archaic\". In some cases he is called ''Kmetix'' based on word \"kme\u0165\" meaning very old man.\n\n====Mrs. Geriatrix====\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Geriatrix enjoys her husband's devotion and also her status as wife of the village's most senior inhabitant, which makes her one of the inner circle of village wives. Her youthful appearance suggests that she is less than half her husband's age; she is also a lot taller. Although as ambitious and gossip-prone as the other wives, she has also shown herself to be very quick-witted. She is an excellent seamstress but has Geriatrix do most of the housework. She rules her home and marriage, and regularly tells her husband what to do even in direct contradiction of his own stated opinions. She does seem to be happily married, however, and the only serious conflict in her marriage is her occasional apparent interest in [[Obelix]] which makes her husband insanely jealous. On one occasion, she is offered the magic potion. She does not appear to be interested and says that it's very fattening, while staring at Obelix. She appears to be in favour of women's rights, as shown in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She eagerly accepted the radical changes in the village that occurred in this story. She and Impedimenta cause a gigantic fight in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#Mini Midi Maxi|Mini Midi Maxi]]\".\n\n* She has never been officially named and is always referred to by [[Mrs#Traditional usage|the local title for wife]] and the translation of her husband's name ([[Uderzo]] has stated she is partially based on his own wife and he wishes to retain an air of mystery). In ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', Impedimenta appears to address her as ''Myopia'' (which, given her choice of spouse would be extremely appropriate), but, as explained in this page\u2019s note, this is an invocation to a Gaulish Goddess (of short-sightedness) thus a [[double entendre]].\n\n===Unhygienix===\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nUnhygienix is the village [[fishmonger]], as was his father Unhealthix before him (as seen in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''). His fish do not come from the sea near the village even though he has a fishing boat; instead they are transported all the way from [[Paris|Lutetia]] (and from [[Marseilles|Massilia]] in the German translations) as he believes they are of finer quality. He does not notice their smell, but most of the other villagers do and a lot of fights are caused by his stale fish, as when the blacksmith Fulliautomatix says: \"Anyway, it [the fight] wouldn't have happened if they [the fish] were fresh!\" and then Unhygenix slaps him with his fish.\nHe regularly has fights about his fish with his friend [[#Fulliautomatix|Fulliautomatix]], the village blacksmith, which often escalate to involve most of the village. Fulliautomatix says the fish are stale, Unhygienix throws a fish at him, he throws it back, it hits someone else, etc., and the whole village gets into a fight. This rivalry is a family tradition \u2014 their fathers also fought, and their children are continuing it. Despite this, his catch phrase is a scream to his wife, \"Bacteria! Get the fish inside!\" or \"Save the sales!\", in fights on the village he doesn't want to enter (i.e. fights that are not about his fish), when villagers buy or steal his fish to fight with. \n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ordralfab\u00e9tix'' (''{{lang|fr|Ordre alphab\u00e9tique}}'', meaning \"alphabetical order\") \u2014 this is essentially the same in Spanish (Ordenalfab\u00e9tix), Portuguese, Catalan and Italian (''Ordinalfabetix''), as well as Hebrew (\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, ''Lefisederalphabetix'')\n*In [[English language|English]], he is ''Unhygienix'' (\"unclean\" from \"[[hygiene|unhygienic]]\"), and in the American dub of ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', he is called Fishstix (from [[Fish finger|fish sticks]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Abecedix from [[alphabet]] and -ix.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Kostunrix'' (\"costs a riks\", ''{{lang|nl|riks}}'' being short for ''[[rijksdaalder]]'', 2\u00bd [[Dutch guilder|guilders]])\n*In [[German language|German]], he is ''Verleihnix''  (''{{lang|de|Verleih' nichts}}'' \u2014 \"(I) do not lend anything\", especially not fish because, as Bacteria puts it, people are so careless and return the fish in poor condition).\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Crabbofix'' (close to \"crab and fish\")\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], he is ''H\u00f8rmetix'' (''{{lang|da|H\u00f8rme}}'' means \"to stink\")\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is ''Hermetix'' (''{{lang|no|Hermetikk}}'' refers to the food contained in [[hermetic seal|hermetic]] [[tin can]]s)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Szykalfabetiks'' (\"alphabetical order\") or ''Ahigieniks'' (\"unhygienic\")\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Messesaglix'' (\"stinks far\")\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aerobiks'') \u2014 a pun on the word \"[[aerobics]]\"\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], he is \"Ordenalfabetix\" (\"alphabetic order\")\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Fi\u015da\u0109iks'' [\"fishachix\"] (''{{lang|eo|fi\u015da\u0109o}}'' \u2014 ''rotten fish'')\n*In [[Hebrew]], his name is ''\u05d1\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1'' [\"beseder-alephbetix\"] meaning in lexicographical order.\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Amaryllix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u0391\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Alfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"alphabet\" \u2014 formerly \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Katalfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"in alphabetical order\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Palamutiks''.

In addition to being a direct translation of the original French name, this could also be a reference to the first published Bulgarian schoolbook, which taught children the alphabet and featured a picture of a whale at the end of it, giving it the nickname \"The Fish Schoolbook\" (despite whales being mammals, not fish).\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Alfabetix'' based on English word \"alphabet\".\n*in [[Scots language|Scots]], he is ''Minginhaddix'', the play being ''mingin' haddocks''. ''Minging'' is a colloquialism used in various regions of the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Scotland]], meaning ''disgusting.'' \n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' based on \"Anti sanitation\".\n\n====Bacteria====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nBacteria is the wife of Unhygienix. She is one of the inner circle of village wives. She is quiet and easy-going, but doesn't hesitate to say exactly what she thinks. She helps her husband run his shop, selling fish of dubious quality, and is unperturbed by the bizarre uses to which they are sometimes put. They have two sons (whose names have not been mentioned) \u2014 one with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and the other with red hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\nIn ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' the blonde son is seen having taken over the shop but rather than to import the fish from Lutetia, he gets the fish he sells from the nearby sea. This displeases his father who fears that the \"good name of the shop will go to waste\" that way.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''I\u00e9losubmarine'' (a pun on \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\") \u2014 a variant of this is used in most translations.\n*In [[English language|English]], [[bacteria]] is the name for a [[biological kingdom|kingdom]] of microorganisms, some of which are responsible for various diseases, keeping the same unsanitary character as her husband's name.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Forentientje'' (''{{lang|nl|voor een tientje}}'', \"for ten guilders\", matching the monetary theme of her husband's name).\n*In [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], she is ''Remouladine''. (After the dressing, [[remoulade]], popular in Scandinavia and often eaten along with fish.){{citation needed |date=June 2011 |reason=but her name is never used in Swedish!}}\n* In [[Polish language|Polish]] she is ''Jelousubmarina'', which is \"yellow submarine\" written according to Polish pronunciation and with a female ending. Similar in [[German language|German]]: Jellosubmarine.\n\n===Fulliautomatix===\nFulliautomatix is the village [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]. His father, Semiautomatix, was the village smith before him. He is tall and [[wikt:robust|robust]], and very [[wikt:strong|strong]] \u2014 he is one of the strongest characters, perhaps second only to Obelix, and a bit of a ruffian, especially to Cacofonix. Fulliautomatix's first appearance was in the first volume, ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', where the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] spy was amazed that he used his fists to forge [[iron]]. However, he is subsequently shown using a normal [[hammer]] and is now rarely seen without one.\nA very different looking Fulliautomatix appeared in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' in which he and Obelix argue as to who should be entitled to punch the Roman that they are both engaged in hitting anyway.\n\nFulliautomatix often interacts with [[#Unhygienix|Unhygienix]], the fishmonger, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. Fulliautomatix claims the [[fish]] he sells are stale, and this often results in Unhygienix throwing a fish at his face, causing a fight (sometimes the other villagers join in just for fun).<ref>Asterix in Belgium</ref>\nFulliautomatix also takes great pleasure in abusing, breaking the lyre of [[#Cacofonix|Cacofonix]] the bard, threatening him and hitting him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song (the songs are so bad that the other villagers do not object) \u2014 this happens so frequently that Cacofonix only protests about it if he hadn't intended to sing in the first place (such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where it turned out Cacofonix just wanted to tell Fulliautomatix that he was standing on Cacofonix's toes, which Fulliautomatix was unaware of due to the current snow covering their feet). It has been stated that he is perhaps the ancestor of all music critics. On the other hand, he is occasionally beaten up with a cane by [[#Geriatrix|Geriatrix]] when he is provoked by some comment the smith makes. When this happens he will often take out his frustration on the nearest convenient bystander (Cacofonix for preference) on the grounds that he does not feel he can fight back against someone so old, which only helps to further incense the old man.\n\nFulliautomatix also has two unnamed children who have appeared in separate comics \u2014 a son with blond hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and a daughter with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. In ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide]]'' he is shown as having an [[apprentice]], though it is not specified if he's a relative; some speculate that he is the young son grown to teenage years, while in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]'' a young man resembling him is introduced as his eldest son. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' Fulliautomatix is seen as an elderly man with his now adult son having taken over business; the scene begins with his son making steel dentures for Fulliautomatix, who has gone toothless over the years.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''C\u00e9tautomatix'' (''{{lang|fr|c'est automatique}}'', meaning \"it is automatic\") \u2014 the languages of Iberia follow fairly literally: ''Esautom\u00e1tix'' in Spanish, ''Esautom\u00e0tix'' in Catalan and ''Zetautomatix'' in Basque; in Portuguese ''Ceutautomatix'' or ''\u00c9automatix''.\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"fully automatic\"\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Poluautomatix means \"Semiautomatix\".\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] he is simply ''Automatix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Automatix'').\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Automatiks'', or ''Tenautomatiks''.\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Automatix'', or ''Kovomatix'' where \"kovo\" means metallic.\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Tuta\u016dtomatiks''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Hoefnix'' \u2014 a double pun: ''{{lang|nl|hoef}}'' means \"hoof\" and the phrase ''{{lang|nl|ik hoef niks}}'' means \"I don't need/want anything\" referring to Unhygienix's fish.\n*In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], he is just ''Automatix.''\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Latin]], he is ''Armamix'' \u2014 in Latin, ''{{lang|la|armo}}'' means to provide arms, to equip with weapons.\n*In Icelandic versions, he is ''Ry\u00f0r\u00edkur''. Ironically, ''{{lang|is|Ry\u00f0}}'' means \"[[rust]]\" in Icelandic.\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] versions, ''Smidefix'' (as a pun on the words \"smith\" and \"fix\")\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Tamotomatiks'', meaning \"fully automatic\".\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Caravellix'', possibly as a pun on the boat model Karaveli, meaning [[Caravel]].\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Metaloplastiks''), as a pun on the words \"[[metal]]\" and \"[[plastics]]\", but also on the name of the famous [[team handball|handball]] team [[RK Metaloplastika|Metaloplastika]] from [[\u0160abac]]\n*In Hindi translation, he is \u092c\u0926\u092c\u094b\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0932\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094b\u0921\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Badbolix Lohatodix''), which means \"ill-spoken iron-breaker\"\n*In Hebrew, \u05e0\u05e9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Neshek-Otomatix'') means \"automatic weapon\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Udarnix), derived from \"\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\", which could translate as either \"hammer\" or \"striker\". \"\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\" by itself also means \"to hit\".\n\n====Mrs. Fulliautomatix====\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Fulliautomatix is one of the inner circle of village wives. One of the shortest women in the village, and possessing of a steep and pointy nose, she takes no nonsense and dominates her much larger husband as well as getting into a brawl with the wife of Chief Vitalstatistix in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''. Although she appears often, she has never been named in the stories. She has been known to beat up Cacofonix on occasion as well, in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She has a brother, as mentioned by her husband in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\n===Julius Caesar===\n:''Main article: [[Julius Caesar]]'' (historical)\nJulius Caesar (Jules C\u00e9sar) is the Roman dictator and conqueror of Gaul. Many of the stories involve his schemes to finally conquer this last Gaulish village holding out against his legions. At other times, the village has (indirectly) come to his aid, but more often it is a major embarrassment to him in the [[Roman senate]] \u2014 in at least one book, the entire senate is laughing at him after a failed plan. Despite this, Caesar is also shown to be a man of honour, since whenever Asterix and Obelix somehow end up helping Caesar, Caesar always grants them any favour they ask. He goes so far as to rebuild the entire Gaulish village when it was destroyed by [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] who was trying to kidnap Caesar's son, whom Asterix returned safely to his family (''[[Asterix and Son]]''). The appearance of Caesar is based on portraits found on ancient Roman coins.\n\n===The Pirates===\n[[File:Redbeard vs asterix.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Asterix'' parodies on the left, ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' originals at right]]\n\nIn the course of their travels, Asterix and Obelix regularly cross paths with \u2014 and beat up \u2014 a group of [[pirate]]s. The Gauls then proceed to sink their ship, causing the pirates severe financial difficulties. The pirates make their first appearance in the fourth album (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''), and feature in almost every subsequent album.\n\nThe main pirates are based on the Belgian comic series ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' (1959 and continuing). The adventures of Barbe Rouge (Redbeard) and his son Eric were published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, where Asterix's adventures were also published prior to appearing in book form.\n\nAlthough Barbe Rouge is a popular character in his own right in continental Europe, the popularity of Asterix's pirates is one of the few occasions when parody figures have overshadowed their originals.\n\nOn one occasion (in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'') after the wreck the pirates were depicted in a scene similar to [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]''. In the English version of this scene, the captain also refers to an ancient Gaulish artist called \"Jericho\", an alternative spelling of the name G\u00e9ricault.\n\nSuch is the fear that the pirates have for the Gauls that, having unknowingly taken them aboard\u2014Asterix and his companions boarded the ship in the night when it was too dark for either side to see the other properly, with the pirates only learning the truth when they sneaked into their guests' cabin to rob them\u2014they fled their own ship in the middle of the night while the subjects of their fear were sound asleep (''[[Asterix in Corsica]]''). At other times, it is Asterix and Obelix who have boarded the pirates' vessel and captured booty, thus reversing their roles of hunter and prey. This has happened mainly in the quest for food in an empty ocean (''[[Asterix in Spain]]''). On another occasion, Asterix and Obelix take all the food on the ship, leaving the pirates with a single sausage for the Captain's birthday; the pirates decide to look on the bright side and note that their ship didn't sink (''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]''). It happened again (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') with Asterix leaving a single coin for payment after Obelix threw all of their recently recovered treasure overboard while searching for food; the Captain told his depressed crew that it was better than nothing and that at least they still had the ship, but then their lookout proudly announced that he had upheld their honour and scuttled the ship himself. The other pirates were not impressed.\n\nThis \"honorable suicide-sinking\" has actually happened in earlier Asterix adventures, such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' when the captain himself sank the ship after learning that the Gauls were on a nearby Egyptian vessel, reasoning that that would be the eventual outcome and doing it themselves would spare them a punch-up. Curiously enough, at the end of the same adventure, he and his crew were having to work as rowers aboard the very [[galley]] taking the Gauls back home and he announced with unusual determination that he will hunt them down and get his revenge. On another occasion, the pirates destroyed their ship simply at the sight of Asterix and all his fellow villagers in another vessel taking them to the [[Asterix at the Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. In this event, though, the villagers did not attack since the captain of their ship announced that attacking the pirates would cost them extra. At the end of [[Asterix in Britain]], The captain, In a panic, orders his men to row as fast as they can in order to get away from Asterix and Obelix. Only for them to run aground on a beach. But the captain states that this is better than being sunk again.\n\nOn two occasions, Asterix also forced the Captain to spend all his hard-won loot on the merchandise of Ekonomikrisis the Phoenician merchant (''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''). On one occasion (''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'') the Pirates appear on land, as part of the group of slaves (later freed) in the story. However, in one story so far\u2014''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''\u2014they end up happy for a change when a cauldron full of money that Asterix has been chasing throughout the story is tipped over a cliff and lands in their laps.\n\nThe main pirates are:\n* Redbeard (''Barbe Rouge'') \u2014 captain of the pirates.\n* Pegleg (''Triple Patte'') \u2014 an old pirate with a wooden leg who makes classical quotations in Latin.\n* {{anchor|Flaturtha}}<!-- \"Flaturtha\" redirects here. Please do not change the anchor unless you also change the redirect. TIA -->Pirate Lookout (''Baba'') \u2014 the [[Africa]]n pirate in the [[crow's nest]]. He also has a cousin who is a gladiator (see ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''). In the original French and some other language versions he fails to pronounce the letters 'R' and 'L', leaving blanks in his speech. Early English translations also had him speaking something that resembled [[Jamaican Patois]] but this has been replaced by standard [[British English]] in re-editions, his manner of speaking no longer being a source of humour. He is sometimes confused with Flaturtha the Numidian, leader of the slaves in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''. However, these are actually two separate characters;  Flaturtha has a different hairstyle, face shape, and physique.\n* Erix \u2014 the captain's son. Seen in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'', he is mentioned in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' as being left as a deposit on a new ship.\n\nIn addition a number of members of the pirate crew are [[sight gag]]s, some of whom have appeared on more than one occasion such as [[Frankenstein|Frankenstein's Monster]] and a [[Mongols|Mongol warrior]].\n\nIt should also be noted that in the films where the pirates are seen, Erix replaces Pegleg on the [[jetsam]] with Redbeard.\n\n==Minor recurring characters==\n:Original (''[[France|French]]'') name is given in parentheses when different.\n\n===Historical figures===\n\n[[File:Siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] to Caesar, by [[Lionel-No\u00ebl Royer]].]]\n* [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Queen Cleopatra]] (''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'') \u2014 Queen of Egypt. Other characters often make remarks about her beautiful nose. She appears on the cover of ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where Asterix, Obelix and Getafix are asked for aid from an Egyptian architect to build a palace in three months, as Cleopatra has a bet with Caesar to show the greatness of the Egyptians and has threatened to feed the architect to the [[crocodile]]s if he fails. She is also in ''[[Asterix and Son]]''\u2014where she sends her son by Caesar to Asterix for safekeeping as Brutus has tried to kill him\u2014and ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'', where she is in Rome with Caesar. In ''Asterix and Son'', she has fairer skin and a shorter, differently shaped nose, while in ''All At Sea'' she has darker skin than her first appearance and the smaller nose of her second appearance. Her appearance in the comic is seemingly based on [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s screen depiction of the historical figure.\n* [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] \u2014 Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar's adopted son. Constantly plays with a knife, a reference to him being one of [[assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's assassins]] in real life. This is alluded to in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', where a [[Divination|soothsayer]] tells Caesar that if he keeps Brutus near he will come to no harm. The series includes numerous other references to the future assassination, such as Brutus muttering resentfully to himself, after being slighted by Caesar, \"one of these days I'll.....\" (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''), or, Caesar thinking to himself \"That Brutus... I can see I'm going to have trouble with him.\" (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'').  Caesar often uses the [[Shakespeare]]an quote: \"{{lang|la|[[Et tu, Brute?]]}}\" to him for various purposes. Brutus appears in minor roles in various books, and has a major role in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', where his plot to kill Caesar and Cleopatra's infant son to secure his place as Caesar's heir prompts him to attack the village when Cleopatra sends her son there for safety, causing Caesar to send him to Upper [[Germania]]. Brutus's physical appearance is arguably different in each of his appearances.\n* [[Pompey]] (''Pomp\u00e9e'') \u2014 Caesar's greatest enemy and a former [[consul of Rome]]. He is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' and appears in person in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'', where he is the book's antagonist, seeking valuable pieces of armour that have been given to Asterix and Obelix as birthday presents.\n* [[Metellus Scipio]] (''Scipion'') \u2014 Another of Caesar's enemies, allied to Pompey. Caesar defeated him in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], as depicted in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]''. Note that Pompey doesn't make an appearance there, as he was assassinated before these events took place (though he anachronistically surfaces in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'' later).\n* [[Caesarion]] \u2014 Caesar and Cleopatra's baby boy. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'' where he is sent to the village for safety. He drinks the magic potion twice, causing trouble for the villagers and the Romans sent to capture him, but it has worn off by the end and he is reunited with his family. He shows a liking for sleeping under trees.\n* [[Spartacus]] \u2014 Gladiator and rebellion leader, resembling [[Kirk Douglas]] in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'' although in the album he is a Greek named ''Spartakis'', and is accompanied by a group of multi-national slaves after stealing Caesar's own galley. By the end the slaves have decided to stay in [[Atlantis]], and become children like most of the other inhabitants due to the magic of the Priest there.\n* [[Vercingetorix]] \u2014 [[Arverni]]an chieftain, who is shown as a historical figure surrendering Gaul in various books by throwing his arms ''on'' the feet of Caesar, which comically hurt Caesar's feet. His shield is at the centre of ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', and his fictional daughter Adrenalin in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n* [[Cassivellaunus]] \u2014 British chieftain who resists the Roman invasion.<ref>''Asterix in Britain'', p. 3</ref> Appears in ''[[Asterix in Britain]]''.\n\n===Villagers===\n* Monosyllabix and Polysyllabix (''Petit\u00e9l\u00e9grafix'') \u2014 Villagers that appear together, first in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]'', where they appear on the cover. They also appear in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\n* Obese lady \u2014 another of [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]'s inner circle of village wives, however unlike the others her husband and name are unknown.\n* Soporifix (''Plantaquatix'') \u2014 father of Panacea who is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'', but not seen until ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]''.\n*''Other villagers'' mentioned by name (and ''presumed'' to be recurring part of crowd scenes):\n**Operatix (''Boulimix''), Acoustix (''Aventur\u00e9pix''), Harmonix (''Allegorix''), Polyfonix (''Porquepix'') and Polytechnix (''El\u00e8vedelix'') in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]''\n**Pacifix (''Linguistix''), Atlantix (''Arrierboutix''), Baltix (''Harenbaltix''), Adriatix (''Choucroutgarnix'') and Analgesix (''Analg\u00e9six'') in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]''\n**Bucolix (''D\u00e9bo\u00eetemendumenix'') and Photogenix (''Bellodalix'') in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', and briefly in ''Obelix and Co.''<ref>Obelix and Co, p. 8</ref>\n**Tenansix (''C\u00e9tyounix'') in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' \u2013 named for the old pre-1970s British monetary amount of 10\u00bd shillings (written as 10s6d or 10/6, spoken as 'Ten and Six'). [[Decimal Day|Decimalisation of UK currency]] didn't happen until early 1971, well after the first Asterix story was published.\n**[[Pick 'n' mix|Picanmix]] (''Keskonrix''), a youngster in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''. Named for the method of buying confectionery from sweet shops in Britain. Also appears in Asterix and Cleopatra<ref>Asterix and Cleopatra p. 48</ref>\n**Pectine, a young girl, seen only in ''[[Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion]]''.  \n**Scarlatina (''Galantine'') in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#For Gaul Lang Syne|For Gaul Lang Syne]]\"\n*Chanticleerix (''Chanteclairix'') \u2014 the village's [[rooster]].

They were the first post-war cruisers constructed for the Royal Navy and were designed within the limits of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons, [[Displacement (ship)|standard displacement]] and 8-inch [[caliber|calibre]] main guns may be referred to as \"treaty cruisers\" (the term \"heavy cruiser\" was not defined until the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}).\n\nThe thirteen Counties were built in the ''Kent'', ''London'' and ''Norfolk'' sub-classes. They were the only 10,000-ton 8-inch gun, or \"A\", cruisers that the Royal Navy built. The Counties are remembered for their distinctive three-funnel layout and service in all the major naval theatres of the Second World War.\n\nTo extract more ships from the treaty limits, the navy planned to construct 8,250-ton \"B\" ships, six of which could be built in place of five Counties. The extra ship that this afforded was an attractive proposition for a navy that had the immense peacetime commitments of empire.<ref name=\"lenton\">Lenton</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}<ref>Marriot (2005) c. 3, para. 23</ref> Peacetime economies and politics intervened and only two B-type cruisers were built, an 8-inch gun modified County design: the {{sclass-|York|cruiser|4}}.\n\nIn 1929, the mean cost of each \"A\" ship was estimated to be \u00a32,180,000, whilst the mean cost of each \"B\" ship was estimated to be \u00a31,800,000.<ref>{{cite hansard|speaker=[[Cuthbert Headlam]]|title=Cruiser Construction (Cost) |house=House of Commons |date= 20 February 1922 |volume=225 |column= 1104 |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1929/feb/20/cruiser-construction-cost#S5CV0225P0_19290220_HOC_80|website=millbanksystems|publisher=millbanksystems|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\nThe 10,000-ton treaty cruisers were the first type of warships built to internationally agreed restrictions.<ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} These restrictions posed new engineering challenges and forced compromises upon designers in how to extract the best balance of speed, armament and protection.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States Navy]] adopted a design with [[gun turret|triple-gun turrets]], allowing the hull to be shortened thus saving weight that could be put into protection. This approach required increased power, as the speed of a ship is a function of the ratio of length to beam. The Royal Navy had a requirement for a vessel for colonial [[trade route]] defence, which required a good cruising range and speed and independent fighting power. This determined the need for a long hull and the use of four twin-gun turrets, with any remaining displacement invested in protection.\n\nThe design was conservative in nature, especially when compared to the contemporary [[Nelson-class battleship|''Nelson''-class]] battleships built to satisfy the same treaty. The long (630 feet [[Length overall|overall]]) hull was [[flush deck]]ed and with a high freeboard and was strongly built. This afforded high [[directional stability|initial stability]], which contributed to the protection scheme.<ref name=\"lenton\"/><ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Pages needed|date=January 2020}} The machinery spaces followed the traditional layout of [[Boiler room (ship)|boiler rooms]] ahead of [[engine room]]s, separated by an amidships [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]. The two boiler rooms exhausted into four uptakes, the central pair being combined to form a thickened central funnel. The three-funnel design was handsome but a somewhat impractical use of internal space.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs had been tested in the WW1 Emerald class [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Enterprise|D52|6}}, whose completion had been delayed post-war, the Counties featured a new design of forward superstructure incorporating the navigating bridge, wheelhouse, signalling and compass platforms and [[fire-control system|gunnery director]] in a block. This advance considerably rationalised the separate armoured conning tower and myriad of decks and platforms of older designs. Moving the fire-control equipment from the mast negated the need for a heavy tripod and light pole masts sufficed for signalling yards and the spread of wireless antennae.\n\n===Armament===\nThe guns, [[British ordnance terms#BL|BL]] 8-inch Mark VIII (203&nbsp;mm, L/50), were equally disposed in superfiring twin turrets fore and aft. The turret design was needlessly complicated by the original requirement that they should be capable of anti-aircraft fire and were thus provided with a maximum elevation of 70\u00b0, despite the inability to train and elevate sufficiently quickly to track aerial targets and the complete lack of a suitable fire control system.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}<ref name=\"navweaps\">[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_8-50_mk8.htm NavWeaps.com, British 8\"/50 (20.3 cm) Mark VIII]</ref>\n\nSecondary armament consisted of four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} (L/45) Mark V guns]] in single mounts [[British ordnance terms#HA|HA]] Mk.III fed from the amidships magazine. There were quadruple-tube [[torpedo]] launchers, one each side, amidships. The single 4-inch Mk V guns were later replaced by Mk XVI guns in paired mountings. In a fruitless attempt to keep within treaty limits, the Mark XVI mounting was stripped down to reduce the weight, the result being the Mark XVII, an exercise described as \"ridiculous punctiliousness\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell (2002)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} They were later converted back to standard Mark XVI mounts. The initial design called for two octuple mountings for the [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk.VIII]] anti-aircraft [[autocannon]] but as a weight-saving exercise these were not initially shipped and the existing QF 2-pounder Mark II was carried in lieu on four single mounts. Space was provided for a rotating catapult and a crane for operating aircraft, although again these were initially not provided.\n\n===Protection===\nThe initial design left little weight to distribute amongst protection. Thus, the traditional side-belt of armour was dispensed with and the {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} side plating was sufficient to only give protection against shell splinters. A {{convert|1.25|in|mm|adj=on}} protective deck covered the machinery spaces and there were \"box citadels\" protecting the magazines and shell rooms; {{convert|2.5|in|mm|adj=on}} crowns and {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} sides, closed by 2.5-inch bulkheads. The aft box citadel had slightly reduced thicknesses at the ends and the citadel amidships had thinner armour as it lay within the confines of the armoured deck and side plating. There was a {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} arch over the steering gear closed by a 1-inch-thick forward bulkhead. The turrets and barbettes received only thin splinter plating, as did the [[compass platform]]. There were external [[anti-torpedo bulge|bulges to provide torpedo protection]].\n\n==Differences and modifications==\n\n===''Kent'' class===\nOriginally planned as a programme of 17 Royal Navy vessels, the numbers were cut back significantly following the formation of the [[First MacDonald ministry|first Labour Government]] after the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|election of December 1923]]. Of the eight ships planned to begin construction in 1924, only five were approved, with a further two ordered later by the Royal Australian Navy.<ref>Marriot (2005) c.3, para. 6</ref>\n\nThese initial seven ships \u2013 {{HMS|Berwick|65|2}}, {{HMS|Cornwall|56|2}}, {{HMS|Cumberland|C57|2}}, {{HMS|Kent|68|2}}, and {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}, built for the Royal Navy, and {{HMAS|Australia|1927|2}} and {{HMAS|Canberra|1927|2}} for the Royal Australian Navy \u2013 formed the '''''Kent'' class'''. All were ordered in 1924 and commissioned in 1928. It was quickly found necessary to heighten the funnels by some {{convert|15|ft|m}} to clear the flue gasses from the aft superstructure. The Australian ships, ''Australia'' and ''Canberra'' had them raised a further {{convert|3|ft|m}}. Between 1930 and 1933 the aircraft and catapult were added, as was a high-angle [[HACS]] director for the 4-inch guns. ''Kent'' received an additional pair of 4-inch guns in 1934, and she, ''Berwick'' and ''Cornwall'' each received a pair of [[Vickers machine gun|QF 0.5-inch Vickers]] machine guns added abreast the fore funnel.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the British ''Kent''s were due for modernisation. However, there was little surplus weight for the designers to work with while remaining within the Treaty requirements; they were between 150 and 250 tons under the treaty limits and it was estimated that a further 200-odd tons could be gained through various savings.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} A {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} armoured belt, {{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=on}} thick, was added amidships, extending down from the armoured deck to 1 foot below the waterline. ''Cumberland'' and ''Suffolk'' had the aft superstructure razed and replaced by a large hangar for two aircraft and a fixed athwartships catapult. A crane was fitted on either side of the after funnel, and the rear gunnery, navigation and control positions were relocated to the hangar roof. The single 2-pounder guns were removed, and quadruple mountings, Mark VII, were added on either side of the bridge. The 4-inch guns were relocated, and the rearmost pair were replaced by twin mountings Mark XIX for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI. To keep weight within acceptable margins, the hull was cut down by one deck aft of \"Y\" turret. ''Berwick'' and ''Cornwall'' were similarly converted, but with more weight in hand the hull was not cut down; all four 4-inch mounts were twins and the 2-pounder guns were octuple mounts. By 1939, the torpedo tubes had been removed in all four ships.\n\n''Kent'' had less weight available for improvements and therefore was not given such an extensive modernisation. While she received the 4-inch armour belt and the double 4-inch gun mounts like her sisters, she retained the rotating catapult and after superstructure, with an additional fire-control position mounted on a distinctive lattice structure aft. Her anti-aircraft armaments were improved as for her sisters, but the multiple 2-pounders and their directors were carried aft, by the lattice structure. The naval historian H. Trevor Lenton estimates that despite the best attempts, none of these ships stayed within the treaty limits; ''Kent''{{'}}s full load displacement was 14,197 tons, indicating a standard displacement of around 10,600 tons. Lenton expresses doubts whether the Admiralty ever informed the Government of these excesses, as with war imminent, \"there were more pressing demands on their time\".<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} Another historian, Leo Marriott, gives an alternative displacement of 10,300 tons and notes that it was \"unofficially accepted\" by the UK, USA, Italy, France and Japan that refits could allow ships to exceed the London treaty limits by up to 300 tons.<ref>Marriot (2005) c.3, para. 9</ref>\n\n===''London'' class===\nThe second group, the four ships of the ''London'' class ({{HMS|Devonshire|39|2}}, {{HMS|London|69|2}}, {{HMS|Shropshire|73|2}} and {{HMS|Sussex|96|2}}), closely followed the design of the ''Kent''s. The external bulges were not present, reducing the beam by {{convert|2|ft|m}}, and the hull was lengthened by {{convert|2|ft|9|in|m}}; these changes translated into a {{Frac||3|4}}-knot increase in speed. To remedy the loss of the bulge protection, there was a second skin of inner plating to provide the same effect. The bridge was moved aft to lessen the effects of muzzle blast from B turret when the guns were trained [[Glossary of nautical terms#Abaft the beam|abaft the beam]]. They had heightened funnels as built. The aircraft and catapult had been fitted by 1932.\n\nIn all ships bar ''Sussex'', four 4-inch guns were added in single mountings abreast the funnels. The single 2-pounder guns were removed, and two quadruple mounts for 0.5-inch Vickers machine guns were added. ''Shropshire'' acquired an additional anti-aircraft fire control director. Early in the war, the additional 4-inch guns were removed, and the original 4-inch guns altered to the Mark XVI twin mounts. The octuple 2-pounder guns that had originally been designed in were also finally added.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1941, ''London'' received an altogether more comprehensive modernisation. Her upperworks were removed and replaced by new fore and aft superstructures and two upright funnels modelled on the contemporary {{sclass2-|Crown Colony|cruiser|0}} cruisers. The forward superstructure block incorporated a large hangar opening onto an athwartships catapult between the superstructure blocks. There was a catapult on either side of the after funnel. The 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced by twin mountings and relocated to the after superstructure, with the torpedoes a deck below. The 2-pounder guns were carried on the hangar roof and the multiple Vickers guns mounted, one each, on the roofs of \"B\" and \"X\" turrets. A {{convert|3.5|in|mm|adj=on}} belt, {{convert|8|ft|m}} deep, was added abreast the machinery spaces, extending up to the armoured deck. However, the hull had originally been carefully designed to reduce weight based on the initial arrangements. The modifications to ''London'' added heavy weights fore and aft and severely overstressed the hull. As a result cracks and loose rivets began to appear on the upper deck. The upper deck was reinforced, which caused the stress to be transmitted through the lower hull instead and cracks began to appear under the waterline. It took underwater reinforcements and refits extending into 1943 to remedy the situation.<ref name=\"lenton\"/><ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Pages needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe outbreak of war prevented what had ended up being a rather fruitless cosmetic rebuild being extended to the rest of her sisters, as had originally been intended. The remaining ''London''s thus never received side armouring or the improved aircraft complement.\n\nDuring wartime refits, the last three ''London''s underwent similar alterations as the ''Kent''s did, having their eight {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes removed, and \"X\" {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} turret removed, although both ''London'' and ''Shropshire'' retained it. ''Shropshire'', unlike her two un-converted sisters retained her torpedo armament, and was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in early 1943 to replace ''Canberra''.\n\n===''Norfolk'' class===\nThe final pair of Counties \u2013 {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} and {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} \u2013 formed the ''Norfolk'' class. Another two ships that had been deferred from the 1927\u20131928 and 1928\u20131929 programmes \u2013 to have been named ''Northumberland'' and ''Surrey'' \u2013 were ordered on 15 May 1929, but suspended on 23 August and finally cancelled on 14 January 1930. A proposed fifth vessel of the sub-class was also cancelled.<ref>Marriot (2005) c. 2, para. 14</ref> This was due to the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|change in administration in 1929]] that ushered in a minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government under [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. The new government cancelled the ships as an economy measure and as a gesture to the forthcoming [[London Naval Conference 1930]].<ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe ''Norfolk''s were repeats of the ''London''s with minor alterations. The bridge and after superstructure were lowered. The 8-inch gun mountings were Mark II variants that simplified loading but ended up being heavier than the Mark I variant.<ref>Marriot (2005) Appendix 3, para. 4</ref> The 4-inch guns were relocated forwards in order that they did not obstruct the catapult and aircraft which had been mounted lower down than in their predecessors. During 1937, the 4-inch guns were replaced by twins, octuple 2-pounders were added around the after superstructure and the single guns forward were removed. These improvements pushed the standard displacement over 10,400 tons.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nDuring the war, [[Unrotated Projectile|UP rocket]] launchers were initially added, but they were later removed along with the Vickers guns. These were replaced by the altogether more useful 20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon gun. An additional director for the 4-inch guns was added, and the pole masts were replaced by tripods to support the additional weight of masthead electronics. ''Dorsetshire'' was sunk in 1942, and so it was only ''Norfolk'' that underwent a refit in 1944, during which her aircraft, catapult and X turret were removed. This allowed four quadruple 2-pounder mounts and their directors and four single 40&nbsp;mm Bofors guns to be added. An extra superstructure was added aft to carry barrage directors, fitted with [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 283|radar Type 283]], which finally allowed the main armament to serve in its intended anti-aircraft role.\n\nIt was intended for ''Surrey'' and ''Northumberland'' to have a modified design, more heavily armoured but {{convert|2|kn}} slower.<ref>[ADM 1/9301 10,000ton

''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'' were equipped with [[radar]] which was used to good advantage when they shadowed the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||6}} during the RN's [[last battle of the battleship Bismarck|attempts to hunt her down]] after the sinking of {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}.\n\nThe class saw service in nearly every theatre of the war. ''Norfolk'', ''Suffolk'', and ''Dorsetshire'' were involved in the pursuit of ''Bismarck'' and {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}.  ''Berwick'' fought a gunnery action with the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||6}}, and ''Norfolk'' again fought German Navy surface units during [[Battle of the North Cape]].  ''Suffolk'' and ''Sussex'' suffered bomb damage from [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft, and both required substantial repairs.  Three of the class were lost, with ''Canberra'' being hit by naval gunfire at the [[Battle of Savo Island]] then scuttled by a U.S. destroyer, and ''Cornwall'' and ''Dorsetshire'' both bombed and sunk by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft during the [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean raid]].\n\nThe survivors began decommissioning in 1948, and were all decommissioned by the mid-1950s, except ''Cumberland'', which was an armaments trials ship testing the automatic 6-inch and 3-inch guns that would be fitted to the {{sclass-|Tiger|cruiser|4}}. She was scrapped in 1959.\n\n==''Canarias'' class==\nTwo ships based on the County class, {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Canarias||2}} and {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Baleares||2}} of the {{sclass-|Canarias|cruiser|4}}, were designed in the UK and constructed in Spain by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] subsidiary [[Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Construcci\u00f3n Naval]]. Completed in the late 1930s for the [[Spanish Navy]], they saw service during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Although they shared a common hull, machinery and main armament, the Spanish ships had a notably different appearance, with an enormous single funnel \u2013 though ''Canarias'' received two funnels in a later refit \u2013 and an equally tall forward superstructure.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=John |title=Naval Weapons of World War Two |date=2002 |publisher=Conway Maritime |location=London |isbn=0-85177-924-7}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lenton |first1=H.

They were the first post-war cruisers constructed for the Royal Navy and were designed within the limits of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons, [[Displacement (ship)|standard displacement]] and 8-inch [[caliber|calibre]] main guns may be referred to as \"treaty cruisers\" (the term \"heavy cruiser\" was not defined until the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}).\n\nThe thirteen Counties were built in the ''Kent'', ''London'' and ''Norfolk'' sub-classes. They were the only 10,000-ton 8-inch gun, or \"A\", cruisers that the Royal Navy built. The Counties are remembered for their distinctive three-funnel layout and service in all the major naval theatres of the Second World War.\n\nTo extract more ships from the treaty limits, the navy planned to construct 8,250-ton \"B\" ships, six of which could be built in place of five Counties. The extra ship that this afforded was an attractive proposition for a navy that had the immense peacetime commitments of empire.<ref name=\"lenton\">Lenton</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}<ref>Marriot (2005) c. 3, para. 23</ref> Peacetime economies and politics intervened and only two B-type cruisers were built, an 8-inch gun modified County design: the {{sclass-|York|cruiser|4}}.\n\nIn 1929, the mean cost of each \"A\" ship was estimated to be \u00a32,180,000, whilst the mean cost of each \"B\" ship was estimated to be \u00a31,800,000.<ref>{{cite hansard|speaker=[[Cuthbert Headlam]]|title=Cruiser Construction (Cost) |house=House of Commons |date= 20 February 1922 |volume=225 |column= 1104 |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1929/feb/20/cruiser-construction-cost#S5CV0225P0_19290220_HOC_80|website=millbanksystems|publisher=millbanksystems|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\nThe 10,000-ton treaty cruisers were the first type of warships built to internationally agreed restrictions.<ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} These restrictions posed new engineering challenges and forced compromises upon designers in how to extract the best balance of speed, armament and protection.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} The [[United States Navy]] adopted a design with [[gun turret|triple-gun turrets]], allowing the hull to be shortened thus saving weight that could be put into protection. This approach required increased power, as the speed of a ship is a function of the ratio of length to beam. The Royal Navy had a requirement for a vessel for colonial [[trade route]] defence, which required a good cruising range and speed and independent fighting power. This determined the need for a long hull and the use of four twin-gun turrets, with any remaining displacement invested in protection.\n\nThe design was conservative in nature, especially when compared to the contemporary [[Nelson-class battleship|''Nelson''-class]] battleships built to satisfy the same treaty. The long (630 feet [[Length overall|overall]]) hull was [[flush deck]]ed and with a high freeboard and was strongly built. This afforded high [[directional stability|initial stability]], which contributed to the protection scheme.<ref name=\"lenton\"/><ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Pages needed|date=January 2020}} The machinery spaces followed the traditional layout of [[Boiler room (ship)|boiler rooms]] ahead of [[engine room]]s, separated by an amidships [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]. The two boiler rooms exhausted into four uptakes, the central pair being combined to form a thickened central funnel. The three-funnel design was handsome but a somewhat impractical use of internal space.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAs had been tested in the wartime cruiser {{HMS|Emerald|D66|6}}, whose completion had been delayed post-war, the Counties featured a new design of forward superstructure incorporating the navigating bridge, wheelhouse, signalling and compass platforms and [[fire-control system|gunnery director]] in a block. This advance considerably rationalised the separate armoured conning tower and myriad of decks and platforms of older designs. Moving the fire-control equipment from the mast negated the need for a heavy tripod and light pole masts sufficed for signalling yards and the spread of wireless antennae.\n\n===Armament===\nThe guns, [[British ordnance terms#BL|BL]] 8-inch Mark VIII (203&nbsp;mm, L/50), were equally disposed in superfiring twin turrets fore and aft. The turret design was needlessly complicated by the original requirement that they should be capable of anti-aircraft fire and were thus provided with a maximum elevation of 70\u00b0, despite the inability to train and elevate sufficiently quickly to track aerial targets and the complete lack of a suitable fire control system.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}<ref name=\"navweaps\">[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_8-50_mk8.htm NavWeaps.com, British 8\"/50 (20.3 cm) Mark VIII]</ref>\n\nSecondary armament consisted of four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} (L/45) Mark V guns]] in single mounts [[British ordnance terms#HA|HA]] Mk.III fed from the amidships magazine. There were quadruple-tube [[torpedo]] launchers, one each side, amidships. The single 4-inch Mk V guns were later replaced by Mk XVI guns in paired mountings. In a fruitless attempt to keep within treaty limits, the Mark XVI mounting was stripped down to reduce the weight, the result being the Mark XVII, an exercise described as \"ridiculous punctiliousness\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell (2002)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} They were later converted back to standard Mark XVI mounts. The initial design called for two octuple mountings for the [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk.VIII]] anti-aircraft [[autocannon]] but as a weight-saving exercise these were not initially shipped and the existing QF 2-pounder Mark II was carried in lieu on four single mounts. Space was provided for a rotating catapult and a crane for operating aircraft, although again these were initially not provided.\n\n===Protection===\nThe initial design left little weight to distribute amongst protection. Thus, the traditional side-belt of armour was dispensed with and the {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} side plating was sufficient to only give protection against shell splinters. A {{convert|1.25|in|mm|adj=on}} protective deck covered the machinery spaces and there were \"box citadels\" protecting the magazines and shell rooms; {{convert|2.5|in|mm|adj=on}} crowns and {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} sides, closed by 2.5-inch bulkheads. The aft box citadel had slightly reduced thicknesses at the ends and the citadel amidships had thinner armour as it lay within the confines of the armoured deck and side plating. There was a {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} arch over the steering gear closed by a 1-inch-thick forward bulkhead. The turrets and barbettes received only thin splinter plating, as did the [[compass platform]]. There were external [[anti-torpedo bulge|bulges to provide torpedo protection]].\n\n==Differences and modifications==\n\n===''Kent'' class===\nOriginally planned as a programme of 17 Royal Navy vessels, the numbers were cut back significantly following the formation of the [[First MacDonald ministry|first Labour Government]] after the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|election of December 1923]]. Of the eight ships planned to begin construction in 1924, only five were approved, with a further two ordered later by the Royal Australian Navy.<ref>Marriot (2005) c.3, para. 6</ref>\n\nThese initial seven ships \u2013 {{HMS|Berwick|65|2}}, {{HMS|Cornwall|56|2}}, {{HMS|Cumberland|C57|2}}, {{HMS|Kent|68|2}}, and {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}, built for the Royal Navy, and {{HMAS|Australia|1927|2}} and {{HMAS|Canberra|1927|2}} for the Royal Australian Navy \u2013 formed the '''''Kent'' class'''. All were ordered in 1924 and commissioned in 1928. It was quickly found necessary to heighten the funnels by some {{convert|15|ft|m}} to clear the flue gasses from the aft superstructure. The Australian ships, ''Australia'' and ''Canberra'' had them raised a further {{convert|3|ft|m}}. Between 1930 and 1933 the aircraft and catapult were added, as was a high-angle [[HACS]] director for the 4-inch guns. ''Kent'' received an additional pair of 4-inch guns in 1934, and she, ''Berwick'' and ''Cornwall'' each received a pair of [[Vickers machine gun|QF 0.5-inch Vickers]] machine guns added abreast the fore funnel.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the British ''Kent''s were due for modernisation. However, there was little surplus weight for the designers to work with while remaining within the Treaty requirements; they were between 150 and 250 tons under the treaty limits and it was estimated that a further 200-odd tons could be gained through various savings.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} A {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} armoured belt, {{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=on}} thick, was added amidships, extending down from the armoured deck to 1 foot below the waterline. ''Cumberland'' and ''Suffolk'' had the aft superstructure razed and replaced by a large hangar for two aircraft and a fixed athwartships catapult. A crane was fitted on either side of the after funnel, and the rear gunnery, navigation and control positions were relocated to the hangar roof. The single 2-pounder guns were removed, and quadruple mountings, Mark VII, were added on either side of the bridge. The 4-inch guns were relocated, and the rearmost pair were replaced by twin mountings Mark XIX for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI. To keep weight within acceptable margins, the hull was cut down by one deck aft of \"Y\" turret. ''Berwick'' and ''Cornwall'' were similarly converted, but with more weight in hand the hull was not cut down; all four 4-inch mounts were twins and the 2-pounder guns were octuple mounts. By 1939, the torpedo tubes had been removed in all four ships.\n\n''Kent'' had less weight available for improvements and therefore was not given such an extensive modernisation. While she received the 4-inch armour belt and the double 4-inch gun mounts like her sisters, she retained the rotating catapult and after superstructure, with an additional fire-control position mounted on a distinctive lattice structure aft. Her anti-aircraft armaments were improved as for her sisters, but the multiple 2-pounders and their directors were carried aft, by the lattice structure. The naval historian H. Trevor Lenton estimates that despite the best attempts, none of these ships stayed within the treaty limits; ''Kent''{{'}}s full load displacement was 14,197 tons, indicating a standard displacement of around 10,600 tons. Lenton expresses doubts whether the Admiralty ever informed the Government of these excesses, as with war imminent, \"there were more pressing demands on their time\".<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}} Another historian, Leo Marriott, gives an alternative displacement of 10,300 tons and notes that it was \"unofficially accepted\" by the UK, USA, Italy, France and Japan that refits could allow ships to exceed the London treaty limits by up to 300 tons.<ref>Marriot (2005) c.3, para. 9</ref>\n\n===''London'' class===\nThe second group, the four ships of the ''London'' class ({{HMS|Devonshire|39|2}}, {{HMS|London|69|2}}, {{HMS|Shropshire|73|2}} and {{HMS|Sussex|96|2}}), closely followed the design of the ''Kent''s. The external bulges were not present, reducing the beam by {{convert|2|ft|m}}, and the hull was lengthened by {{convert|2|ft|9|in|m}}; these changes translated into a {{Frac||3|4}}-knot increase in speed. To remedy the loss of the bulge protection, there was a second skin of inner plating to provide the same effect. The bridge was moved aft to lessen the effects of muzzle blast from B turret when the guns were trained [[Glossary of nautical terms#Abaft the beam|abaft the beam]]. They had heightened funnels as built. The aircraft and catapult had been fitted by 1932.\n\nIn all ships bar ''Sussex'', four 4-inch guns were added in single mountings abreast the funnels. The single 2-pounder guns were removed, and two quadruple mounts for 0.5-inch Vickers machine guns were added. ''Shropshire'' acquired an additional anti-aircraft fire control director. Early in the war, the additional 4-inch guns were removed, and the original 4-inch guns altered to the Mark XVI twin mounts. The octuple 2-pounder guns that had originally been designed in were also finally added.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1941, ''London'' received an altogether more comprehensive modernisation. Her upperworks were removed and replaced by new fore and aft superstructures and two upright funnels modelled on the contemporary {{sclass2-|Crown Colony|cruiser|0}} cruisers. The forward superstructure block incorporated a large hangar opening onto an athwartships catapult between the superstructure blocks. There was a catapult on either side of the after funnel. The 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced by twin mountings and relocated to the after superstructure, with the torpedoes a deck below. The 2-pounder guns were carried on the hangar roof and the multiple Vickers guns mounted, one each, on the roofs of \"B\" and \"X\" turrets. A {{convert|3.5|in|mm|adj=on}} belt, {{convert|8|ft|m}} deep, was added abreast the machinery spaces, extending up to the armoured deck. However, the hull had originally been carefully designed to reduce weight based on the initial arrangements. The modifications to ''London'' added heavy weights fore and aft and severely overstressed the hull. As a result cracks and loose rivets began to appear on the upper deck. The upper deck was reinforced, which caused the stress to be transmitted through the lower hull instead and cracks began to appear under the waterline. It took underwater reinforcements and refits extending into 1943 to remedy the situation.<ref name=\"lenton\"/><ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Pages needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe outbreak of war prevented what had ended up being a rather fruitless cosmetic rebuild being extended to the rest of her sisters, as had originally been intended. The remaining ''London''s thus never received side armouring or the improved aircraft complement.\n\nDuring wartime refits, the last three ''London''s underwent similar alterations as the ''Kent''s did, having their eight {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} torpedo tubes removed, and \"X\" {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} turret removed, although both ''London'' and ''Shropshire'' retained it. ''Shropshire'', unlike her two un-converted sisters retained her torpedo armament, and was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in early 1943 to replace ''Canberra''.\n\n===''Norfolk'' class===\nThe final pair of Counties \u2013 {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} and {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} \u2013 formed the ''Norfolk'' class. Another two ships that had been deferred from the 1927\u20131928 and 1928\u20131929 programmes \u2013 to have been named ''Northumberland'' and ''Surrey'' \u2013 were ordered on 15 May 1929, but suspended on 23 August and finally cancelled on 14 January 1930. A proposed fifth vessel of the sub-class was also cancelled.<ref>Marriot (2005) c. 2, para. 14</ref> This was due to the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|change in administration in 1929]] that ushered in a minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government under [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. The new government cancelled the ships as an economy measure and as a gesture to the forthcoming [[London Naval Conference 1930]].<ref>Marriot (2005)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe ''Norfolk''s were repeats of the ''London''s with minor alterations. The bridge and after superstructure were lowered. The 8-inch gun mountings were Mark II variants that simplified loading but ended up being heavier than the Mark I variant.<ref>Marriot (2005) Appendix 3, para. 4</ref> The 4-inch guns were relocated forwards in order that they did not obstruct the catapult and aircraft which had been mounted lower down than in their predecessors. During 1937, the 4-inch guns were replaced by twins, octuple 2-pounders were added around the after superstructure and the single guns forward were removed. These improvements pushed the standard displacement over 10,400 tons.<ref name=\"lenton\"/>{{Page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nDuring the war, [[Unrotated Projectile|UP rocket]] launchers were initially added, but they were later removed along with the Vickers guns. These were replaced by the altogether more useful 20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon gun. An additional director for the 4-inch guns was added, and the pole masts were replaced by tripods to support the additional weight of masthead electronics. ''Dorsetshire'' was sunk in 1942, and so it was only ''Norfolk'' that underwent a refit in 1944, during which her aircraft, catapult and X turret were removed. This allowed four quadruple 2-pounder mounts and their directors and four single 40&nbsp;mm Bofors guns to be added. An extra superstructure was added aft to carry barrage directors, fitted with [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 283|radar Type 283]], which finally allowed the main armament to serve in its intended anti-aircraft role.\n\nIt was intended for ''Surrey'' and ''Northumberland'' to have a modified design, more heavily armoured but {{convert|2|kn}} slower.<ref>[ADM 1/9301 10,000ton

''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'' were equipped with [[radar]] which was used to good advantage when they shadowed the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||6}} during the RN's [[last battle of the battleship Bismarck|attempts to hunt her down]] after the sinking of {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}.\n\nThe class saw service in nearly every theatre of the war. ''Norfolk'', ''Suffolk'', and ''Dorsetshire'' were involved in the pursuit of ''Bismarck'' and {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}.  ''Berwick'' fought a gunnery action with the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||6}}, and ''Norfolk'' again fought German Navy surface units during [[Battle of the North Cape]].  ''Suffolk'' and ''Sussex'' suffered bomb damage from [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft, and both required substantial repairs.  Three of the class were lost, with ''Canberra'' being hit by naval gunfire at the [[Battle of Savo Island]] then scuttled by a U.S. destroyer, and ''Cornwall'' and ''Dorsetshire'' both bombed and sunk by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft during the [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean raid]].\n\nThe survivors began decommissioning in 1948, and were all decommissioned by the mid-1950s, except ''Cumberland'', which was an armaments trials ship testing the automatic 6-inch and 3-inch guns that would be fitted to the {{sclass-|Tiger|cruiser|4}}. She was scrapped in 1959.\n\n==''Canarias'' class==\nTwo ships based on the County class, {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Canarias||2}} and {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Baleares||2}} of the {{sclass-|Canarias|cruiser|4}}, were designed in the UK and constructed in Spain by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] subsidiary [[Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Construcci\u00f3n Naval]]. Completed in the late 1930s for the [[Spanish Navy]], they saw service during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Although they shared a common hull, machinery and main armament, the Spanish ships had a notably different appearance, with an enormous single funnel \u2013 though ''Canarias'' received two funnels in a later refit \u2013 and an equally tall forward superstructure.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=John |title=Naval Weapons of World War Two |date=2002 |publisher=Conway Maritime |location=London |isbn=0-85177-924-7}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lenton |first1=H.

They settled near [[Winkler, Manitoba]].  At age 14, Hildebrand was converted at a [[Canadian Sunday School Mission]] summer camp.\n\nIn 1929 Hildebrand enrolled in Winnipeg Bible Institute (now known as [[Providence University College and Theological Seminary]]), where he earned an undergraduate degree and completed a year of post-graduate studies.  It was at this time he met [[Inger Soyland]]. A Norwegian by descent, Inger had come to Canada with a cousin to visit her aunt, but her return to Norway was cancelled when the Depression struck.\n\nIn 1935 he accepted an invitation to come to the small town of [[Briercrest, Saskatchewan]], to lead the Briercrest Gospel Assembly. That same year Briercrest Bible Institute was founded. In 1946 the institute moved to [[Caronport, Saskatchewan]], and a Christian high school was created. The Bible institute grew to become one of Canada's largest Christian post-secondary schools (now known as Briercrest College and Seminary).\n\nHildebrand married [[Inger Soyland]] on August 12, 1937, and brought his new bride to Briercrest.  Their family grew to include five children, Marcia, Evelyn, David, Paul, and Glen.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1977, Hildebrand served as chancellor until 1990, and chancellor emeritus until his death. He and Inger moved from Caronport in 1992, but remained very involved in the ministry of Briercrest.\n\nOn October 24, 1979, Hildebrand was invested by Governor-General Edward Schreyer with membership in the nation's highest civil honour, the Order of Canada, for his leadership in Christian education through Briercrest and the impact of his life upon Canadian youth and society.\n\n==Education==\n    '''Winnipeg Bible Institute'''\n    1930-32\u2013Diploma\n    1932-33\u2013Post-graduate\n\n    '''[[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]]'''\n    1949\n\n    '''Winona Lake School of Theology'''\n    1964\u2013BA (major in Bible)\n    1966\u2013MA\n\n==Recognition==\n*[[Order of Canada]] - October 24, 1979\n*Received the nation's highest civil honour at a ceremony at Government House, Ottawa\n*Hildebrand was invested by Governor-General [[Edward Schreyer]] with membership in the Order of Canada\n*Given in recognition of Dr. Hildebrand's lifelong work in Christian education through [[Briercrest Family of Schools]] and for the impact of his life upon Canadian youth and society.\n*Honorary doctorate (Doctor of Divinity) from [[Providence University College and Theological Seminary|Providence College]] in 1977.\n*Honorary doctorate (Doctor of Pedagogy) from [[Briercrest Bible College]] in 1992, as well as the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\n==Church affiliation==\n\n    * Caronport Community Church\n    * Central Heights MB Church - Abbotsford, BC\n\n==Books published==\n    * In His Loving Service \u2013 Memoirs by Henry Hildebrand (published 1985)\n    * Contemporary Leadership Dynamics \u2013 Illustrations from Acts (published 1987)\n    * The Model of Servant Leadership \u2013 (published 1990)\n    * Living the Abounding Life\u2013Empowered by the Holy Spirit \u2013 (published 1996)\n    * Our Gracious and Loving Heavenly Father \u2013 Devotionals \u2013 Book 1 (published 1999)\n    * Our Gracious and Loving Heavenly Father \u2013 Devotionals \u2013 Book 2 (published 2000)\n    * Joyful Servants: A Biography of David and Jeannie Hildebrand \u2013 (published 2001)\n    * Our Gracious God and Loving Heavenly Father, Vols. 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hildebrand, Henry}}\n[[Category:Canadian university and college chief executives]]\n[[Category:Wheaton College (Illinois) alumni]]\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=January 2016}}\n'''Henry Hildebrand''' (November 16, 1911 \u2013 February 7, 2006) is most known for being the founding principal (later called president) of [[Briercrest Bible Institute]] for 42 years; the school is now known as [[Briercrest Family of Schools]] or [[Briercrest College and Seminary]].\n\n==History==\nBorn in 1911, Henry Hildebrand immigrated to Canada with his parents Peter and Anna, and the rest of their family in 1925 from southern Russia (Ukraine) for political reasons.

As a member of the reigning [[House of Bourbon]], she was a ''[[Prince du Sang|princesse du sang]]''. Forced to marry the [[Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine|Duke of Maine]], legitimised son of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Madame de Montespan]], she revelled in politics and the arts, and held a popular ''salon'' at the [[H\u00f4tel Biron|H\u00f4tel du Maine]] as well as at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nLouise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was born on 8 November 1676 at the [[Od\u00e9on|H\u00f4tel de Cond\u00e9]]{{efn|''H\u00f4tel de Cond\u00e9'' would ordinarily refer to the principal residence of the [[House of Cond\u00e9]] in Paris. At the time this ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier]]'' was built, ''[[Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Louis Joseph de Bourbon]]'' was living at the [[Palais Bourbon]] with his mistress, [[Maria Caterina Brignole]]. The former Cond\u00e9 h\u00f4tel occupied the site where the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on]] now stands. The h\u00f4tel gave its name to the present ''rue de Cond\u00e9'', on which its forecourt faced. On 26 March 1770, an order in council authorised the execution of the Od\u00e9on project, designed by [[Charles De Wailly|Charles de Wailly]] and [[Marie-Joseph Peyre|Marie Joseph Peyre]] on the grounds of the garden of the h\u00f4tel of the ''prince de Cond\u00e9'', who expected to be rid of the property in expectations of setting up more grandly in the [[Palais Bourbon]].}} in [[Paris]]. She was the eighth child born to the then Duke and Duchess of Enghien. The name '''B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte''' was added in honour of the girls maternal aunt, [[Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate|Benedicta, Duchess of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]].\n\nShe was brought up at the H\u00f4tel de Cond\u00e9 with her many sisters and had to endure slave-like conditions under the madness of her father. Her mother, who was pious and gentle, was often beaten by her father as were their staff and her sister [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1678\u20131718)|Marie Anne, Mademoiselle de Montmorency]]. When formally addressed, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was known as ''Mademosielle d'Enghien''. As a [[Prince du Sang|princess of the blood]], she possessed the style of ''[[Serene Highness]]''. When she was nine years old, her father was given the title of ''[[Count of Charolais]]'', and as a result Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte became known as court as ''Mademoiselle de Charolais''. This appellation would later pass to her niece [[Louise Anne de Bourbon|Louise Anne]].\n\nShe was very outspoken and witty, and had a terrible temper. As she was very small and paid much attention to her appearance, she was nicknamed ''poup\u00e9e du Sang'' at the French court, literally, \"Doll of the Blood\", a play on the honorific ''princesse du sang'', princess of the Blood. This nickname is sometimes said to have been made up by her sister-in-law the [[Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon, Duchess of Bourbon|Duchess of Bourbon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conde.ifrance.com/al.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512091305/http://conde.ifrance.com/al.htm |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} ''Doll of the Blood''</ref> She was close to her sister Marie Anne, whose marriage to the [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend\u00f4me|Duke of Vend\u00f4me]] (1654\u20131712) she later arranged. Although born with a lame arm, she was generally thought to be the most attractive of the Cond\u00e9 daughters.

She spent most of her time in the company of her mother and two older sisters.\n\n==Marriage==\n\nAt first, it was proposed that she marry [[Louis, Count of Vermandois|Louis de Bourbon, Count of Vermandois]], son of Louis XIV and [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]]. However, the count died in exile in 1683. [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] arranged several marriages into princely houses of France for his legitimised children by [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]]. Prior to her marriage, she saw the marriage of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]] to ''[[Fran\u00e7oise Marie de Bourbon|Mademoiselle de Blois]]'', future ''duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans''.

The couple did not like each other, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte found her husband weak and abhorred his lack of ambition. He could not stand her terrible temper and deliberate attempts to embarrass him at court. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's is said to have had several affairs which were known to Maine.<ref>[http://forum.alexanderpalace.org/index.php?topic=6346.0 Duchess of Maine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> To her husband, she was recorded as saying, \"Just look at yourself - a lame bastard! - and you'd like to boss me?

Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte spent a further 80,000 livres on its furnishings and decorations.\n\nAfter extensive renovations, she took up residence in December 1700. There, she began to be called ''La Reine des Abeilles'', or Queen of the Bees. In 1703, to amuse herself, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte created her own personal [[chivalric order]],  the '''Order of the Honey Bee'''. She gave the order to thirty-nine people. Each member had a robe embroidered with silver thread, a wig in the shape of a beehive and a medal embossed with a profile of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and engraved with the letters L. BAR. D. SC. D.P.D.L.O.D.L.M.A.M, meaning ''Louise, baronne de Sceaux, dictatrice perp\u00e9tuelle de l'ordre de la Mouche \u00e0 miel'' (\"Louise, baroness of Sceaux, dictator of Order of the Honey Bee\").<ref>Les Aventures des Cond\u00e9 & Conti</ref>\n\nTo her small court, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte attracted a host of literary figures of the day, including the young [[Voltaire]], the ''[[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|baron de Montesquieu]]'', the ''[[Fran\u00e7ois-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis|cardinal de Bernis]]'', the ''[[Anne Claude Philippe de Tubieres de Grimoard de Pestels de Levis, Comte de Caylus|comte de Caylus]]'', [[Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9nault]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]].\n[[Image:Chateau-sceaux-colbert.jpg|thumb|430px|right|The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux]] at the time of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte]]\nIn 1710, she helped to plot the marriage of her sister, Marie Anne, ''Mademoiselle de Monmorency'', to the famous general [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vend\u00f4me|Louis Joseph de Bourbon, ''duc de Vend\u00f4me'']]. For mercenary reasons, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte wanted a marriage that would not produce any children. Upon the death of a childless Vend\u00f4me, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte hoped that she or her children would inherit the duke's huge estate, which he had acquired as the grandson of the rich heiress, [[Fran\u00e7oise of Lorraine]]. At thirty-two, Marie Anne was considered past child-bearing age, and Vend\u00f4me was a well known [[homosexual]], thirty years older than his prospective bride. As it happened, though, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte got nothing. On the duke's death, Marie Anne was created Duchess of \u00c9tampes in her own right and inherited the [[H\u00f4tel de Vend\u00f4me]] in Paris, where she died in 1718 from [[alcoholism]].\n\nBoth the Maines doted on their children. Their daughter, who would remain close to her mother until her death, was baptised at Versailles on 9 April 1714. ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' was given the name of her paternal aunt [[Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon]], known at court as ''Madame la Duchesse''. ''Madame la Duchesse'' had grown up with Maine under the care of [[Madame de Maintenon]].\n\nThe guest of honour at the baptism of ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' was the small dauphin, the future [[Louis XV]], who was chaperoned by Maine's other sister, the new [[Fran\u00e7oise Marie de Bourbon|Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]]. The [[Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan|cardinal de Rohan]] baptised ''Mademoiselle du Maine''. Thanks to the help of Madame de Maintenon, who had always loved Maine, Louis XIV created Maine a ''[[Prince du Sang|Prince of the Blood]]'' which put him in line of succession to the throne. In his will, Louis XIV also appointed Maine to be the Regent of France for his five-year-old great-grandson, the future [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].\n\n==Regency of Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans==\n[[File:LouisXV DucOrl\u00e9ans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]] pointing to an infant Louis XV for whom he acted as regent for till 1723, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was imprisoned by Orl\u00e9ans as a result of her involvement in the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]] in 1719.]]\nAt the death of the king in 1715, however, the [[Parlement de Paris]] annulled Louis XIV's will and named Maine's brother-in-law, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], as [[regent|R\u00e9gent]] for the child king. Upset with this and the role played by the ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'' in reducing the status of the legitimised children of Louis XIV from the rank of ''[[Prince du Sang|Princes du Sang]]'' (which Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte had enjoyed since birth) to mere [[Peerage of France|peers of France]], Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte induced her husband to join in the '''[[Cellamare Conspiracy]]''' in the hope of transferring the regency to King [[Philip V of Spain]], the uncle of Louis XV.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The plot was named after [[Antonio del Giudice]], Duke of Giovinazzo, Prince of Cellamare, who was the Spanish ambassador to France.\n\nIn order to gain more support for a new regent, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte started a correspondence with [[Giulio Alberoni]], the Spanish [[Prime Minister]]. Among her co-conspirators were the [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu|Duke of Richelieu]] and [[Melchior de Polignac]]. The plot, however, was discovered, and both the Maines were arrested and forced to abandon their residence at Sceaux.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In 1719, the duke was imprisoned in the [[Doullens]] fortress and the duchess in [[Dijon]]. Their two sons were put in the care of their governor in [[Gien]], and their daughter was taken from a convent at Maubuisson to another convent at [[Chaillot]] in Paris, in the area of the present [[Trocad\u00e9ro]]. She stayed at Chaillot till 1720 when her parents were released from their separate imprisonments.\n\nAfter her release, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte led a more peaceful life at Sceaux, still surrounded though by her little court of wits and poets.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> On 27 December 1718, before their exile, she and her husband had purchased an unfinished house in Paris on the rue de Bourbon (now rue de Lille) from her sister [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]]. It was originally designed by the architect [[Robert de Cotte]], but they had hired a new architect, [[Armand-Claude Mollet]], to enlarge and redesign it. It was completed before their return from exile and became known as the [[H\u00f4tel du Maine]] (destroyed 1838).<ref>Robert Neuman (1994) ''Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France'', Chicago/London: The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|9780226574370}}, pp. 142\u2013143; Alexandre Gady (2008) ''Les H\u00f4tels particuliers de Paris du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Belle \u00c9poque'', Paris: Parigramme, {{ISBN|9782840962137}}, pp. 313. The site of the former H\u00f4tel du Maine is at 84\u201386 rue de Lille.</ref>\n\nAt the time of her imprisonment, she was trying to arrange the marriage of her eldest son, [[Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes|Louis Auguste de Bourbon]], heir to the Maine's fortune, to his cousin [[Charlotte Agla\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans|Charlotte Agla\u00e9, Mademoiselle de Valois]]. The rivalry between the Maines and Charlotte Agla\u00e9's father, the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], was well known, and it was hoped that the wedding would heal old wounds. A marriage did not occur, however, as the young ''Mademoiselle de Valois'' refused her cousin, much to the annoyance of the proud Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte. Madame du Maine was not happy when she found out that Charlotte Agla\u00e9 had considered the hand of another cousin, [[Charles de Bourbon (1700\u20131760)|Charles de Bourbon]], the son of ''[[Louis III, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Monsieur le Duc]]'', Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's brother, and ''[[Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon|Madame la Duchesse]]'', Maine's sister.\n\n==Widowhood==\n\nAfter their release from imprisonment in 1720, the Maines seemed to have reconciled and led a more compatible life rather than being hostile to each other. In May 1736, the duke died at the age of sixty-six.<ref>G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Pi\u00e9pape, ''La duchesse du Maine'' (1910).</ref> Louis XV allowed Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte to keep her apartments at Versailles next to those of her daughter. These apartments overlooked the Orang\u00e9rie. Both her sons also had apartments at court, but both preferred to stay in the country hunting. Madame du Maine tried on more than one occasion to arrange an advantageous marriage for her daughter. The first was to one Monsieur de Guise, but that marriage never materialised. Later, she tried to convince the widower [[Jacques I, Prince of Monaco]], who was often at Versailles, to wed again. Despite the lure of a large dowry, both men considered Mademoiselle du Maine to be very unattractive. Unwed, she died in 1743. She was buried at the \u00c9glise at Sceaux. At the time of her death, her library was numbered at having some 3000 books. \n\n[[File:L'h\u00f4tel biron 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The H\u00f4tel du Maine, present day [[H\u00f4tel Biron]] where Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte lived as a widow]]\n\nIn 1736 Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte received the medieval [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond (Saint-Amand-Montrond)|Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond]], which she allowed to be dismantled for its stone and the slate and lead in its roof.<ref>[https://montjoye.net/chateau-de-montrond-de-saint-amand-montrond \"Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond de Saint-Amand-Montrond\"], montjoye.net.</ref> In 1737, she leased the [[H\u00f4tel Peyrenc-de-Moras]] (today the [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]) in Paris from the widow of [[Abraham Peyrenc de Moras]].

Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and her oldest sister [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]], known as ''Mademoiselle de Bourbon'' until her marriage to ''[[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti|le Grand Conti]]'' in 1688, were considered the most attractive of the daughters born to the Cond\u00e9s.\n\n''Mademoiselle d'Enghien'' received the typical education given to girls of the [[nobility]] in France and was taught reading, writing, dancing, singing and other matters which were considered necessary for a young aristocrat. She spent most of her time in the company of her mother and two older sisters.\n\n==Marriage==\n\nAt first, it was proposed that she marry [[Louis, Count of Vermandois|Louis de Bourbon, Count of Vermandois]], son of Louis XIV and [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]]. However, the count died in exile in 1683. [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] arranged several marriages into princely houses of France for his legitimised children by [[Louise de La Valli\u00e8re]]. Prior to her marriage, she saw the marriage of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]] to ''[[Fran\u00e7oise Marie de Bourbon|Mademoiselle de Blois]]'', future ''duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans''. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's own brother [[Louis III, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Louis de Bourbon]] had even had been forced to marry ''[[Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon, Duchess of Bourbon|Mademoiselle de Nantes]]'', eldest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.\n\nIn 1692, the 15-year-old Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte married the 21-year-old [[Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine|Louis Auguste de Bourbon, ''L\u00e9gitim\u00e9 de France'', Duke of Maine]]. \n[[File:Engraving of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon (Duchess of Maine), by Nicholas de Larmessin of Paris circa 1690.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte in the year of her marriage]]\nThe wedding ceremony took place on 19 May 1692 in the chapel of the [[Palace of Versailles]], Madame de Montespan was not invited but all of Maine's siblings attended as well as the princes and princesses of the blood. As both the groom and his wife were physically handicapped, members of the court joked that \"look at the union of a one-armed woman and a lame man! What a beautiful couple!\".{{efn|''Voici l'union d'un boiteux et d'une manchote. Ah, le beau couple!''. ''Prince of Cond\u00e9'' site.}} \nThe marriage was not happy. The couple did not like each other, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte found her husband weak and abhorred his lack of ambition. He could not stand her terrible temper and deliberate attempts to embarrass him at court. Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's is said to have had several affairs which were known to Maine.<ref>[http://forum.alexanderpalace.org/index.php?topic=6346.0 Duchess of Maine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> To her husband, she was recorded as saying, \"Just look at yourself - a lame bastard! - and you'd like to boss me?

One to support your body, and the other, me, to maintain your rank! And this Leggy wants to rule my steps!\" (Since Maine limped, his wife called him 'Gambillard', which meant leggy).{{efn|\"Regardez-vous un peu! Un b\u00e2tard boiteux! Qui me pr\u00e9tend gouverner!

Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte spent a further 80,000 livres on its furnishings and decorations.\n\nAfter extensive renovations, she took up residence in December 1700. There, she began to be called ''La Reine des Abeilles'', or Queen of the Bees. In 1703, to amuse herself, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte created her own personal [[chivalric order]],  the '''Order of the Honey Bee'''. She gave the order to thirty-nine people. Each member had a robe embroidered with silver thread, a wig in the shape of a beehive and a medal embossed with a profile of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and engraved with the letters L. BAR. D. SC. D.P.D.L.O.D.L.M.A.M, meaning ''Louise, baronne de Sceaux, dictatrice perp\u00e9tuelle de l'ordre de la Mouche \u00e0 miel'' (\"Louise, baroness of Sceaux, dictator of Order of the Honey Bee\").<ref>Les Aventures des Cond\u00e9 & Conti</ref>\n\nTo her small court, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte attracted a host of literary figures of the day, including the young [[Voltaire]], the ''[[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|baron de Montesquieu]]'', the ''[[Fran\u00e7ois-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis|cardinal de Bernis]]'', the ''[[Anne Claude Philippe de Tubieres de Grimoard de Pestels de Levis, Comte de Caylus|comte de Caylus]]'', [[Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9nault]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]].\n[[Image:Chateau-sceaux-colbert.jpg|thumb|430px|right|The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux]] at the time of Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte]]\nIn 1710, she helped to plot the marriage of her sister, Marie Anne, ''Mademoiselle de Monmorency'', to the famous general [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vend\u00f4me|Louis Joseph de Bourbon, ''duc de Vend\u00f4me'']]. For mercenary reasons, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte wanted a marriage that would not produce any children. Upon the death of a childless Vend\u00f4me, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte hoped that she or her children would inherit the duke's huge estate, which he had acquired as the grandson of the rich heiress, [[Fran\u00e7oise of Lorraine]]. At thirty-two, Marie Anne was considered past child-bearing age, and Vend\u00f4me was a well known [[homosexual]], thirty years older than his prospective bride. As it happened, though, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte got nothing. On the duke's death, Marie Anne was created Duchess of \u00c9tampes in her own right and inherited the [[H\u00f4tel de Vend\u00f4me]] in Paris, where she died in 1718 from [[alcoholism]].\n\nBoth the Maines doted on their children. Their daughter, who would remain close to her mother until her death, was baptised at Versailles on 9 April 1714. ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' was given the name of her paternal aunt [[Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon]], known at court as ''Madame la Duchesse''. ''Madame la Duchesse'' had grown up with Maine under the care of [[Madame de Maintenon]].\n\nThe guest of honour at the baptism of ''Mademoiselle du Maine'' was the small dauphin, the future [[Louis XV]], who was chaperoned by Maine's other sister, the new [[Fran\u00e7oise Marie de Bourbon|Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]]. The [[Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan|cardinal de Rohan]] baptised ''Mademoiselle du Maine''. Thanks to the help of Madame de Maintenon, who had always loved Maine, Louis XIV created Maine a ''[[Prince du Sang|Prince of the Blood]]'' which put him in line of succession to the throne. In his will, Louis XIV also appointed Maine to be the Regent of France for his five-year-old great-grandson, the future [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].\n\n==Regency of Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans==\n[[File:LouisXV DucOrl\u00e9ans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]] pointing to an infant Louis XV for whom he acted as regent for till 1723, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte was imprisoned by Orl\u00e9ans as a result of her involvement in the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]] in 1719.]]\nAt the death of the king in 1715, however, the [[Parlement de Paris]] annulled Louis XIV's will and named Maine's brother-in-law, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], as [[regent|R\u00e9gent]] for the child king. Upset with this and the role played by the ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'' in reducing the status of the legitimised children of Louis XIV from the rank of ''[[Prince du Sang|Princes du Sang]]'' (which Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte had enjoyed since birth) to mere [[Peerage of France|peers of France]], Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte induced her husband to join in the '''[[Cellamare Conspiracy]]''' in the hope of transferring the regency to King [[Philip V of Spain]], the uncle of Louis XV.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The plot was named after [[Antonio del Giudice]], Duke of Giovinazzo, Prince of Cellamare, who was the Spanish ambassador to France.\n\nIn order to gain more support for a new regent, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte started a correspondence with [[Giulio Alberoni]], the Spanish [[Prime Minister]]. Among her co-conspirators were the [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu|Duke of Richelieu]] and [[Melchior de Polignac]]. The plot, however, was discovered, and both the Maines were arrested and forced to abandon their residence at Sceaux.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In 1719, the duke was imprisoned in the [[Doullens]] fortress and the duchess in [[Dijon]]. Their two sons were put in the care of their governor in [[Gien]], and their daughter was taken from a convent at Maubuisson to another convent at [[Chaillot]] in Paris, in the area of the present [[Trocad\u00e9ro]]. She stayed at Chaillot till 1720 when her parents were released from their separate imprisonments.\n\nAfter her release, Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte led a more peaceful life at Sceaux, still surrounded though by her little court of wits and poets.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> On 27 December 1718, before their exile, she and her husband had purchased an unfinished house in Paris on the rue de Bourbon (now rue de Lille) from her sister [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Bourbon]]. It was originally designed by the architect [[Robert de Cotte]], but they had hired a new architect, [[Armand-Claude Mollet]], to enlarge and redesign it. It was completed before their return from exile and became known as the [[H\u00f4tel du Maine]] (destroyed 1838).<ref>Robert Neuman (1994) ''Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France'', Chicago/London: The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|9780226574370}}, pp. 142\u2013143; Alexandre Gady (2008) ''Les H\u00f4tels particuliers de Paris du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Belle \u00c9poque'', Paris: Parigramme, {{ISBN|9782840962137}}, pp. 313. The site of the former H\u00f4tel du Maine is at 84\u201386 rue de Lille.</ref>\n\nAt the time of her imprisonment, she was trying to arrange the marriage of her eldest son, [[Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes|Louis Auguste de Bourbon]], heir to the Maine's fortune, to his cousin [[Charlotte Agla\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans|Charlotte Agla\u00e9, Mademoiselle de Valois]]. The rivalry between the Maines and Charlotte Agla\u00e9's father, the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], was well known, and it was hoped that the wedding would heal old wounds. A marriage did not occur, however, as the young ''Mademoiselle de Valois'' refused her cousin, much to the annoyance of the proud Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte. Madame du Maine was not happy when she found out that Charlotte Agla\u00e9 had considered the hand of another cousin, [[Charles de Bourbon (1700\u20131760)|Charles de Bourbon]], the son of ''[[Louis III, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Monsieur le Duc]]'', Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's brother, and ''[[Louise Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon|Madame la Duchesse]]'', Maine's sister.\n\n==Widowhood==\n\nAfter their release from imprisonment in 1720, the Maines seemed to have reconciled and led a more compatible life rather than being hostile to each other. In May 1736, the duke died at the age of sixty-six.<ref>G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Pi\u00e9pape, ''La duchesse du Maine'' (1910).</ref> Louis XV allowed Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte to keep her apartments at Versailles next to those of her daughter. These apartments overlooked the Orang\u00e9rie. Both her sons also had apartments at court, but both preferred to stay in the country hunting. Madame du Maine tried on more than one occasion to arrange an advantageous marriage for her daughter. The first was to one Monsieur de Guise, but that marriage never materialised. Later, she tried to convince the widower [[Jacques I, Prince of Monaco]], who was often at Versailles, to wed again. Despite the lure of a large dowry, both men considered Mademoiselle du Maine to be very unattractive. Unwed, she died in 1743. She was buried at the \u00c9glise at Sceaux. At the time of her death, her library was numbered at having some 3000 books. \n\n[[File:L'h\u00f4tel biron 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The H\u00f4tel du Maine, present day [[H\u00f4tel Biron]] where Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte lived as a widow]]\n\nIn 1736 Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte received the medieval [[Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond (Saint-Amand-Montrond)|Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond]], which she allowed to be dismantled for its stone and the slate and lead in its roof.<ref>[https://montjoye.net/chateau-de-montrond-de-saint-amand-montrond \"Ch\u00e2teau de Montrond de Saint-Amand-Montrond\"], montjoye.net.</ref> In 1737, she leased the [[H\u00f4tel Peyrenc-de-Moras]] (today the [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]) in Paris from the widow of [[Abraham Peyrenc de Moras]].

The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus as well as the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007. The remix was also featured on the [[Now That's What I Call Music! 9 (U.S. series)|9th installment]] of the U.S. version of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series.\n\n==Track listing==\n* '''UK CD1''' and '''Cassette'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pnk-Get-The-Party-Started/release/2138820|title=P!nk -

Instead, it feels more like the kinds of grooves that were coming out in the early Nineties, when alt-rock was influencing the discos as well as the college charts. In fact, it sounds a little like [[Apollo Smile]] who had an album out back in \u201891 or so. \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like [[Deee-Lite]]\u2019s \u201c[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\u201d had that won over many fans.

The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus as well as the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007. The remix was also featured on the [[Now That's What I Call Music! 9 (U.S. series)|9th installment]] of the U.S. version of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series.\n\n==Track listing==\n* '''UK CD1''' and '''Cassette'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pnk-Get-The-Party-Started/release/2138820|title=P!nk -
