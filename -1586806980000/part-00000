The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] on 13 March 2006. The aircraft's general designer is Mr. Zhang Hong (\u5f20\u5f18), and development had reportedly been completed alongside [[Yakovlev]] OKB of Russia. The L-15 is a direct rival to the [[Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation]] (GAIC) [[JL-9]]/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle in competition for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]]'s (PLAAF) next-generation advanced trainer aircraft program.\n\nHAIG unveiled a full-scale [[mock-up]] of its L-15 advanced [[lead-in fighter trainer]] (LIFT) in the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition|2004 Zhuhai Airshow]]. The two-seat, two-engine L-15 featured the latest advanced technologies developed by China, such as the digital quadruple [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW), [[glass cockpit]] (two multi-color head down displays for both the front and rear cockpit, and an additional head-up display for the front cockpit) and [[hands-on-throttle-and-stick]] (HOTAS) [[flight control]]. The look-down field of view for the front cockpit is 18\u00b0, and 6\u00b0 for the rear cockpit, exceeding the US requirement.  The aerodynamic performance of the aircraft is enhanced by its large [[leading edge extensions]] (LEX) design, which gives a maximum [[angle of attack]] of 30\u00b0. This is very useful when trying to simulate the maneuvers of advanced [[Fourth generation jet fighter|fourth-generation fighters]] such as [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]], [[JF-17 Thunder|JF-17]] and [[Shenyang J-11|J-11]], as well as for newest fifth generation fighter like J-20 and J-31. JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle trainer jet from Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) is a direct competitor of the L-15. L-15 has a wide range of more advanced features comparing JL-9, but JL-9 is significant cheaper and its development and production would be fully indigenous, while early batches of L-15 still rely on AI-222 series turbofan engine from Ukraine before an indigenous update is ready. <ref name=\"L15-JL9-trainer-jet-competition\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |title=L15 and JL9 trainer jet competition, China PLAAF |website=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=29 Aug 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128065129/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |archivedate=2011-11-28 }}</ref> \n\nWith the L-15, student pilots will be able to complete mission [[flight training]] and advanced [[combat training]], as well as complete all basic jet flight training courses. The aircraft also has six (four under-wing and two wingtip) [[Aircraft pylon|pylons]] to carry various [[Air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] and [[air-to-ground]] weapons. If necessary, it can serve in the lightweight attack role with minor modifications, carrying up to 3.5 tons of armament.<ref name=\"sina.cn\">{{cite web|author=sina_mobile |url=https://mil.sina.cn/sd/2018-08-27/detail-ihifuvph8146505.d.html |title=\u6211\u519b\u6559\u7ec310\u7814\u53d1\u8def\u9014\u4e00\u6ce2\u4e09\u6298 \u66fe\u9669\u56e0\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0b\u9a6c_\u624b\u673a\u65b0\u6d6a\u7f51 |website=Mil.sina.cn |date=2018-08-27 |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nEach of the first two units (#01 & #02) are powered by two [[Ivchenko-Progress]] [[ZMKB (Progress) DV-2|DV-2]] engines, which do not have [[Afterburner|afterburners]], and these two aircraft thus do not have the capability to reach supersonic speed. The third unit (#03) is powered by a pair of an improved version of the DV-2, the DV-2F, that has afterburners, so that it can attain supersonic speed.  The subsequent production units are expected to be powered by Ukraine's Ivchenko-Progress [[AI-222K-25F]] [[turbofan]] engines with afterburners once a co-production license is obtained by the 608 Institute. Ivchenko-Progress was able to increase the thrust of the AI-222-28F (thrust 4500&nbsp;kg afterburning) and AI-222-30F (5000&nbsp;kg thrust afterburning) engines. The latter two engines may be used to equip the L-15 or other Chinese aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.airforceworld.com/a/20150624/144.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702181419/http://en.airforceworld.com/a/20150624/144.html |archive-date=2015-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Meanwhile, according to various Chinese reports, L-15s with updated Guizhou FWS-17 engines had already undergone test flights.<ref name=\"sina.cn\"/> \n\nIn June 2013, the AJT condition of L-15 finalized the design and would be operated by PLAAF with a formal name JL-10.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cjdby.net/junbeidongtai/2013-06-12/military-4229.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620105329/http://www.cjdby.net/junbeidongtai/2013-06-12/military-4229.html |archive-date=2013-06-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On July 1, 2013, the first batch of JL-10 began delivery to the PLAAF.

The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] on 13 March 2006. The aircraft's general designer is Mr. Zhang Hong (\u5f20\u5f18), and development had reportedly been completed alongside [[Yakovlev]] OKB of Russia. The L-15 is a direct rival to the [[Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation]] (GAIC) [[JL-9]]/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle in competition for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]]'s (PLAAF) next-generation advanced trainer aircraft program.\n\nHAIG unveiled a full-scale [[mock-up]] of its L-15 advanced [[lead-in fighter trainer]] (LIFT) in the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition|2004 Zhuhai Airshow]]. The two-seat, two-engine L-15 featured the latest advanced technologies developed by China, such as the digital quadruple [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW), [[glass cockpit]] (two multi-color head down displays for both the front and rear cockpit, and an additional head-up display for the front cockpit) and [[hands-on-throttle-and-stick]] (HOTAS) [[flight control]]. The look-down field of view for the front cockpit is 18\u00b0, and 6\u00b0 for the rear cockpit, exceeding the US requirement.  The aerodynamic performance of the aircraft is enhanced by its large [[leading edge extensions]] (LEX) design, which gives a maximum [[angle of attack]] of 30\u00b0. This is very useful when trying to simulate the maneuvers of advanced [[Fourth generation jet fighter|fourth-generation fighters]] such as [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]], [[JF-17 Thunder|JF-17]] and [[Shenyang J-11|J-11]], as well as for newest fifth generation fighter like J-20 and J-31. JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle trainer jet from Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) is a direct competitor of the L-15. L-15 has a wide range of more advanced features comparing JL-9, but JL-9 is significant cheaper and its development and production would be fully indigenous, while early batches of L-15 still rely on AI-222 series turbofan engine from Ukraine before an indigenous update is ready. <ref name=\"L15-JL9-trainer-jet-competition\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |title=L15 and JL9 trainer jet competition, China PLAAF |website=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=29 Aug 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128065129/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/english/L15-advanced-trainer-jet-china.html |archivedate=2011-11-28 }}</ref> \n\nWith the L-15, student pilots will be able to complete mission [[flight training]] and advanced [[combat training]], as well as complete all basic jet flight training courses. The aircraft also has six (four under-wing and two wingtip) [[Aircraft pylon|pylons]] to carry various [[Air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] and [[air-to-ground]] weapons. If necessary, it can serve in the lightweight attack role with minor modifications, carrying up to 3.5 tons of armament.<ref name=\"sina.cn\">{{cite web|author=sina_mobile |url=https://mil.sina.cn/sd/2018-08-27/detail-ihifuvph8146505.d.html |title=\u6211\u519b\u6559\u7ec310\u7814\u53d1\u8def\u9014\u4e00\u6ce2\u4e09\u6298 \u66fe\u9669\u56e0\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0b\u9a6c_\u624b\u673a\u65b0\u6d6a\u7f51 |website=Mil.sina.cn |date=2018-08-27 |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nEach of the first two units (#01 & #02) are powered by two [[Ivchenko-Progress]] [[ZMKB (Progress) DV-2|DV-2]] engines, which do not have [[Afterburner|afterburners]], and these two aircraft thus do not have the capability to reach supersonic speed. The third unit (#03) is powered by a pair of an improved version of the DV-2, the DV-2F, that has afterburners, so that it can attain supersonic speed.  The subsequent production units are expected to be powered by Ukraine's Ivchenko-Progress [[AI-222K-25F]] [[turbofan]] engines with afterburners once a co-production license is obtained by the 608 Institute. Ivchenko-Progress was able to increase the thrust of the AI-222-28F (thrust 4500&nbsp;kg afterburning) and AI-222-30F (5000&nbsp;kg thrust afterburning) engines. The latter two engines may be used to equip the L-15 or other Chinese aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.airforceworld.com/a/20150624/144.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702181419/http://en.airforceworld.com/a/20150624/144.html |archive-date=2015-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Meanwhile, according to various Chinese reports, L-15s with updated Guizhou FWS-17 engines had already undergone test flights.<ref name=\"sina.cn\"/> \n\nIn June 2013, the AJT condition of L-15 finalized the design and would be operated by PLAAF with a formal name JL-10.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cjdby.net/junbeidongtai/2013-06-12/military-4229.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620105329/http://www.cjdby.net/junbeidongtai/2013-06-12/military-4229.html |archive-date=2013-06-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On July 1, 2013, the first batch of JL-10 began delivery to the PLAAF.
