Cardiac contractility modulation therapy aims to treat heart failure through a medium- to long-term treatment, over the course of weeks and months.\n\nAccording to large implanting clinics, after the implantation wound is healed, the lifestyle of a patient is not restricted by the implanted device.<ref name=\"Pacemaker life2\">[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/PreventionTreatmentofArrhythmia/Living-With-Your-Pacemaker_UCM_305290_Article.jsp Tips by the American Heart Associuation \"Living With Your Pacemaker\"]</ref> Leisure, travel (by car, train, ship or plane), hobbies and sex life will not be restricted. The patient may perceive an improved capacity for these activities and overall enhanced performance and exercise capacity in response to the actual therapy.\n\n==Contraindications ==\nIn the past, the most important contraindication in Cardiac contractility modulation treatment was permanent and long-standing persistent [[atrial fibrillation]]. The signal application in current Cardiac contractility modulation devices was timed and triggered according to the electrical activity of the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]]. In atrial fibrillation, electrical activity in the atrium is severely disturbed and is therefore not a reliable basis for the triggering of Cardiac contractility modulation signals.

This increases the muscle contraction strength. Additionally, within minutes, cell [[metabolism]] and [[gene expression]], which are typically abnormal in heart failure, improve towards their normal state.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> This beneficial effect occurs initially only in the area adjacent to the electrodes, but with time also spreads to remote areas of the cardiac muscle.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> Cardiac contractility modulation therefore restores the structure and function of damaged cells back towards their normal state.

Some preliminary single-center studies have been reported though.<ref name=\"Kuschyk 20152\" /> Kuschyk et al. evaluated the long-term efficacy and survival of patients with Cardiac contractility modulation.<ref name=\"Kuschyk 20152\" /> Their analysis included 81 patients with a disease severity of NYHA class II, III or IV and a mean follow-up of around 3 years.

Mortality rates were significantly lower than predicted at year 1, and lower than predicted but not statistically significant at year 3.\n\n==== General ====\n\nHeart failure is a chronic disease that usually progresses gradually.<ref name=\"ESC Guideline2\" /> The rate of progression and the degree of symptoms of the disease varies between different patients. Cardiac contractility modulation therapy aims to treat heart failure through a medium- to long-term treatment, over the course of weeks and months.\n\nAccording to large implanting clinics, after the implantation wound is healed, the lifestyle of a patient is not restricted by the implanted device.<ref name=\"Pacemaker life2\">[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/PreventionTreatmentofArrhythmia/Living-With-Your-Pacemaker_UCM_305290_Article.jsp Tips by the American Heart Associuation \"Living With Your Pacemaker\"]</ref> Leisure, travel (by car, train, ship or plane), hobbies and sex life will not be restricted. The patient may perceive an improved capacity for these activities and overall enhanced performance and exercise capacity in response to the actual therapy.\n\n==Contraindications ==\nIn the past, the most important contraindication in Cardiac contractility modulation treatment was permanent and long-standing persistent [[atrial fibrillation]]. The signal application in current Cardiac contractility modulation devices was timed and triggered according to the electrical activity of the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]]. In atrial fibrillation, electrical activity in the atrium is severely disturbed and is therefore not a reliable basis for the triggering of Cardiac contractility modulation signals. This also applies to other diseases involving severe disturbance in electrical atrial sensing.<ref name=\"R\u00f6ger 2014a2\">{{cite journal|last=R\u00f6ger|first=S.|display-authors=etal|date=Apr 2014|title=Cardiac contractility modulation: first experience in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and permanent atrial fibrillation|journal=Europace|volume=16|issue=8|pages=1205\u20139|doi=10.1093/europace/euu050|pmid=24706089}}<!--| accessdate = Oct 14, 2014--></ref> Requests have been raised in scientific literature for an improved Cardiac contractility modulation algorithm which would allow the therapy to be delivered independently from any atrial signal.

CRT treatment should be considered in lieu of Cardiac contractility modulation in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a QRS duration of over 120 ms, or when the QRS duration is greater than 150 ms and independent of LBBB.<ref name=\"Abraham 20134\" /><ref name=\"ESC Guideline2\" />\n\nAs with conventional pacemaker therapy, the Cardiac contractility modulation device cannot be implanted if the leads cannot be positioned appropriately in the heart. In cases where there is an [[artificial heart valve]] between the right atrium and ventricle (a mechanical prosthetic tricuspid valve), the valve function could be greatly affected by the ventricular leads. In some instances it may be impossible to guide the leads through the main veins in the upper half of the body to the heart due to [[venous thrombosis]], for example [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker#mode|VVI pacemakers]], in the case of 100% stimulation, are also contraindicated.<ref name=\"Abraham 20134\" />\n\n== Side effects ==\nThe most frequently encountered adverse events related to Cardiac contractility modulation therapy are lead fracture or lead dislodgement.<ref name=\"Kadish 20112\" /> Other reported complications include:\n* Infection and bleeding at the IPG implantation site\n* Accumulation of fluid in the pericardium ([[pericardial effusion]])<ref name=\"Borggrefe 20082\" />\n\nThese side effects are similar to those that occur with other electrical stimulation therapies, such as pacemakers, CRT devices or ICD devices.<ref name=\"Pakarinen 20102\" /> Furthermore, recorded complications did not differ between patients with activated or deactivated Cardiac contractility modulation devices.<ref name=\"Burkhoff 20112\" />\n\nOverall, Cardiac contractility modulation treatment was demonstrated to have no negative impact on health markers.<ref name=\"Burkhoff 20112\" />\n\n=== Precautions ===\n\n[[File:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Metal detectors used for security screening]]\nSimilarly to patients with other electrical stimulation devices, patients with a Cardiac contractility modulation device must follow certain precautions arising from the device implantation and its function.\n* Electromagnetic fields: Strong electromagnetic fields can interfere with the function of the device.

This increases the muscle contraction strength. Additionally, within minutes, cell [[metabolism]] and [[gene expression]], which are typically abnormal in heart failure, improve towards their normal state.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> This beneficial effect occurs initially only in the area adjacent to the electrodes, but with time also spreads to remote areas of the cardiac muscle.<ref name=\"Lyon 20132\" /> Cardiac contractility modulation therefore restores the structure and function of damaged cells back towards their normal state.

Some genetic material will stay in the cells and transform them. The [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] efficiency is lower than in [[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|agrobacterial]] mediated transformation, which is also common in plant genetic engineering, but particle bombardment is especially suitable for plastid transformation.\n\nIn order to persist and be stably maintained in the cell, a plasmid DNA molecule must contain an [[origin of replication]], which allows it to be replicated in the cell independently of the [[chromosome]]. Because transformation usually produces a mixture of rare transformed cells and abundant non-transformed cells, a method is needed to identify the cells that have acquired the plasmid. Plasmids used in transformation experiments will usually also contain a gene giving resistance to an antibiotic (or, more recently developed resistance against a herbicide) that the intended recipient strain of bacteria is sensitive to. Selection for cells able to grow on media containing this antibiotic can then select the cells that have acquired the plasmid by transformation, as cells lacking the plasmid will be unable to grow.\n\n==Biological containment and agricultural coexistence==\nGenetically modified plants must be safe for the environment and suitable for [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence with conventional and organic crops]]. Towards such safety, a major hurdle is posed by the potential [[outcrossing]] of the [[transgene]] via pollen movement. Plastid transformation, which yields transplastomic plants in which the pollen does not contain the transgene, not only increases biosafety, but also facilitates the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic agriculture.

The major advantage of this technology is that in many plant species [[plastid]] DNA is not transmitted through pollen, which prevents [[gene flow]] from the genetically modified plant to other plants.\n\n==Transformation technology==\nThe most common method to transform plastids is particle bombardment: Small gold or tungsten particles are coated with DNA and shot into young plant cells or plant embryos. Some genetic material will stay in the cells and transform them. The [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] efficiency is lower than in [[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|agrobacterial]] mediated transformation, which is also common in plant genetic engineering, but particle bombardment is especially suitable for plastid transformation.\n\nIn order to persist and be stably maintained in the cell, a plasmid DNA molecule must contain an [[origin of replication]], which allows it to be replicated in the cell independently of the [[chromosome]]. Because transformation usually produces a mixture of rare transformed cells and abundant non-transformed cells, a method is needed to identify the cells that have acquired the plasmid. Plasmids used in transformation experiments will usually also contain a gene giving resistance to an antibiotic (or, more recently developed resistance against a herbicide) that the intended recipient strain of bacteria is sensitive to. Selection for cells able to grow on media containing this antibiotic can then select the cells that have acquired the plasmid by transformation, as cells lacking the plasmid will be unable to grow.\n\n==Biological containment and agricultural coexistence==\nGenetically modified plants must be safe for the environment and suitable for [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence with conventional and organic crops]].

Regarded as one of the most important fiction writers in North Korean history, Han also ran the entire North Korean literary scene as the head of the [[Korean Writers' Union]] and [[Ministry of Education (North Korea)|minister of education]].\n\nDuring his career, Han survived a number of purges that were caused by [[Workers' Party of North Korea#Factionalism|factional strife]] within the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]], to become a member of  the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]]. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered some of the earliest known contributions to the [[cult of personality of Kim Il-sung]]. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best-known work, the [[anti-American]] novella ''[[Jackals (Han Sorya novel)|Jackals]]'', however, has been invoked in the 2000s.\n\n==Early life==\nHan was born on 3 August 1900 in [[Hamhung]], in the north of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. His father was a county magistrate. He graduated from middle school in 1919 and attended [[Nippon University]] in Tokyo from 1921 to 1924,{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} studying [[sociology]].{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=20}} He emigrated to [[Manchuria]] in 1925 but returned to [[Seoul]] in the south in 1927.{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} In 1944, he returned to his native Hamhung.

The organization had been founded in 1925 during his emigration in Manchuria,{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} and after the liberation it would have been the only left-leaning Korean literary organization. For this reason, [[Kim Il-sung]] would promote writers like Han who had belonged to it and exaggerated their achievements.<ref name=\"Gabroussenko2013\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Han did briefly associate himself with leftist ideas, but later, during the [[Pacific War]], he became a [[Chinilpa|pro-Japanese]] writer.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} He also joined pro-Japanese writers' organizations.{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} After the war, he reinvented his image abruptly. Besides the Japanese, he also distanced himself from the [[Domestic faction]] of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea|Workers' Party]],{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} though some scholars like {{Interlanguage link multi|Wada Haruki|ja|3=\u548c\u7530\u6625\u6a39}} explicitly include him in the faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=70}} From this position, he played an important role in opposing the [[Soviet Koreans faction]] during the late 1950s.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}}\n\n===Emigration===\nAfter the liberation of Korea, writers were faced with the task of establishing a [[national literature]]. Some, like {{Interlanguage link multi|Kim Namch'\u014fn|ko|3=\uae40\ub0a8\ucc9c}}, sought to gather a wide range of both moderate and progressive writers to write \"democratic national literature\".{{sfn|Ryu|2013|p=182}} A writers' association called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Headquarters for the Construction of Korean Literature|ko|3=\uc870\uc120\ubb38\ud559\uac74\uc124\ubcf8\ubd80}} ([[McCune\u2013Reischauer|MR]]: ''Chos\u014fn Munhak K\u014fns\u014fl Ponbu'') was founded in 1945 immediately after the liberation by Kim and others. Han, however, disagreed with this approach, accusing it of forgetting class questions.{{sfn|Ryu|2013|p=195}} Since the 1930s, Han had already had bad personal relations with these writers originally hailing from the south of Korea. The struggle for dominance in the North Korean literary bureaucracy made them worse.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=35}} In retaliation Han, together with other writers including Yi Kiy\u014fng, founded the [[Korean Proletarian Literature Alliance]] ([[McCune\u2013Reischauer|MR]]: ''Chos\u014fn P'\u016drollet'aria Munhak Tongmaeng'').{{sfn|Ryu|2013|p=195}} For Han's purposes his fellow writer Yi Kiy\u014fng, though respected, was not particularly interested in political matters and thus posed no threat to Han's own aspirations.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} The two organizations became merged to form {{Interlanguage link multi|Korean Writers' Alliance|ko|3=\uc870\uc120\ubb38\ud559\ub3d9\ub9f9}} ([[McCune\u2013Reischauer|MR]]: ''Chos\u014fn munhakka tongmaeng'') in late 1945.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=182}} Disapproving of this, Han moved to the north of the country, and was one of the first writers to do so.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n===In North Korea===\nSoon after starting his career in North Korea, Han had become one of the earliest and most enthusiastic admirers of [[Kim Il-sung]],{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} with whom he had met in February 1946.{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=37}} Han acted in his writing as a \"curator of the personality cult\" [[Personality cult of Kim Il-sung|of Kim Il-sung]]{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=148}} and was, in effect, the official [[hagiographer]] of Kim.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=43}} Indeed, the cult's beginnings can be traced as far back as 1946{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=171}} when Han coined the appellation \"our Sun\" to describe Kim.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=223}} Han was also the first to employ the phrase \"Sun of the Nation\" in referring to Kim.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=44}} Considered proteg\u00e9 of Kim,<ref name=\"Jospehson2009\">{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Paul R.|title=Would Trotsky Wear a Bluetooth? : Technological Utopianism under Socialism, 1917\u20131989|location=Baltimore|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2009|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10375804|via=ProQuest ebrary|page=153|isbn=978-0-8018-9841-9}}</ref> Han survived the purge of the Domestic faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} The [[August faction]] criticized Han for his close ties with Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=97}}\n\nWriters opposing Han, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Yim Hwa|ko|3=\uc784\ud654}}, were purged because of their connections with South Korean communists.

His name began to be disconnected from his work, which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Gabroussenko2013\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThough Han Sorya's name has been since been all but forgotten in official North Korean accounts, his influence on contemporary North Korean literature has been significant.<ref name=Yearn1995>{{cite journal|title=World literature in review: Korea|last=Choi|first=Yearn Hong|journal=World Literature Today|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/9512211137/world-literature-review-korea|date=1995|volume=69|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nLiterately, Han's style of writing has been described as experimental in his employment of various narrative structures.<ref name=\"Lee2007\"/> [[Andrei Lankov]] considers Han mediocre as a writer{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} and assess his rivals Kim Namch'\u014fn and {{Interlanguage link multi|Yi T'ae-jun|ko|3=\uc774\ud0dc\uc900}} \"marginally more gifted\", however considering North Korean literature of the period \"boring and highly politicized propaganda\" across the board.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=35}} Lankov describes Han \"unscrupulous\" as an opportunist and careerist.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} The literary style and ideologies of Han and some of his adversaries are very similar, and Han's prevailing is due to factional strife. Some aspects of the struggles are baseless, too, as some works by Han include rather sympathetic depictions of Japanese soldiers, while it was many of his rivals who were purged because of their \"pro-Japanese\" tendencies. Thus, Lankov concludes, the struggle within the literary establishment can be attributed to conflicting personal ambitions more than anything else.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=35}}\n\nYearn Hong Choi assess that \"Han is not a typical North Korean writer\" but an extremely political one in his attempt at pleasing Kim Il-sung.<ref name=Yearn1995/> B. R. Myers contrasts Han's legacy with that of North Korean poet [[Cho Ki-chon]]. While in Han's works Kim Il-sung embodies traditional Korean virtues of innocence and naivety having \"mastered Marxism\u2013Leninism with his heart, not his brain\",{{sfn|Myers|2011|p=36}} in Cho's he exemplifies particular traits of the rather early cult of personality built upon Soviet [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and bloc conformity.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=28, 40n36}} The style of Han based on [[Korean ethnic nationalism]] ultimately established itself as the standard of propaganda over Cho's.{{sfn|Myers|2011|p=36}} According to Myers, Han is not a writer of fiction in the official literary doctrine of [[socialist realism]] at all, but \"his own man, not a socialist realist\". Yearn Hong Choi disagrees, and points to Han's one-time praise of the Soviets and Kim Il-sung as well as his employment of propaganda in praise of a \"utopian\" North Korea as proof of him being a socialist realist. According to Yearn, Myers simply has a different idea of what socialist realism is from North Korean writers.<ref name=Yearn1995/>\n\nAn exception to Han's forgotten legacy in North Korea exists. The multi-part film ''[[Nation and Destiny]]'' not only features him, but allows Han to be a hero of the film.

'''Han Py\u014fngdo''';{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} 3 August 1900 \u2013 6 April 1976) was a Korean writer, literary administrator and politician who spent much of his career in [[North Korea]]. Regarded as one of the most important fiction writers in North Korean history, Han also ran the entire North Korean literary scene as the head of the [[Korean Writers' Union]] and [[Minister of education (North Korea)|minister of education]].\n\nDuring his career, Han survived a number of purges that were caused by [[Workers' Party of North Korea#Factionalism|factional strife]] within the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]], to become a member of  the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]]. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered some of the earliest known contributions to the [[cult of personality of Kim Il-sung]]. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best-known work, the [[anti-American]] novella ''[[Jackals (Han Sorya novel)|Jackals]]'', however, has been invoked in the 2000s.\n\n==Early life==\nHan was born on 3 August 1900 in [[Hamhung]], in the north of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. His father was a county magistrate. He graduated from middle school in 1919 and attended [[Nippon University]] in Tokyo from 1921 to 1924,{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} studying [[sociology]].{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=20}} He emigrated to [[Manchuria]] in 1925 but returned to [[Seoul]] in the south in 1927.{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} In 1944, he returned to his native Hamhung. After the [[liberation of Korea]] he settled in [[Pyongyang]].{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=190}}\n\n==Career==\nHan was one of the most prominent fiction writers in the history of [[North Korean literature]].<ref name=\"Yearn1995\"/> During his career, Han earned the official title of \"the greatest writer of modern Korean literature\", which he shared with [[Yi Kiy\u014fng]], and was called a \"living classic\".{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} Han's career was at its height from 1955 to 1957.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} Han, along with [[Kim Tu-bong]], shaped North Korea's cultural policies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Keith|chapter=Music across the DMZ|editor-first1=John Morgan|editor-last1=O'Connell|editor-first2=Salwa El-Shawan|editor-last2=Castelo-Branco|title=Music and Conflict|location=Champaign|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=September 2010|via=ProQuest ebrary|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10603913|page=82|isbn=978-0-252-09025-7}}</ref>\n\n===In pre-liberation Korea===\nBefore the liberation of Korea, Han was an insignificant author.

The organization had been founded in 1925 during his emigration in Manchuria,{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} and after the liberation it would have been the only left-leaning Korean literary organization. For this reason, [[Kim Il-sung]] would promote writers like Han who had belonged to it and exaggerated their achievements.<ref name=\"Gabroussenko2013\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Han did briefly associate himself with leftist ideas, but later, during the [[Pacific War]], he became a [[Chinilpa|pro-Japanese]] writer.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} He also joined pro-Japanese writers' organizations.{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=189}} After the war, he reinvented his image abruptly. Besides the Japanese, he also distanced himself from the [[Domestic faction]] of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea|Workers' Party]],{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} though some scholars like {{Interlanguage link multi|Wada Haruki|ja|3=\u548c\u7530\u6625\u6a39}} explicitly include him in the faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=70}} From this position, he played an important role in opposing the [[Soviet Koreans faction]] during the late 1950s.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}}\n\n===Emigration===\nAfter the liberation of Korea, writers were faced with the task of establishing a [[national literature]]. Some, like {{Interlanguage link multi|Kim Namch'\u014fn|ko|3=\uae40\ub0a8\ucc9c}}, sought to gather a wide range of both moderate and progressive writers to write \"democratic national literature\".{{sfn|Ryu|2013|p=182}} A writers' association called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Headquarters for the Construction of Korean Literature|ko|3=\uc870\uc120\ubb38\ud559\uac74\uc124\ubcf8\ubd80}} ([[McCune\u2013Reischauer|MR]]: ''Chos\u014fn Munhak K\u014fns\u014fl Ponbu'') was founded in 1945 immediately after the liberation by Kim and others. Han, however, disagreed with this approach, accusing it of forgetting class questions.{{sfn|Ryu|2013|p=195}} Since the 1930s, Han had already had bad personal relations with these writers originally hailing from the south of Korea. The struggle for dominance in the North Korean literary bureaucracy made them worse.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=35}} In retaliation Han, together with other writers including Yi Kiy\u014fng, founded the [[Korean Proletarian Literature Alliance]] ([[McCune\u2013Reischauer|MR]]: ''Chos\u014fn P'\u016drollet'aria Munhak Tongmaeng'').{{sfn|Ryu|2013|p=195}} For Han's purposes his fellow writer Yi Kiy\u014fng, though respected, was not particularly interested in political matters and thus posed no threat to Han's own aspirations.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} The two organizations became merged to form {{Interlanguage link multi|Korean Writers' Alliance|ko|3=\uc870\uc120\ubb38\ud559\ub3d9\ub9f9}} ([[McCune\u2013Reischauer|MR]]: ''Chos\u014fn munhakka tongmaeng'') in late 1945.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=182}} Disapproving of this, Han moved to the north of the country, and was one of the first writers to do so.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n===In North Korea===\nSoon after starting his career in North Korea, Han had become one of the earliest and most enthusiastic admirers of [[Kim Il-sung]],{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} with whom he had met in February 1946.{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=37}} Han acted in his writing as a \"curator of the personality cult\" [[Personality cult of Kim Il-sung|of Kim Il-sung]]{{sfn|Myers|1994|p=148}} and was, in effect, the official [[hagiographer]] of Kim.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=43}} Indeed, the cult's beginnings can be traced as far back as 1946{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=171}} when Han coined the appellation \"our Sun\" to describe Kim.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=223}} Han was also the first to employ the phrase \"Sun of the Nation\" in referring to Kim.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=44}} Considered proteg\u00e9 of Kim,<ref name=\"Jospehson2009\">{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Paul R.|title=Would Trotsky Wear a Bluetooth? : Technological Utopianism under Socialism, 1917\u20131989|location=Baltimore|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2009|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10375804|via=ProQuest ebrary|page=153|isbn=978-0-8018-9841-9}}</ref> Han survived the purge of the Domestic faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} The [[August faction]] criticized Han for his close ties with Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=97}}\n\nWriters opposing Han, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Yim Hwa|ko|3=\uc784\ud654}}, were purged because of their connections with South Korean communists. When the Domestic faction, including its leader [[Pak Hon-yong]], were purged,{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} Han attacked their associates in the literary circles from 1953 onwards.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=35}} Later, between 1955 and 1957, Han attacked the Soviet Koreans faction,{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} accusing them of \"factional, splitting activity\"{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=37}} and \"not allow[ing] the party and the people to demonstrate their good feeling and love toward their leader\".{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=44}} It is possible that Han influenced Kim Il-sung to wage his campaign against the Soviet Koreans' faction specifically on the literary front, culminating in Kim's famous \"''[[Juche]]'' speech\" of 1955: [[On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work|''On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing ''Juche'' in Ideological Work'']].{{sfn|Lankov|2007|pp=39\u201340}} The speech credits Han for uncovering{{sfn|Myers|2006|pp=94\u201395}} \"serious ideological errors on the literary front\"<ref name=\"marx_Onel\">{{Cite web | title = On eliminating dogmatism and formalism and establishing Juche in ideological work | author = Kim Il-sung | work = Marxists Internet Archive | orig-year = 28 December 1955 | date = 2008| accessdate = 2 July 2015 | url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/kim-il-sung/1955/12/28.htm | others = Transcription: Victor Barraza, HTML Markup: Salil Sen}}</ref> and can be considered an expression of public support for Han.{{sfn|Myers|2006|p=111}} In editions after Han's purge in 1962, his name is omitted or replaced with the expression \"prominent proletarian writers\".{{sfn|Myers|2015|pp=231\u2013232, 236}}\n\n[[File:1952-10 1952\u5e7410\u67082\u65e5\u4e9a\u6d32\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5e73\u4f1a\u8bae\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ee3\u8868\u56e2\u957f\u4e0e\u671d\u9c9c\u4ee3\u8868\u97e9\u96ea\u91ce.png|thumb|Han Sorya meeting Americans in 1952.

His name began to be disconnected from his work, which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Gabroussenko2013\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThough Han Sorya's name has been since been all but forgotten in official North Korean accounts, his influence on contemporary North Korean literature has been significant.<ref name=Yearn1995>{{cite journal|title=World literature in review: Korea|last=Choi|first=Yearn Hong|journal=World Literature Today|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/9512211137/world-literature-review-korea|date=1995|volume=69|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nLiterately, Han's style of writing has been described as experimental in his employment of various narrative structures.<ref name=\"Lee2007\"/> [[Andrei Lankov]] considers Han mediocre as a writer{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} and assess his rivals Kim Namch'\u014fn and {{Interlanguage link multi|Yi T'ae-jun|ko|3=\uc774\ud0dc\uc900}} \"marginally more gifted\", however considering North Korean literature of the period \"boring and highly politicized propaganda\" across the board.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=35}} Lankov describes Han \"unscrupulous\" as an opportunist and careerist.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=34}} The literary style and ideologies of Han and some of his adversaries are very similar, and Han's prevailing is due to factional strife. Some aspects of the struggles are baseless, too, as some works by Han include rather sympathetic depictions of Japanese soldiers, while it was many of his rivals who were purged because of their \"pro-Japanese\" tendencies. Thus, Lankov concludes, the struggle within the literary establishment can be attributed to conflicting personal ambitions more than anything else.{{sfn|Lankov|2007|p=35}}\n\nYearn Hong Choi assess that \"Han is not a typical North Korean writer\" but an extremely political one in his attempt at pleasing Kim Il-sung.<ref name=Yearn1995/> B. R. Myers contrasts Han's legacy with that of North Korean poet [[Cho Ki-chon]]. While in Han's works Kim Il-sung embodies traditional Korean virtues of innocence and naivety having \"mastered Marxism\u2013Leninism with his heart, not his brain\",{{sfn|Myers|2011|p=36}} in Cho's he exemplifies particular traits of the rather early cult of personality built upon Soviet [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and bloc conformity.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=28, 40n36}} The style of Han based on [[Korean ethnic nationalism]] ultimately established itself as the standard of propaganda over Cho's.{{sfn|Myers|2011|p=36}} According to Myers, Han is not a writer of fiction in the official literary doctrine of [[socialist realism]] at all, but \"his own man, not a socialist realist\". Yearn Hong Choi disagrees, and points to Han's one-time praise of the Soviets and Kim Il-sung as well as his employment of propaganda in praise of a \"utopian\" North Korea as proof of him being a socialist realist. According to Yearn, Myers simply has a different idea of what socialist realism is from North Korean writers.<ref name=Yearn1995/>\n\nAn exception to Han's forgotten legacy in North Korea exists. The multi-part film ''[[Nation and Destiny]]'' not only features him, but allows Han to be a hero of the film.

After the war, Georgia Tech hired him as their assistant basketball coach.\n\nIn 1943, he enlisted in the US Navy and was assigned as a physical education instructor at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], he spent the 1943\u201344 and 1944-45 seasons as a Georgia Tech assistant to Dwayne Keith in addition to his US Navy duties, after the war ended he was hired in the same capacity by Georgia Tech.\n\nIn February 1947, Vanderbilt was pummeled by the Kentucky Wildcats in the SEC Tournament 98-29, the Commodores Athletic Director (and football coach) Red Sanders decided to upgrade the basketball program by hiring a full-time coach and offering scholarships. His search led him to Bob Polk (another candidate who was interviewed for the job was the future legend, [[John Wooden]], who had led his [[Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball|Indiana State Sycamores]] to a conference title and an invitation from the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].\n\n===Vanderbilt===\nPolk coached the [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt Commodores]] from 1947 to 1961.

Polk quickly turned the Tigers into a power, leading them from the depths of the [[Southland Conference]] to the title in four seasons; he was named the Southland Conference Coach-of-the-Year in 1967 following a record of 16-6. His 1967-68 team was even better, the Tigers racked up a record of 23-7 and advanced to the [[1968 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|NCAA College Division Tournament]], where the Tigers finished 3rd overall.

However, he was unable to duplicate the earlier success he enjoyed at Vanderbilt.  Polk served as the President of the National Association of Basketball Coaches during the 197475 season.\n\n==UAB==\nIn April 1977, Polk resigned from Rice and accepted a position as the assistant athletic director at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB). He retired from that position in 1977. He hired [[Gene Bartow]] to build the men's basketball program.\n\n==Death==\nPolk died of heart disease at age 71 in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], on March 18, 1986.

His first coaching job was at his high school ''alma mater'' [[Tell City#Schools|Tell City High]], in [[Tell City, Indiana]].\n\n==Early life==\nPolk was born in [[Tell City, Indiana]] and began to play basketball in the 4th grade. After high school, Polk attended the [[University of Evansville]] from 1936 to 1939. He worked part-time at several jobs, including sweeping out the University President's office, running a movie projector, bank teller and working in a tomato canning factory.<ref name=\"evpl\">{{cite web|url=http://local.evpl.org/views/viewimage.asp?ID=675617|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203131758/http://local.evpl.org/views/viewimage.asp?ID=675617 |archive-date=2014-02-03 |url-status=dead|title=View Image|accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref> to help pay his college expenses. He was a guard on the basketball team under long-time Purple Aces' coach [[Bill Slyker]] from 1935-36 to 1938\u201339.\n\nIn Polk's sophomore season (1935\u201336), Evansille finished 11\u20137. This would mark the best season for the Purple Aces during Polk's college playing career.\n\n==High school coaching==\nPolk began his career in coaching by accepting a teaching and coaching job at his alma mater Tell City High School, Tell City, Indiana. Polk had graduated only 8&nbsp;years earlier (1931) after leading the Marksmen to their fifth [[Indiana High School Athletic Association|IHSAA]] Sectional title.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pastbb.homestead.com/files/history330.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128232422/http://pastbb.homestead.com/files/history330.htm |archive-date=2018-01-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Polk assisted Ivan Hollen, who also began that season, replacing future Purdue Boilermakers' Head Coach [[Ray Eddy]].\n\n==College coaching==\nAfter a four-year tenure, Polk joined the U.S. Navy, he was assigned as a physical education instructor at Georgia Tech in the Navy's [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 Program]], he also assisted Georgia Tech head coach Dwayne Keith during the 1943\u201344 and 1944-45 seasons. After the war, Georgia Tech hired him as their assistant basketball coach.\n\nIn 1943, he enlisted in the US Navy and was assigned as a physical education instructor at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], he spent the 1943\u201344 and 1944-45 seasons as an Georgia Tech assistant to Dwayne Keith in addition to his US Navy duties, after the war ended he was hired in the same capacity by Georgia Tech.\n\nIn February 1947, Vanderbilt was pummeled by the Kentucky Wildcats in the SEC Tournament 98-29, the Commodores Athletic Director (and football coach) Red Sanders decided to upgrade the basketball program by hiring a full-time coach and offering scholarships. His search led him to Bob Polk (another candidate who was interviewed for the job was the future legend, [[John Wooden]], who had led his [[Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball|Indiana State Sycamores]] to a conference title and an invitation from the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].\n\n===Vanderbilt===\nPolk coached the [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt Commodores]] from 1947 to 1961.  There, he won the 1951\u201352 SEC Tournament. Polk's Vanderbilt teams recorded one losing season in 13 seasons and finished 2nd in the SEC on four occasions. His 1954-55, 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357 squads all finished the season in the Top 20 [[Associated Press]] poll.<ref name=\"sports-reference4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/vanderbilt/|title=Vanderbilt Commodores Index &#124; College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|publisher=sports-reference.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\nIn his 13 seasons as Vanderbilt coach, Polk mined the rich Southwestern Indiana talent fields to build a consistent winner; players such as SEC First Team members Dave Kardokus (1951) and SEC Second team members Billy Joe Adcock (1948\u201350), Al Weiss (1951), Bob Dudley Smith (1951) and Dave Kardokus. Heart problems forced Polk to resign after the 1960-61 season. When he left, Polk was the leader in wins for the Commodores (197-106 .650) and had won the 1951&nbsp;SEC Tourney.\n\nSix of his players were drafted by NBA teams; \n* Bill Depp \u2013 1961 3rd round Boston  \n* Jim Henry \u2013 1959 6th round  Minneapolis   \n* Al Rochelle \u2013 1957 5th round St. Louis    \n* Dan Finch \u2013 1954 Minneapolis   \n* George Kelley \u2013 1951 Indianapolis   \n* Billy Joe Adcock \u2013 1950 Fort Wayne \n<ref name=\"basketball-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/draft.cgi?college=vandy|title=NBA Draft Picks From Vanderbilt University &#124; Basketball-Reference.com|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===Trinity===\nPolk recovered quickly from his heart attack and accepted the head coaching and athletic director position at [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] in San Antonio, Texas. Polk quickly turned the Tigers into a power, leading them from the depths of the [[Southland Conference]] to the title in four seasons; he was named the Southland Conference Coach-of-the-Year in 1967 following a record of 16-6. His 1967-68 team was even better, the Tigers racked up a record of 23-7 and advanced to the [[1968 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|NCAA College Division Tournament]], where the Tigers finished 3rd overall. He was also the NCAA National Coach-of-the-Year for the College Division (today's NCAA Div II) in 1968. In his four years at Trinity, Polk compiled a 70-28 record, a Southland title and a National 3rd-place finish. He was chiefly responsible for the Tigers moving to NCAA Division I classification, however, today they are a NCAA Div III school.\n\n===Saint Louis===\nFollowing his successful tenure at Trinity, Polk accepted the head coaching job at [[Saint Louis University]]; he was the 16th head coach in Billikens history and quickly turned around the program.<ref>http://local.evpl.org/views/viewimage.asp?ID=675688</ref>  In his 2nd season, he led them to a share of the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] championship and was named the Conference's Coach of the Year.<ref name=\"evpl2\">{{cite web|url=http://local.evpl.org/views/viewimage.asp?ID=675698|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221134130/http://local.evpl.org/views/viewimage.asp?ID=675698 |archive-date=2014-02-21 |url-status=dead|title=View Image|accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>  While at St Louis, he sent two players to the NBA; Harry \u201cTree\u201d Rogers  and Robin Jones.<ref name=\"basketball-reference2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/draft.cgi?college=stlouis|title=NBA Draft Picks From Saint Louis University &#124; Basketball-Reference.com|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===Rice===\nIn a return to bigger conference, he accepted the head coaching position at Rice after five seasons at Saint Louis.  However, he was unable to duplicate the earlier success he enjoyed at Vanderbilt.  Polk served as the President of the National Association of Basketball Coaches during the 197475 season.\n\n==UAB==\nIn April 1977, Polk resigned from Rice and accepted a position as the assistant athletic director at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB). He retired from that position in 1977. He hired [[Gene Bartow]] to build the men's basketball program.\n\n==Death==\nPolk died of heart disease at age 71 in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], on March 18, 1986. He is buried in [[Tell City, Indiana]]. He was memorialized by his induction into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\n==Head coaching record==\n{{CBB Yearly Record Start|\n|type=coach\n|postseason\n|poll=no\n|conference\n}}\n{{CBB

He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old. He followed his older brothers [[Anders Eriksson (Karlstad curler)|Anders Eriksson]] and [[Markus_Eriksson_(curler)|Marcus Eriksson]] into the sport, but his skill level advanced more rapidly.<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> He was part of a curling team at age seven,<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> debuting in Sweden's Elite Series at the age of thirteen.<ref>https://www.nwt.se/2009/12/30/framtiden-osaker-for-lag-eriksson/</ref> He won his first Swedish Men's Curling Championship title in his junior career and has gone on to win six more championship titles since then.<ref>[[Swedish Men%27s Curling Championship]]</ref>. As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nEriksson made his first run a junior world championship title when he was sixteen at [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]]. He skipped his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and Nils Karlsson, to a silver medal, losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium. He also joined Team Lindstr\u00f6m from [[Lit, Sweden|Lit]], formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]]. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltz.se/artikel/lag-lindstrom-bast-i-norska-elitserien |title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Lag Lindstr\u00f6m b\u00e4st i norden|publisher=L\u00e4nstidningen \u00d6stersund |date= 12 October 2008|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> With this team, Eriksson made his second run for the gold medal at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]], but reached only a fourth-place finish, losing in the bronze-medal game to the US team that was again skipped by Plys. Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team with Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m at the Swedish Junior Curling Championship undefeated until the finals. Team Eriksson came in second place to the team from Sundyberg skipped by his future teammate [[Rasmus Wran\u00e5]], who qualified for the World Junior Curling Championships instead.<ref>https://www.cuponline.se/teamView.aspx?cupid=1570&id=17105</ref>\n\n=== Seniors I (2009-2014): Team Lindstr\u00f6m/Eriksson and Team Edin ===\n\nShortly after joining Team Lit in 2008, Eriksson played simultaneously with two teams. His official team during this period was Team Lit, which he skipped for most of this period and was alternatively known as Team Lindstr\u00f6m and eventually Team Eriksson.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 5 April 2020|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref> From 2009 to the end of 2013, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, Team Lit became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2012/10/04/topplag-i-samma-bo |title=Topplag i samma bo|publisher=Nya Wermlands Tidningen |date= 4 October 2012|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship Gold medal (2013) and two bronze (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played all games except three because Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played in the second position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won a bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2013) European Masters (2013) as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Eliter Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and his first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, Edin and Eriksson's team immediately saw the potential for the new team and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed, after finishing in the top ten on the Order of Merit and prize money mist in their first two seasons as a new team, Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured reached the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been ranked in the top 10 since they formed on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit, ranking first in 2017 and first on the money list in 2017 and 2018. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In 2016, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup), securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/?auth=true</ref> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

for the [[Niklas Edin]] rink. He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old. He followed his older brothers [[Anders Eriksson (Karlstad curler)|Anders Eriksson]] and [[Markus_Eriksson_(curler)|Marcus Eriksson]] into the sport, but his skill level advanced more rapidly.<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> He was part of a curling team at age seven,<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/</ref> debuting in Sweden's Elite Series at the age of thirteen.<ref>https://www.nwt.se/2009/12/30/framtiden-osaker-for-lag-eriksson/</ref> He won his first Swedish Men's Curling Championship title in his junior career and has gone on to win six more championship titles since then.<ref>[[Swedish Men%27s Curling Championship]]</ref>. As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nEriksson made his first run a junior world championship title when he was sixteen at [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]]. He skipped his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and Nils Karlsson, to a silver medal, losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium. He also joined Team Lindstr\u00f6m from [[Lit, Sweden|Lit]], formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]]. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltz.se/artikel/lag-lindstrom-bast-i-norska-elitserien |title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Lag Lindstr\u00f6m b\u00e4st i norden|publisher=L\u00e4nstidningen \u00d6stersund |date= 12 October 2008|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> With this team, Eriksson made his second run for the gold medal at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]], but reached only a fourth-place finish, losing in the bronze-medal game to the US team that was again skipped by Plys. Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team with Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m at the Swedish Junior Curling Championship undefeated until the finals. Team Eriksson came in second place to the team from Sundyberg skipped by his future teammate [[Rasmus Wran\u00e5]], who qualified for the World Junior Curling Championships instead.<ref>https://www.cuponline.se/teamView.aspx?cupid=1570&id=17105</ref>\n\n=== Seniors I (2009-2014): Team Lindstr\u00f6m/Eriksson and Team Edin ===\n\nShortly after joining Team Lit in 2008, Eriksson played simultaneously with two teams. His official team during this period was Team Lit, which he skipped for most of this period and was alternatively known as Team Lindstr\u00f6m and eventually Team Eriksson.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 5 April 2020|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>. From 2009 to the end of 2013, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, Team Lit became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2012/10/04/topplag-i-samma-bo |title=Topplag i samma bo|publisher=Nya Wermlands Tidningen |date= 4 October 2012|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship Gold medal (2013) and two bronze (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played all games except three because Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played in the second position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won a bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2013) European Masters (2013) as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Eliter Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and his first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, Edin and Eriksson's team immediately saw the potential for the new team and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed, after finishing in the top ten on the Order of Merit and prize money mist in their first two seasons as a new team, Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured reached the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been ranked in the top 10 since they formed on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit, ranking first in 2017 and first on the money list in 2017 and 2018. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In 2016, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup), securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref>https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/?auth=true</ref> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
