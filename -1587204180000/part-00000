It was written by Rowland along with [[Scott Storch]] and [[Poo Bear|Jason \"Poo Bear\" Boyd]] for her second studio album, ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' (2007), while production was helmed by Storch and Boyd. An [[up-tempo]] party record that displays elements of [[funk]] and [[go-go]], \"Work\" is composed in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[D-sharp minor|D#minor]]. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman who affirms to her man that actions speak louder than words and that she is not a woman who is easy to get to. \"Work\" was acclaimed by music critics who highlighted the pulsating beat, suggestive lyrics, and the fast and stuttered style in which Rowland sings.\n\nIntended to be released as ''Ms. Kelly''{{'}}s [[lead single]] at one time or another, \"Work\" record was eventually released as the album's second single during the first quarter of 2008 in most international music markets, excluding Canada and North America where \"[[Ghetto (Kelly Rowland song)|Ghetto]]\" was issued instead. Prominently pushed by a [[bhangra (music)|bhangra]]-infused [[dance pop]] remix by British DJ duo [[Freemasons (band)|Freemasons]], which, according to Rowland, gave it \"new life\", \"Work\" enjoyed major commercial success and eventually became Rowland's best-charting solo single in years, reaching the top-ten in Australia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. \n\nThe [[music video]] for \"Work\" was filmed in [[Los Angeles]] and directed by [[Philip Andelman]]. Influenced by the work of American minimalist [[Dan Flavin]], it shows Rowland and her dancers posed in [[silhouette]] and shot against backdrops of vivid color and beam lighting that is used to create a [[kaleidoscope]] effects. \"Work\" was part of Rowland's set list for her [[Ms. Kelly Tour]]. Its commercial success prompted Rowland to record additional music for the ''Ms. Kelly'' album of which a more uptempo [[deluxe edition]] reissue was released in 2008 and would introduce a temporary shift to [[dance music]] in Rowland's sound in the late 2000s.\n\n==Writing and recording==\n\"Work\" was written by Rowland, [[Scott Storch]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Poo Bear|Jason \"Poo Bear\" Boyd]].<ref name=\"liner notes\"/> The song is one out of two tracks which the trio crafted for ''Ms. Kelly'' and was among eight new tracks that Rowland recorded near completion in 2006 for the revamped version of ''My Story'', the album's actual version.<ref name=\"mcp\">{{cite web|title=Interview |work=MiddleChild Promotions |url=http://middlechildpromotions.com/interviews/kelly.htm |accessdate=2008-03-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023091212/http://www.middlechildpromotions.com/interviews/kelly.htm |archivedate=2007-10-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Conceived during a studio session at the [[The Hit Factory]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], Rowland, Storch and Boyd began to work on melodic ideas for the song over an instrumental track by Storch.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> With most of its lyrics being written after returning from a night out in the city, composing for \"Work\" was eventually finished in \"like twenty minutes,\" according to Rowland.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|title=DJ B interviews Kelly Rowland |work=BBC/1Xtra |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/rnb/features/kelly.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225103557/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/rnb/features/kelly.shtml |archivedate=2007-12-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The team returned the next day for vocal recording.<ref name=\"ilm\">{{cite web|author=I Like Music|date=2008-02-01|title=Kelly Rowland chats to ''I Like Music''|work=I Like Music|url=http://www.ilikemusic.co.uk/interviews/Kelly_Rowland_interview_2008-4489/1|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> Vocal production was helmed by Rowland and Boyd, while engineering was overseen by Conrad Golding and Rommel Nino Villanueva with assistance by Vadim Chislov.<ref name=\"liner notes\"/> [[Audio mixing|Mixing]] was handled Jason Goldstein; Christian Baker served as his assistant.<ref name=\"liner notes\"/> Storch and Boyd received producer and co-producer credits, respectively.<ref name=\"liner notes\"/>\n\nInitially titled \"Put It in\",<ref name=\"ilm\"/> Rowland has described the song as \"a party record, a record that'd make you get up and dance.\"<ref name=\"ilm\"/> An [[up-tempo]] composition featuring [[funk]] production and [[go-go]] elements,<ref name=\"sheet\"/> it is composed in [[E-flat minor|E{{music|flat}} minor]] and moves at a moderate [[tempo]] of 104 [[beats per minute]].

It was written by Rowland along with [[Scott Storch]] and [[Poo Bear|Jason \"Poo Bear\" Boyd]] for her second studio album, ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' (2007), while production was helmed by Storch and Boyd. An [[up-tempo]] party record that displays elements of [[funk]] and [[go-go]], \"Work\" is composed in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[D-sharp minor|D#minor]]. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman who affirms to her man that actions speak louder than words and that she is not a woman who is easy to get to. \"Work\" was acclaimed by music critics who highlighted the pulsating beat, suggestive lyrics, and the fast and stuttered style in which Rowland sings.\n\nIntended to be released as ''Ms. Kelly''{{'}}s [[lead single]] at one time or another, \"Work\" record was eventually released as the album's second single during the first quarter of 2008 in most international music markets, excluding Canada and North America where \"[[Ghetto (Kelly Rowland song)|Ghetto]]\" was issued instead. Prominently pushed by a [[bhangra (music)|bhangra]]-infused [[dance pop]] remix by British DJ duo [[Freemasons (band)|Freemasons]], which, according to Rowland, gave it \"new life\", \"Work\" enjoyed major commercial success and eventually became Rowland's best-charting solo single in years, reaching the top-ten in Australia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. \n\nThe [[music video]] for \"Work\" was filmed in [[Los Angeles]] and directed by [[Philip Andelman]].

The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1962 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|1962]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champion is [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], which won its third title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 tournament]] defending the championship title.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 19 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> (as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]) have won six times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Championship winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], and [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], with three titles each; [[Czech Republic men's national volleyball team|Czech Republic]] (as [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]) with two titles; [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as  [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 World Championship]] was co-hosted by Italy and Bulgaria.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the [[Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://worldgrandprix.2017.fivb.com/en/finals-3/competition Competition introduction].</ref>.\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nThe history of the World Championship clearly demonstrates how volleyball was originally dominated by European nations.\n\nThe first two editions were won by the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. In 1956, twice runner-up [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]] took the gold. There followed two more consecutive wins for the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in both cases over [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]. The Czechs won a gold medal in the 1966 edition.\n\nIn 1970, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]] prevailed over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]] for their first and only title. In 1974, the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] threatened to take the lead once more, but ended up being defeated by [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] at the final. Nevertheless, they would confirm their leadership by winning, for the third time, two editions in a row.\n\n1986 saw the first relevant confrontation between [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], the rising major force of the decade, and the traditional leader [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] after the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984. As would be the case two years later at the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympic Games]], the issue was settled in favour of the Americans led by [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]]. [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] completely dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning all the editions that took place in this decade (1990, 1994, 1998), led by such players as [[Lorenzo Bernardi]] and [[Andrea Giani]].\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] became the leading force in the sport, winning three consecutive editions (2002, 2006 and 2010), the first of which in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the same stage where the Brazilians had been runners-up in 1982. In 2014, [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], playing in home, defeated [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in 4 sets at the final achieving their second gold medal and preventing what would be a historical fourth title in a row.\n\nAs of 2014, 18 editions of the men's Volleyball World Championship have been played: 14 went to European teams, and four to [[Americas|American]] teams (three times to [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and once to [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]]).\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB

The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1962 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|1962]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champion is [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], which won its third title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 tournament]] defending the championship title.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 19 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> (as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]) have won six times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Championship winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], and [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], with three titles each; [[Czech Republic men's national volleyball team|Czech Republic]] (as [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]) with two titles; [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as  [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 World Championship]] was co-hosted by Italy and Bulgaria.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the [[Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://worldgrandprix.2017.fivb.com/en/finals-3/competition Competition introduction].</ref>.\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nThe history of the World Championship clearly demonstrates how volleyball was originally dominated by European nations.\n\nThe first two editions were won by the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. In 1956, twice runner-up [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]] took the gold. There followed two more consecutive wins for the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in both cases over [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]. The Czechs won a gold medal in the 1966 edition.\n\nIn 1970, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]] prevailed over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]] for their first and only title. In 1974, the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] threatened to take the lead once more, but ended up being defeated by [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] at the final. Nevertheless, they would confirm their leadership by winning, for the third time, two editions in a row.\n\n1986 saw the first relevant confrontation between [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], the rising major force of the decade, and the traditional leader [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] after the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984. As would be the case two years later at the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympic Games]], the issue was settled in favour of the Americans led by [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]]. [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] completely dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning all the editions that took place in this decade (1990, 1994, 1998), led by such players as [[Lorenzo Bernardi]] and [[Andrea Giani]].\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] became the leading force in the sport, winning three consecutive editions (2002, 2006 and 2010), the first of which in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the same stage where the Brazilians had been runners-up in 1982. In 2014, [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], playing in home, defeated [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in 4 sets at the final achieving their second gold medal and preventing what would be a historical fourth title in a row.\n\nAs of 2014, 18 editions of the men's Volleyball World Championship have been played: 14 went to European teams, and four to [[Americas|American]] teams (three times to [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and once to [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]]).\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB
