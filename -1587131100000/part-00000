On bars, she included her Tweddle release in combination with a half turn transfer (Ezhova). She fell on her toe-on Shaposhnikova (Maloney) and dismounted with a full-twisting double layout. Despite the fall, she scored a 14.350 and finished 8th on the event. A mistake and fall on beam scored an 11.800 and she finished 18th on the event.\n\n'''P&G Championships'''\n\nOn August 13 & 15, Dowell competed at the P&G Championships where she competed in the all-around for the first time since 2013. She finished in 11th with a 2-night score of 113.700, including a 15.150 on uneven bars. She was named to the Senior National Team and was invited to the 2015 Worlds Selection Camp in September.\n\n'''World Championships'''\n\nOn October 8, Dowell, alongside Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Madison Kocian, Maggie Nichols, Aly Raisman, and Mykayla Skinner, was once again chosen to represent the United States of America at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, in Glasgow. She competed floor, vault, and bars in team qualification. During her floor performance in qualifications her music did not play. She still competed a solid routine without music, and went along with the clapping from the audience. On floor, she performed a piked double front salto. This was the first time the skill had been performed at the World Championships, and thus it was named after her in the Code of Points. She performed a solid vault afterward.  She also competed on the uneven bars.  Dowell later became a world champion, winning gold with the team.\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\nIn early 2016, Brenna attended the U.S Olympic Team Summit, an event for potential U.S Olympic Team members to meet with the media and do promotional work. She attended with fellow 2015 World Championships gold medalists, [[Simone Biles]], [[Aly Raisman]]. [[Gabby Douglas]], [[Madison Kocian]], [[Maggie Nichols (gymnast)|Maggie Nichols]] and [[MyKayla Skinner]].\n\nIn April, Dowell was chosen to compete at the [[2016 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships]] in Everett, Washington. On day 1 of competition, Brenna had a clean competition, hitting all 4 of her events which helped team USA take the gold medal. She also took 4th place All-Around with a score of 58.850, making a strong case to earn one of the 5 spots on the 2016 U.S Olympic Team, coming back strong after having a bad experience at the 2015 World Championships, where she struggled with nerves despite earning a gold medal with team USA. Dowell, whilst having the 4th highest score at the Pacific Rim Championships, did not officially earn the 4th place spot due to the two per country rule. Officially, Shallon Olsen of Canada earned that spot, however it will be noted by the selection committee for the 2016 U.S Olympic team that she did indeed earn the fourth highest score behind U.S teammates, [[Aly Raisman]], [[Simone Biles]] and [[Laurie Hernandez]].\n\nDowell also qualified in second place to the Uneven Bars final, after displaying an impressive set on night 1 of competition. Also, after [[Simone Biles]], was withdrawn from event finals, Dowell also earned a spot in the Floor Exercise final. In event finals, unfortunately, Dowell fell on a release move in the Uneven Bars final, incurring a deduction and placing her 5th with a score of 14.000. However, she came back strong and earned a silver medal in Floor Exercise finals with a score of 14.825 behind reigning Olympic Floor Exercise champion and U.S teammate, [[Aly Raisman]].\n\nAt the 2016 P&G championships, Dowell was named to the National Team and earned a berth to the 2016 Olympic Trials in San Jose, CA. Despite solid efforts, she didn't make the main or alternate teams\n\n=== '''2017''' ===\nIn 2017, Dowell continued her gymnastics career at the University of Oklahoma for her Sophomore season. \n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{USAG|143542|Brenna Dowell}}\n* {{FIG|bio=33809|lic=17849|name=Brenna Dowell}}\n\n{{NavigationWorldChampionsArtisticGymnasticsWomenTC|2015}}\n{{PanAmChampionsWAGTeam|2010}}\n{{Footer NCAA Gymnastics Vault Champions (Women)}}\n{{Footer NCAA Gymnastics Floor Exercise Champions (Women)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dowell, Brenna}}\n[[Category:1996 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American female artistic gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Kansas City, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Oklahoma Sooners women's gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]]\n[[Category:Originators of elements in artistic gymnastics]]\n[[Category:U.S. women's national team gymnasts]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Infobox gymnast\n| name            = Brenna Dowell\n| image           = http://www.intlgymnast.com/image/dowell_brenna_3.jpg\n| image_size      = \n| caption         = {{Dowell at the [2014 American Cup]}}\n| full_name       = \n| nickname        = \n| country         = {{USA}}\n| formercountry   = \n| birth_date      = {{birth date and age|mf=yes|1996|3|04}}\n| birth_place     = [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n| residence       = [[Norman, Oklahoma]]\n| death_date      = \n| death_place     = \n| height          = 5 ft 3 in\n| weight          = \n| website         = \n| discipline      = WAG\n| level           = Senior International Elite\n| natlteam        = 2011\u20132017 ([[United States women's national gymnastics team|USA]])\n| club            = [[Great American Gymnastics Express]] (GAGE)\n| gym             = \n| collegeteam     = [[Oklahoma Sooners women's gymnastics|Oklahoma Sooners]]<br />(2015\u201319)\n| headcoach       = Al Fong\n| assistcoach     = \n| formercoach     = \n| choreographer   = \n| music           = \n| eponymousskills = The Dowell (FX) Piked Double Front salto\n| retired         = April 25, 2019\n| show-medals     = yes\n| medaltemplates  = \n{{MedalSport | Women's gymnastics }}\n{{MedalCountry | {{USA}} }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] }}\n{{MedalGold | [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 Glasgow]] | Team }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[Pacific Rim Championships]] }}\n{{MedalGold | [[2016 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships|2016 Everett]] | Team }}\n{{MedalSilver | 2016 Everett | Floor Exercise }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[American Cup (gymnastics)|American Cup]] }}\n{{MedalSilver | 2014 Greensboro | All-Around }}\n{{MedalCountry | [[Oklahoma Sooners women's gymnastics|Oklahoma Sooners]] }}\n{{MedalCompetition | [[NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championships|NCAA Championships]] }}\n{{MedalGold|[[2017 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship|2017 St. Louis]]|Team}}\n{{MedalGold|[[2018 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship|2018 St. Louis]]|Vault}}\n{{MedalGold|[[2019 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship|2019 Fort Worth]]|Team}}\n{{MedalGold|[[2019 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship|2019 Fort Worth]]|Floor Exercise}}\n{{MedalSilver|[[2015 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship|2015 Fort Worth]]|Floor Exercise}}\n{{MedalSilver|[[2018 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship|2018 St. Louis]]|Team}}\n{{MedalBronze|[[2015 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship|2015 Fort Worth]]|Team}}\n}}\n\n'''Brenna Dowell''' (born March 4, 1996) is a former American [[artistic gymnastics|artistic gymnast]].

She scored season highs of 9.925 (VT), 10.00 (UB) and 9.975 (FX). She helped her team come in third place at Super Six Finals.<ref>http://www.soonersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209702401</ref> She was Floor champion at the Big-12 Championships and was later crowned Big-12 Newcomer of the Year.<ref>http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=106193&SPID=13156&DB_LANG=C&ATCLID=209975841&DB_OEM_ID=10410</ref>\n\nOn June 9, 2015, it was announced that Dowell would be deferring for the 2015\u201316 season to compete elite again.<ref>http://www.soonersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210111694&DB_OEM_ID=31000</ref>\n\n'''Secret U.S. Classic'''\n\nOn July 25, Dowell competed at the Secret U.S. Classic where she only competed on uneven bars and balance beam. On bars, she included her Tweddle release in combination with a half turn transfer (Ezhova). She fell on her toe-on Shaposhnikova (Maloney) and dismounted with a full-twisting double layout. Despite the fall, she scored a 14.350 and finished 8th on the event. A mistake and fall on beam scored an 11.800 and she finished 18th on the event.\n\n'''P&G Championships'''\n\nOn August 13 & 15, Dowell competed at the P&G Championships where she competed in the all-around for the first time since 2013. She finished in 11th with a 2-night score of 113.700, including a 15.150 on uneven bars. She was named to the Senior National Team and was invited to the 2015 Worlds Selection Camp in September.\n\n'''World Championships'''\n\nOn October 8, Dowell, alongside Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Madison Kocian, Maggie Nichols, Aly Raisman, and Mykayla Skinner, was once again chosen to represent the United States of America at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, in Glasgow. She competed floor, vault, and bars in team qualification. During her floor performance in qualifications her music did not play. She still competed a solid routine without music, and went along with the clapping from the audience. On floor, she performed a piked double front salto. This was the first time the skill had been performed at the World Championships, and thus it was named after her in the Code of Points. She performed a solid vault afterward.  She also competed on the uneven bars.  Dowell later became a world champion, winning gold with the team.\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\nIn early 2016, Brenna attended the U.S Olympic Team Summit, an event for potential U.S Olympic Team members to meet with the media and do promotional work. She attended with fellow 2015 World Championships gold medalists, [[Simone Biles]], [[Aly Raisman]]. [[Gabby Douglas]], [[Madison Kocian]], [[Maggie Nichols (gymnast)|Maggie Nichols]] and [[MyKayla Skinner]].\n\nIn April, Dowell was chosen to compete at the [[2016 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships]] in Everett, Washington. On day 1 of competition, Brenna had a clean competition, hitting all 4 of her events which helped team USA take the gold medal. She also took 4th place All-Around with a score of 58.850, making a strong case to earn one of the 5 spots on the 2016 U.S Olympic Team, coming back strong after having a bad experience at the 2015 World Championships, where she struggled with nerves despite earning a gold medal with team USA. Dowell, whilst having the 4th highest score at the Pacific Rim Championships, did not officially earn the 4th place spot due to the two per country rule. Officially, Shallon Olsen of Canada earned that spot, however it will be noted by the selection committee for the 2016 U.S Olympic team that she did indeed earn the fourth highest score behind U.S teammates, [[Aly Raisman]], [[Simone Biles]] and [[Laurie Hernandez]].\n\nDowell also qualified in second place to the Uneven Bars final, after displaying an impressive set on night 1 of competition. Also, after [[Simone Biles]], was withdrawn from event finals, Dowell also earned a spot in the Floor Exercise final. In event finals, unfortunately, Dowell fell on a release move in the Uneven Bars final, incurring a deduction and placing her 5th with a score of 14.000. However, she came back strong and earned a silver medal in Floor Exercise finals with a score of 14.825 behind reigning Olympic Floor Exercise champion and U.S teammate, [[Aly Raisman]].\n\nAt the 2016 P&G championships, Dowell was named to the National Team and earned a berth to the 2016 Olympic Trials in San Jose, CA. Despite solid efforts, she didn't make the main or alternate teams\n\n=== '''2017''' ===\nIn 2017, Dowell continued her gymnastics career at the University of Oklahoma for her Sophomore season. \n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{USAG|143542|Brenna Dowell}}\n* {{FIG|bio=33809|lic=17849|name=Brenna Dowell}}\n\n{{NavigationWorldChampionsArtisticGymnasticsWomenTC|2015}}\n{{PanAmChampionsWAGTeam|2010}}\n{{Footer NCAA Gymnastics Vault Champions (Women)}}\n{{Footer NCAA Gymnastics Floor Exercise Champions (Women)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dowell, Brenna}}\n[[Category:1996 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American female artistic gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Kansas City, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Oklahoma Sooners women's gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]]\n[[Category:Originators of elements in artistic gymnastics]]\n[[Category:U.S. women's national team gymnasts]]\n", "name_user": "Victor Schmidt", "label": "safe", "comment": "It's not possible for legal reasons to insert images hosted elsewhere on the web", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenna_Dowell"}

Some people may view Christian R&B as a subgenre of [[gospel music]], or a cross-genre under both gospel and R&B.\n\n== Origin and musical style ==\n[[Gospel music]] is one of the roots or influences of R&B music.<ref>Handyside, Christopher.

Yet some modern musicians mix R&B elements with gospel music elements.\n\nR&B originated between the 1940s and 1950s,<ref>Handyside, Christopher. ''A History of American Music: Soul and R&B''. Chicago: Heinemann Library, 2006. Print.</ref> and Christian R&B followed close behind. Christian rhythm and blues have the same musical characteristics heard in regular or secular R&B music, with the only major difference between the two being the lyrics. Some Christians who perform R&B may not explicitly mention God, Jesus Christ, or other overtly religious terms, but their lyrics still fit within the Christian moral standards, or may be ethically neutral.{{cn|date=February 2016}}\n\nA few early gospel R&B musicians can be found as far back as the 1950s. One R&B vocal group, for example, known as [[the Orioles]], sang \"gospel-styled reworkings of songs that had been popular country, blues, or R&B songs.\"<ref>Handyside, Christopher. ''A History of American Music: Soul and R&B'' (p. 8). Chicago: Heinemann Library, 2006. Print</ref> In 1953, the Orioles recorded a gospel song called \"Crying in the Chapel\"; yet the band was considered to be R&B.\n\nA strong influence on the merging of gospel and R&B came from [[Sam Cooke]]. He started out as the lead singer for the gospel group [[Soul Stirrers]], but had always loved blues and jazz.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The History of Gospel Music |last=Woog |first=Adam |date=2014 |publisher=Lucent Books |location=Farmington Hills, MI |page=87}}</ref> He would incorporate elements from these two musical styles into his gospel recordings. Even though he was making a nice living, he wanted to venture into secular music. In 1956, for fear he would upset his fans, bandmates, and his record label, he released his first R&B single (called \"Lovable\") under the assumed name 'Dale Cooke'. Because his voice is distinctive, people were not fooled by the name Dale Cooke.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\t\n\nSoon, other singers followed Cooke's footsteps, crossing over from gospel to R&B/soul and merging the two.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The History of Gospel Music |last=Woog |first=Adam |date=2014 |publisher=Lucent Books |location=Farmington Hills, MI}}</ref> [[Ray Charles]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[James Brown]] are other important figures who combined gospel and R&B.\n\nIn the early age of R&B, the musicality distinguishing gospel from R&B was blurred.
