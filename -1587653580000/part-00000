Starring [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Gene Wilder]], the film was written by Brooks, [[Andrew Bergman]], [[Richard Pryor]], Norman Steinberg and [[Alan Uger]], and was based on Bergman's story and draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |title=Director and Leading Actors |publisher=Getback.com |archive-date=October 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004054717/http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] and is ranked No. 6 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]'' list.\n\nBrooks appears in three supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane, a [[Yiddish]]-speaking Native American chief and \"a director\" in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]] and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]] and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.\n\nThe film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American frontier|American West]], with the hero being a [[African Americans|black]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', to the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German army]] of [[World War II]].\n\nIn 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through [[quicksand]]. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, the conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr (named after [[Hedy Lamarr]]) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (named after [[Le Petomane]]) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting Taggart earlier. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.\n\nAfter an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself as a hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the \"Waco Kid,\" to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then he beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Sht\u00fcpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Upon Mongo's release, he vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr's connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad work site and discover from Charlie, Bart's best friend, that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Just as Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, Jim outshoots the thugs, forcing Taggart to retreat to Lamarr. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Nazis, and [[Methodism|Methodists]].\n\nEast of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"[[New York State Thruway|Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway]]\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \"a shitload of dimes\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are booby-trapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.\n\nThe resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs literally breaks the [[fourth wall]] as the fight spills onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to \"drive me off this picture\". He ducks into [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], which is playing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work in Rock Ridge is done (and he's bored). Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to \"nowhere special\". The two friends ride off into the sunset\u2014in a chauffeured [[limousine]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|1=\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Sheriff Bart\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Jim, \"The Waco Kid\"\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Taggart\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Hedley Lamarr\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Lili von Sht\u00fcpp, \"The Teutonic Titwillow\"\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Gov.

It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named \"Reb Jordan\". Other cast members included Millie Slavin and [[Noble Willingham]]. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.\n\nCBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by [[Gerrit Graham]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] and was written by [[Michael Elias]] and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eustis later created and executive produced the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Head of the Class]]'' (1986\u20131991).\n\nInterviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said ''Black Bart'' \"was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on ''[[Barney Miller]]'' by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain.\"\n\nIn 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told ''Entertainment Tonight'', \"CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air ''Blazing Saddles'', and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make ''Blazing Saddles'' into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing ''Blazing Saddles'' stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in a show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to ''Blazing Saddles''. By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled.\"\n\nMel Brooks addressed the existence of the ''Black Bart'' series in 2005: \"My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another ''Blazing Saddles'', and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. [[Oy gevalt]]! Well, management changed and they never did ''Blazing Saddles 2'', and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day.\"\n\nThe pilot episode of ''Black Bart'' was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.<ref>{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}</ref>\n\n===Possible stage production===\nIn September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of ''Blazing Saddles'' in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/21/stupidly-politically-correct-society-death-comedy-warns-veteran/ |title='Stupidly politically correct society is the death of comedy', warns veteran comedian Mel Brooks |last=Sabur |first=Rozina |date=September 21, 2017 |website=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=September 22, 2017 |quote=The director said he hopes he is able to recreate Blazing Saddles on the stage in the future.}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe unreleased animated film ''[[Blazing Samurai]]'', starring [[Michael Cera]], [[Samuel L.

Le Petomane, a [[Yiddish]]-speaking Native American chief and \"a director\" in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]] and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]] and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.\n\nThe film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American frontier|American West]], with the hero being a [[African Americans|black]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', to the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German army]] of [[World War II]].\n\nIn 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through [[quicksand]]. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, the conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr (named after [[Hedy Lamarr]]) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (named after [[Le Petomane]]) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting Taggart earlier. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.\n\nAfter an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself as a hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the \"Waco Kid,\" to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then he beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Sht\u00fcpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Upon Mongo's release, he vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr's connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad work site and discover from Charlie, Bart's best friend, that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Just as Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, Jim outshoots the thugs, forcing Taggart to retreat to Lamarr. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Nazis, and [[Methodism|Methodists]].\n\nEast of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"[[New York State Thruway|Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway]]\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \"a shitload of dimes\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are booby-trapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.\n\nThe resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs literally breaks the [[fourth wall]] as the fight spills onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to \"drive me off this picture\". He ducks into [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], which is playing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work in Rock Ridge is done (and he's bored). Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to \"nowhere special\". The two friends ride off into the sunset\u2014in a chauffeured [[limousine]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|1=\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Sheriff Bart\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Jim, \"The Waco Kid\"\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Taggart\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Hedley Lamarr\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Lili von Sht\u00fcpp, \"The Teutonic Titwillow\"\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Gov.

It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named \"Reb Jordan\". Other cast members included Millie Slavin and [[Noble Willingham]]. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.\n\nCBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by [[Gerrit Graham]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] and was written by [[Michael Elias]] and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eustis later created and executive produced the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Head of the Class]]'' (1986\u20131991).\n\nInterviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said ''Black Bart'' \"was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on ''[[Barney Miller]]'' by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain.\"\n\nIn 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told ''Entertainment Tonight'', \"CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air ''Blazing Saddles'', and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make ''Blazing Saddles'' into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing ''Blazing Saddles'' stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in a show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to ''Blazing Saddles''. By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled.\"\n\nMel Brooks addressed the existence of the ''Black Bart'' series in 2005: \"My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another ''Blazing Saddles'', and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. [[Oy gevalt]]! Well, management changed and they never did ''Blazing Saddles 2'', and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day.\"\n\nThe pilot episode of ''Black Bart'' was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.<ref>{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}</ref>\n\n===Possible stage production===\nIn September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of ''Blazing Saddles'' in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/21/stupidly-politically-correct-society-death-comedy-warns-veteran/ |title='Stupidly politically correct society is the death of comedy', warns veteran comedian Mel Brooks |last=Sabur |first=Rozina |date=September 21, 2017 |website=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=September 22, 2017 |quote=The director said he hopes he is able to recreate Blazing Saddles on the stage in the future.}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe unreleased animated film ''[[Blazing Samurai]]'', starring [[Michael Cera]], [[Samuel L.

{"title_page": "Personality changes", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{essay|date=April 2012}}\n{{confusing|date=April 2012}}\n}}\n\nSome debates have pervaded the field of psychology since its genesis. Perhaps one of the most salient ones deals with the nature and development of personality. Personality psychology studies one's distinctive style of [[cognition]], behavior, and [[affect (psychology)|affect]]. However, this concept elicits discord among psychologists as some have insisted that it does not exist,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} while others struggle with issues of measurement.\n\n==Personality exists==\n[[Personality]], one's characteristic way of feeling, behaving and thinking, is often conceptualized as a person's standing on each [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five personality trait]] ([[extraversion]], [[neuroticism]], [[openness to experience]], [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]]). A person's personality profile is thus gauged from their standing on five broad concepts which predict, among other life outcomes, behavior and the quality of interpersonal relationships. Initially, it was believed that one's Big Five profile was static and dichotomous in that one was either at one extreme of each trait or another <ref>Funder, D. C. (2010). The Personality Puzzle (5th Ed.). NY: Norton</ref> \nFor example, people are typically categorized as [[introverted]] or [[extraverted]]. Personality was therefore assessed in terms of generalities or averages. In noticing the strong inconsistencies in how people behaved across situations, some psychologists dismissed personality as nonexistent.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThis school of thought attributes human behavior to environmental factors, relegating individual differences to situational artifacts and contesting the existence of individual predispositions. It was led by [[Situationism (psychology)|situationists]] like [[Walter Mischel]] (1968). Their contention held that personality was a fictitious concept.  For them, the discrepancies observed across one's behaviors were evidence that interindividual differences did not exist <ref>Mischel, W. (1968). Personality and assessment. Hoboken, NJ US: John Wiley & Sons Inc.</ref>\nSome aspects of the situationist perspective even suggest that all human beings are the same and that the differences we observe are simply illusory biproducts of the environment. \n          \nHowever, personologists soon integrated these inconsistencies into their conceptualization of [[personality]]. They modified the old, more monolithic construct by measuring how people differ across situations. Their new methods of personality assessment describe fluctuations in personality characteristics as consistent and predictable for each person based on the environment he is in and his predispositions. Some work suggests that people can espouse different levels of a personality dimension as the social situations and time of day change<ref name=\"Fleeson, William 2001\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = William | year = 2001 | title = Towards a structure- and process-integrated view of personality: Traits as density distributions of states | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 6| pages = 1011\u20131027 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.1011}}</ref>\n         \nTherefore, someone is not [[conscientious]] all the time, but can be conscientious at work and a lot less so when she is home. This work also suggests that intrapersonal variations on a [[trait theory|trait]] can be even larger than interpersonal variations. [[Extraversion]] varies more within a person than across individuals, for example. This work was based on individual self-ratings during the day across a long period of time. This allowed for researchers to assess moment-to-moment and day to day variations on personality attributes.<ref name=\"Fleeson, William 2001\"/>\nPersonologists now tend to agree that people's personalities are variegated and are not to be conceptualized through bipolar characterizations (e.g. extraversion vs introversion). Rather people oscillate between the two extremes of a trait. The pattern of this oscillation then constitutes personality.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==The impact of social roles==\nIn addition, social roles (e.g. employee) have been identified as a potential sources of [[personality]] change. Researchers have found strong correspondences between the demands of a [[social role]] and one's personality profile.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heller | first1 = D. | last2 = Perunovic | first2 = W.

Conversely, once he leaves that role and or takes on another which entails less conscientiousness, he will manifest a lower level standing on that trait. Longitudinal research demonstrates that people's personality trajectories can often be explained by the social roles they espoused and relinquished throughout their life stages. Thus social roles are often studied as fundamental predictors of personality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ozer | first1 = D.

For example, employees judged effective by their peers and superiors are often described as conscientious as well.  \n            \nPersonality also changes through life stages. This may be due to physiological changes associated with development but also experiences that impact behavior. Adolescence and young adulthood have been found to be prime periods of personality changes, especially in the domains of extraversion and agreeableness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Soto | first1 = C.

Mottus, Johnson and Geary (2012) found that instability engendered by aging does not necessarily affect one's standing within an age cohort. Hence, fluctuations and stability coexist so that one changes relative to one's former self but not relative to one's peers. Similarly, other psychologists found that [[Neuroticism]], [[Extraversion]] (only in men), and [[Openness to experience|Openness]] decreased with age after 70, but [[Conscientiousness]] and [[Agreeableness]] increased with age (the latter only in men). Moreover, they suggest that there is a decline on each trait after the age of 81.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = R.

Fleisher and Woehr (2008) suggest that that consistency across the Big Five is a construct that is fairly stable and contributes to the predictive validity of personality measures. Hence inconsistency is quantifiable much like a trait and constitutes an index of and enhances the fit of psychological models.\n\nTo accommodate the inconsistency demonstrated on personality tests, researchers developed the Frame Of Reference principle (FOR). According to this theory, people tend to think of their personality in terms of a specific social context when they are asked to rate them.  Whichever environment is cognitively salient at the time of the personality measurement will influence the respondent's ratings on a trait measure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reddock | first1 = C.

Accounting for the FOR principle aims at increasing the validity of personality measures.  This demonstrates that the predictive validity of personality measures which specify a social context is a lot higher than those measures which take a more generic approach.\n          \nThis point is substantiated by yet another body of work suggesting that FOR instructions moderated the link between extraversion and openness scores on manager ratings of employee performance <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hunthausen | first1 = J.

A ''rank-order change'' refers to a change in an individual's personality trait relative to other individuals; such changes do not occur very often.<ref name=\"Funder 258\">{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The Personality Puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W.

Biological transitions are stages like [[puberty]] or first childbirth. Social transitions might be changes in social roles like becoming a parent or working at a first job. These life transitions do not necessarily cause change, but they may be reasons for change. As humans we do not adapt just in our body, our mind also makes changes to itself in order to thrive in our environment.

[[Therapy]] involves the same type of introspection. The individual along with the therapist identifies the behaviors that are inappropriate, and then self-monitors in order to change them. Eventually the individual internalizes the behavior they want to attain, and that trait will generalize to other areas of the individual's life.\nPersonality change also occurs when individuals observe the actions of others. Individuals may mimic the behaviors of others and then internalize those behaviors. Once the individual internalizes those behaviors they are said to be a part of that person's personality.<ref name=\"Caspi and Roberts\" />\nIndividuals also receive feedback from other individuals or groups about their own personality.

Perhaps one of the most salient ones deals with the nature of personality. Personality psychology studies one's distinctive style of [[cognition]], behavior, and [[affect (psychology)|affect]]. However, this concept elicits discord among psychologists as some have insisted that it does not exist,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} while others struggle with issues of measurement.\n\n==Personality exists==\n[[Personality]], one's characteristic way of feeling, behaving and thinking, is often conceptualized as a person's standing on each [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five personality trait]] ([[extraversion]], [[neuroticism]], [[openness to experience]], [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]]). A person's personality profile is thus gauged from their standing on five broad concepts which predict, among other life outcomes, behavior and the quality of interpersonal relationships. Initially, it was believed that one's Big Five profile was static and dichotomous in that one was either at one extreme of each trait or another <ref>Funder, D. C. (2010). The Personality Puzzle (5th Ed.). NY: Norton</ref> \nFor example, people are typically categorized as [[introverted]] or [[extraverted]]. Personality was therefore assessed in terms of generalities or averages. In noticing the strong inconsistencies in how people behaved across situations, some psychologists dismissed personality as nonexistent.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThis school of thought attributes human behavior to environmental factors, relegating individual differences to situational artifacts and contesting the existence of individual predispositions. It was led by [[Situationism (psychology)|situationists]] like [[Walter Mischel]] (1968). Their contention held that personality was a fictitious concept.  For them, the discrepancies observed across one's behaviors were evidence that interindividual differences did not exist <ref>Mischel, W. (1968). Personality and assessment. Hoboken, NJ US: John Wiley & Sons Inc.</ref>\nSome aspects of the situationist perspective even suggest that all human beings are the same and that the differences we observe are simply illusory biproducts of the environment. \n          \nHowever, personologists soon integrated these inconsistencies into their conceptualization of [[personality]]. They modified the old, more monolithic construct by measuring how people differ across situations. Their new methods of personality assessment describe fluctuations in personality characteristics as consistent and predictable for each person based on the environment he is in and his predispositions. Some work suggests that people can espouse different levels of a personality dimension as the social situations and time of day change<ref name=\"Fleeson, William 2001\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = William | year = 2001 | title = Towards a structure- and process-integrated view of personality: Traits as density distributions of states | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 6| pages = 1011\u20131027 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.1011}}</ref>\n         \nTherefore, someone is not [[conscientious]] all the time, but can be conscientious at work and a lot less so when she is home. This work also suggests that intrapersonal variations on a [[trait theory|trait]] can be even larger than interpersonal variations. [[Extraversion]] varies more within a person than across individuals, for example. This work was based on individual self-ratings during the day across a long period of time. This allowed for researchers to assess moment-to-moment and day to day variations on personality attributes.<ref name=\"Fleeson, William 2001\"/>\nPersonologists now tend to agree that people's personalities are variegated and are not to be conceptualized through bipolar characterizations (e.g. extraversion vs introversion). Rather people oscillate between the two extremes of a trait. The pattern of this oscillation then constitutes personality.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==The impact of social roles==\nIn addition, social roles (e.g. employee) have been identified as a potential sources of [[personality]] change.

Conversely, once he leaves that role and or takes on another which entails less conscientiousness, he will manifest a lower level standing on that trait. Longitudinal research demonstrates that people's personality trajectories can often be explained by the social roles they espoused and relinquished throughout their life stages. Thus social roles are often studied as fundamental predictors of personality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ozer | first1 = D.

Mottus, Johnson and Geary (2012) found that instability engendered by aging does not necessarily affect one's standing within an age cohort. Hence, fluctuations and stability coexist so that one changes relative to one's former self but not relative to one's peers. Similarly, other psychologists found that [[Neuroticism]], [[Extraversion]] (only in men), and [[Openness to experience|Openness]] decreased with age after 70, but [[Conscientiousness]] and [[Agreeableness]] increased with age (the latter only in men). Moreover, they suggest that there is a decline on each trait after the age of 81.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = R.

Fleisher and Woehr (2008) suggest that that consistency across the Big Five is a construct that is fairly stable and contributes to the predictive validity of personality measures. Hence inconsistency is quantifiable much like a trait and constitutes an index of and enhances the fit of psychological models.\n\nTo accommodate the inconsistency demonstrated on personality tests, researchers developed the Frame Of Reference principle (FOR). According to this theory, people tend to think of their personality in terms of a specific social context when they are asked to rate them.  Whichever environment is cognitively salient at the time of the personality measurement will influence the respondent's ratings on a trait measure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reddock | first1 = C.

Accounting for the FOR principle aims at increasing the validity of personality measures.  This demonstrates that the predictive validity of personality measures which specify a social context is a lot higher than those measures which take a more generic approach.\n          \nThis point is substantiated by yet another body of work suggesting that FOR instructions moderated the link between extraversion and openness scores on manager ratings of employee performance <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hunthausen | first1 = J.

A ''rank-order change'' refers to a change in an individual's personality trait relative to other individuals; such changes do not occur very often.<ref name=\"Funder 258\">{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The Personality Puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W.

Longitudinal research shows that mean-level change does occur.<ref name=\"Funder 258\" /> However, some [[Trait theory|traits]] tend to change while some traits tend to stay stable.\n\nDuring adolescence there are many increases or rapid changes in hormones, societal pressures, and environment among other things. These things theoretically factor into significant personality changes as one progresses through adolescence. As you progress through adulthood personality becomes more stable and predictable because you fall into a pattern of thinking, behaving, and feeling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borghuis|first=Jeroen|last2=Denissen|first2=Jaap J.

Biological transitions are stages like [[puberty]] or first childbirth. Social transitions might be changes in social roles like becoming a parent or working at a first job. These life transitions do not necessarily cause change, but they may be reasons for change. As humans we do not adapt just in our body, our mind also makes changes to itself in order to thrive in our environment. One theory says that whether or not these life transitions cause personality change is based on whether the transition was expected based on age or was unforeseen.<ref name=\"Caspi and Moffitt\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Caspi | first1 = Avshalom | last2 = Moffitt | first2 = Terrie E. | title = When Do Individual Differences Matter?

Individuals will change their behavior based on the ideas in their environment that emit [[Reward system#Psychological reward|rewards]] and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishments]].

[[Therapy]] involves the same type of introspection. The individual along with the therapist identifies the behaviors that are inappropriate, and then self-monitors in order to change them. Eventually the individual internalizes the behavior they want to attain, and that trait will generalize to other areas of the individual's life.\nPersonality change also occurs when individuals observe the actions of others. Individuals may mimic the behaviors of others and then internalize those behaviors. Once the individual internalizes those behaviors they are said to be a part of that person's personality.<ref name=\"Caspi and Roberts\" />\nIndividuals also receive feedback from other individuals or groups about their own personality. This is a driving force of change because the individual has social motivations to change his or her personality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has also been shown that major positive and negative life events can predict changes in personality.<ref name=\"Jeronimus2014\"/><ref name=\"Jeronimus2013\"/> Some of the largest changes are observed in individuals with psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.

She has been called \"one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early 20th century\" and a \"pioneer\" in modern Indian art. Drawn to painting from an early age, Sher-Gil started getting formal lessons in the art, at the age of eight. She first gained recognition at the age of 19, for her [[oil painting]] titled ''Young Girls'' (1932).\n\nSher-Gil traveled throughout her life to various countries including Turkey, France, and India, deriving heavily from precolonial Indian art styles and its current culture. Sher-Gil is considered an important painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands on a level with that of the pioneers from the [[Bengali Renaissance|Bengal Renaissance]]. She was also an avid reader and a pianist. Sher-Gil's paintings are among the most expensive by Indian women painters today, although few acknowledged her work when she was alive.

She has been called \"one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early 20th century\" and a \"pioneer\" in modern Indian art. Drawn to painting from an early age, Sher-Gil started getting formal lessons in the art, at the age of eight. She first gained recognition at the age of 19, for her [[oil painting]] titled ''Young Girls'' (1932).\n\nSher-Gil traveled throughout her life to various countries including Turkey, France, and India, deriving heavily from precolonial Indian art styles and its current culture. Sher-Gil is considered an important painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands on a level with that of the pioneers from the [[Bengali Renaissance|Bengal Renaissance]]. She was also an avid reader and a pianist. Sher-Gil's paintings are among the most expensive by Indian women painters today, although few acknowledged her work when she was alive.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n[[File:Amrita with Indira 1922.jpg|thumb|150px|left| Amrita with her sister Indira, 1922]]\n\nAmrita Sher-Gil was born on 30 January 1913<ref name=GreatMinds>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000312/spectrum/main2.htm#3 Great Minds], The Tribune, 12 March 2000.</ref> in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Budapest Diary|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?267032|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=Outlook|date=20 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529110336/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?267032|archive-date=29 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> to Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a  [[Jat sikh|sikh]] aristocrat and a scholar in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], and Marie Antoniette Gottesmann, a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian-Jewish]] opera singer who came from an affluent bourgeois family.<ref name=\"The Indian Frida Kahlo\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10087130/The-Indian-Frida-Kahlo.html|title=The Indian Frida Kahlo|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"christies.com\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.christies.com/features/Amrita-Sher-Gil-6132-1.aspx|title=Revolution personified {{!}} Christie's'|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> Her parents first met in 1912, while Marie Antoinette was visiting Lahore.<ref name=\"The Indian Frida Kahlo\"/> Her mother came to India as a companion of [[Princess Bamba Sutherland]], the granddaughter of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]].<ref name=\"spectrum\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090920/spectrum/main3.htm|title=The Princess who died unknown|last=Kang|first=Kanwarjit Singh|date=20 September 2009|work=The Sunday Tribune|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=Hamari Amrita|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?230674|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=Outlook|date=27 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206165148/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?230674|archive-date=6 February 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Sher-Gil was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (n\u00e9e Sher-Gil), born in March 1914), mother of the contemporary artist [[Vivan Sundaram]].
