She was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Commissioned in December 1942, ''Essex'' participated in several campaigns in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater of Operations]], earning the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and 13 [[Service star|battle stars]]. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), eventually becoming an [[Antisubmarine Aircraft Carrier|antisubmarine aircraft carrier]] (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, playing a role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. She also participated in the [[Korean War]], earning four battle stars and the [[Navy Unit Commendation]]. She was the primary recovery carrier for the [[Apollo&nbsp;7]] space mission.\n\nShe was decommissioned for the last time in 1969, and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrap on 1{{nbsp}}June 1975.<ref name=\"US Navy - A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers - USS Essex (CV9)\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/histories/cv09-essex/cv09-essex.html |title=USS Essex (CV-9) |date=11 June 2009 |website=U.S. Navy |access-date=31 December 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007170234/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/histories/cv09-essex/cv09-essex.html |archive-date=7 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Construction and Commissioning ==\n''Essex'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 28{{nbsp}}April 1941, by [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] and Dry Dock Co. After the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] her building contract (along with the same for {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|1}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|1}}) was reworked. After an accelerated construction, she was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 31 July 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Artemus L. Gates, the wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 31{{nbsp}}December 1942, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Donald B. Duncan]] commanding.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n== Service history ==\n\n=== World War II ===\nFollowing her accelerated builder's trials and [[Sea trial|shakedown cruise]], ''Essex'' moved to the Pacific in May 1943. Departing from [[Pearl Harbor]], she participated with [[Task Force 16]] (TF 16) in carrier operations against [[Marcus Island]]. On 31{{nbsp}}August 1943, she was designated the [[flagship]] of TF{{nbsp}}14 and struck [[Wake Island]] on 5{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}6 October. On 11{{nbsp}}November, she took part in carrier operations during the [[Rabaul]] strike, alongside {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2}} and {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}. She then launched an attack with Task Group 50.3 (TG{{nbsp}}50.3) against the [[Gilbert Islands]] where she took part in her first [[amphibious assault]] during the [[Battle of Tarawa]]. After [[Underway replenishment|refueling at sea]], she cruised as the flagship of TG{{nbsp}}50.3 to attack [[Kwajalein]] on 4 December. Her second amphibious assault delivered in company with TG{{nbsp}}50.3 was against the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Marshall Islands]] on 29{{nbsp}}January to 2{{nbsp}}February 1944.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n''Essex,'' in TG{{nbsp}}50.3, now joined with TG{{nbsp}}58.1 and TG{{nbsp}}58.2 to constitute [[Fast Carrier Task Force|Task Force 58]], the \"Fast Carrier Task Force\", launched an [[Operation Hailstone|attack against Truk]] between 17{{nbsp}}and 18{{nbsp}}February 1944 during which eight Japanese ships were sunk. While en route to the [[Mariana Islands]] to sever Japanese [[supply line]]s, the carrier force was detected and subjected to a prolonged aerial attack which it repelled successfully. It then continued with the scheduled attack upon [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], and [[Guam]] on 23{{nbsp}}February 1944.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\nAfter this operation, ''Essex'' proceeded to [[San Francisco]] for her single wartime overhaul. Following her overhaul, ''Essex'' became the carrier for Air Group 15, the \"Fabled Fifteen,\" commanded by the U.S. Navy's top ace of the war, [[David McCampbell]]. She then joined carriers {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|2}} and {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|2}} in TG{{nbsp}}12.1 to strike Marcus Island on 19{{nbsp}}to 20{{nbsp}}May 1944, and Wake, on 23{{nbsp}}May 1944. She deployed with TF{{nbsp}}58 to support the occupation of the Marianas on 12{{nbsp}}June to{{nbsp}}10 August; sortied with TG{{nbsp}}38.3 to lead an attack against the [[Palau Islands]] on 6{{nbsp}}to 8{{nbsp}}September, and [[Mindanao]] on 9{{nbsp}}to 10{{nbsp}}September with enemy shipping as the main target, and remained in the area to [[Battle of Peleliu|support landings on Peleliu.]] On 2{{nbsp}}October, she weathered a [[typhoon]] and four days later departed with Task Force 38{{nbsp}}(TF 38) for the [[Ryukyus]].{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}<ref group=note>TF{{nbsp}}38 was actually the same formation as TF{{nbsp}}58, the nomenclature being changed to reflect the rotation of command staffs employed by the Navy for efficiency in executing multiple operations; this rotation allowed constant front-line deployment of the ships and their crews while providing operational planning time at better-equipped, rear-area base facilities for the command structure not currently afloat.</ref>\n[[File:D4Y Yoshinori Yamaguchi col.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lieutenant]] Yamaguchi's [[Yokosuka D4Y]]3 (Type 33) ''Suisei'' diving at ''Essex'', 25{{nbsp}} November 1944.

She resumed the offensive and delivered attacks on [[Manila]] and the northern [[Philippine Islands]] during November. On 25{{nbsp}}November, for the first time in her far-ranging operations and destruction to the enemy, ''Essex'' received damage.

She rode out [[Typhoon Cobra]] and made a special search for survivors afterward. With TG{{nbsp}}38.3, she participated in the [[Lingayen Gulf]] operations, launched strikes against Formosa, [[Sakishima]], [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], and Luzon. Entering the [[South China Sea]] in search of enemy surface forces, the task force [[South China Sea raid|pounded shipping and conducted strikes]] on Formosa, the [[China]] coast, [[Hainan]], and [[Hong Kong]]. ''Essex'' withstood the onslaught of the third typhoon in four months on 20{{nbsp}}and 21{{nbsp}}January 1945 before striking again at Formosa, [[Miyako-jima]], and Okinawa on 26{{nbsp}}and 27{{nbsp}}January.\n\nFor the remainder of the war, she operated with TF{{nbsp}}58, conducting attacks against the [[Tokyo]] area on 16{{nbsp}}and 17{{nbsp}}February. On 25{{nbsp}}February 1945, she was deployed to neutralize the enemy's air power before the landings on [[Iwo Jima]] and to cripple the aircraft manufacturing industry. She sent support missions against Iwo Jima and neighboring islands, but from 23{{nbsp}}March to 28{{nbsp}}May was employed primarily to support the conquest of Okinawa. In the closing days of the war, ''Essex'' took part in the final telling raids against the Japanese home islands on 10{{nbsp}}July to 15{{nbsp}}August 1945.\n\n===Recommission===\n[[File:USS Essex (CV-9) underway in March 1951.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' after receiving the SCB-27A refit  March 1951.]]\nFollowing the [[surrender of Japan]], she continued defensive [[combat air patrol]]s until 3 September, when she was ordered to [[Bremerton, Washington]], for inactivation. She arrived at [[Puget Sound]] on 15 September.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Big Warships Return From Pacific Sector |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The San Bernardino Daily Sun |location=San Bernardino, California |date=16 September 1945 |volume=52 |page=5}}</ref> On 9{{nbsp}}January 1947, she was [[Decommissioned (ship)|decommissioned]] and placed in reserve. Modernization endowed ''Essex'' with a new flight deck, and a streamlined island superstructure on 16 January 1951, when she was recommissioned, with Captain A. W. Wheelock commanding.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n=== Korean War ===\n\n[[File:USS Essex (CV-9) flight deck fire, 16 September 1951.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' flight deck fire, 16 September 1951]]After a brief cruise in Hawaiian waters, she began the first of three tours in Far Eastern waters during the [[Korean War]]. She served as flagship for [[Carrier Strike Group One|Carrier Division 1]] (CarDiv 1) and [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]]. She was the first carrier to launch [[F2H Banshee]]s on combat missions; on 16{{nbsp}}September 1951, one of these planes, damaged in combat, crashed into aircraft parked on the forward flight deck causing an explosion and fire which killed seven. After repairs at [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], she returned to frontline action on 3{{nbsp}}October to launch strikes up to the [[Yalu River]] and provide [[close air support]] for U.N. troops. Her two deployments in the Korean War were from August 1951{{snd}}March 1952 and July 1952{{snd}}January 1953.\n\nOn 1{{nbsp}}December 1953, she started her final tour of the war, sailing in the [[East China Sea]] with what official U.S. Navy records describe as the \"Peace Patrol\". From November 1954 \u2013 June 1955 she engaged in training exercises, operated for three months with the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], assisted in the [[Tachen Islands]] evacuation, and engaged in air operations and fleet maneuvers off Okinawa.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n=== Pacific Fleet ===\nIn July 1955, ''Essex'' entered [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] for repairs and extensive alterations. The SCB-125 modernization program included installation of an angled flight deck and an enclosed hurricane bow, as well as relocation of the aft elevator to the starboard deck edge. Modernization completed, she rejoined the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in March 1956. For the next 14 months, the carrier operated off the West Coast, except for a six-month cruise with the 7th{{nbsp}}Fleet in the Far East. Ordered to join the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]] for the first time in her long career, she sailed from [[San Diego]] on 21{{nbsp}}June 1957, rounded [[Cape Horn]], and arrived at [[Naval Station Mayport]] on 1 August.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n=== Atlantic and Mediterranean ===\n[[File:USS Essex (CVA-9) at sea c1956.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' after the SCB-125 modernization, 1956.|left]]\n\nIn the fall of 1957, ''Essex'' participated as an anti-submarine carrier in the [[NATO]] [[Exercise Strikeback]] and in February 1958, deployed with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] until May, when she shifted to the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. Alerted to the Middle East crisis on 14{{nbsp}}July 1958, she sped to support the US landings in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], launching reconnaissance and patrol missions until 20{{nbsp}}August. Once again, she was ordered to proceed to Asian waters and transited the [[Suez Canal]] to arrive in the [[Taiwan]] operational area, where she joined TF{{nbsp}}77 in conducting flight operations before rounding the Horn and proceeding back to Mayport.\n[[File:USS Essex (CVS-9) in drydock at Brooklyn Navy Yard 1960.jpg|thumb|USS ''Essex'' (CVS-9) in drydock at Brooklyn Navy Yard being converted for the Anti-submarine role.]]\n''Essex'' joined with the [[United States Second Fleet|2nd Fleet]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] ships in Atlantic exercises and with NATO forces in the eastern Mediterranean during the fall of 1959. In December she aided victims of a disastrous flood at [[Fr\u00e9jus]], [[France]].\n\nIn the spring of 1960, she was converted into an ASW Support Carrier and was thereafter homeported at [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Since that time she operated as the flagship of [[Carrier Division 18]] and Antisubmarine Carrier Group Three. She conducted rescue and salvage operations off the New Jersey coast for a downed [[blimp]]; cruised with midshipmen, and was deployed on NATO and [[CENTO]] exercises that took her through the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean. Ports of call included Karachi and the British Crown Colony of Aden. In November she joined the French navy in Operation \"Jet Stream\".{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\nOn 7{{nbsp}}November 1960, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[research vessel]] {{ship|RV|Vityaz|1939}} was reported by [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] to have been buzzed in the [[Arabian Sea]] by a [[Grumman S-2F Tracker]] from ''Essex''. The United States Navy denied that the aircraft was buzzing the ship, claiming it was merely establishing her identity.<ref name=Times101160>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=U.S. denies Arabian Sea \"buzzing\" |date=10 November 1960 |page_number=12 |issue=54925 |column=C}}</ref>\n\n=== Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis ===\n[[File:USS Essex (CV-9) - January 1960.jpg|thumb|The modernized ''Essex'' with an angled flight deck, seen in heavy seas in 1960.|left]]\nIn April 1961, ''Essex'' steamed out of NS Mayport, on a two-week \"routine training\" cruise, purportedly to support the carrier qualification of a squadron of Navy pilots. Twelve [[A-4 Skyhawk|A4D-2 Skyhawks]] had been loaded aboard; the aircraft, pilots and support crews all from attack squadron [[VFA-34|VA-34]]. The A4D-2Ns were armed with 20&nbsp;mm cannon, and after several days at sea, all their identifying markings were crudely obscured with flat gray paint. They began flying mysterious missions day and night with at least one returning bearing battle damage. Not generally known to ''Essex'' crew was that they had been tasked to provide air support to CIA-sponsored bombers during the ill-fated [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. The naval aviation part of the mission was aborted by [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] at the last moment and the ''Essex'' crew sworn to secrecy.{{sfn|Wyden|1979|pages=125\u2013127,130,214,240\u2013241}}\n\nLater in 1961, ''Essex'' completed a \"People to People\" cruise to Northern Europe with ports of call in [[Rotterdam]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Greenock]]. During the Hamburg visit over one million visitors toured ''Essex''. During her departure, ''Essex'' almost ran aground in the shallow [[Elbe|Elbe River]]. On her return voyage to the United States she ran into a severe North Atlantic storm (January 1962) and suffered major structural damage. In early 1962, she went into dry dock in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] for a major overhaul.\n\n''Essex'' had just finished her six-month-long overhaul and was at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] for sea trials when President Kennedy placed a naval \"quarantine\" on Cuba in October 1962, in response to the discovered presence of Soviet missiles in that country (see [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]). (The word quarantine was used rather than blockade for reasons of international law\u2014Kennedy reasoned that a blockade would be an act of war, and war had not been declared between the U.S. and Cuba.){{sfn|Kennedy|1969|}} ''Essex'' spent over a month in the Caribbean as one of the US Navy ships enforcing this \"quarantine\", returning home just before Thanksgiving.\n\n=== ''Nautilus'' incident ===\nWhile conducting replenishment exercises with NATO forces in November 1966, ''Essex'' collided with the submerged submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}}. The submarine sustained extensive sail damage, returning to port unassisted.  Aboard ''Essex'', the hull was opened and the ship's speed indicator equipment was destroyed, but the carrier was still able to make port unassisted. ''Essex'' subsequently reported to the [[Boston Naval Shipyard]] for an extensive overhaul and hull repairs.{{sfn|Nautilus (SSN-571) iv}}[[File:The Apollo 7 crew is welcomed aboard the USS Essex.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 7]] crew is welcomed aboard ''Essex''.]]\n\n=== Tupolev Tu-16 incident===\nOn 25 May 1968, ''Essex'' was underway in the [[Norwegian Sea]] when it was buzzed four times by a Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-16]] heavy bomber.

She was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Commissioned in December 1942, ''Essex'' participated in several campaigns in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater of Operations]], earning the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and 13 [[Service star|battle stars]]. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), eventually becoming an [[Antisubmarine Aircraft Carrier|antisubmarine aircraft carrier]] (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, playing a role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. She also participated in the [[Korean War]], earning four battle stars and the [[Navy Unit Commendation]]. She was the primary recovery carrier for the [[Apollo&nbsp;7]] space mission.\n\nShe was decommissioned for the last time in 1969, and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrap on 1{{nbsp}}June 1975.<ref name=\"US Navy - A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers - USS Essex (CV9)\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/histories/cv09-essex/cv09-essex.html |title=USS Essex (CV-9) |date=11 June 2009 |website=U.S. Navy |access-date=31 December 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007170234/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/histories/cv09-essex/cv09-essex.html |archive-date=7 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Construction and Commissioning ==\n''Essex'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 28{{nbsp}}April 1941, by [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] and Dry Dock Co. After the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] her building contract (along with the same for {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|1}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|1}}) was reworked. After an accelerated construction, she was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 31 July 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Artemus L. Gates, the wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 31{{nbsp}}December 1942, with [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Donald B. Duncan]] commanding.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n== Service history ==\n\n=== World War II ===\nFollowing her accelerated builder's trials and [[Sea trial|shakedown cruise]], ''Essex'' moved to the Pacific in May 1943. Departing from [[Pearl Harbor]], she participated with [[Task Force 16]] (TF 16) in carrier operations against [[Marcus Island]]. On 31{{nbsp}}August 1943, she was designated the [[flagship]] of TF{{nbsp}}14 and struck [[Wake Island]] on 5{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}6 October. On 11{{nbsp}}November, she took part in carrier operations during the [[Rabaul]] strike, alongside {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2}} and {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}. She then launched an attack with Task Group 50.3 (TG{{nbsp}}50.3) against the [[Gilbert Islands]] where she took part in her first [[amphibious assault]] during the [[Battle of Tarawa]]. After [[Underway replenishment|refueling at sea]], she cruised as the flagship of TG{{nbsp}}50.3 to attack [[Kwajalein]] on 4 December. Her second amphibious assault delivered in company with TG{{nbsp}}50.3 was against the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Marshall Islands]] on 29{{nbsp}}January to 2{{nbsp}}February 1944.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n''Essex,'' in TG{{nbsp}}50.3, now joined with TG{{nbsp}}58.1 and TG{{nbsp}}58.2 to constitute [[Fast Carrier Task Force|Task Force 58]], the \"Fast Carrier Task Force\", launched an [[Operation Hailstone|attack against Truk]] between 17{{nbsp}}and 18{{nbsp}}February 1944 during which eight Japanese ships were sunk. While en route to the [[Mariana Islands]] to sever Japanese [[supply line]]s, the carrier force was detected and subjected to a prolonged aerial attack which it repelled successfully. It then continued with the scheduled attack upon [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], and [[Guam]] on 23{{nbsp}}February 1944.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\nAfter this operation, ''Essex'' proceeded to [[San Francisco]] for her single wartime overhaul. Following her overhaul, ''Essex'' became the carrier for Air Group 15, the \"Fabled Fifteen,\" commanded by the U.S. Navy's top ace of the war, [[David McCampbell]]. She then joined carriers {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|2}} and {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|2}} in TG{{nbsp}}12.1 to strike Marcus Island on 19{{nbsp}}to 20{{nbsp}}May 1944, and Wake, on 23{{nbsp}}May 1944. She deployed with TF{{nbsp}}58 to support the occupation of the Marianas on 12{{nbsp}}June to{{nbsp}}10 August; sortied with TG{{nbsp}}38.3 to lead an attack against the [[Palau Islands]] on 6{{nbsp}}to 8{{nbsp}}September, and [[Mindanao]] on 9{{nbsp}}to 10{{nbsp}}September with enemy shipping as the main target, and remained in the area to [[Battle of Peleliu|support landings on Peleliu.]] On 2{{nbsp}}October, she weathered a [[typhoon]] and four days later departed with Task Force 38{{nbsp}}(TF 38) for the [[Ryukyus]].{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}<ref group=note>TF{{nbsp}}38 was actually the same formation as TF{{nbsp}}58, the nomenclature being changed to reflect the rotation of command staffs employed by the Navy for efficiency in executing multiple operations; this rotation allowed constant front-line deployment of the ships and their crews while providing operational planning time at better-equipped, rear-area base facilities for the command structure not currently afloat.</ref>\n[[File:D4Y Yoshinori Yamaguchi col.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lieutenant]] Yamaguchi's [[Yokosuka D4Y]]3 (Type 33) ''Suisei'' diving at ''Essex'', 25{{nbsp}} November 1944.

She rode out [[Typhoon Cobra]] and made a special search for survivors afterward. With TG{{nbsp}}38.3, she participated in the [[Lingayen Gulf]] operations, launched strikes against Formosa, [[Sakishima]], [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], and Luzon. Entering the [[South China Sea]] in search of enemy surface forces, the task force [[South China Sea raid|pounded shipping and conducted strikes]] on Formosa, the [[China]] coast, [[Hainan]], and [[Hong Kong]]. ''Essex'' withstood the onslaught of the third typhoon in four months on 20{{nbsp}}and 21{{nbsp}}January 1945 before striking again at Formosa, [[Miyako-jima]], and Okinawa on 26{{nbsp}}and 27{{nbsp}}January.\n\nFor the remainder of the war, she operated with TF{{nbsp}}58, conducting attacks against the [[Tokyo]] area on 16{{nbsp}}and 17{{nbsp}}February. On 25{{nbsp}}February 1945, she was deployed to neutralize the enemy's air power before the landings on [[Iwo Jima]] and to cripple the aircraft manufacturing industry. She sent support missions against Iwo Jima and neighboring islands, but from 23{{nbsp}}March to 28{{nbsp}}May was employed primarily to support the conquest of Okinawa. In the closing days of the war, ''Essex'' took part in the final telling raids against the Japanese home islands on 10{{nbsp}}July to 15{{nbsp}}August 1945.\n\n===Recommission===\n[[File:USS Essex (CV-9) underway in March 1951.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' after receiving the SCB-27A refit  March 1951.]]\nFollowing the [[surrender of Japan]], she continued defensive [[combat air patrol]]s until 3 September, when she was ordered to [[Bremerton, Washington]], for inactivation.

Wheelock commanding.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n=== Korean War ===\n\n[[File:USS Essex (CV-9) flight deck fire, 16 September 1951.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' flight deck fire, 16 September 1951]]After a brief cruise in Hawaiian waters, she began the first of three tours in Far Eastern waters during the [[Korean War]]. She served as flagship for [[Carrier Strike Group One|Carrier Division 1]] (CarDiv 1) and [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]]. She was the first carrier to launch [[F2H Banshee]]s on combat missions; on 16{{nbsp}}September 1951, one of these planes, damaged in combat, crashed into aircraft parked on the forward flight deck causing an explosion and fire which killed seven. After repairs at [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], she returned to frontline action on 3{{nbsp}}October to launch strikes up to the [[Yalu River]] and provide [[close air support]] for U.N. troops. Her two deployments in the Korean War were from August 1951{{snd}}March 1952 and July 1952{{snd}}January 1953.\n\nOn 1{{nbsp}}December 1953, she started her final tour of the war, sailing in the [[East China Sea]] with what official U.S. Navy records describe as the \"Peace Patrol\". From November 1954 \u2013 June 1955 she engaged in training exercises, operated for three months with the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], assisted in the [[Tachen Islands]] evacuation, and engaged in air operations and fleet maneuvers off Okinawa.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n=== Pacific Fleet ===\nIn July 1955, ''Essex'' entered [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] for repairs and extensive alterations. The SCB-125 modernization program included installation of an angled flight deck and an enclosed hurricane bow, as well as relocation of the aft elevator to the starboard deck edge. Modernization completed, she rejoined the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in March 1956. For the next 14 months, the carrier operated off the West Coast, except for a six-month cruise with the 7th{{nbsp}}Fleet in the Far East. Ordered to join the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]] for the first time in her long career, she sailed from [[San Diego]] on 21{{nbsp}}June 1957, rounded [[Cape Horn]], and arrived at [[Naval Station Mayport]] on 1 August.{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\n=== Atlantic and Mediterranean ===\n[[File:USS Essex (CVA-9) at sea c1956.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' after the SCB-125 modernization, 1956.|left]]\n\nIn the fall of 1957, ''Essex'' participated as an anti-submarine carrier in the [[NATO]] [[Exercise Strikeback]] and in February 1958, deployed with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] until May, when she shifted to the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. Alerted to the Middle East crisis on 14{{nbsp}}July 1958, she sped to support the US landings in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], launching reconnaissance and patrol missions until 20{{nbsp}}August. Once again, she was ordered to proceed to Asian waters and transited the [[Suez Canal]] to arrive in the [[Taiwan]] operational area, where she joined TF{{nbsp}}77 in conducting flight operations before rounding the Horn and proceeding back to Mayport.\n[[File:USS Essex (CVS-9) in drydock at Brooklyn Navy Yard 1960.jpg|thumb|USS ''Essex'' (CVS-9) in drydock at Brooklyn Navy Yard being converted for the Anti-submarine role.]]\n''Essex'' joined with the [[United States Second Fleet|2nd Fleet]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] ships in Atlantic exercises and with NATO forces in the eastern Mediterranean during the fall of 1959. In December she aided victims of a disastrous flood at [[Fr\u00e9jus]], [[France]].\n\nIn the spring of 1960, she was converted into an ASW Support Carrier and was thereafter homeported at [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Since that time she operated as the flagship of [[Carrier Division 18]] and Antisubmarine Carrier Group Three. She conducted rescue and salvage operations off the New Jersey coast for a downed [[blimp]]; cruised with midshipmen, and was deployed on NATO and [[CENTO]] exercises that took her through the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean. Ports of call included Karachi and the British Crown Colony of Aden. In November she joined the French navy in Operation \"Jet Stream\".{{sfn|Essex (CV-9) iv}}\n\nOn 7{{nbsp}}November 1960, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[research vessel]] {{ship|RV|Vityaz|1939}} was reported by [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] to have been buzzed in the [[Arabian Sea]] by a [[Grumman S-2F Tracker]] from ''Essex''.

Twelve [[A-4 Skyhawk|A4D-2 Skyhawks]] had been loaded aboard; the aircraft, pilots and support crews all from attack squadron [[VFA-34|VA-34]]. The A4D-2Ns were armed with 20&nbsp;mm cannon, and after several days at sea, all their identifying markings were crudely obscured with flat gray paint. They began flying mysterious missions day and night with at least one returning bearing battle damage. Not generally known to ''Essex'' crew was that they had been tasked to provide air support to CIA-sponsored bombers during the ill-fated [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. The naval aviation part of the mission was aborted by [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] at the last moment and the ''Essex'' crew sworn to secrecy.{{sfn|Wyden|1979|pages=125\u2013127,130,214,240\u2013241}}\n\nLater in 1961, ''Essex'' completed a \"People to People\" cruise to Northern Europe with ports of call in [[Rotterdam]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Greenock]]. During the Hamburg visit over one million visitors toured ''Essex''. During her departure, ''Essex'' almost ran aground in the shallow [[Elbe|Elbe River]]. On her return voyage to the United States she ran into a severe North Atlantic storm (January 1962) and suffered major structural damage. In early 1962, she went into dry dock in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] for a major overhaul.\n\n''Essex'' had just finished her six-month-long overhaul and was at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] for sea trials when President Kennedy placed a naval \"quarantine\" on Cuba in October 1962, in response to the discovered presence of Soviet missiles in that country (see [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]). (The word quarantine was used rather than blockade for reasons of international law\u2014Kennedy reasoned that a blockade would be an act of war, and war had not been declared between the U.S. and Cuba.){{sfn|Kennedy|1969|}} ''Essex'' spent over a month in the Caribbean as one of the US Navy ships enforcing this \"quarantine\", returning home just before Thanksgiving.\n\n=== ''Nautilus'' incident ===\nWhile conducting replenishment exercises with NATO forces in November 1966, ''Essex'' collided with the submerged submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}}. The submarine sustained extensive sail damage, returning to port unassisted.  Aboard ''Essex'', the hull was opened and the ship's speed indicator equipment was destroyed, but the carrier was still able to make port unassisted. ''Essex'' subsequently reported to the [[Boston Naval Shipyard]] for an extensive overhaul and hull repairs.{{sfn|Nautilus (SSN-571) iv}}[[File:The Apollo 7 crew is welcomed aboard the USS Essex.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 7]] crew is welcomed aboard ''Essex''.]]\n\n=== Tupolev Tu-16 incident===\nOn May 25, 1968, ''Essex'' was underway in the [[Norwegian Sea]] when it was buzzed four times by a Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-16]] heavy bomber.

Listings include actors that have played the characters in various media.\n\n==Willy Wonka==\n{{main|Willy Wonka}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Willy Wonka\n| series    = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[Gene Wilder]] (1971)<br>[[Johnny Depp]] (2005)<br>\n| voice     = [[James Arnold Taylor]] ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />J.P. Karliak (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender    = Male\n}}\n\nIn the novels and films, '''Willy Wonka''' is the eccentric owner of the world's largest candy factory, making candy and chocolate. Wonka holds a contest, hiding 5 Golden Tickets within the wrappers of his chocolate bars, promising their finders a tour of his factory and a lifelong supply of his creations. \n\nWonka has a black goatee and \"marvelously\" bright eyes, a high and \"flutey\" voice, a face \"alight of fun and laughter\", and quick little jerky movements \"like a squirrel\". He is enthusiastic, talkative, friendly and charming, but is sometimes insensitive and has been given to glossing self-criticism.\n\nIn the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'', he is portrayed by [[Gene Wilder]]. While his personality remains generally the same as in the original, he is more melancholy here, and frequently quotes books and poems, including [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (\"Is it my soul that calls upon my name?\") or [[John Masefield]]'s \"[[Sea-Fever]]\" (\"All I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by\"), and the famous \"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker\" from \"Reflections on Ice-Breaking\" by [[Ogden Nash]], among many others. Toward the end of the film, he tests Charlie's conscience by reprimanding him and pretending to deny him any reward but assumes an almost paternal role when Charlie proves to be honest after all.\n\nIn the 2005 film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', he is portrayed by [[Johnny Depp]]. In this version, a backstory was added that Willy Wonka's father (being a dentist) would not let him eat sweets because of the potential risk to his teeth, and that the young Wonka left home to become a chocolatier.\n\n==Charlie Bucket==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Charlie Bucket\n| series    = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[Peter Ostrum]] (1971)<br>[[Freddie Highmore]] (2005)\n| voice     = Freddie Highmore ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />Lincoln Melcher (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender    = Male\n| family    = Mr. Bucket (father)<br>Mrs. Bucket (mother)\n| relatives = Joe Bucket (grandfather) <br> Josephine Bucket (grandmother) <br> George [surname unknown] (grandfather)<br> Georgina [surname unknown] (grandmother)\n}}\n'''Charlie Bucket''' is the second main character of ''[[Charlie and the Chocol\n\nbot Factory]]'', its sequel ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]'', and the film adaptations of these books.<ref name=20170913theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/13/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-hero-originally-black-roald-dahl|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory hero 'was originally black'|first=Haroon|last=Siddique|date=13 September 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> He is depicted as a kind-hearted and selfless boy who lives with his mother, father and his four grandparents. In 1971, he has a newspaper route after school. He and his family follow the progress of the hunt for the Golden Tickets in newspapers and television. Unlike the first four finalists, Charlie is honest and generous; he is actually worried if the other nasty children such as Augustus and Veruca will actually be alive after their ordeals. In the 1971 film, Charlie was portrayed by [[Peter Ostrum]], in his only film appearance. His nationality is never explicitly stated, but in the 1971 film, he speaks with an American accent, and in the 2005 film, he speaks with an English accent. The filmmakers have stated that it was their intention that Charlie's hometown be kept ambiguous. In this version, when Grandpa Joe decided to accompany Charlie to the factory, Charlie explains that the family needs the money now, instead of the ticket; then Grandpa George explains the reason why Charlie still has to go to the factory, and indeed he and Grandpa Joe do go.\n\nIn the novel, at the end of the tour, Wonka declares Charlie the heir to the factory for his refusal of vice, and Charlie's family are permitted to move into the factory. In the 1971 film, Charlie wins the factory when he returns an Everlasting Gobstopper given to him by Wonka, thereby passing Wonka's moral test. In the 2005 film, Wonka initially refuses to allow Charlie's family to join them in the factory, and Charlie rejects Wonka's offer. When Charlie helps Wonka reconcile with his father, the family move into the factory, and Charlie and Wonka both became partners.\n\n==Grandpa Joe Bucket==\n \n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Grandpa Joe\n| series             = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first              = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator            = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer          = [[Jack Albertson]] (1971)<br>[[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] (2005)<br>[[Nigel Planer]], [[Barry James]] ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (musical)|2013]])<br>[[John Rubinstein]] ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (musical)|2017]])\n| voice              = David Kelly ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />[[Jess Harnell]] (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender             = Male\n| spouse             = Josephine Bucket (wife)\n| children           = Mr. Bucket (son)\n| relatives          = Mrs. Bucket (daughter-in-law)<br>Charlie Bucket (grandson)\n}}\n'''Grandpa Joe Bucket''' is the third main character. He is one of Charlie's four bed-ridden grandparents. He tells Charlie (and the reader) the story of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and the mystery of the secret workers. When Charlie finds the Golden Ticket, Grandpa Joe leaps out of bed in joy and is chosen as the one to accompany Charlie in the tour of the factory. In the sequel book, he and all members of Charlie's family ride with Charlie and Wonka in the Great Glass Elevator and assists the rescue of the Commuter Capsule from the [[Vermicious Knids]]. Grandpa Joe's age is given as \"ninety-six and a half\" in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", making him the eldest of Charlie's grandparents, but in the musical, it is stated he is almost ninety and a half.\n \nThe character was played by [[Jack Albertson]] in the 1971 [[film adaptation]] ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''. In this film, he is often excitable, paranoid, and stubborn, and appears anxious that Charlie won the contest, and becomes angry when Charlie is dismissed without reward because they had violated the rules by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks and not following the tour, which indicated that Charlie violated the contract, before realizing that returning the everlasting gobstopper was the true test. He tells Charlie that he expects him to find all five Golden Tickets and most certainly expects Charlie to find one when he receives a Wonka Bar for his birthday.\n \nThe character was played by [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] in the 2005 film adaptation, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. Veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] was originally selected to play the role, but he died in 2003 before filming began. This version of the character is written as more calm than the 1971 version. An original backstory to Grandpa Joe's past was added to [[Tim Burton]]'s film, wherein it is said that Joe worked for Wonka until the latter fired all his workers from his factory due to constant corporate espionage by rival confectionery manufacturers. When he returns to the factory with Charlie for the tour, Wonka asks if he was a spy working for a competing factory, which Joe assures he wasn't.\n\n==Augustus Gloop==\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Augustus Gloop \n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = Michael B\u00f6llner (1971)<br>[[Philip Wiegratz]] (2005)\n| voice       = Philip Wiegratz ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />Rachel Butera (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Male\n| family      = Mr. Gloop (father)<br>Mrs. Gloop (mother)\n| nationality = German\n}}\n\n'''Augustus Gloop'''  is an obese, greedy, gluttonous 9-year-old boy, the first person to find a Golden Ticket and one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''. He hails from the fictional town of Dusselheim, Germany in the 1971 film, and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany in the 2005 film. His mother takes great pride in his gluttonous eating and seems to enjoy the attention of the media. In the novel and both films, he is portrayed as \"enormously fat\". Augustus is the first to be removed from the tour: while drinking from the Chocolate Room's Chocolate River, he accidentally falls into the river and is drawn through a pipe to the factory's Fudge Room. His parents are summoned to retrieve him from the mixing-machine. In the book, he is depicted leaving the factory extremely underweight from being squeezed in the pipe. \n\nIn the 1971 film, despite eating constantly, he has decent table manners, is not as obese as he is in the book, and is polite to Charlie and the other three finalists. He is portrayed by Michael B\u00f6llner in this film. Since B\u00f6llner could not speak fluent English at the time of the film's production, the 1971 Augustus has fewer lines and less screen time.\n\nIn the 2005 film, Augustus is always shown consuming chocolate. He has a [[binge eating disorder]] and often has food smeared on his face. He is a bully towards Charlie in the one instance when they interact, as Augustus offers Charlie a bite of his Wonka Bar and then retracts it, saying that Charlie should have brought some himself. As in the book, he is shown leaving the factory toward the end of the story; but in this version, he is his normal size, licking his fingers to remove the adherent chocolate that he is still coated in, to which his mother tells him to stop, but Augustus refuses, saying that \"he tastes so good.\" The actor, Philip Wiegratz, wore a fat suit for the production.\n\nIn the book, both of Augustus's parents accompany him to the factory. Both film versions contradict this, however, and only his mother goes with him.\n\nIn the 2013 London musical, Augustus Gloop is known as \"the Bavarian Beefcake\" in his Alpine community. His mother and father indulge his eating habits with sweets and pieces of sausage of which they (and sometimes Augustus) butcher themselves. In his number, \"More of Him to Love\", Frau Gloop reveals that she had vital organs removed to retrieve Augustus from the womb. They arrive at the factory wearing traditional Eastern European clothing, with Augustus in a red, argyle sweater and green shorts. When Augustus falls into the Chocolate River, Wonka summons the diversionary pumping system to divert the flow, while Oompa-Loompas dressed in red boiler suits sing, \"Auf Wiedersehen, Augustus Gloop\", as they prepare the chocolate, while Augustus travels through the main industrial pipe, occasionally getting stuck in it. The 2017 Broadway rendition of the musical does not largely alter the character, though he and all the other finalists (sans Charlie) are portrayed by adults. Further, Augustus's father is confirmed to be deceased; it is implied that Augustus actually devoured him.\n\n==Violet Beauregarde==\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Violet Beauregarde\n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| image       =\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = [[Denise Nickerson]] (1971)<br>[[AnnaSophia Robb]] (2005)\n| voice       = AnnaSophia Robb ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />Dallas Lovato (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Female\n| family      = Mr. Beauregarde (father)<br>Mrs. Beauregarde (mother)\n| nationality = American\n}}\n\n'''Violet Beauregarde''', a 10-year-old girl, is the third person to find a Golden Ticket, one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', and the second to be eliminated from the tour. She is the skillful, self-centered, rude, and a chewing gum-obsessed girl. Violet chews gum obsessively and boasts that she has been chewing the same piece \"for three months solid\", a world record which Violet proclaims was previously held by her best friend Cornelia Prinzmetel. She is also aggressively competitive, prideful, and has won trophies for gum chewing and other activities. She has brown hair in the 1971 film, while in the 2005 film, she has blonde hair. In the 1971 film, she is shown to be from [[Miles City, Montana|Miles City]], [[Montana]], while in the 2005 film, she is from [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\nWhen Wonka shows the group around the Inventing Room, he stops to display a new type of [[Chewing gum|gum]] he is working on. The gum doubles as a three-course meal which is composed of tomato soup, roast beef and baked potato, and blueberry pie and ice cream. Violet is intrigued and eager to try it out, despite Wonka's protests, snatches and chews the gum. She is delighted by its effects but, when she reaches the dessert, [[blueberry pie]], her skin starts turning a somewhat indigo color and her body begins to swell up, filling with blueberry juice. Eventually, Violet's head, legs, and arms get sucked into her gigantic body, but she is still mobile and is able to waddle. When her swelling stops, she resembles a [[blueberry]], causing Wonka to have the [[Oompa-Loompas]] roll her to the Juicing Room to have the juice squeezed out of her, in fear that she may explode. She is last seen leaving the factory with the other children, restored to her normal size and becomes more flexible, but her indigo skin remains, and is most likely permanent as Wonka says there is nothing that can be done to change Violet's skin back to its original pigment.\n\nIn the 1971 film, Violet is impatient, arrogant, self-centered, vain, and impulsive. She is accompanied by her father, Sam Beauregarde, a fast-talking car salesman and politician who tries to advertise his business during Violet's television interview. She demeans Cornelia Prinzmetel more than she did in the book. She is polite to everyone, with the exception of Veruca Salt, with whom she persistently argues. Her blueberry form is relatively small, and her hair color remains unchanged. Violet is informed that she must be juiced immediately before she explodes and is last seen <i>en route</i> to the Juicing Room, and her father follows after, crying, \"I've gotta <i>blueberry</i> for a daughter!\"\n\nIn the 2005 film, Violet (portrayed by [[AnnaSophia Robb]]) is 10 years old, has blonde hair, green eyes, and a rude and competitive personality. Aside from gum-chewing, she also has many other interests that reflect her obsession with always winning, such as in [[karate]]. She is accompanied by her single mother, Scarlett Beauregarde (a former baton champion herself), whose own competitive personality appears to have had an influence on her daughter, as Scarlett expresses pride over Violet's 263 trophies and medals. Cornelia Prinzmetel was not mentioned in this film. In this version, when she and Veruca interact with each other, they suggest being best friends, though they do not really like each other. Violet is also shown to be anti-social and bullying when she briefly insults Charlie, snatching a piece of confectionery from his hand and calling him a loser when he tries to interact with her. She turns blue, although her lips remain red, her eyes and hair turn blue, and swells up into a 12-foot blueberry before being rolled off to the Juicing Room by the [[Oompa-Loompas]] to prevent her from bursting. Violet is shown leaving the factory gymnastically [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheeling]] as a consequence of her increased flexibility, which she is actually happy about, although her mother is less than pleased with her daughter's possibly permanently indigo colour.\n\nIn the 2013 [[Sam Mendes]] London musical, Violet Beauregarde is portrayed as an African-American, Californian fame-hungry wannabe, with her agent/father Eugene Beauregarde parlaying her mundane talent of gum chewing into celebrity status, with multitude of endorsements including her own TV show, line of perfume, and a clothing boutique franchise. Her theme is called \"The Double-Bubble Duchess\". It is revealed that Violet's chewing \"skill\" was picked up when she was a baby and her mom tried to get her to stop talking all the time. Violet and her father are escorted by an entourage to the factory entrance. Violet comes dressed in a sparkly purple and pink disco jumper and a pink backpack. Upon swelling in the influence of the experimental gum (which consisted of tomato soup, roast chicken, potatoes and gravy, Fizzy Orange, cheese and crackers and blueberry pie), she panics and runs away as the Oompa-Loompas break into a disco number, \"Juicy\", and roller skate along the stage as Violet lifts into the air, resembling a giant purple disco ball. Mr. Beauregarde phones his lawyer excitedly, with intent to profit from Violet's new size, until Violet explodes. Wonka's only reassurance of her survival is the prospect of rescuing the pieces and de-juicing them. In the Broadway version, the song \"Juicy\" is cut out (the only child-exit song to be cut from the London version), and Violet instead becomes a blueberry and explodes in the background when an Oompa-Loompa blows an air-dart at her while Wonka explains how he met the Ooompa-Loompas to the group.\n\n==Veruca Salt==\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Veruca Salt\n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = [[Julie Dawn Cole]] (1971)<br>Julia Winter (2005)\n| voice       = Julia Winter ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />[[Emily O'Brien]] (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Female\n| family      = Mr. Salt (father)<br>Mrs. Salt (mother)\n| nationality = British<br>Russian (Broadway version)\n}}\n\n'''Veruca Salt''' is a greedy, demanding, stingy, spoiled brat and one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''. She demands every single thing she wants and is the second person to find a Golden Ticket and the third eliminated from the tour. A selfish, rotten brat who shows her wealthy family no mercy and has absolutely no regard for other people's property, Veruca frequently pesters her parents to purchase a variety of different objects for her; when the tour reached the Nut Room\u2014a room where trained squirrels test each nut to see if it is good or bad by tapping them with their knuckles-and Veruca demands her parents to buy one for herself, Wonka refused, so she goes in and get one for herself, but the squirrels grabbed her and declared her a bad nut; after that, both she and her parents are thrown down the garbage chute, all three Salts are seen exiting the factory \"covered in garbage\". In the 1971 film adaptation, Veruca has a fiery temper, rudely demands various desires nonstop, brags about her wealth, and chastises anyone who questions her. In this film, it is not squirrels but geese that lay special golden chocolate-filled eggs for Easter, one of which she demands as a new pet. She and Violet, in this film, bicker on two occasions. Veruca is eliminated at the end of her musical number in the film (\"[https://genius.com/Julie-dawn-cole-i-want-it-now-oompa-loompa-lyrics I Want it Now]\") after climbing a machine designed to tell whether or not the goose eggs are \"good\" or \"bad\" eggs, and it judges her as a bad one. Her father then follows and is also deemed bad. In the [[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory|'' Tom and Jerry'' version of the 1971 film]], Veruca and her father manage to escape the furnace right before it ignites while trapping [[Tom Cat|Tom]] inside. Veruca demands to be taken home and have her father make her a different chocolate factory, but Mr. Salt, having had enough of Veruca's spoiled and selfish behavior, finally decides to discipline her, as the near-death experience that they have both gone through seems to have finally gotten to him.\n\nIn the 2005 film adaptation, Veruca's elimination remains virtually the same as in the book and the Tom and Jerry version, with only a few changes made. Her demeanour is less vehement, but more obnoxious, compared to the 1971 version. In the 2005 film, it is revealed that she owns a pony, two dogs, four cats, six rabbits, two parakeets, three canaries, a parrot, a turtle, and a hamster, totalling up to 21 pets. But when she interferes with the trained [[squirrel]]s used by Willy Wonka to select the best nuts to bake into chocolate bars, she is judged as a \"bad nut\" by the squirrels and discarded into the adjacent garbage chute and her dad, being with her, follows suit. Both are later seen leaving the factory covered in garbage, with Veruca's father trying with extraordinary effort to contain his visible anger against her. When she sees the Great Glass Elevator, she demands one like it; however, instead of cheerfully catering to Veruca's demands like before, as he had been reformed by the Oompa-Loompas (whom he felt had taught him a good parenting lesson), Veruca's father tells her sternly and firmly that the ''only'' thing she will be getting that day \u201cis a bath, and that\u2019s final\u201d. Not only did he change his opinion of Veruca, but he also changed his ways of disciplining her by realizing that both he and his wife had been constantly spoiling her. When she speaks up, he fiercely glares at her, prompting her to be quiet.\n\nHer nationality was never specified in Dahl's novel, but she hails from an upper-class family in the [[United Kingdom]] in both films - in the 2005 film, she lives in [[Buckinghamshire]]. In the book, both of Veruca's parents accompany her to the factory. Both film versions contradict this, however, and have only her father go with her.\n\nIn the 2013 Sam Mendes London musical, Veruca Salt is a British billionaire's daughter, dressed in a pink ballerina tutu and baby seal fur coat - \"clubbed and tickled pink\". Her father, Sir Robert Salt, is portrayed as a spineless dolt for giving his daughter her wishes. In the Nut Sorting Room, Veruca runs foul of the nut-testing squirrels who deem her a 'bad nut' when she tries to steal one of them. This summons oversized squirrels with Oompa-Loompas riding on their backs. They sing a nightmarish ballet \"[http://www.themusicallyrics.com/c/278-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-the-musical/2311-verucas-nutcracker-sweet.html Veruca's Nutcracker Sweet]\" that concludes with Veruca and her father sent down the garbage chute; it has similar lyrics to the original book-although in the book version, both of Veruca parents follow her down the garbage chute. In the Broadway version, Veruca's nationality is changed to Russian, and the squirrels tear her apart limb by limb, but Wonka assures the group that the Ooompa-Loompas will be able to put her back together again.\n\n==Mike Teavee==\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Mike Teavee\n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = [[Paris Themmen]] (1971)<br>[[Jordan Fry]] (2005)\n| voice       = Jordan Fry ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br/>Lauren Weisman (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Male\n| family      = Mr. Teavee (father)<br>Mrs. Teavee (mother)\n| nationality = American\n}}\n'''Mike Teavee''' is a 9-year-old boy who does nothing but watch television, both the fourth Golden Ticket finder and the fourth to be eliminated from the tour, and one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''. He was described as adorned with 18 toy pistols that he \"fires\" while watching gangsters on TV. He is bad-tempered and slothful, but also intelligent. How he found his Golden Ticket is never explained in the book or 1971 film, as he is too absorbed in his television viewing to talk to the press about it. In the 2005 film, he does have an explanation on how he found the Golden Ticket: he used an [[algorithm]] to find it as an intellectual exercise. In the book, both of Mike's parents tour the factory with him. During a display of miniaturization technology, used to transport chocolate, Mike shrinks himself to a tiny size, Willy Wonka has an Oompa-Loompa take the Teavee family to the Gum-Stretcher Room to get Mike stretched back to normal. Mike is last seen exiting the factory, now {{convert|10|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall because the Oompa-Loompas had overstretched him. His last name resembles the word TV in connection to his love of electronics.\n\nIn the 1971 film, Mike is played by [[Paris Themmen]] and his surname is spelled \"Teevee\" in the credits. Mike is nine years old and accompanied to the factory by his high-strung mother. He is from the fictional town of Marble Falls, [[Arizona]], enjoys Western films and wears [[cowboy]] attire. He makes constant references to television shows throughout the factory tour and comes across as somewhat of a know-it-all. Although easily annoyed, he does not have any major anger issues and gets along relatively well with the other kids. After being shrunk to three inches, Mike is being taken to the Taffy Pulling Room to be stretched back to normal, which causes his mother to faint; unlike the book, he (on the advice of his mother) is receptive to Slugworth's bribe.\n\nIn the 2005 film, 13-year-old Mike is portrayed by [[Jordan Fry]], and his interests are updated to being very destructive, with the Internet and video games (especially gory first-person shooters), in addition to television viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/637654/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-s-Jordan-Fry-as-Mike-Teavee|title=You won't believe what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2019s Mike Teavee looks like now\u2026|first=Helen|last=Kelly|date=25 January 2016|website=Express.co.uk|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref> In this version, he is from [[Denver, Colorado]], is accompanied by his father, and is portrayed as more disrespectful and violent. In the Chocolate Room, when Wonka told everyone to enjoy his candy, he did not eat anything, instead he was stomping on a candy pumpkin, completely destroying it in the process, and when Mr. Teavee told him to stop, he ignores him with a brief sentence: \"Dad, he said 'enjoy'!\" Also, whenever he says something critical of Wonka's company, or his ideas, Wonka reacts as if Mike is mumbling, even though he does not. He is able to find the Golden Ticket by using math and logic, though he admits that he does not even like chocolate. When Mike demands to know why candy is pointless, Charlie tries to reason with him, saying candy does not have to have a point, then he demands that candy is a waste of time (like Wonka's father), but then Wonka's flashback reappears again. When they arrive in the Television Chocolate Room, Mike points that Wonka could use his teleportation device to revolutionize mankind, as opposed to distributing his products, ignoring the fact that anything sent by television gets shrunk. When Mr. Teavee tries to reason with his son, the boy insults Wonka and sends himself by television. After the incident in the Television Chocolate Room, Willy Wonka has an Oompa-Loompa take Mr. Teavee and Mike to the Taffy-Puller Room to have Mike stretched back to normal. When Mike and his father are later seen leaving the factory, Mike is {{convert|10|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall, as well as incredibly thin and flat.\n\nIn the 2013 Sam Mendes London musical, Mike Teavee (now age 10) lives in a suburban neighborhood with his disinterested father Norman Teavee and neurotic, alcoholic mother, Doris Teavee; in this version, he is wearing a black shirt with an orange jacket on the outside. Their opening number, \"It's Teavee Time!\" has Mrs. Teavee presenting her family as a normal, functioning household, downplaying Mike's violent tendencies like setting a cat on fire, chloroforming a nurse, and stealing a German tank. In the Department of the Future, where Wonka transmits chocolate by television, Mike jumps into the machine and transmits himself, much to his mother's horror. Wonka summons the monitors to see on which channel Mike has ended, as the Oompa-Loompas rave around the room, singing, \"Vidiots\". Near the end, Mrs. Teavee joins the rave, as they conclude that Mike still has a future on \"mike.com\". When Mike is shrunk as a result of the transporter, Mrs. Teavee happily takes him home, as he can no longer cause trouble and she can take care of him like when he was a baby. In the Broadway version of the musical, Mike hails from [[Iowa]], and the lyrics in Mike's song and some of Mike's mannerisms reference [[Donald Trump]].\n\n==Arthur Slugworth==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Arthur Slugworth\n| series    = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]] (1971)<br>Philip Philmar (2005)\n| voice     = [[Walker Edmiston]] (1971, uncredited), [[Mick Wingert]] (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender    = Male\n}}\nIn the book, '''Arthur Slugworth''' is one of [[Willy Wonka]]'s rival chocolatiers. Slugworth, along with Wonka's other rivals Mr. Fickelgruber and Mr. Prodnose, sent in spies to steal the secret recipes to Wonka's treats, which he plagiarized, nearly ruining Wonka's factory. After Wonka re-opens his factory (operated exclusively by the [[#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompas]]), Slugworth is never heard from again, but it is stated that Fickelgruber would give each of his front teeth to enter Wonka's inventing room (laboratory/chocolate room in the book) for three minutes. In the 1971 movie, Willy Wonka states that Slugworth would give his false teeth to get in for just five minutes.\n\nSlugworth has a much larger role as an enigmatic villain in the 1971 film. Inside Bill's Candy Shop, Wonka's products and signs are the most visible; but Slugworth's Sizzlers are also prominent, and one is even sold to a child. Also seen are signs for Fickelgruber's candy. Grandpa Joe describes Slugworth as the worst of Wonka's rivals. As each Golden Ticket is found, a sinister man approaches the finder and whispers something into his or her ear. After Charlie finds the last ticket, the same man approaches Charlie as well, introduces himself as Arthur Slugworth, and offers the child a bribe to bring him one piece of the newly invented 'Everlasting Gobstopper', allowing him to plagiarize the formula and prevent the future invention from ruining his business. Two of the children (Veruca and Mike) respond to Slugworth's bribe; but Charlie, when tempted, returns the Everlasting Gobstopper to Wonka. Wonka eventually reveals that the tempter is not Slugworth, but his own employee '''Mr. Wilkinson''', and that his offer was a moral test of character. Slugworth/Wilkinson was played by [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]], a [[West Germany|West German]] actor, while his speaking voice is provided by an uncredited [[Walker Edmiston]].\n\nSlugworth only makes a split-second appearance in Tim Burton's ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' where he, alongside Mr. Ficklegruber and Mr. Prodnose, are sending spies to steal ingredients from Wonka's factory. He is here played by Philip Philmar.\n\nIn the ''Tom and Jerry'' version of the 1971 film, Slugworth is the main antagonist, instead of an enigmatic villain. When he first meets Charlie, he sings a cover of Veruca's song \"I Want it Now!\" and also sings it as a duet with Veruca during her downfall. He teams up with [[Spike and Tyke (characters)|Spike]] to steal a Gobstopper from the factory, but the two are thwarted by Charlie, Tom, and Jerry. Despite being more emphasized as a villain, he is still revealed to be Wonka's employee Mr. Wilkinson, much to Tom and Jerry's dismay. Nevertheless, the cat and mouse get the last word on Slugworth/Wilkinson (and Spike) by shrinking them with the Wonkavision.\n\n==Mr. Turkentine==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Mr. Turkentine\n| series    = Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[David Battley]] (1971)\n| voice     = [[David Battley]]\n| gender    = Male\n}}\n'''Mr. Turkentine''' is Charlie Bucket's school teacher and appears in the 1971 film, but not in the book or the 2005 film. He has an odd sense of humor, which he uses to express knowledge. He asks Charlie to assist him in making a medicine using several scientific elements for the class, but the project is interrupted due to the frantic Golden Ticket search for Willy Wonka. Mr. Turkentine, when hearing the news about the Golden Tickets during the project, dismisses the class and runs out. Later, when it is revealed that all of the tickets have supposedly been found ending with a Paraguayan millionaire, he decides to use Wonka bars as an example to teach his class about percentages. He uses a few students as examples for the class, including Charlie. Charlie, however, reveals that he only opened two Wonka bars during the search and so, to help make it easier for his class, he decides to pretend that Charlie opened 200. Mr. Turkentine is played by British actor [[David Battley]].\n\n==Prince Pondicherry==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Prince Pondicherry\n| series    = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[Nitin Ganatra]] (2005)\n| gender    = Male\n}}\n'''Prince Pondicherry''' is a prince who lives in India. He appears in the third chapter of the novel when Grandpa Joe is telling Charlie a story. In the story, [[Willy Wonka]] makes him a chocolate [[palace]] in India, and advises him to eat it before it melts. He does not take this advice, insisting that he intends to live in the palace, which later melts in the heat from the sun. His name derives from the city of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] (officially spelled Puducherry since 2006) in southeastern India.\n\nHe is absent from the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 film version]], but makes a brief appearance in Tim Burton's ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', where he is played by [[Nitin Ganatra]]. His story here matches that in the book, except in depicting his wife ([[Shelley Conn]]) and stating that the Prince demanded a second palace, but was refused, due to Wonka dealing with problems of his own at the time that involved spies sent by his rivals. In the 2013 musical, he drowns in the melted chocolate from his palace, along with his wife.\n\n=={{Visible anchor|The Oompa-Loompas}}==<!-- Other articles link here. -->\nThe '''Oompa-Loompas''' are small humans who were preyed upon by the various predators\nthat also reside in Loompaland before Wonka invited them to work at his factory. They are paid in their favorite food, [[cocoa bean]]s, which were extremely rare on their island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/UCB_McNair_Journal_2012_wc.pdf|format=PDF|title=Deconstructing Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory : Race, Labor, and the Changing Depictions of the Oompa-Loompas|author=Chryl Corbin|website=Ourenvironment,berkely.edu|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160912-the-dark-side-of-roald-dahl|title=The dark side of Roald Dahl|first=Hephzibah|last=Anderson|website=Bbc.com|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref> The Oompa-Loompas are also mischievous, loving to play practical jokes and singing songs which, according to Wonka, they are very good at improvising. They sing a song at the end of each child's comeuppance.\n\nIn early editions of the novel, the Oompa-Loompas (originally called \"Whipple-Scrumpets\" before publication)<ref name=Slate-Characters>{{cite web|last1=Slate|first1=Jeff|title=CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY 50 YEARS LATER|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-images|work=Esquire|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> are shown as African [[Pygmy peoples|pygmies]], before Dahl rewrote them to be white-skinned and golden-haired. In both editions, despite working in the factory, the Oompa-Loompas insist on maintaining their native clothing: men wear animal skins, women wear leaves, and children wear nothing.\n\nIn the 1971 film, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', they were written to be played by actors with [[dwarfism]] and are portrayed as orange-skinned, green-haired men in striped shirts and baggy [[lederhosen]]-like pants. Prominent portrayers included [[Angelo Muscat]], [[Rusty Goffe]], [[George Claydon]], Rudy Borgstaller, Jo Kilkenny, Andy Wilday, [[Malcolm Dixon (actor)|Malcolm Dixon]], Ismed Hassan, Norman Mcglen, Pepe Poupee, Marcus Powell, Akary, Romana, and Albert Wilkinson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/27/1|title=My life as an Oompa Loompa: 'Willy Wonka was my first and favourite film'|first=Rusty|last=Goffe|date=27 July 2005|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2005 film, the Oompa-Loompas are all played by [[Deep Roy]] and are virtually identical. They wear their tribal clothing during their time in Loompaland, and typical factory worker uniforms in Wonka's factory. Some of the female Oompa-Loompas, like Doris, work in the administration offices. In the reboot, Willy Wonka explained to the visitors how the Oompa-Loompas were hired to work in the factory.\n\n==The Vermicious Knids==\nThe '''Vermicious Knids''' are a fictional species of amorphous aliens that invade the \"Space Hotel USA\" in [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]''.\n\nThey are also mentioned in the 1971 feature film adaptation, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', but only as predators of the Oompa-Loompas.\n\nIn the book, Vermicious Knids are huge, dark, egg-shaped predators who swallow their victims whole, and are capable of surviving in the vacuum of space. Although normally oviform, they can assume any shape at will, while retaining their native texture and features. They originate (according to Mr. Wonka) on the planet Vermes, a fictional planet located (in dialogue) {{convert|184270000000|mi|abbr=off|sigfig=5}} from Earth (52 times [[Pluto|Pluto's]] distance). In the presence of victims, they cannot resist shaping themselves to spell out the word \"SCRAM\" (the only Earth word that they know) before they attack. They are stated to be extremely voracious, having devoured an entire race that once lived on the Moon, and they only avoid Earth because entering the atmosphere causes them to burn up via atmospheric friction. \n\nIn ''Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator'', a swarm of Knids take possession of the new \"Space Hotel USA\". When the transport capsule brings the staff to the Space Hotel, the Knids consume some of the staff, and the survivors retreat to the capsule. There, the Knids bludgeon the capsule with their own bodies, until its [[Retrorocket|retrorocket]]s are useless; whereupon Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe connect the capsule to the Elevator, in hope of towing it to Earth, and one Knid wraps itself around the Elevator while the others form a chain, intending to draw the Elevator and the capsule to their home planet. The Elevator then returns to Earth, and the Knids are incinerated in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWhen [[Nestl\u00e9]] created its interpretation of Wonka's world to sell chocolate bars under the name \"Wonka\", they released a number of downloadable [[Adobe Flash Player|flash]] games, wherein Knids seemed to have entered the factory and had the appearance of flying green blobs with single red eyes.\n\nThe etymology of the name was not provided by Dahl. Pronunciation of ''Knid'' is said in the book to approximate adding a [[schwa]] between the \"K\" and \"nid\", or in Dahl's words, \"K'nid\". [[Cnidaria]] is the name of the taxonomic [[phylum]] containing stinging aquatic invertebrates such as [[jellyfish]] and [[coral]]s, in turn derived from the [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] word for [[Urtica|nettle]], \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7. ''Vermicious'' is a real word, meaning \"worm-like\".\n\nThe Vermicious Knids are also mentioned in other Dahl stories, including ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (where the [[New York City Police Department]] misidentify Miss Spider as one) and ''[[The Minpins]]''.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Portrayed in other media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" \n!

Wonka holds a contest, hiding 5 Golden Tickets within the wrappers of his chocolate bars, promising their finders a tour of his factory and a lifelong supply of his creations. \n\nWonka has a black goatee and \"marvelously\" bright eyes, a high and \"flutey\" voice, a face \"alight of fun and laughter\", and quick little jerky movements \"like a squirrel\". He is enthusiastic, talkative, friendly and charming, but is sometimes insensitive and has been given to glossing self-criticism.\n\nIn the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'', he is portrayed by [[Gene Wilder]]. While his personality remains generally the same as in the original, he is more melancholy here, and frequently quotes books and poems, including [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (\"Is it my soul that calls upon my name?\") or [[John Masefield]]'s \"[[Sea-Fever]]\" (\"All I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by\"), and the famous \"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker\" from \"Reflections on Ice-Breaking\" by [[Ogden Nash]], among many others. Toward the end of the film, he tests Charlie's conscience by reprimanding him and pretending to deny him any reward but assumes an almost paternal role when Charlie proves to be honest after all.\n\nIn the 2005 film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', he is portrayed by [[Johnny Depp]]. In this version, a backstory was added that Willy Wonka's father (being a dentist) would not let him eat sweets because of the potential risk to his teeth, and that the young Wonka left home to become a chocolatier.\n\n==Charlie Bucket==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Charlie Bucket\n| series    = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[Peter Ostrum]] (1971)<br>[[Freddie Highmore]] (2005)\n| voice     = Freddie Highmore ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />Lincoln Melcher (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender    = Male\n| family    = Mr. Bucket (father)<br>Mrs. Bucket (mother)\n| relatives = Joe Bucket (grandfather) <br> Josephine Bucket (grandmother) <br> George [surname unknown] (grandfather)<br> Georgina [surname unknown] (grandmother)\n}}\n'''Charlie Bucket''' is the second main character of ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', its sequel ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]'', and the film adaptations of these books.<ref name=20170913theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/13/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-hero-originally-black-roald-dahl|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory hero 'was originally black'|first=Haroon|last=Siddique|date=13 September 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> He is depicted as a kind-hearted and selfless boy who lives with his mother, father and his four grandparents. In 1971, he has a newspaper route after school. He and his family follow the progress of the hunt for the Golden Tickets in newspapers and television. Unlike the first four finalists, Charlie is honest and generous; he is actually worried if the other nasty children such as Augustus and Veruca will actually be alive after their ordeals. In the 1971 film, Charlie was portrayed by [[Peter Ostrum]], in his only film appearance. His nationality is never explicitly stated, but in the 1971 film, he speaks with an American accent, and in the 2005 film, he speaks with an English accent. The filmmakers have stated that it was their intention that Charlie's hometown be kept ambiguous. In this version, when Grandpa Joe decided to accompany Charlie to the factory, Charlie explains that the family needs the money now, instead of the ticket; then Grandpa George explains the reason why Charlie still has to go to the factory, and indeed he and Grandpa Joe do go.\n\nIn the novel, at the end of the tour, Wonka declares Charlie the heir to the factory for his refusal of vice, and Charlie's family are permitted to move into the factory. In the 1971 film, Charlie wins the factory when he returns an Everlasting Gobstopper given to him by Wonka, thereby passing Wonka's moral test. In the 2005 film, Wonka initially refuses to allow Charlie's family to join them in the factory, and Charlie rejects Wonka's offer. When Charlie helps Wonka reconcile with his father, the family move into the factory, and Charlie and Wonka both became partners.\n\n\n==Grandpa Joe Bucket==\n \n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Grandpa Joe\n| series             = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first              = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator            = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer          = [[Jack Albertson]] (1971)<br>[[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] (2005)<br>[[Nigel Planer]], [[Barry James]] ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (musical)|2013]])<br>[[John Rubinstein]] ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (musical)|2017]])\n| voice              = David Kelly ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />[[Jess Harnell]] (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender             = Male\n| spouse             = Josephine Bucket (wife)\n| children           = Mr. Bucket (son)\n| relatives          = Mrs. Bucket (daughter-in-law)<br>Charlie Bucket (grandson)\n}}\n'''Grandpa Joe Bucket''' is the third main character. He is one of Charlie's four bed-ridden grandparents. He tells Charlie (and the reader) the story of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and the mystery of the secret workers. When Charlie finds the Golden Ticket, Grandpa Joe leaps out of bed in joy and is chosen as the one to accompany Charlie in the tour of the factory. In the sequel book, he and all members of Charlie's family ride with Charlie and Wonka in the Great Glass Elevator and assists the rescue of the Commuter Capsule from the [[Vermicious Knids]]. Grandpa Joe's age is given as \"ninety-six and a half\" in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", making him the eldest of Charlie's grandparents, but in the musical, it is stated he is almost ninety and a half.\n \nThe character was played by [[Jack Albertson]] in the 1971 [[film adaptation]] ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''. In this film, he is often excitable, paranoid, and stubborn, and appears anxious that Charlie won the contest, and becomes angry when Charlie is dismissed without reward because they had violated the rules by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks and not following the tour, which indicated that Charlie violated the contract, before realizing that returning the everlasting gobstopper was the true test. He tells Charlie that he expects him to find all five Golden Tickets and most certainly expects Charlie to find one when he receives a Wonka Bar for his birthday.\n \nThe character was played by [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] in the 2005 film adaptation, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. Veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] was originally selected to play the role, but he died in 2003 before filming began. This version of the character is written as more calm than the 1971 version. An original backstory to Grandpa Joe's past was added to [[Tim Burton]]'s film, wherein it is said that Joe worked for Wonka until the latter fired all his workers from his factory due to constant corporate espionage by rival confectionery manufacturers. When he returns to the factory with Charlie for the tour, Wonka asks if he was a spy working for a competing factory, which Joe assures he wasn't.\n\n==Augustus Gloop==\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Augustus Gloop \n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = Michael B\u00f6llner (1971)<br>[[Philip Wiegratz]] (2005)\n| voice       = Philip Wiegratz ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />Rachel Butera (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Male\n| family      = Mr. Gloop (father)<br>Mrs. Gloop (mother)\n| nationality = German\n}}\n\n'''Augustus Gloop'''  is an obese, greedy, gluttonous 9-year-old boy, the first person to find a Golden Ticket and one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''. He hails from the fictional town of Dusselheim, Germany in the 1971 film, and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany in the 2005 film. His mother takes great pride in his gluttonous eating and seems to enjoy the attention of the media. In the novel and both films, he is portrayed as \"enormously fat\". Augustus is the first to be removed from the tour: while drinking from the Chocolate Room's Chocolate River, he accidentally falls into the river and is drawn through a pipe to the factory's Fudge Room. His parents are summoned to retrieve him from the mixing-machine. In the book, he is depicted leaving the factory extremely underweight from being squeezed in the pipe. \n\nIn the 1971 film, despite eating constantly, he has decent table manners, is not as obese as he is in the book, and is polite to Charlie and the other three finalists. He is portrayed by Michael B\u00f6llner in this film. Since B\u00f6llner could not speak fluent English at the time of the film's production, the 1971 Augustus has fewer lines and less screen time.\n\nIn the 2005 film, Augustus is always shown consuming chocolate. He has a [[binge eating disorder]] and often has food smeared on his face. He is a bully towards Charlie in the one instance when they interact, as Augustus offers Charlie a bite of his Wonka Bar and then retracts it, saying that Charlie should have brought some himself. As in the book, he is shown leaving the factory toward the end of the story; but in this version, he is his normal size, licking his fingers to remove the adherent chocolate that he is still coated in, to which his mother tells him to stop, but Augustus refuses, saying that \"he tastes so good.\" The actor, Philip Wiegratz, wore a fat suit for the production.\n\nIn the book, both of Augustus's parents accompany him to the factory. Both film versions contradict this, however, and only his mother goes with him.\n\nIn the 2013 London musical, Augustus Gloop is known as \"the Bavarian Beefcake\" in his Alpine community. His mother and father indulge his eating habits with sweets and pieces of sausage of which they (and sometimes Augustus) butcher themselves. In his number, \"More of Him to Love\", Frau Gloop reveals that she had vital organs removed to retrieve Augustus from the womb. They arrive at the factory wearing traditional Eastern European clothing, with Augustus in a red, argyle sweater and green shorts. When Augustus falls into the Chocolate River, Wonka summons the diversionary pumping system to divert the flow, while Oompa-Loompas dressed in red boiler suits sing, \"Auf Wiedersehen, Augustus Gloop\", as they prepare the chocolate, while Augustus travels through the main industrial pipe, occasionally getting stuck in it. The 2017 Broadway rendition of the musical does not largely alter the character, though he and all the other finalists (sans Charlie) are portrayed by adults. Further, Augustus's father is confirmed to be deceased; it is implied that Augustus actually devoured him.\n\n==Violet Beauregarde==\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Violet Beauregarde\n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| image       =\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = [[Denise Nickerson]] (1971)<br>[[AnnaSophia Robb]] (2005)\n| voice       = AnnaSophia Robb ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />Dallas Lovato (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Female\n| family      = Mr. Beauregarde (father)<br>Mrs. Beauregarde (mother)\n| nationality = American\n}}\n\n'''Violet Beauregarde''', a 10-year-old girl, is the third person to find a Golden Ticket, one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', and the second to be eliminated from the tour. She is the skillful, self-centered, rude, and a chewing gum-obsessed girl. Violet chews gum obsessively and boasts that she has been chewing the same piece \"for three months solid\", a world record which Violet proclaims was previously held by her best friend Cornelia Prinzmetel. She is also aggressively competitive, prideful, and has won trophies for gum chewing and other activities. She has brown hair in the 1971 film, while in the 2005 film, she has blonde hair. In the 1971 film, she is shown to be from [[Miles City, Montana|Miles City]], [[Montana]], while in the 2005 film, she is from [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\nWhen Wonka shows the group around the Inventing Room, he stops to display a new type of [[Chewing gum|gum]] he is working on. The gum doubles as a three-course meal which is composed of tomato soup, roast beef and baked potato, and blueberry pie and ice cream. Violet is intrigued and eager to try it out, despite Wonka's protests, snatches and chews the gum. She is delighted by its effects but, when she reaches the dessert, [[blueberry pie]], her skin starts turning a somewhat indigo color and her body begins to swell up, filling with blueberry juice. Eventually, Violet's head, legs, and arms get sucked into her gigantic body, but she is still mobile and is able to waddle. When her swelling stops, she resembles a [[blueberry]], causing Wonka to have the [[Oompa-Loompas]] roll her to the Juicing Room to have the juice squeezed out of her, in fear that she may explode. She is last seen leaving the factory with the other children, restored to her normal size and becomes more flexible, but her indigo skin remains, and is most likely permanent as Wonka says there is nothing that can be done to change Violet's skin back to its original pigment.\n\nIn the 1971 film, Violet is impatient, arrogant, self-centered, vain, and impulsive. She is accompanied by her father, Sam Beauregarde, a fast-talking car salesman and politician who tries to advertise his business during Violet's television interview. She demeans Cornelia Prinzmetel more than she did in the book. She is polite to everyone, with the exception of Veruca Salt, with whom she persistently argues. Her blueberry form is relatively small, and her hair color remains unchanged. Violet is informed that she must be juiced immediately before she explodes and is last seen <i>en route</i> to the Juicing Room, and her father follows after, crying, \"I've gotta <i>blueberry</i> for a daughter!\"\n\nIn the 2005 film, Violet (portrayed by [[AnnaSophia Robb]]) is 10 years old, has blonde hair, green eyes, and a rude and competitive personality. Aside from gum-chewing, she also has many other interests that reflect her obsession with always winning, such as in [[karate]]. She is accompanied by her single mother, Scarlett Beauregarde (a former baton champion herself), whose own competitive personality appears to have had an influence on her daughter, as Scarlett expresses pride over Violet's 263 trophies and medals. Cornelia Prinzmetel was not mentioned in this film. In this version, when she and Veruca interact with each other, they suggest being best friends, though they do not really like each other. Violet is also shown to be anti-social and bullying when she briefly insults Charlie, snatching a piece of confectionery from his hand and calling him a loser when he tries to interact with her. She turns blue, although her lips remain red, her eyes and hair turn blue, and swells up into a 12-foot blueberry before being rolled off to the Juicing Room by the [[Oompa-Loompas]] to prevent her from bursting. Violet is shown leaving the factory gymnastically [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheeling]] as a consequence of her increased flexibility, which she is actually happy about, although her mother is less than pleased with her daughter's possibly permanently indigo colour.\n\nIn the 2013 [[Sam Mendes]] London musical, Violet Beauregarde is portrayed as an African-American, Californian fame-hungry wannabe, with her agent/father Eugene Beauregarde parlaying her mundane talent of gum chewing into celebrity status, with multitude of endorsements including her own TV show, line of perfume, and a clothing boutique franchise. Her theme is called \"The Double-Bubble Duchess\". It is revealed that Violet's chewing \"skill\" was picked up when she was a baby and her mom tried to get her to stop talking all the time. Violet and her father are escorted by an entourage to the factory entrance. Violet comes dressed in a sparkly purple and pink disco jumper and a pink backpack. Upon swelling in the influence of the experimental gum (which consisted of tomato soup, roast chicken, potatoes and gravy, Fizzy Orange, cheese and crackers and blueberry pie), she panics and runs away as the Oompa-Loompas break into a disco number, \"Juicy\", and roller skate along the stage as Violet lifts into the air, resembling a giant purple disco ball. Mr. Beauregarde phones his lawyer excitedly, with intent to profit from Violet's new size, until Violet explodes. Wonka's only reassurance of her survival is the prospect of rescuing the pieces and de-juicing them. In the Broadway version, the song \"Juicy\" is cut out (the only child-exit song to be cut from the London version), and Violet instead becomes a blueberry and explodes in the background when an Oompa-Loompa blows an air-dart at her while Wonka explains how he met the Ooompa-Loompas to the group.\n\n==Veruca Salt==\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Veruca Salt\n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = [[Julie Dawn Cole]] (1971)<br>Julia Winter (2005)\n| voice       = Julia Winter ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br />[[Emily O'Brien]] (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Female\n| family      = Mr. Salt (father)<br>Mrs. Salt (mother)\n| nationality = British<br>Russian (Broadway version)\n}}\n\n'''Veruca Salt''' is a greedy, demanding, stingy, spoiled brat and one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''. She demands every single thing she wants and is the second person to find a Golden Ticket and the third eliminated from the tour. A selfish, rotten brat who shows her wealthy family no mercy and has absolutely no regard for other people's property, Veruca frequently pesters her parents to purchase a variety of different objects for her; when the tour reached the Nut Room\u2014a room where trained squirrels test each nut to see if it is good or bad by tapping them with their knuckles-and Veruca demands her parents to buy one for herself, Wonka refused, so she goes in and get one for herself, but the squirrels grabbed her and declared her a bad nut; after that, both she and her parents are thrown down the garbage chute, all three Salts are seen exiting the factory \"covered in garbage\". In the 1971 film adaptation, Veruca has a fiery temper, rudely demands various desires nonstop, brags about her wealth, and chastises anyone who questions her. In this film, it is not squirrels but geese that lay special golden chocolate-filled eggs for Easter, one of which she demands as a new pet. She and Violet, in this film, bicker on two occasions. Veruca is eliminated at the end of her musical number in the film (\"[https://genius.com/Julie-dawn-cole-i-want-it-now-oompa-loompa-lyrics I Want it Now]\") after climbing a machine designed to tell whether or not the goose eggs are \"good\" or \"bad\" eggs, and it judges her as a bad one. Her father then follows and is also deemed bad. In the [[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory|'' Tom and Jerry'' version of the 1971 film]], Veruca and her father manage to escape the furnace right before it ignites while trapping [[Tom Cat|Tom]] inside. Veruca demands to be taken home and have her father make her a different chocolate factory, but Mr. Salt, having had enough of Veruca's spoiled and selfish behavior, finally decides to discipline her, as the near-death experience that they have both gone through seems to have finally gotten to him.\n\nIn the 2005 film adaptation, Veruca's elimination remains virtually the same as in the book and the Tom and Jerry version, with only a few changes made. Her demeanour is less vehement, but more obnoxious, compared to the 1971 version. In the 2005 film, it is revealed that she owns a pony, two dogs, four cats, six rabbits, two parakeets, three canaries, a parrot, a turtle, and a hamster, totalling up to 21 pets. But when she interferes with the trained [[squirrel]]s used by Willy Wonka to select the best nuts to bake into chocolate bars, she is judged as a \"bad nut\" by the squirrels and discarded into the adjacent garbage chute and her dad, being with her, follows suit. Both are later seen leaving the factory covered in garbage, with Veruca's father trying with extraordinary effort to contain his visible anger against her. When she sees the Great Glass Elevator, she demands one like it; however, instead of cheerfully catering to Veruca's demands like before, as he had been reformed by the Oompa-Loompas (whom he felt had taught him a good parenting lesson), Veruca's father tells her sternly and firmly that the ''only'' thing she will be getting that day \u201cis a bath, and that\u2019s final\u201d. Not only did he change his opinion of Veruca, but he also changed his ways of disciplining her by realizing that both he and his wife had been constantly spoiling her. When she speaks up, he fiercely glares at her, prompting her to be quiet.\n\nHer nationality was never specified in Dahl's novel, but she hails from an upper-class family in the [[United Kingdom]] in both films - in the 2005 film, she lives in [[Buckinghamshire]]. In the book, both of Veruca's parents accompany her to the factory. Both film versions contradict this, however, and have only her father go with her.\n\nIn the 2013 Sam Mendes London musical, Veruca Salt is a British billionaire's daughter, dressed in a pink ballerina tutu and baby seal fur coat - \"clubbed and tickled pink\". Her father, Sir Robert Salt, is portrayed as a spineless dolt for giving his daughter her wishes. In the Nut Sorting Room, Veruca runs foul of the nut-testing squirrels who deem her a 'bad nut' when she tries to steal one of them. This summons oversized squirrels with Oompa-Loompas riding on their backs. They sing a nightmarish ballet \"[http://www.themusicallyrics.com/c/278-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-the-musical/2311-verucas-nutcracker-sweet.html Veruca's Nutcracker Sweet]\" that concludes with Veruca and her father sent down the garbage chute; it has similar lyrics to the original book-although in the book version, both of Veruca parents follow her down the garbage chute. In the Broadway version, Veruca's nationality is changed to Russian, and the squirrels tear her apart limb by limb, but Wonka assures the group that the Ooompa-Loompas will be able to put her back together again.\n\n==Mike Teavee==\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Mike Teavee\n| series      = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first       = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator     = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer   = [[Paris Themmen]] (1971)<br>[[Jordan Fry]] (2005)\n| voice       = Jordan Fry ([[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005 video game)|2005 video game]])<br/>Lauren Weisman (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender      = Male\n| family      = Mr. Teavee (father)<br>Mrs. Teavee (mother)\n| nationality = American\n}}\n'''Mike Teavee''' is a 9-year-old boy who does nothing but watch television, both the fourth Golden Ticket finder and the fourth to be eliminated from the tour, and one of the four main antagonists of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''. He was described as adorned with 18 toy pistols that he \"fires\" while watching gangsters on TV. He is bad-tempered and slothful, but also intelligent. How he found his Golden Ticket is never explained in the book or 1971 film, as he is too absorbed in his television viewing to talk to the press about it. In the 2005 film, he does have an explanation on how he found the Golden Ticket: he used an [[algorithm]] to find it as an intellectual exercise. In the book, both of Mike's parents tour the factory with him. During a display of miniaturization technology, used to transport chocolate, Mike shrinks himself to a tiny size, Willy Wonka has an Oompa-Loompa take the Teavee family to the Gum-Stretcher Room to get Mike stretched back to normal. Mike is last seen exiting the factory, now {{convert|10|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall because the Oompa-Loompas had overstretched him. His last name resembles the word TV in connection to his love of electronics.\n\nIn the 1971 film, Mike is played by [[Paris Themmen]] and his surname is spelled \"Teevee\" in the credits. Mike is nine years old and accompanied to the factory by his high-strung mother. He is from the fictional town of Marble Falls, [[Arizona]], enjoys Western films and wears [[cowboy]] attire. He makes constant references to television shows throughout the factory tour and comes across as somewhat of a know-it-all. Although easily annoyed, he does not have any major anger issues and gets along relatively well with the other kids. After being shrunk to three inches, Mike is being taken to the Taffy Pulling Room to be stretched back to normal, which causes his mother to faint; unlike the book, he (on the advice of his mother) is receptive to Slugworth's bribe.\n\nIn the 2005 film, 13-year-old Mike is portrayed by [[Jordan Fry]], and his interests are updated to being very destructive, with the Internet and video games (especially gory first-person shooters), in addition to television viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/637654/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-s-Jordan-Fry-as-Mike-Teavee|title=You won't believe what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2019s Mike Teavee looks like now\u2026|first=Helen|last=Kelly|date=25 January 2016|website=Express.co.uk|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref> In this version, he is from [[Denver, Colorado]], is accompanied by his father, and is portrayed as more disrespectful and violent. In the Chocolate Room, when Wonka told everyone to enjoy his candy, he did not eat anything, instead he was stomping on a candy pumpkin, completely destroying it in the process, and when Mr. Teavee told him to stop, he ignores him with a brief sentence: \"Dad, he said 'enjoy'!\" Also, whenever he says something critical of Wonka's company, or his ideas, Wonka reacts as if Mike is mumbling, even though he does not. He is able to find the Golden Ticket by using math and logic, though he admits that he does not even like chocolate. When Mike demands to know why candy is pointless, Charlie tries to reason with him, saying candy does not have to have a point, then he demands that candy is a waste of time (like Wonka's father), but then Wonka's flashback reappears again. When they arrive in the Television Chocolate Room, Mike points that Wonka could use his teleportation device to revolutionize mankind, as opposed to distributing his products, ignoring the fact that anything sent by television gets shrunk. When Mr. Teavee tries to reason with his son, the boy insults Wonka and sends himself by television. After the incident in the Television Chocolate Room, Willy Wonka has an Oompa-Loompa take Mr. Teavee and Mike to the Taffy-Puller Room to have Mike stretched back to normal. When Mike and his father are later seen leaving the factory, Mike is {{convert|10|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall, as well as incredibly thin and flat.\n\nIn the 2013 Sam Mendes London musical, Mike Teavee (now age 10) lives in a suburban neighborhood with his disinterested father Norman Teavee and neurotic, alcoholic mother, Doris Teavee; in this version, he is wearing a black shirt with an orange jacket on the outside. Their opening number, \"It's Teavee Time!\" has Mrs. Teavee presenting her family as a normal, functioning household, downplaying Mike's violent tendencies like setting a cat on fire, chloroforming a nurse, and stealing a German tank. In the Department of the Future, where Wonka transmits chocolate by television, Mike jumps into the machine and transmits himself, much to his mother's horror. Wonka summons the monitors to see on which channel Mike has ended, as the Oompa-Loompas rave around the room, singing, \"Vidiots\". Near the end, Mrs. Teavee joins the rave, as they conclude that Mike still has a future on \"mike.com\". When Mike is shrunk as a result of the transporter, Mrs. Teavee happily takes him home, as he can no longer cause trouble and she can take care of him like when he was a baby. In the Broadway version of the musical, Mike hails from [[Iowa]], and the lyrics in Mike's song and some of Mike's mannerisms reference [[Donald Trump]].\n\n==Arthur Slugworth==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Arthur Slugworth\n| series    = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]] (1971)<br>Philip Philmar (2005)\n| voice     = [[Walker Edmiston]] (1971, uncredited), [[Mick Wingert]] (''[[Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'')\n| gender    = Male\n}}\nIn the book, '''Arthur Slugworth''' is one of [[Willy Wonka]]'s rival chocolatiers. Slugworth, along with Wonka's other rivals Mr. Fickelgruber and Mr. Prodnose, sent in spies to steal the secret recipes to Wonka's treats, which he plagiarized, nearly ruining Wonka's factory. After Wonka re-opens his factory (operated exclusively by the [[#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompas]]), Slugworth is never heard from again, but it is stated that Fickelgruber would give each of his front teeth to enter Wonka's inventing room (laboratory/chocolate room in the book) for three minutes. In the 1971 movie, Willy Wonka states that Slugworth would give his false teeth to get in for just five minutes.\n\nSlugworth has a much larger role as an enigmatic villain in the 1971 film. Inside Bill's Candy Shop, Wonka's products and signs are the most visible; but Slugworth's Sizzlers are also prominent, and one is even sold to a child. Also seen are signs for Fickelgruber's candy. Grandpa Joe describes Slugworth as the worst of Wonka's rivals. As each Golden Ticket is found, a sinister man approaches the finder and whispers something into his or her ear. After Charlie finds the last ticket, the same man approaches Charlie as well, introduces himself as Arthur Slugworth, and offers the child a bribe to bring him one piece of the newly invented 'Everlasting Gobstopper', allowing him to plagiarize the formula and prevent the future invention from ruining his business. Two of the children (Veruca and Mike) respond to Slugworth's bribe; but Charlie, when tempted, returns the Everlasting Gobstopper to Wonka. Wonka eventually reveals that the tempter is not Slugworth, but his own employee '''Mr. Wilkinson''', and that his offer was a moral test of character. Slugworth/Wilkinson was played by [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]], a [[West Germany|West German]] actor, while his speaking voice is provided by an uncredited [[Walker Edmiston]].\n\nSlugworth only makes a split-second appearance in Tim Burton's ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' where he, alongside Mr. Ficklegruber and Mr. Prodnose, are sending spies to steal ingredients from Wonka's factory. He is here played by Philip Philmar.\n\nIn the ''Tom and Jerry'' version of the 1971 film, Slugworth is the main antagonist, instead of an enigmatic villain. When he first meets Charlie, he sings a cover of Veruca's song \"I Want it Now!\" and also sings it as a duet with Veruca during her downfall. He teams up with [[Spike and Tyke (characters)|Spike]] to steal a Gobstopper from the factory, but the two are thwarted by Charlie, Tom, and Jerry. Despite being more emphasized as a villain, he is still revealed to be Wonka's employee Mr. Wilkinson, much to Tom and Jerry's dismay. Nevertheless, the cat and mouse get the last word on Slugworth/Wilkinson (and Spike) by shrinking them with the Wonkavision.\n\n==Mr. Turkentine==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Mr. Turkentine\n| series    = Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[David Battley]] (1971)\n| voice     = [[David Battley]]\n| gender    = Male\n}}\n'''Mr. Turkentine''' is Charlie Bucket's school teacher and appears in the 1971 film, but not in the book or the 2005 film. He has an odd sense of humor, which he uses to express knowledge. He asks Charlie to assist him in making a medicine using several scientific elements for the class, but the project is interrupted due to the frantic Golden Ticket search for Willy Wonka. Mr. Turkentine, when hearing the news about the Golden Tickets during the project, dismisses the class and runs out. Later, when it is revealed that all of the tickets have supposedly been found ending with a Paraguayan millionaire, he decides to use Wonka bars as an example to teach his class about percentages. He uses a few students as examples for the class, including Charlie. Charlie, however, reveals that he only opened two Wonka bars during the search and so, to help make it easier for his class, he decides to pretend that Charlie opened 200. Mr. Turkentine is played by British actor [[David Battley]].\n\n==Prince Pondicherry==\n{{Infobox character\n| name      = Prince Pondicherry\n| series    = Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n| first     = ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''\n| creator   = Roald Dahl\n| portrayer = [[Nitin Ganatra]] (2005)\n| gender    = Male\n}}\n'''Prince Pondicherry''' is a prince who lives in India. He appears in the third chapter of the novel when Grandpa Joe is telling Charlie a story. In the story, [[Willy Wonka]] makes him a chocolate [[palace]] in India, and advises him to eat it before it melts. He does not take this advice, insisting that he intends to live in the palace, which later melts in the heat from the sun. His name derives from the city of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] (officially spelled Puducherry since 2006) in southeastern India.\n\nHe is absent from the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 film version]], but makes a brief appearance in Tim Burton's ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', where he is played by [[Nitin Ganatra]]. His story here matches that in the book, except in depicting his wife ([[Shelley Conn]]) and stating that the Prince demanded a second palace, but was refused, due to Wonka dealing with problems of his own at the time that involved spies sent by his rivals. In the 2013 musical, he drowns in the melted chocolate from his palace, along with his wife.\n\n=={{Visible anchor|The Oompa-Loompas}}==<!-- Other articles link here. -->\nThe '''Oompa-Loompas''' are small humans who were preyed upon by the various predators\nthat also reside in Loompaland before Wonka invited them to work at his factory.

In both editions, despite working in the factory, the Oompa-Loompas insist on maintaining their native clothing: men wear animal skins, women wear leaves, and children wear nothing.\n\nIn the 1971 film, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', they were written to be played by actors with [[dwarfism]] and are portrayed as orange-skinned, green-haired men in striped shirts and baggy [[lederhosen]]-like pants. Prominent portrayers included [[Angelo Muscat]], [[Rusty Goffe]], [[George Claydon]], Rudy Borgstaller, Jo Kilkenny, Andy Wilday, [[Malcolm Dixon (actor)|Malcolm Dixon]], Ismed Hassan, Norman Mcglen, Pepe Poupee, Marcus Powell, Akary, Romana, and Albert Wilkinson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/27/1|title=My life as an Oompa Loompa: 'Willy Wonka was my first and favourite film'|first=Rusty|last=Goffe|date=27 July 2005|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2005 film, the Oompa-Loompas are all played by [[Deep Roy]] and are virtually identical. They wear their tribal clothing during their time in Loompaland, and typical factory worker uniforms in Wonka's factory. Some of the female Oompa-Loompas, like Doris, work in the administration offices. In the reboot, Willy Wonka explained to the visitors how the Oompa-Loompas were hired to work in the factory.\n\n==The Vermicious Knids==\nThe '''Vermicious Knids''' are a fictional species of amorphous aliens that invade the \"Space Hotel USA\" in [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]''.\n\nThey are also mentioned in the 1971 feature film adaptation, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', but only as predators of the Oompa-Loompas.\n\nIn the book, Vermicious Knids are huge, dark, egg-shaped predators who swallow their victims whole, and are capable of surviving in the vacuum of space. Although normally oviform, they can assume any shape at will, while retaining their native texture and features. They originate (according to Mr. Wonka) on the planet Vermes, a fictional planet located (in dialogue) {{convert|184270000000|mi|abbr=off|sigfig=5}} from Earth (52 times [[Pluto|Pluto's]] distance). In the presence of victims, they cannot resist shaping themselves to spell out the word \"SCRAM\" (the only Earth word that they know) before they attack. They are stated to be extremely voracious, having devoured an entire race that once lived on the Moon, and they only avoid Earth because entering the atmosphere causes them to burn up via atmospheric friction. \n\nIn ''Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator'', a swarm of Knids take possession of the new \"Space Hotel USA\". When the transport capsule brings the staff to the Space Hotel, the Knids consume some of the staff, and the survivors retreat to the capsule. There, the Knids bludgeon the capsule with their own bodies, until its [[Retrorocket|retrorocket]]s are useless; whereupon Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe connect the capsule to the Elevator, in hope of towing it to Earth, and one Knid wraps itself around the Elevator while the others form a chain, intending to draw the Elevator and the capsule to their home planet. The Elevator then returns to Earth, and the Knids are incinerated in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWhen [[Nestl\u00e9]] created its interpretation of Wonka's world to sell chocolate bars under the name \"Wonka\", they released a number of downloadable [[Adobe Flash Player|flash]] games, wherein Knids seemed to have entered the factory and had the appearance of flying green blobs with single red eyes.\n\nThe etymology of the name was not provided by Dahl. Pronunciation of ''Knid'' is said in the book to approximate adding a [[schwa]] between the \"K\" and \"nid\", or in Dahl's words, \"K'nid\". [[Cnidaria]] is the name of the taxonomic [[phylum]] containing stinging aquatic invertebrates such as [[jellyfish]] and [[coral]]s, in turn derived from the [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] word for [[Urtica|nettle]], \u03ba\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7. ''Vermicious'' is a real word, meaning \"worm-like\".\n\nThe Vermicious Knids are also mentioned in other Dahl stories, including ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (where the [[New York City Police Department]] misidentify Miss Spider as one) and ''[[The Minpins]]''.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Portrayed in other media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" \n!

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

German identity and the problem of history. ''History and ethnicity'', p.146</ref>\n\nPan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of [[East Prussia]], sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.\n\n===1871\u20131918===\n{{Further|Unification of Germany}}\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria\u2013Hungary, 1910]]\nBy the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire. [[German nationalism in Austria]] grew among all social circles of the empire, many wanted to be unified with the German Reich to form a [[Greater Germany]] and wanted policies to be carried out to enforce their German ethnic identity rejecting any Austrian pan-ethnic identity.<ref name=\"DPSO\">{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in \u00d6sterreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423112116/http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | archive-date=23 April 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Many German Austrians felt annoyed that they were excluded from the German Empire since it included various non-German ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Urspr\u00fcnge, Anf\u00e4nge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&pg=PA41 |isbn=9783825230760 }}</ref> Prominent Austrian pan-Germans such as [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]]  created pan-German movements which demanded the annexation of all ethnic German territories.

It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.\n\nUsed as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of \"a German\" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>\ne.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'' (1872\u20131878), s.v. \"Diutsche\".\nThe Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for \"in the German realm, in Germany\".\nThe phrase ''in t\u00fctschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', s.v. \"Deutsch\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]].

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Nationalism and Pan-Germanism became almost taboo because they had been used so destructively by the Nazis. Indeed, the word \"Volksdeutscher\" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging \"[[Gastarbeiter]]\" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Further|German reunification}}\n\nHowever, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates.

After discovering his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers to move at great speeds at an early age, he turns to a life of crime. This eventually brings Cannon, using his first alias as the '''Human Top''' and pursuing his career as a jewel thief, into conflict with [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] on several occasions.<ref>''Tales To Astonish'' #50-52, 55.

In the role of Charles, he pines for Janet, making advances when [[Hank Pym]] is presumed to be dead during the run in ''[[Marvel Feature]]''.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #5-6 (Sept-Nov 1972).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhirlwind is then employed by master villain [[Count Nefaria]] and joined the [[Lethal Legion]]. Nefaria temporarily amplifies the abilities of Whirlwind and super-powered team-mates [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the [[Living Laser]] before sending them against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria subsequently defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #164-166.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Whirlwind was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Whirlwind into a teenager named Scotty. When Baron Zemo and Fixer restored everyone's memories, Whirlwind went on a rampage with Absorbing Man.

He is assisted by people that appear to be Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes with both his arms.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWhirlwind is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at great speeds, without impairing his ability to see, speak, or interact with his environment (for instance, pick up objects or change clothes). Although he can rotate at subsonic speeds he can only travel in a straight line for a limited time, or fly like a helicopter for an even shorter length of time. He possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, and often uses himself as a human battering ram. Whirlwind has the ability to focus air currents generated by his rotation into a jet stream powerful enough to blast a hole through a brick wall, as well as create a windscreen able to deflect matter as massive as a falling boulder. He also has the ability to create small tornadoes.\n\nWhirlwind wears full body armor. Since upgrading his armor, Whirlwind has added to his offensive capabilities via the use of two {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hardened tool-steel sawblades mounted on metal wrist bracelets, which are driven by two DC servo-motors each and activated by palm switches. He also uses thrown [[shuriken]] and razor sharp jacks, whose damaging potential is greatly increased by the velocity of his whirling powers.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Heroes Reborn===\nIn the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' reality, Whirlwind is featured as well. This version wears a streamlined suit of armor with multiple blades.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Masters of Evil'' (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> He was hired by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to attack Tony Stark. To this end, Whirlwind kidnapped Stark's secretary [[Pepper Potts]] and blackmailed Stark to come to the Stark International office on Long Island alone without his \"bodyguard\" Iron Man (unaware that Stark himself was in reality Iron Man). Going to the office without his Iron Man armor, Tony was more than ready to deal with Whirlwind without his armor. Using various gadgets to defend himself and Pepper, Stark had Whirlwind chase him down to a Stark International Lab. There Tony activated a Kinetic Intake Converter that threatened to destroy Whirlwind if he didn't surrender. Refusing to do so, Whirlwind was engulfed with the converter's energy and killed.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #3.

After discovering his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers to move at great speeds at an early age, he turns to a life of crime. This eventually brings Cannon, using his first alias as the '''Human Top''' and pursuing his career as a jewel thief, into conflict with [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] on several occasions.<ref>''Tales To Astonish'' #50-52, 55. Marvel Comics.</ref> Defeated each time, Cannon then redesigns his costume and adopts the alias of \"Whirlwind\", and adopts the identity of '''Charles Matthews''', [[chauffeur]] of Janet van Dyne.<ref>''Avengers'' #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> Whirlwind joined the supervillain group the second [[Masters of Evil]], and participated in a plot to destroy the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #54</ref> He joined the third Masters of Evil, and participated in a Vermont battle against the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #83. Marvel Comics.</ref> With [[Batroc the Leaper]] and [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], he went on a mission for the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Captain America'' #130. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCannon continues with the Charles Matthews identity,<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 (Nov. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref> first with the intent of robbing van Dyne, later with the intent of [[flirting|hitting on]] van Dyne. In the role of Charles, he pines for Janet, making advances when [[Hank Pym]] is presumed to be dead during the run in ''[[Marvel Feature]]''.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #5-6 (Sept-Nov 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref> Charles is later fired for trying to embezzle Janet's money,<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #9 (May 1973). Marvel Comics.</ref> and Hank finally discovers that Charles is Whirlwind later on in the series, forcing Whirlwind to abandon the identity.<ref>''Avengers'' #139 (Sept. 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhirlwind is then employed by master villain [[Count Nefaria]] and joined the [[Lethal Legion]]. Nefaria temporarily amplifies the abilities of Whirlwind and super-powered team-mates [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the [[Living Laser]] before sending them against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria subsequently defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #164-166. Marvel Comics.</ref> Whirlwind joined the third Masters of Evil in a plan to destroy the Avengers, but caused their defeat by attacking prematurely.<ref>''Avengers'' #222</ref> Whirlwind later upgrades his costume when joining a new version of the Masters of Evil formed by [[Baron Zemo]].<ref>''Avengers'' #270-277. Marvel Comics.</ref> Whirlwind partnered with the [[Trapster]], obtained a new battle armor and weapons from the [[Tinkerer]], and battled [[Captain America]] in an attempt to bolster his criminal reputation.<ref>''Captain America'' #324. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then partnered with the [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], traveled to San Francisco to steal an experimental \"psycho-circuit\", and battled the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Whirlwind also shows signs of an obsession with the Wasp, as he forces prostitutes to dress in the Wasp's past costumes and then assaults them.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #71. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhirlwind and the Trapster end up fighting, due to a bounty placed on the former by the up-and-coming criminal mastermind Ricadonna. Trapster glues Whirlwind to the floor just at the start of his spin. He continues twirling, breaking many of his bones, including his spine.<ref>''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'' #3 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> He makes a full recovery and is forced to join Baron Zemo's team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2 #104. Marvel Comics.</ref> After leaving them, he gathered a group of villains together and tried to extort money from the Thunderbolts' new director [[Norman Osborn]], but was viciously beaten by Osborn and is now forced to work secretly.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason in Madness''. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''Dark Reign: Zodiac'', Cannon is shown as a mole for Zodiac, working as Norman's chauffeur.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: Zodiac''. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhirlwind later attacks Hank blaming for Janet's death during the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" and outraged by Pym taking the Wasp codename. He is defeated by the [[Avengers Academy]] student [[Striker (comics)|Striker]]. In a conversation between Striker and his mother, it is revealed that she hired Whirlwind to stage the attack to gain publicity for Striker.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhirlwind was recruited by the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Zeke Stane]] into joining the other villains in a plot to take down [[Iron Man]]. Whirlwind receives a new costume from Mandarin and Zeke Stane.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\" storyline, Whirlwind was seen with [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] robbing banks when they are approached by [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]]. Spymaster enlists Whirlwind and Blizzard to help him and the villains he recruited to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhirlwind was hired by [[Power Broker]]'s \"Hench\" App to kill Ant-Man as part of the App's demonstration to [[Darren Cross]]. When Cross was unwilling to give Power Broker the 1.2 billion dollars he demanded for investment in the Hench app, this caused Power Broker to cancel the demo and cancel Whirlwind's assassination on Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Whirlwind was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Whirlwind into a teenager named Scotty. When Baron Zemo and Fixer restored everyone's memories, Whirlwind went on a rampage with Absorbing Man. When the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] show up to retrieve Absorbing Man, Whirlwind joins Absorbing Man in siding with Hood's [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].<ref>''Illuminati'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Whirlwind is among the villains that joins the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #13</ref> Whirlwind, Batroc the Leaper, and Living Laser attack a haggard, bearded man in torn World War II army uniform who identifies himself as Steve Rogers. He is assisted by people that appear to be Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes with both his arms.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWhirlwind is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at great speeds, without impairing his ability to see, speak, or interact with his environment (for instance, pick up objects or change clothes). Although he can rotate at subsonic speeds he can only travel in a straight line for a limited time, or fly like a helicopter for an even shorter length of time. He possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, and often uses himself as a human battering ram. Whirlwind has the ability to focus air currents generated by his rotation into a jet stream powerful enough to blast a hole through a brick wall, as well as create a windscreen able to deflect matter as massive as a falling boulder. He also has the ability to create small tornadoes.\n\nWhirlwind wears full body armor. Since upgrading his armor, Whirlwind has added to his offensive capabilities via the use of two {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hardened tool-steel sawblades mounted on metal wrist bracelets, which are driven by two DC servo-motors each and activated by palm switches. He also uses thrown [[shuriken]] and razor sharp jacks, whose damaging potential is greatly increased by the velocity of his whirling powers.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Heroes Reborn===\nIn the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' reality, Whirlwind is featured as well. This version wears a streamlined suit of armor with multiple blades.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Masters of Evil'' (2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> He was hired by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to attack Tony Stark. To this end, Whirlwind kidnapped Stark's secretary [[Pepper Potts]] and blackmailed Stark to come to the Stark International office on Long Island alone without his \"bodyguard\" Iron Man (unaware that Stark himself was in reality Iron Man). Going to the office without his Iron Man armor, Tony was more than ready to deal with Whirlwind without his armor. Using various gadgets to defend himself and Pepper, Stark had Whirlwind chase him down to a Stark International Lab. There Tony activated a Kinetic Intake Converter that threatened to destroy Whirlwind if he didn't surrender. Refusing to do so, Whirlwind was engulfed with the converter's energy and killed.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===JLA/Avengers===\nWhirlwind is among the enthralled villains guarding [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold. He tries to attack Thor from behind as Thor helps [[Red Tornado]] but is shot by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Old Man Logan===\nIn the pages of ''[[Old Man Logan]]'', the elderly Logan awoke on Earth-616 and had a flashback to where Whirlwind, [[Red Skull]], [[Baron Blood]], [[Count Nefaria]], and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] were standing over the dead bodies of the superheroes the day when the villains rose and the heroes fell.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Whirlwind appeared in the 1990s ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]] (initially) and by [[Dorian Harewood]] (subsequently).

Introduced in the episode \"The Man in the Anthill\", he goes on a rampage in town after stealing a sonic emitter from a college and he fights the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. When Whirlwind chases after the Wasp, he gets tricked into heading right into a swarm of flies. When he breaks free using his powers, Whirlwind charges Ant-Man and the Wasp, but is taken down by the Wasp. Ending up incarcerated at the Big House, he overrides his power dampener and goes on a rampage against the [[Ultron|Ultron Synthezoids]] until he learns the hard way about the prison when he ends up pinned down by [[Hank Pym]]'s finger. It turns out Whirlwind was hired by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]] to steal the sonic emitter. When [[Clay Quartermain]] discovers Whirlwind is actually a mutant, the power on Whirlwind's power dampener gets doubled and Nick Fury sees to it that he is arranged to be handed over to the [[Mutant Response Division]]. While Whirlwind is in his cell, he gets in a conversation with the [[Mad Thinker]] on why there hasn't been an escape attempt yet; the Big House is one of the four major supervillain prisons and that every supervillain will be free when the security systems break down.

In the episode \"Me Time\", he is hired by [[Doctor Octopus]] to attack [[Spider-Man]]. After a destructive battle, Spider-Man eventually defeats Whirlwind by webbing off his helmet and knocking him out with it. Afterwards, Spider-Man (due to being dizzy in the tornado) throws up in Whirlwind's helmet and notes that [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] might want to have the helmet washed before returning it to Whirlwind.

These logs record changes to the stored data to allow the database to recover from [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] or other data errors and maintain the stored data in a consistent state. Thus, database systems usually have both general event logs and transaction logs.<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190925.aspx Microsoft, The Transaction Log (SQL Server)]</ref><ref>[http://www.sqlshack.com/beginners-guide-sql-server-transaction-logs/ qlshack.com, A beginner\u2019s guide to SQL Server transaction logs, February 11, 2014 by Ivan Stankovic]</ref><ref>[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/understanding-the-importance-of-transaction-logs-in-sql-server/ techrepublic.com, Understanding the importance of transaction logs in SQL Server, SQL Server transaction log maintenance, By Crowe, Chizek, November 11, 2004]</ref><ref>[https://www.neurobs.com/pres_docs/html/03_presentation/07_data_reporting/01_logfiles/index.html neurobs.com, Logfiles]</ref>\n\n== Message logs ==\n\n[[Internet Relay Chat|Internet Relay Chat (IRC)]], [[Instant messaging|instant messaging (IM)]] programs, [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing clients with chat functions, and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games (especially [[MMORPG]]s) commonly have the ability to automatically log or save textual communication, both public (IRC channel/IM conference/MMO public/party chat messages) and private chat messages between users.\n<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sqlserver.management.smo.logfile.aspx Microsoft, LogFile Class]</ref>\nMessage logs are almost universally plain text files, but IM and [[VoIP]] clients (which supports textual chat, e.g. Skype) might save them in [[HTML]] files or in a custom format to ease reading and [[encryption]].\n\n=== Internet Relay Chat (IRC) ===\n\nIn the case of IRC software, message logs often include system/server messages and entries related to channel and user changes (e.g. topic change, user joins/exits/[[List of Internet Relay Chat commands#KICK|kicks]]/[[Block (Internet)|bans]], [[nickname]] changes, user status changes), making them more like a combined message/event log of the channel in question, but such a log isn't comparable to a true IRC server event log, because it only records user-visible events for the time frame the user spent being connected to a certain channel.\n\n=== Instant messaging ===\n\nInstant messaging and VoIP clients often offer the chance to store encrypted logs to enhance the user's privacy. These logs require a password to be decrypted and viewed, and they are often handled by their respective writing application..\n\n=== Transaction log analysis ===\nThe use of data stored in transaction logs of Web search engines, Intranets, and Web sites can provide valuable insight into understanding the information-searching process of online searchers.<ref>Jansen, B. J. 2006. Search log analysis: What is it; what's been done; how to do it.

This approach, in combination with [[statistical analysis]], may yield [[Statistical correlation|correlations]] between seemingly unrelated events on different servers. Other solutions employ network-wide querying and [[report]]ing.<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd206996.aspx Microsoft Log File Viewer]</ref><ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html W3C, Extended Log File Format W3C Working Draft WD-logfile-960323 ]</ref>\n\n=== Transaction logs ===\n{{Main|Transaction log}}\n\nMost [[Database|database systems]] maintain some kind of '''transaction log''', which are not mainly intended as an audit trail for later analysis, and are not intended to be [[human-readable]]. These logs record changes to the stored data to allow the database to recover from [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] or other data errors and maintain the stored data in a consistent state. Thus, database systems usually have both general event logs and transaction logs.\n \n<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190925.aspx Microsoft, The Transaction Log (SQL Server)]</ref><ref>[http://www.sqlshack.com/beginners-guide-sql-server-transaction-logs/ qlshack.com, A beginner\u2019s guide to SQL Server transaction logs, February 11, 2014 by Ivan Stankovic]</ref><ref>[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/understanding-the-importance-of-transaction-logs-in-sql-server/ techrepublic.com, Understanding the importance of transaction logs in SQL Server, SQL Server transaction log maintenance, By Crowe, Chizek, November 11, 2004]</ref><ref>[https://www.neurobs.com/pres_docs/html/03_presentation/07_data_reporting/01_logfiles/index.html neurobs.com, Logfiles]</ref>\n\n== Message logs ==\n\n[[Internet Relay Chat|Internet Relay Chat (IRC)]], [[Instant messaging|instant messaging (IM)]] programs, [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing clients with chat functions, and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games (especially [[MMORPG]]s) commonly have the ability to automatically log or save textual communication, both public (IRC channel/IM conference/MMO public/party chat messages) and private chat messages between users.\n<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sqlserver.management.smo.logfile.aspx Microsoft, LogFile Class]</ref>\nMessage logs are almost universally plain text files, but IM and [[VoIP]] clients (which supports textual chat, e.g. Skype) might save them in [[HTML]] files or in a custom format to ease reading and [[encryption]].\n\n=== Internet Relay Chat (IRC) ===\n\nIn the case of IRC software, message logs often include system/server messages and entries related to channel and user changes (e.g. topic change, user joins/exits/[[List of Internet Relay Chat commands#KICK|kicks]]/[[Block (Internet)|bans]], [[nickname]] changes, user status changes), making them more like a combined message/event log of the channel in question, but such a log isn't comparable to a true IRC server event log, because it only records user-visible events for the time frame the user spent being connected to a certain channel.\n\n=== Instant messaging ===\n\nInstant messaging and VoIP clients often offer the chance to store encrypted logs to enhance the user's privacy. These logs require a password to be decrypted and viewed, and they are often handled by their respective writing application..\n\n=== Transaction log analysis ===\nThe use of data stored in transaction logs of Web search engines, Intranets, and Web sites can provide valuable insight into understanding the information-searching process of online searchers.<ref>Jansen, B. J. 2006. Search log analysis: What is it; what's been done; how to do it.

As Ant-Man, he serves as an Avenger for years, until he is killed during the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline.

Here, despite Iron Lad's assurance that they could not interact, Scott Lang is hugged by his daughter, and to take him away from the zombified Jack of Hearts who is revealed to be the real Jack of Hearts under the control of an insane Scarlet Witch. When Jack explodes, the Scarlet Witch regains her memories and returns them to the present, including Scott (thus his death is [[retconned]] as having never actually happened, as he was merely taken from his time and brought forward).<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #5</ref> Scott is proud that his daughter followed in his footsteps.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #6</ref> However, a subsequent battle ensues (regarding the fate of the Scarlet Witch) involving the Avengers, Young Avengers, [[X-Men]], [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] and Doctor Doom. In the course of the fight, Scott is seemingly killed by Doom, although he actually survives relatively unscathed; enraged, Cassie attacks but Doom kills her, much to Scott's grief.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #7</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Scott joins the new Defenders team composed of [[Doctor Strange]], [[Silver Surfer]], [[Namor]], [[Betty Ross|Red She-Hulk]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol 4 #10 (September 2012)</ref> Eventually, he became the second [[Future Foundation]]'s leader replacing Reed Richards when the [[Fantastic Four]] went on a time travel trip.<ref>''FF'' #1 (November 2012)</ref> Still suffering from his daughter's death, he decided to aim all the Foundation's resources towards making Doctor Doom pay for his crime; in the meantime he engaged in a romantic relationship with Darla Deering, aka Ms. Thing.<ref>''FF'' Vol. 2</ref>\n\nAfter a heated battle, Scott managed to exact his revenge on Doctor Doom by gradually overwhelming and defeating him, and by having him believe he had killed [[Valeria Richards]]. He also determined the true meaning of Pym Particles, and how they operate on three distinct axes determining size, strength and durability.<ref>''FF'' (vol 2) #16</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, a now-heroic and repentant Doctor Doom used Scarlet Witch's powers to resurrect Cassandra Lang, seeking to atone for at least one of his crimes; she turned out alive and well on Scott's doorstep.<ref>''Avengers World'' #16</ref>\n\nFollowing this, Lang moved to Miami to start a new life as well as to spend more time with his daughter.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Scott later established Ant-Man Security Solutions.

Afterwards, Scott offered Grizzly a job in the company.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #2</ref> When Cassie was kidnapped by [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] on behalf of Augustine Cross to use Cassie's Pym-particle irradiated heart could revive the very first villain Scott had fought, Scott was forced to turn to Grizzly and his fellow supervillain [[Machinesmith]] to infiltrate Cross' plant to save his daughter. With Machinesmith disabling all the security Scott was able to get into Cross Technologies and fight his way to Darren Cross, whom Dr. Sondheim was blackmailed into reviving using Cassie's heart.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #3-4</ref> Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while the hero tried to buy time for Sondheim to transplant another heart into Cassie. After Cross was forced to flee when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down, Scott shrank down to microscopic size, and was guided by Sondheim to attack Cassie's white cells and allow her body accept the new heart's tissue. Even though the procedure was difficult, Scott was finally able to help Cassie survive the experience. When Peggy and Blake arrived, Sondheim told her that Cassie suffered an infraction and Scott took them to her. Although he saved his daughter, Scott decided to distance himself from her so that she could have a normal life.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #5</ref>\n\nSome months ago, Ant-Man helped Giant-Man into rescuing a computer technician named Raz Malhotra from Egghead. Months later after the incident where Hank Pym and Ultron were fused together with Pym seemingly perishing as a result of the fusion, Scott received one of Pym's labs. Recalling his encounter with Raz, Scott sent Raz a present in the form of the Giant-Man suit.<ref>''Ant-Man Annual'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Ant-Man recovers an unnamed Asgardian artifact from [[Slug (comics)|Slug]] which he won from [[List of Marvel Comics characters: M#Miss Patriot|Mary Morgan]] in a game of contact bridge. Ant-Man delivers the goods to Mary Morgan where he learns that she is Miss Patriot. Mary Morgan revealed that Valhalla Villas is a retirement home for Golden Age heroes and villains where they live out their days in blissful remembrance.

Using the Asgardian artifact, Mary Morgan rejuvenated the Valhalla Villa residents as Miami sees the unexpected resurgence of characters from the Golden Age. Mary decides to remain elderly since the past was too much to bear the first and only time. Scott then visits his ex-wife Peggy Rae in an attempt to see his daughter [[Cassandra Lang]]. Peggy puts Scott in his place due to him making no effort to visit her since she was in the hospital. Peggy also tells Scott that Cassandra is at a school excursion to Atlanta. While drinking at a nightclub, Ant-Man encounters [[Janice Lincoln]] and tries to take her down, only to get blasted. Janice states to Ant-Man that he should party like there is no tomorrow since it is the last night on Earth. Ant-Man takes in Janice's suggestions as they both hit the dance floor. He wakes up the next morning with Janice in his bed as the final parts of the Incursion occur.<ref>''Ant-Man: Last Days'' #1</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Ant-Man becomes a target of Whirlwind when [[Power Broker]] offers a demonstration of the Hench App to Darren Cross. When Cross was unable to pay $12,000,000.00 to Power Broker, Whirlwind received orders to not attack Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1</ref> Ant-Man later helped Darla Deering when she was attacked by the second [[Magician (comics)|Magician]] (the son of the original Magician) when he was hired by a publicist named Marlena Howard through the Hench App to pretend to have a grudge against her.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #2</ref>\n\nScott Lang later reunited with Raz Malhotra and took him to confront Power Broker at his public promotion of the Hench App 2.0. They ended up coming into conflict with a female [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] who Power Broker hired to guard the event. Due to Raz's inexperience in crimefighting, Blacklash got away. Following the incident, Scott Lang gave Raz an offer come with him to Florida to be trained while looking over Hank Pym's lab there. Raz accepted the offer.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #5</ref>\n\nScott later recruited Hijacker, Whirlwind, the new Beetle, the Voice and the Magician to his Ant-Man Security Solutions.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #8</ref> As a team, they fought Darren Cross, Crossfire and Augustine Cross to save Stinger, aka Cassie Lang.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #10</ref> After that battle, the NYPD arrested Scott for his crimes, but after a trial, he was released.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Ant-Man joins the resistance group against [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]] after they takeover the U.S. After seeing footage from [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], explaining Steve Rogers' conversion into HYDRA's supreme leader, Scott is among the heroes who join Hawkeye in the search for the [[Cosmic Cube]] fragments that were scattered around the world, so they could reform the Cube and restore Steve back to normal.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1-2</ref> After he smuggles Cassie out of the country, he offers [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] to join the resistance but Sam turns it down. Ant-Man then meets him at a bar, with a small group of heroes led by Hawkeye.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #22</ref> Hawkeye and the Tony Stark A.I. manage to convince Sam to smuggle them out of the country so they can find the Cosmic Cube fragments.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #3</ref> It is eventually revealed that HYDRA found and captured Cassie, forcing Scott to become a double agent in order to save her life. He confesses his treachery just as HYDRA's forces arrive and destroy the resistance's hideout.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #6</ref> During the final battle, Scott shrinks [[Bucky Barnes]] down so that he can enter the Cosmic Cube and reawaken [[Kobik]]. This ultimately allows Kobik to bring back the original Steve Rogers, who defeats his HYDRA doppelganger.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #10</ref>\n\nWith his reputation tarnished due to his betrayal, Scott joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in order to get away from Earth for a while.<ref>''All-New Guardians of the Galaxy''</ref> During a later attempt to coordinate a return to Earth for Cassie's birthday with [[Nadia van Dyne]]'s aid, things go quickly awry, and the two of them experience a series of bizarre adventures in the microverse before returning home.

fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[David Michelinie]], [[Bob Layton]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], Scott Lang first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #181 (March 1979) and in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979) as the second superhero character to use the [[Ant-Man]] name in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is a reformed thief and an electronics expert. He was a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the main character in the comic-book series ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' and, in 2015 became the title character in the series ''Ant-Man''.\n\nScott Lang is an ex-convict and electronics expert hired by [[Stark International]], which enables him to steal the Ant-Man suit from [[Hank Pym]], who had long since given up the name, to help his sick daughter. When Pym finds out, he gives the suit to Lang, allowing him to become the second Ant-Man. As Ant-Man, he serves as an Avenger for years, until he is killed during the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline. Years later, he is resurrected in the ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'' mini-series. Following his resurrection, Lang briefly heads the [[Future Foundation]].\n\n[[Paul Rudd]] portrays [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[David Michelinie]], [[Bob Layton]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]],{{sfn|Rivera|2015}} Scott Lang first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #181 ([[cover-date]]d March 1979) and as the second Ant-Man in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979).{{sfn|Lovette|2015}} Michelinie had long been an enthusiast of shrinking heroes, and saw Hank Pym's return to the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]] guise as an opportunity to take over the discarded Ant-Man identity.<ref name=\"back71\">{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=29|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> He explained how he came up with the character: {{quote|I wanted something completely different, in both origin and motivation, from Pym. So I came up with the idea of a reformed criminal - not an unjustly accused innocent, which would have been the expected angle. And I figured that, as a burglar, he probably enjoyed the adrenaline rush of his previous 'job,' so the excitement of heroic adventure could fill that need in him, but legally.<ref name=\"back71\"/>}}\n\nThough Ant-Man's two-issue tryout in ''Marvel Premiere'' failed to garner the character his own series, the dynamic of a single father and reformed criminal in the superhero role struck a chord with readers and led to Ant-Man enjoying modest popularity and frequent appearances in Marvel Comics thereafter.<ref name=\"back71\"/>\n\nAnt-Man appeared prominently in the 2012's ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' series by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Mike Allred]].{{sfn|Beard|2012}}\n\nAn ongoing series focusing on Lang, titled simply ''Ant-Man'' written by [[Nick Spencer]] and drawn by [[:ca:Ramon Rosanas|Ramon Rosanas]], began in January 2015.{{sfn|Beard|2014}} After Marvel's Secret Wars event, the series continued with the title ''Astonishing Ant-Man.''\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\nScott Edward Harris Lang was born in [[Coral Gables, Florida]].{{sfn|Truitt|2015}} A movie fanatic, he turned to burglary when his occupation as an electrical engineer failed to  provide him with enough excitement in life.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47 (April 1979); ''Avengers'' #195 (May 1980)</ref> (This was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] with the statement that he did so because he couldn't support his family.{{sfn|Rivera|2015}}) Apprehended, Lang served his prison sentence and was paroled after four years for good behavior. In prison, he furthered his study of electronics and was soon hired by [[Stark International]] to work in its design department. Under Tony Stark's direction, he helped install a new security system in [[Avengers Mansion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #181</ref>\n\n===The second Ant-Man===\n[[File:Marvel Premiere 47 Scott Lang.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 (April 1979).

However, at the very moment he attempted to contact her, Sondheim was forcibly taken away to [[Cross Technological Enterprises]], and in order to get her out, he decided to return to burglary as a final resort.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47</ref> He broke into [[Hank Pym|Dr. Hank Pym]]'s home and stole the Ant-Man suit and shrinking gas canisters.{{sfn|Enk|2014}} Garbed as Ant-Man, Lang broke into Cross Enterprises and discovered that Sondheim was being held prisoner by [[Darren Cross]]. He rescued the doctor from Cross' clutches and was relieved when Sondheim was able to save his beloved Cassie's life. Upon being confronted by Pym (as [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]), Lang intended to return the Ant-Man suit to Pym and turn himself in for its theft, but Pym, aware of the use to which Lang had put the stolen goods, offered to let him keep them, provided he only use them to uphold the law.<ref name=\"MarvelPr47-48\">''Marvel Premiere'' #47-48</ref>\n\n===Hero===\nShortly after, Scott Lang donned the Ant-Man costume on various occasions, primarily to assist [[Iron Man]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Here, despite Iron Lad's assurance that they could not interact, Scott Lang is hugged by his daughter, and to take him away from the zombified Jack of Hearts who is revealed to be the real Jack of Hearts under the control of an insane Scarlet Witch. When Jack explodes, the Scarlet Witch regains her memories and returns them to the present, including Scott (thus his death is [[retconned]] as having never actually happened, as he was merely taken from his time and brought forward).<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #5</ref> Scott is proud that his daughter followed in his footsteps.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #6</ref> However, a subsequent battle ensues (regarding the fate of the Scarlet Witch) involving the Avengers, Young Avengers, [[X-Men]], [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] and Doctor Doom. In the course of the fight, Scott is seemingly killed by Doom, although he actually survives relatively unscathed; enraged, Cassie attacks but Doom kills her, much to Scott's grief.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #7</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Scott joins the new Defenders team composed of [[Doctor Strange]], [[Silver Surfer]], [[Namor]], [[Betty Ross|Red She-Hulk]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol 4 #10 (September 2012)</ref> Eventually, he became the second [[Future Foundation]]'s leader replacing Reed Richards when the [[Fantastic Four]] went on a time travel trip.<ref>''FF'' #1 (November 2012)</ref> Still suffering from his daughter's death, he decided to aim all the Foundation's resources towards making Doctor Doom pay for his crime; in the meantime he engaged in a romantic relationship with Darla Deering, aka Ms. Thing.<ref>''FF'' Vol. 2</ref>\n\nAfter a heated battle, Scott managed to exact his revenge on Doctor Doom by gradually overwhelming and defeating him, and by having him believe he had killed [[Valeria Richards]]. He also determined the true meaning of Pym Particles, and how they operate on three distinct axes determining size, strength and durability.<ref>''FF'' (vol 2) #16</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, a now-heroic and repentant Doctor Doom used Scarlet Witch's powers to resurrect Cassandra Lang, seeking to atone for at least one of his crimes; she turned out alive and well on Scott's doorstep.<ref>''Avengers World'' #16</ref>\n\nFollowing this, Lang moved to Miami to start a new life as well as to spend more time with his daughter.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Scott later established Ant-Man Security Solutions. When he was attacked by [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], mistaking him for [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]] unaware of the latter's death, Scott had to clear up the misunderstanding. Afterwards, Scott offered Grizzly a job in the company.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #2</ref> When Cassie was kidnapped by [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] on behalf of Augustine Cross to use Cassie's Pym-particle irradiated heart could revive the very first villain Scott had fought, Scott was forced to turn to Grizzly and his fellow supervillain [[Machinesmith]] to infiltrate Cross' plant to save his daughter. With Machinesmith disabling all the security Scott was able to get into Cross Technologies and fight his way to Darren Cross, whom Dr. Sondheim was blackmailed into reviving using Cassie's heart.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #3-4</ref> Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while the hero tried to buy time for Sondheim to transplant another heart into Cassie. After Cross was forced to flee when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down, Scott shrank down to microscopic size, and was guided by Sondheim to attack Cassie's white cells and allow her body accept the new heart's tissue. Even though the procedure was difficult, Scott was finally able to help Cassie survive the experience. When Peggy and Blake arrived, Sondheim told her that Cassie suffered an infraction and Scott took them to her. Although he saved his daughter, Scott decided to distance himself from her so that she could have a normal life.<ref>''Ant-Man'' vol. 2 #5</ref>\n\nSome months ago, Ant-Man helped Giant-Man into rescuing a computer technician named Raz Malhotra from Egghead. Months later after the incident where Hank Pym and Ultron were fused together with Pym seemingly perishing as a result of the fusion, Scott received one of Pym's labs. Recalling his encounter with Raz, Scott sent Raz a present in the form of the Giant-Man suit.<ref>''Ant-Man Annual'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Ant-Man recovers an unnamed Asgardian artifact from [[Slug (comics)|Slug]] which he won from [[List of Marvel Comics characters: M#Miss Patriot|Mary Morgan]] in a game of contact bridge. Ant-Man delivers the goods to Mary Morgan where he learns that she is Miss Patriot. Mary Morgan revealed that Valhalla Villas is a retirement home for Golden Age heroes and villains where they live out their days in blissful remembrance. Mary Morgan then assembles the residents of Valhalla Villas like [[Golden Girl (Timely Comics)|Golden Girl]], Doctor Fear, [[Thunderer (Marvel Comics)|Thunderer]], Leopard Girl, [[Human Top (David Mitchell)|Human Top]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]], [[American Ace]], Flash Foster, and Wax Master. Using the Asgardian artifact, Mary Morgan rejuvenated the Valhalla Villa residents as Miami sees the unexpected resurgence of characters from the Golden Age. Mary decides to remain elderly since the past was too much to bear the first and only time. Scott then visits his ex-wife Peggy Rae in an attempt to see his daughter [[Cassandra Lang]]. Peggy puts Scott in his place due to him making no effort to visit her since she was in the hospital. Peggy also tells Scott that Cassandra is at a school excursion to Atlanta. While drinking at a nightclub, Ant-Man encounters [[Janice Lincoln]] and tries to take her down, only to get blasted. Janice states to Ant-Man that he should party like there is no tomorrow since it is the last night on Earth. Ant-Man takes in Janice's suggestions as they both hit the dance floor. He wakes up the next morning with Janice in his bed as the final parts of the Incursion occur.<ref>''Ant-Man: Last Days'' #1</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Ant-Man becomes a target of Whirlwind when [[Power Broker]] offers a demonstration of the Hench App to Darren Cross. When Cross was unable to pay $12,000,000.00 to Power Broker, Whirlwind received orders to not attack Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1</ref> Ant-Man later helped Darla Deering when she was attacked by the second [[Magician (comics)|Magician]] (the son of the original Magician) when he was hired by a publicist named Marlena Howard through the Hench App to pretend to have a grudge against her.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #2</ref>\n\nScott Lang later reunited with Raz Malhotra and took him to confront Power Broker at his public promotion of the Hench App 2.0. They ended up coming into conflict with a female [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] who Power Broker hired to guard the event. Due to Raz's inexperience in crimefighting, Blacklash got away. Following the incident, Scott Lang gave Raz an offer come with him to Florida to be trained while looking over Hank Pym's lab there. Raz accepted the offer.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #5</ref>\n\nScott later recruited Hijacker, Whirlwind, the new Beetle, the Voice and the Magician to his Ant-Man Security Solutions.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #8</ref> As a team, they fought Darren Cross, Crossfire and Augustine Cross to save Stinger, aka Cassie Lang.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #10</ref> After that battle, the NYPD arrested Scott for his crimes, but after a trial, he was released.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Ant-Man joins the resistance group against [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]] after they takeover the U.S. After seeing footage from [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], explaining Steve Rogers' conversion into HYDRA's supreme leader, Scott is among the heroes who join Hawkeye in the search for the [[Cosmic Cube]] fragments that were scattered around the world, so they could reform the Cube and restore Steve back to normal.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1-2</ref> After he smuggles Cassie out of the country, he offers [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] to join the resistance but Sam turns it down. Ant-Man then meets him at a bar, with a small group of heroes led by Hawkeye.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #22</ref> Hawkeye and the Tony Stark A.I. manage to convince Sam to smuggle them out of the country so they can find the Cosmic Cube fragments.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #3</ref> It is eventually revealed that HYDRA found and captured Cassie, forcing Scott to become a double agent in order to save her life. He confesses his treachery just as HYDRA's forces arrive and destroy the resistance's hideout.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #6</ref> During the final battle, Scott shrinks [[Bucky Barnes]] down so that he can enter the Cosmic Cube and reawaken [[Kobik]]. This ultimately allows Kobik to bring back the original Steve Rogers, who defeats his HYDRA doppelganger.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #10</ref>\n\nWith his reputation tarnished due to his betrayal, Scott joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in order to get away from Earth for a while.<ref>''All-New Guardians of the Galaxy''</ref> During a later attempt to coordinate a return to Earth for Cassie's birthday with [[Nadia van Dyne]]'s aid, things go quickly awry, and the two of them experience a series of bizarre adventures in the microverse before returning home. However, in the process the two of them became [[Quantum entanglement|quantum-entangled]] with each other.<ref>''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' #1-5 (June\u2013August 2018)</ref>\n\n===Hero for Hire===\nTrying to pick up the pieces of his lost life on Earth, Scott takes up residence in an ant-hill in Florida and begins offering his service for pay.<ref>''Ant-Man'' #1 (February 2020)</ref> On a mission, he ends up joining forces with [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]] against a new enemy, Macrothrax.<ref>''Ant-Man'' #2 (March 2020)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nUsing a gaseous form of \"Pym particles\" kept in a compartment in his belt,<ref name=\"MarvelPr47-48\" /> Ant-Man initially had the power to shrink himself (and other people and objects along with himself) to the size of an [[ant]] and return to normal. Over time, he has acquired the ability to change size at will.{{issue|date=August 2018}} He can also shrink to sub-microscopic size, and thereby enter the countless \"[[Microverse|subatomic universes]]\".<ref name=\"MTiO87\" /> He retains his normal strength in ant size.\n\nThe [[cybernetic]] Ant-Man helmet allows rudimentary [[telepathy|telepathic]] communication with [[insects]], and is equipped with sound amplification equipment allowing normal-sized humans to hear its wearer. The helmet also has a retractable plexiglass face shield and a limited air supply.\n\nLang has advanced training and expertise in electronics, having earned an electronics technician certificate, plus additional advanced electronics training he received while in prison. At times, Lang even made his own modifications to the Ant-Man equipment, such as installing the Pym gas dispenser in his helmet rather than leaving it on his belt,<ref name=\"IronMan133\" /> or mounting an electric disruptor into his helmet for offensive purposes.<ref name=\"IronMan133\" />\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===MC2===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Lang appears in two distinct versions. The Lang of the main MC2 continuity has long retired from the Avengers and has acted as a mentor for Cassie, who has taken up the role of the family superhero.<ref>''A-Next'' #1</ref> Also, the Thunder Guard, a group of Nazi Avengers from an alternate universe who fought A-Next, included a mentally highly unstable version of Scott called \"Pincer\" who had killed that universe's version of Cassie.<ref>''A-Next'' #10</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the character is '''David \"Dave\" Scotty''', one of the Giant-Men that was utilized on the Ultimates' Reserves.<ref>''Ultimates Annual''</ref> During a legion of [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]]' attack, he was among those that guard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. After vampires attack and bit him multiple times, Scotty turned into a vampire. In the ensuing battle, Dave gets killed by Peter, a fellow Giant-Man.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers''</ref>\n\nThe actual Ultimate version of Scott Lang is the second major version of '''[[Giant-Man]]'''. Dr. Lang appears as a member of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Ultimates]] during a massive showdown between the [[Ultimates]] and the Avengers. Lang later helps both teams defeat [[Gregory Stark]]'s forces in [[North Korea]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers vs. New Ultimates''</ref> His daughter Cassie later joins the Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Ultimates'' #17</ref>\n\n===''What If?''===\nIn \"[[What If (comics)|What If]] Iron Man Lost the [[Armor Wars]]\", Lang is captured while spying on [[Justin Hammer]], and taken prisoner along with Cassie. When Hammer is later assassinated and his knowledge over the Iron Man armor claimed by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], Scott and Cassie are taken hostage by them as well, but are eventually freed by Stark clad in the [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]] armor.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #8</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Scott Lang makes his animated debut in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015}} He appears in the episodes \"To Steal an Ant-Man\" and \"Avengers Assemble\".\n* The Scott Lang version of Ant-Man appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Grant George]] (Seasons 1-2 and ''Avengers: Ultron Revolution'') and by [[Josh Keaton]] (''Avengers: Secret Wars'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/65851/avengers-return-action-packed-one-hour-marvels-avengers-secret-wars-season-four-premiere-saturday-june-17-disney-xd//|title=The Avengers Return for An Action-Packed One-Hour 'Marvel's Avengers: Secret Wars' Season Four Premiere on Saturday, June 17 on Disney XD|website=News - Marvel.com|access-date=2017-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824221043/https://news.marvel.com/tv/65851/avengers-return-action-packed-one-hour-marvels-avengers-secret-wars-season-four-premiere-saturday-june-17-disney-xd/|archive-date=2017-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* Ant-Man appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced again by Grant George.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He is a guest teacher at the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]'s [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Academy.\n* Ant-Man appears in the television special ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Avengers Reassembled]]'', voiced again by Grant George.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Avengers Reassembled | series = Lego Marvel Super Heroes | serieslink=Lego Super Heroes | work = Disney XD | at=Closing credits | date = November 16, 2014}}</ref>\n* Ant-Man appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' animated series, voiced again by Grant George in Season Two, and by Josh Keaton in Season Three.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n* Ant-Man appears along with the [[Hulk]] in a [[Coke Mini]] commercial that premiered during [[Super Bowl 50]], with [[Paul Rudd]] providing the voice of Ant-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-coca-cola-super-bowl-commercial-hulk-is-thirsty/|title=Marvel & Coca-Cola Super Bowl Commercial: You Wouldn\u2019t Like the Hulk When He\u2019s Thirsty|last=Anderton|first=Ethan|date=February 7, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref>\n* Ant-Man is the subject of a series of animated shorts on [[Disney XD]], voiced by [[Josh Keaton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/22/marvel-ant-man-animated-shorts-disney-xd/|title='Marvel's Ant-Man' Animated Shorts Coming to Disney XD|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Paul Rudd is set to reprise his role as Scott Lang in the [[Disney+]] animated series, ''[[What If...?

Fischer]], [[Harald Kloser]], [[Larry Franco]] and [[Laeta Kalogridis]]. In the film, a divorced US Capitol Police officer named John Cale attempts rescuing both his daughter Emily and the President of the United States James Sawyer when a massively destructive terrorist assault occurs in the [[White House]]. The film stars [[Channing Tatum]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Joey King]], [[Jason Clarke]], [[Richard Jenkins]], and [[James Woods]].\n\nReleased on June 28, 2013 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures]], ''White House Down'' received mixed reviews from critics toward the screenwriting and the cliched storyline, although the performances and action sequences were praised. The film  grossed over $205 million worldwide against budget of $150 million.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> ''White House Down'' was one of two films released in 2013 that dealt with a terrorist attack on the White House; the other was ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'', released three months earlier.\n\n==Plot==\n[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] James Sawyer ([[Jamie Foxx]]) makes a controversial proposal to remove military forces from the [[Middle East]]. Divorced [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]] officer John Cale ([[Channing Tatum]]) is assigned to [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] Eli Raphelson ([[Richard Jenkins]]), whose nephew he saved while serving in [[Afghanistan]]. Cale hopes to impress his daughter Emily ([[Joey King]]) by interviewing for the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Presidential Detail, getting tickets for them to tour the White House. His interviewer, Deputy [[Special Agent]]-in-Charge Carol Finnerty ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]), a college acquaintance, deems him unqualified for the job.\n\nA bomb is detonated in the [[United States Capitol]], sending the White House into lockdown. Finnerty escorts Raphelson to an underground command center in [[the Pentagon]], while [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Alvin Hammond ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]) is taken aboard [[Air Force One]]. A team of mercenaries led by ex-[[Delta Force]] commando Emil Stenz ([[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]]) infiltrate the White House disguised as video technicians and overwhelm the Secret Service, taking the tour group hostage in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] and seizing the building. Cale escapes to find Emily, separated during the tour. Retiring Head of the Presidential Detail [[Special Agent]]-in-Charge Martin Walker ([[James Woods]]) brings Sawyer to the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center|PEOC]] beneath the [[Library (White House)|Library]]. Inside, Walker kills Sawyer's detail, revealing himself as the leader of the attack, apparently seeking vengeance against Sawyer for a botched black ops mission in [[Iran]] the year prior that resulted in the death of Walker's son. Cale kills a mercenary, taking his weapon and radio, and rescues Sawyer after overhearing Walker's plans.\n\nWalker brings in ex-[[National Security Agency|NSA]] analyst Skip Tyler ([[Jimmi Simpson]]) to hack the defense system, but requires Sawyer to activate the [[nuclear football]]. Right-wing sociopath Carl Killick ([[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]]) catches Emily filming the intruders on her phone and takes her hostage. Cale and Sawyer contact the command structure, using Emily's [[YouTube]] video to discover the mercenaries all formerly worked for government agencies. Cale and Sawyer try to escape via a secret tunnel but find the exit rigged with explosives. They escape in the presidential limo but are attacked by Stenz and fall into the White House pool. With Sawyer and Cale presumed dead in an explosion, the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] is invoked; Hammond is sworn in as president. Cale and Sawyer, still alive, learn Hammond has ordered an aerial incursion to re-acquire the White House, but the mercenaries shoot down the helicopters. Learning Emily's identity from the video, Stenz takes her to Walker in the [[Oval Office]]. Hacking into [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]], Tyler launches a missile at Air Force One from [[Piketon, Ohio]], killing Hammond and everyone on board. Raphelson is sworn in as president and orders an air strike on the White House.\n\nSawyer surrenders himself to save Emily. Walker, blaming Iran for his son's death, demands Sawyer use the football to launch nuclear missiles against various Iranian cities. Sawyer refuses, while Cale sets fire to several rooms as a diversion. Tyler inadvertently triggers the tunnel explosives and is vaporized. Killing most of the mercenaries and freeing the hostages, Cale blows Stenz up with a grenade belt. Sawyer attacks Walker, who uses Sawyer's handprint to activate the football and target the Iranian cities, when Cale crashes a reinforced [[Chevrolet Suburban]] through the Oval Office. Before Walker can launch the missiles, Cale kills him with the car's [[rotary cannon]]. Emily waves off the incoming fighter planes with a presidential flag, calling off the air strike.\n\nCale realizes that Raphelson was Walker's accomplice. Believing Sawyer dead and that Cale has no proof, Raphelson is tricked into confessing and is arrested for [[treason]]. Sawyer names Cale his new special agent, taking him and Emily on an aerial tour of DC. Sawyer receives word that [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Israel]] and Iran have agreed to his peace deal after learning of events at the White House, calling for an end to all wars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div

With Sawyer and Cale presumed dead in an explosion, the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] is invoked; Hammond is sworn in as president. Cale and Sawyer, still alive, learn Hammond has ordered an aerial incursion to re-acquire the White House, but the mercenaries shoot down the helicopters. Learning Emily's identity from the video, Stenz takes her to Walker in the [[Oval Office]]. Hacking into [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]], Tyler launches a missile at Air Force One from [[Piketon, Ohio]], killing Hammond and everyone on board. Raphelson is sworn in as president and orders an air strike on the White House.\n\nSawyer surrenders himself to save Emily. Walker, blaming Iran for his son's death, demands Sawyer use the football to launch nuclear missiles against various Iranian cities. Sawyer refuses, while Cale sets fire to several rooms as a diversion. Tyler inadvertently triggers the tunnel explosives and is vaporized. Killing most of the mercenaries and freeing the hostages, Cale blows Stenz up with a grenade belt. Sawyer attacks Walker, who uses Sawyer's handprint to activate the football and target the Iranian cities, when Cale crashes a reinforced [[Chevrolet Suburban]] through the Oval Office. Before Walker can launch the missiles, Cale kills him with the car's [[rotary cannon]]. Emily waves off the incoming fighter planes with a presidential flag, calling off the air strike.\n\nCale realizes that Raphelson was Walker's accomplice. Believing Sawyer dead and that Cale has no proof, Raphelson is tricked into confessing and is arrested for [[treason]]. Sawyer names Cale his new special agent, taking him and Emily on an aerial tour of DC. Sawyer receives word that [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Israel]] and Iran have agreed to his peace deal after learning of events at the White House, calling for an end to all wars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div
