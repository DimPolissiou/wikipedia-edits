It is characterised by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, and long [[canine teeth]]. Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the [[ventral]] parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches {{convert|40|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|8|-|18|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It was first [[scientific description|scientifically described]] by German naturalist [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1776. Three [[subspecies]] are recognised since 2017.\n\nTypically [[nocturnality|nocturnal]], the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe. It is [[territory (animal)|territorial]], and lives mainly alone or in pairs. The caracal is a [[carnivore]] that typically preys upon small [[mammal]]s, birds, and [[rodent]]s. It can leap higher than {{cvt|12|ft|m|0|disp=flip}} and catch birds in midair. It stalks its prey until it is within {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} of it, after which it runs it down and kills its prey with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck. Both sexes become [[sexually mature]] by the time they are one year old and breed throughout the year. Gestation lasts between two and three months, resulting in a litter of one to six kittens. Juveniles leave their mothers at the age of nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of captive caracals is nearly 16 years.\n\nCaracals have been tamed and used for hunting since the time of [[ancient Egypt]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Faure|first1=E.|last2=Kitchener|first2=A.

Mating has not been extensively studied; a limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, which rolls on the ground.

Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of [[aardvark]]s and [[porcupine]]s. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws not retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around the same time, the kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them every day. All the [[milk teeth]] appear in 50 days, and [[permanent dentition]] is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=heptner/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernard|first1=R. T. F.|last2=Stuart|first2=C.

[[Habitat loss]] due to [[agricultural expansion]], the building of roads and settlements is a major threat in all range countries. It is thought to be close to extinction in North Africa, Critically Endangered in Pakistan, Endangered in Jordan, but stable in central and Southern Africa. Local people kill caracal to protect livestock, or in retaliation for its preying on small livestock. Additionally, it is threatened by hunting for the [[pet trade]] on the Arabian Peninsula. In Turkey and Iran, caracals are frequently killed in road accidents.<ref name=iucn/>\nIn Uzbekistan, the major threat to caracal is killing by herders in retaliation for livestock losses. Guarding techniques and sheds are inadequate to protect small livestock like goats and sheep from being attacked by predators. Additionally, similarly to Ethiopia, heavy-traffic roads crossing Caracal habitat pose a potential threat for the species.<ref name=Gritsina2019/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Lightmatter caracal.jpg|thumb|right|A caracal in the [[San Diego Zoo]]]]\nAfrican caracal populations are listed under [[CITES Appendix II]], while Asian populations come under [[CITES Appendix I]]. Hunting of caracal is prohibited in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In Namibia and South Africa, it is considered a \"problem animal\", and its hunting is allowed for protecting livestock.

It is characterised by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, and long [[canine teeth]]. Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the [[ventral]] parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches {{convert|40|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|8|-|18|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It was first [[scientific description|scientifically described]] by German naturalist [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1776. Three [[subspecies]] are recognised since 2017.\n\nTypically [[nocturnality|nocturnal]], the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe. It is [[territory (animal)|territorial]], and lives mainly alone or in pairs. The caracal is a [[carnivore]] that typically preys upon small [[mammal]]s, birds, and [[rodent]]s. It can leap higher than {{cvt|12|ft|m|0|disp=flip}} and catch birds in midair. It stalks its prey until it is within {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} of it, after which it runs it down and kills its prey with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck. Both sexes become [[sexually mature]] by the time they are one year old and breed throughout the year. Gestation lasts between two and three months, resulting in a litter of one to six kittens. Juveniles leave their mothers at the age of nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of captive caracals is nearly 16 years.\n\nCaracals have been tamed and used for hunting since the time of [[ancient Egypt]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Faure|first1=E.|last2=Kitchener|first2=A.

However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; a limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, which rolls on the ground. Following this, he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separates after copulation.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=kingdon/>\n\n[[Gestation]] lasts about two to three months, following which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of [[aardvark]]s and [[porcupine]]s. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws not retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around the same time, the kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them every day. All the [[milk teeth]] appear in 50 days, and [[permanent dentition]] is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers.

An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The Active model also received new darker seat fabrics of better quality and the addition of a CD player as standard. The new dark red Fiat badge replaced the blue roundel on the Panda in Summer 2007.\n\n===2009 revisions===\nThe Panda range was mildly rearranged again in 2009, with the addition of Active Eco and Dynamic Eco models. These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The new architecture is based on the [[Fiat Mini platform]]. The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda. Unlike the previous generation - which adopted a 70 PS 1.4 ''[[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]]'' inline four - it is powered by the turbocharged, 0.9 liter, two-cylinder ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda.

On response cards distributed by FIAT's sales department, participants gauged the design's exterior and interior appearance and finish, spaciousness, instruments and controls, engine size, price, and its provisional name: ''Rustica''.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over Fiat's plans to move production from plants in Cassino, Sulmona and Termini Imerese to Turin and Desio. An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]].

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Fiat clarified on the same day that ESC would be offered on the entire Fiat Panda range in the first months of 2012.<ref name=\"fiatpress11345\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatpress.com/press/article/11345|title=Fiat Panda EuroNCAP result|date= 23 November 2011|website= FGA EMEA Press site|type= press release|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Collision avoidance system====\n{{main|Collision avoidance system#Fiat|l1=Fiat City Brake Control}}\nFiat's ''City Brake Control'' low-speed crash avoidance system is available as optional on the Panda.\nThe system works by readying and if necessary automatically executing an emergency stop whenever an imminent collision is detected by its [[Lidar|laser sensor]].<ref name=\"fiatpress115664\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatpress.com/press/article/115664|title=City Brake Control wins the \u2018Euro NCAP Advanced\u2019 award |date= 26 June 2013|website= FGA EMEA Press site|type= press release|accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> In 2013 City Brake Control attained the [[Euro NCAP#Euro NCAP Advanced|Euro NCAP Advanced]] reward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/rewards/fiat_cbc.aspx|title=Euro NCAP Advanced: FIAT City Brake Control|website= Euro NCAP official site|accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Records===\nAt 5:28pm on Monday 11 February 2013, Philip Young and Paul Brace broke the world record drive, in either direction, from Cape Town in South Africa to London in Great Britain with a Fiat Panda two-cylinder 0.9 TwinAir.
