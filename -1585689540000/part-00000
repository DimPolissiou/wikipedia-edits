The search was part of the most important judicial case to this day regarding the sale of illegal drugs. The case links the most shocking files of drug-trafficking: the Unicenter shopping mall murders, the ephedrine trafficking case, the arrest of the Colombian drug-dealer nicknamed \"Mi Sangre\" (\"My Blood\") and the smuggling of almost a ton of cocaine into Spain for which the brothers Gustavo Adolfo and Eduardo Juli\u00e1 were arrested and convicted in [[Barcelona]]. In a surprising turn of events that shows the complicity of public agencies with those crimes, the head of the Attorney General's Office of San Isidro, Julio Alberto Novo, was indicted for cover-up and violating his duties as a public official. The investigation determined that Adolfo Juli\u00e1's defence lawyer and his sister-in-law are close collaborators of Novo in positions of responsibility in the Buenos Aires province attorney's offices. In addition, Novot's private secretary was in touch with the defence lawyer of one of the criminals involved in the Unicenter shooting. According to federal attorney Fernando Dom\u00ednguez, Novo and other indicted people would be responsible for \"obstructing and frustrating the legal development of the process in which the murders were investigated\". They are indicted for, in short, obstructing justice.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/179325/views-and-opinions-from-yesterday%E2%80%99s-newspapers ''The Buenos Aires Herald'': Sunday columnists round-up / Views and opinions from yesterday\u2019s newspapers.

This statement is there on the phone recordings by social movement leader [[Luis D'El\u00eda]], who said he had talked about the issue with Federal Planning Minister [[Julio De Vido]]. Official statistics on foreign trade leave no room for doubts. As the Foreign Ministry revealed, based on information by the [[INDEC]], the trade between [[Argentina]] and [[Iran]], far from growing, decreased after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding in January 2013. Maybe some of the middlemen taped by Nisman believed they might use their contacts with the powerful \u2014both in Tehran and Buenos Aires\u2014 to seal a deal and receive a commission. But their pathetic ignorance of the structural conditions of trade between the two countries made it impossible. Not even the prosecutor's tragic death evades the lightness of the opinion he signed.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/180436/views-and-opinions-from-yesterday%E2%80%99s-newspapers Sunday columnists round-up / Views and opinions from yesterday\u2019s newspapers.

As part of that deal, Argentina would request that [[Interpol]] withdraw its red notices on Iranian suspects. The former head of Interpol, Roland Noble, said that he was shocked to hear about this aspect of the alleged deal, and categorically denied any knowledge of it. (He even went so far as to produce earlier correspondence with [[H\u00e9ctor Timerman]], in which the two clearly agreed that the red notices had to remain in place.) State news agencies batted away the accusation that Argentina would barter for Iranian oil; the country needed refined, not crude, oil, which Iran couldn't provide. There were other questions about the legitimacy of Nisman's charges. He did not have the support of the local Jewish community, and he had circumvented the judge who had long presided over the [[AMIA Bombing|AMIA]] case. '''Verbitsky''', the president of CELS, pointed out to me that only two pages of Nisman's nearly three-hundred-page report concern the legal basis of the criminal charges against the President, which is striking considering the magnitude of the accusations.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman?

But the bill grants more power to the new department in the area of criminal investigation, a decision that \"contradicts the basic goal of the reform,\" the centre said.<ref>[http://www.cels.org.ar/home/index.php?info=&ids=&lang=en&ss= CELS, 2015.]</ref>\n\nCELS had a less favourable take on this decision. \"Revising the role of the AFI should lead it to revise its existing staff,\" the human rights organizations said yesterday. According to the bill, agents will be recruited in a more transparent way and will be constantly monitored by their superiors, who will be able to remove them from their posts if they are accused of targeting authorities. However, CELS said these parametres should be more clear in the final version of the legislation.\nWho will lead investigations? CELS warned the full text of the bill unveiled grants new powers to the AFI by reinforcing the department's investigative powers based on the \"new threats\" doctrine following the 9/11 attacks. \"Even if (these new powers) are limited to international threats, the agency's ability to carry out criminal investigations was not originally intended as an intelligence activity, except if ordered by a judge\". This new function, far from helping intelligence agents to work on information collection as well as data and information analysis, will make it harder for the Argentine state to move away \"from the promiscuous relationship between the intelligence structure and federal justice\", as criticized by CFK during the national broadcast where she announced the new proposed changes.\n\nNonetheless, the CELS leadership has expressed hope that \"changes to the bill itself or the implementation\" will resolve some of the outstanding issues.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/181237/CELS-more-is-needed-in-reform ''The Buenos Aires Herald'', CELS: more is needed in reform.

The search was part of the most important judicial case to this day regarding the sale of illegal drugs. The case links the most shocking files of drug-trafficking: the Unicenter shopping mall murders, the ephedrine trafficking case, the arrest of the Colombian drug-dealer nicknamed \"Mi Sangre\" (\"My Blood\") and the smuggling of almost a ton of cocaine into Spain for which the brothers Gustavo Adolfo and Eduardo Juli\u00e1 were arrested and convicted in [[Barcelona]]. In a surprising turn of events that shows the complicity of public agencies with those crimes, the head of the Attorney General's Office of San Isidro, Julio Alberto Novo, was indicted for cover-up and violating his duties as a public official. The investigation determined that Adolfo Juli\u00e1's defence lawyer and his sister-in-law are close collaborators of Novo in positions of responsibility in the Buenos Aires province attorney's offices. In addition, Novot's private secretary was in touch with the defence lawyer of one of the criminals involved in the Unicenter shooting. According to federal attorney Fernando Dom\u00ednguez, Novo and other indicted people would be responsible for \"obstructing and frustrating the legal development of the process in which the murders were investigated\". They are indicted for, in short, obstructing justice.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/179325/views-and-opinions-from-yesterday%E2%80%99s-newspapers ''The Buenos Aires Herald'': Sunday columnists round-up / Views and opinions from yesterday\u2019s newspapers.

This statement is there on the phone recordings by social movement leader [[Luis D'El\u00eda]], who said he had talked about the issue with Federal Planning Minister [[Julio De Vido]]. Official statistics on foreign trade leave no room for doubts. As the Foreign Ministry revealed, based on information by the [[INDEC]], the trade between [[Argentina]] and [[Iran]], far from growing, decreased after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding in January 2013. Maybe some of the middlemen taped by Nisman believed they might use their contacts with the powerful \u2014both in Tehran and Buenos Aires\u2014 to seal a deal and receive a commission. But their pathetic ignorance of the structural conditions of trade between the two countries made it impossible. Not even the prosecutor's tragic death evades the lightness of the opinion he signed.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/180436/views-and-opinions-from-yesterday%E2%80%99s-newspapers Sunday columnists round-up / Views and opinions from yesterday\u2019s newspapers.

State news agencies batted away the accusation that Argentina would barter for Iranian oil; the country needed refined, not crude, oil, which Iran couldn't provide. There were other questions about the legitimacy of Nisman's charges. He did not have the support of the local Jewish community, and he had circumvented the judge who had long presided over the [[AMIA Bombing|AMIA]] case. '''Verbitsky''', the president of CELS, pointed out to me that only two pages of Nisman's nearly three-hundred-page report concern the legal basis of the criminal charges against the President, which is striking considering the magnitude of the accusations.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/happened-alberto-nisman? Jonathan Blitzer: What Happened to Alberto Nisman? New Yorker, January 31, 2015.]</ref>}}\n\n[[The Guardian]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|The mysterious death of [[Alberto Nisman]], who was investigating a 1994 terrorist attack, has alarmed many Jews but others warn against over-simplifying the case. '''Verbitsky''' also cautioned against over-simplifying the case. \"We see the process now of turning Nisman into a hero. He's a tragic figure, but he cannot be considered a hero\", he said, noting how close the prosecutor was to the intelligence agency and foreign embassies. '''Verbitsky''' heads the CELS, a human rights group that helped to secure a 2005 settlement for Amia families in which the government took responsibility for not preventing the bombing and for covering up what happened. He described the move to create a truth commission with Iran as an ingenuous attempt to push forward the quest for justice, though he acknowledges that will now be difficult. \"Twenty years after the blast, it is very difficult to discover who did it\", he noted.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/death-prosecutor-argentina-jewish-community-angry-distrustful?CMP=share_btn_tw Argentina Death of prosecutor leaves Argentina's Jewish community angry and distrustful.

The Buenos Aires Herald, February 2, 2015.]</ref>\n\nNew regulations to bring transparency to the country's intelligence system do not go far enough, while some measures might even worsen the problems it intends to fix, the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS) headed by Verbitsky, said.\nThe dissolution of the Intelligence Secretariat and the creation of a new Federal Intelligence Agency, is \"a major, transcendent\" move, CELS said. But the bill grants more power to the new department in the area of criminal investigation, a decision that \"contradicts the basic goal of the reform,\" the centre said.<ref>[http://www.cels.org.ar/home/index.php?info=&ids=&lang=en&ss= CELS, 2015.]</ref>\n\nCELS had a less favourable take on this decision. \"Revising the role of the AFI should lead it to revise its existing staff,\" the human rights organizations said yesterday. According to the bill, agents will be recruited in a more transparent way and will be constantly monitored by their superiors, who will be able to remove them from their posts if they are accused of targeting authorities. However, CELS said these parametres should be more clear in the final version of the legislation.\nWho will lead investigations? CELS warned the full text of the bill unveiled grants new powers to the AFI by reinforcing the department's investigative powers based on the \"new threats\" doctrine following the 9/11 attacks. \"Even if (these new powers) are limited to international threats, the agency's ability to carry out criminal investigations was not originally intended as an intelligence activity, except if ordered by a judge\". This new function, far from helping intelligence agents to work on information collection as well as data and information analysis, will make it harder for the Argentine state to move away \"from the promiscuous relationship between the intelligence structure and federal justice\", as criticized by CFK during the national broadcast where she announced the new proposed changes.\n\nNonetheless, the CELS leadership has expressed hope that \"changes to the bill itself or the implementation\" will resolve some of the outstanding issues.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/181237/CELS-more-is-needed-in-reform ''The Buenos Aires Herald'', CELS: more is needed in reform.
