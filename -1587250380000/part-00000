Instead of entering a military career, as his father had done, Abelard became an academic. During his early academic pursuits, Abelard wandered throughout France, debating and learning, so as (in his own words) \"he became such a one as the [[Peripatetics]].\"<ref name=\"Calamitatum\">{{cite book|title=Historia Calamitatum|last=Abelard|first=Peter|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html|accessdate=7 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204063034/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html|archivedate=4 December 2008}}</ref> He first studied in the Loire area, where the [[Nominalism|nominalist]] [[Roscellinus]] of [[Compi\u00e8gne]], who had been accused of heresy by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], was his teacher during this period.<ref name=\"CBD\" />\n\n=== Rise to fame ===\nAround 1100, Abelard's travels finally brought him to [[Paris]]. In the great [[cathedral school]] of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (before the current cathedral was actually built), he was taught for a while by [[William of Champeaux]], the disciple of [[Anselm of Laon]] (not to be confused with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]]), a leading proponent of [[Philosophical realism|Realism]].<ref name=\"CBD\" /> During this time he changed his surname to \"Abelard\", sometimes written \"Abailard\" or \"Abaelardus\".

On his return, after 1108, he found William lecturing at the hermitage of Saint-Victor, just outside the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]], and there they once again became rivals, with Abelard challenging William over his theory of universals. Abelard was once more victorious, and Abelard was almost able to hold the position of master at Notre Dame. For a short time, however, William was able to prevent Abelard from lecturing in Paris. Abelard accordingly was forced to resume his school at Melun, which he was then able to move, from  {{circa|1110-12}}, to Paris itself, on the heights of [[Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]], overlooking Notre-Dame.{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=40}}\n\nFrom his success in dialectic, he next turned to [[theology]] and in 1113 moved to [[Laon]] to attend the lectures of [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] on Biblical [[exegesis]] and Christian doctrine.<ref name=EB /> Unimpressed by Anselm's teaching, Abelard began to offer his own lectures on the book of Ezekiel. Anselm forbade him to continue this teaching, and Abelard returned to Paris where, in around 1115, he became master of the cathedral school of [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] (though the present cathedral was not yet begun) and a canon of [[Sens]] (the cathedral of the archdiocese to which Paris belonged).<ref name=\"Calamitatum\" />\n\n=== H\u00e9lo\u00efse ===\n[[File:Abelard and Heloise.jpeg|thumb|Abelard and [[Helo\u00efse]] in a manuscript of the [[Roman de la Rose]] (14th century)]]\nDistinguished in figure and manners, Abelard was seen surrounded by crowds\u2014it is said thousands of students\u2014drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as he says, to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, at the height of his fame, he encountered romance.<ref name=\"Calamitatum\" /><!---a guess-->[[File:Helo\u00efse et d'Ab\u00e9lard.jpg|thumb|right|\"Abaelardus and Helo\u00efse surprised by Master Fulbert\", by [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] painter [[Jean Vignaud]] (1819)]]\n\n[[H\u00e9lo\u00efse d'Argenteuil]] lived within the precincts of Notre-Dame, under the care of her uncle, the secular [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Fulbert. She was remarkable for her knowledge of [[classics|classical letters]], which extended beyond [[Latin]] to [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Abelard sought a place in Fulbert's house and, in 1115 or 1116, began an affair with H\u00e9lo\u00efse. The affair interfered with his career, and Abelard himself boasted of his conquest. Once Fulbert found out, he separated them, but they continued to meet in secret. H\u00e9lo\u00efse became pregnant and was sent by Abelard to be looked after by his family in Brittany, where she gave birth to a son whom she named Astrolabe after the [[astrolabe|scientific instrument]].<ref name=EB /><ref name=\"Calamitatum\" />{{efn|Astrolabe, the son of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse, is mentioned by Peter the Venerable of Cluny, where Abelard spent his last years, when Peter the Venerable wrote to H\u00e9loise: \"I will gladly do my best to obtain a prebend in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake\". A 'Petrus Astralabius' is recorded at the Cathedral of Nantes in 1150, and the same name appears at the Cistercian abbey at Hauterive in what is now Switzerland, but it is uncertain whether this is the same man. However, Astrolabe is recorded as dying at Paraclete on 29 or 30 October, year unknown, appearing in the necrology as \"Petrus Astralabius magistri nostri Petri filius\". (See {{harvnb|Radice|1947|loc= (trans.)}}, The Letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 287; for the necrology, see Enid McLeod, H\u00e9loise (London: Chatto & Windus, 2nd edn., 1971, pp. 253, 283-84)).}}\n\nTo appease Fulbert, Abelard proposed a secret marriage so as not to mar his career prospects. H\u00e9lo\u00efse initially opposed it, but the couple were married. When Fulbert publicly disclosed the marriage, and H\u00e9lo\u00efse denied it, Abelard sent H\u00e9lo\u00efse to the convent at [[Argenteuil]], where she had been brought up, in order to protect her from her uncle. H\u00e9lo\u00efse dressed as a nun and shared the nun's life, though she was not veiled.\n\nFulbert, most probably believing that Abelard wanted to be rid of H\u00e9lo\u00efse by forcing her to become a nun, arranged for a band of men to break into Abelard's room one night and [[Castration|castrate]] him. [[Roscellinus]] would later belittle Abelard for getting castrated.<ref>Russell, Bertrand. ''The History of Western Philosophy''. Simon & Schuster, 1945, p. 436.</ref> Later, Abelard decided to become a monk at the monastery of St Denis, near Paris.<ref name=EB /> Before doing so he insisted that H\u00e9lo\u00efse take vows as a nun. H\u00e9lo\u00efse sent letters to Abelard, questioning why she must submit to a religious life for which she had no calling.<ref name=\"Calamitatum\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nIn the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], the 40-year-old Abelard sought to bury himself as a monk with his woes out of sight.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kevin Guilfoy|first=Jeffrey E. Brower|title=The Cambridge Companion To Abelard|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Abelard and monastic reform|isbn=978-0-521-77596-0|pages=25|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jaj-JMThB4MC&pg=PA25&dq=abelard+became+a+monk#v=onepage&q=abelard%20became%20a%20monk&f=false}}</ref> Finding no respite in the [[cloister]], and having gradually turned again to study, he gave in to urgent entreaties, and reopened his school at an unknown priory owned by the monastery. His lectures, now framed in a devotional spirit, and with lectures on theology as well as his previous lectures on logic, were once again heard by crowds of students, and his old influence seemed to have returned. Using his studies of the Bible and \u2014 in his view \u2014 inconsistent writings of the leaders of the church as his basis, he wrote ''[[Sic et Non]]'' (''Yes and No'').<ref name=EB />\n\nNo sooner had he published his theological lectures (the ''Theologia Summi Boni'') than his adversaries picked up on his rationalistic interpretation of the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] dogma. Two pupils of [[Anselm of Laon]], [[Alberich of Reims]] and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with the heresy of [[Sabellianism|Sabellius]] in a provincial [[synod]] held at [[Soissons]] in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn the ''Theologia'' himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, but it seems to have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked almost immediately, because after a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.<ref name=Marenbon-15 />\n\nLife in his own monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard himself was partly responsible. He took a sort of malicious pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for the sake of a joke, he cited [[Bede]] to prove that the believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] had been [[Bishop of Corinth]], while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot [[Hilduin]] that he had been [[Bishop of Athens]]. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard wrote a letter to the Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' and St. [[Jerome]], according to whom [[Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth]], was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=41}}\n\nAbelard initially lodged at St Ayoul of Provins, where the prior was a friend. Then, after the death of Abbot Adam in March 1122, Abelard was able to gain permission from the new abbot, [[Abbot Suger|Suger]], to live \"in whatever solitary place he wished\". In a deserted place near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] in [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]], he built a cabin of stubble and reeds, and a simple oratory dedicated to the Trinity and became a [[hermit]]. When his retreat became known, students flocked from Paris, and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts. He began to teach again there. The oratory was rebuilt in wood and stone and rededicated as the [[Oratory of the Paraclete]].{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=41}}\n[[File:Abelard cour Napoleon Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Abelard at [[Louvre Palace]] in Paris by [[Jules Cavelier]]]]\n\nAbelard remained at the Paraclete for about five years.

The region was inhospitable, the domain a prey to outlaws, the house itself savage and disorderly.{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=41}} There, too, his relations with the community deteriorated.<ref name=\"Luscombe\" />\n\nDuring this time, however, Abelard came back into contact with H\u00e9lo\u00efse. In April 1129, [[Abbot Suger]] of St Denis succeeded in his plans to have the nuns, including H\u00e9lo\u00efse, expelled from the convent at Argenteuil, in order to take over the property for St Denis. H\u00e9lo\u00efse had meanwhile become the head of a new foundation of nuns called the [[Paraclete]]. Abelard became the abbot of the new community and provided it with a rule and with a justification of the nun's way of life; in this he emphasized the virtue of literary study. He also provided books of hymns he had composed, and in the early 1130s he and H\u00e9lo\u00efse composed a collection of their own love letters and religious correspondence.<ref name=\"Luscombe\" />\n[[File:France illustr\u00e9e I p473.png|thumb|Abelard receives the monastery of the [[Paraclete]] H\u00e9lo\u00efse (1129)]]\n\nLack of success at St Gildas made Abelard decide to take up public teaching again (although he remained for a few more years, officially, Abbot of St Gildas). It is not entirely certain what he then did, but given that [[John of Salisbury]] heard Abelard lecture on dialectic in 1136, it is presumed that he returned to Paris and resumed teaching on the [[Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]]. It is presumed his lectures included logic, at least until 1136,{{efn|Given John of Salisbury's testimony.}} but were mainly concerned with the Bible, Christian doctrine, and ethics. Then he produced further drafts of his ''Theologia'' in which he analyzed the sources of belief in the Trinity and praised the pagan philosophers of classical antiquity for their virtues and for their discovery by the use of [[reason]] of many fundamental aspects of Christian revelation.<ref name=\"Luscombe\" />\n\nAt some point in this time Abelard wrote, among other things, his famous ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]''.

Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, ''Ethica'' or ''[[Scito te ipsum]]'' (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions.<ref name=EB /> During this period, he also wrote ''[[Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum]]'' (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also ''[[Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos]]'', a commentary on [[St. Paul]]'s epistle to the Romans, where he expands on the meaning of [[Christ]]'s life.<ref name=EB />\n\n==== Conflicts with Bernard of Clairvaux====\nAbelard was to face, however, another challenge which would put a final end to his teaching career. After 1136, it is not clear whether Abelard had stopped teaching, or whether he perhaps continued with all except his lectures on logic until as late as 1141. Whatever the exact timing, a process was instigated by [[William of St-Thierry|William of St Thierry]], who discovered what he considered to be heresies in some of Abelard's teaching. In spring 1140 he wrote to the Bishop of Chartres and to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] denouncing them. Another, less distinguished, theologian, [[Thomas of Morigny]], also produced at the same time a list of Abelard's supposed heresies, perhaps at Bernard's instigation. Bernard's complaint mainly is that Abelard has applied logic where it is not applicable, and that is illogical.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj_CNqojMV8C |page=134 |title=Bernard of Clairvaux on the Life of the Mind |author=John R. Sommerfeldt |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8091-4203-3}}</ref> Amid pressure from Bernard, Abelard challenged Bernard either to withdraw his accusations, or to make them publicly at the important [[Councils of Sens|church council at Sens]] planned for 2 June 1141. In so doing, Abelard put himself into the position of the wronged party and forced Bernard to defend himself from the accusation of slander. Bernard avoided this trap, however: on the eve of the council, he called a private meeting of the assembled bishops and persuaded them to condemn, one by one, each of the heretical propositions he attributed to Abelard. When Abelard appeared at the council the next day, he was presented with a list of condemned propositions imputed to him.<ref name=\"John Marenbon 2004 p17\">{{harvnb|Marenbon|2004|p=17}}.</ref>\n\nRefusing to answer to these propositions, Abelard left the assembly, appealed to the Pope, and set off for Rome, hoping that the Pope would be more supportive. However, this hope was unfounded. On 16 July 1141, [[Pope Innocent II]] issued a bull [[excommunication|excommunicating]] Abelard and his followers and imposing perpetual silence on him, and in a second document he ordered Abelard to be confined in a monastery and his books to be burned. Abelard was saved from this sentence, however, by [[Peter the Venerable]], abbot of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]]. Abelard had stopped there, on his way to Rome, before the papal condemnation had reached France. Peter persuaded Abelard, already old, to give up his journey and stay at the monastery. Peter managed to arrange a reconciliation with Bernard, to have the sentence of excommunication lifted, and to persuade Innocent that it was enough if Abelard remained under the aegis of Cluny. Abelard was treated not as a condemned heretic, but as a revered and wise scholar.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He spent his final months at the priory of St. Marcel, near [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]], before he died on 21 April 1142.<ref name=\"John Marenbon 2004 p17\" /> He is said to have uttered the last words \"I don't know\", before expiring.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A history|page=[https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0/page/687 687]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|url=https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0|url-access=registration |accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref> He died from a combination of fever and a skin disorder, most likely [[scurvy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman and Betty|last=Donaldson|title=How Did They Die?|year=1980|publisher=Greenwich House|isbn=978-0-517-40302-0}}</ref>\n\n==== Disputed resting place/lovers' pilgrimage ====\n[[File:Abelardtomb closeup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dedicatory panel in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]\nAbelard was first buried at St. Marcel, but his remains were soon carried off secretly to the Paraclete, and given over to the loving care of H\u00e9lo\u00efse, who in time came herself to rest beside them in 1163.\n\nThe bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in eastern Paris.<ref>{{harvnb|Burge|2006|p=276}}.</ref> The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.\n\nThis remains, however, disputed. The [[Oratory of the Paraclete]] claims Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse are buried there and that what exists in P\u00e8re-Lachaise is merely a monument, or [[cenotaph]]. According to P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the remains of both lovers were transferred from the Oratory in the early 19th century and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds.<ref>{{harvnb|Burge|2006|pp=276\u2013277}}.</ref> Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at P\u00e8re-Lachaise, Helo\u00efse's remains are elsewhere.\n\n== Philosophy and theology ==\n{{Catholic philosophy}}\n\n=== Philosophical thought ===\nThe general importance of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with the object of giving a formal, rational expression to received ecclesiastical doctrine. Though his particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from the heads of the Church.\n\nHe helped to establish the ascendancy of the philosophical authority of [[Aristotle]] which became firmly established in the half-century after his death. It was at this time that the completed ''[[Organon]]'', and gradually all the other works of the Greek thinker, first came to be available in the schools. Before his time, [[Plato]]'s authority was the basis for the prevailing Realism. As regards his so-called Conceptualism and his attitude to the question of universals, a discussion can be found in the 1911 [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] article [[s:1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Scholasticism|''Scholasticism'']].\n\nOutside of his dialectic, it was in ethics that Abelard showed greatest activity of philosophical thought. He stressed the subjective intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value, of human action. His thought in this direction, anticipating something of modern speculation, is remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least in the field of morals, hardly venturing to bring the principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after they were made fully aware of Aristotle's great ethical inquiries.\n\nRegarding the un[[baptized]] who die in [[infancy]], Abelard\u2014in ''Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos''\u2014emphasized the goodness of God and interpreted St. [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s \"mildest punishment\" as the pain of loss at being denied the [[beatific vision]] (''carentia visionis Dei''), without hope of obtaining it, but with no additional punishments. His thought contributed to the forming of [[Limbo of Infants]] theory in the 12th\u201313th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|title=The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised|author=International Theological Commission, the Vatican|accessdate=7 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222011157/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|archivedate=22 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Philosophical works ===\n* ''Logica ingredientibus'' (\"Logic for Advanced\") completed before 1121\n* ''Petri Abaelardi Glossae in Porphyrium'' (\"The Glosses of Peter Abailard on Porphyry\"), c. 1120\n* ''Dialectica'', before 1125 (1115\u20131116 according to John Marenbon, ''The Philosophy of Peter Abelard'', Cambridge University Press 1997).<ref>Latin text in L.

Only one of his strictly philosophical works, the ethical treatise ''Scito te ipsum'', had been published before the 19th century, in 1721. It was only with the publication by Cousin in 1836 of the collection entitled ''Ouvrages inedits d'Abelard'' that Abelard's philosophical work began to be studied more closely. Cousin's collection gave extracts from the theological work ''[[Sic et Non]]'' (\"Yes and No\") which is an assemblage of what Abelard saw as opposite opinions on doctrinal points culled from the Fathers as a basis for discussion. The collection also includes the ''Dialectica, ''and commentaries on logical works of Aristotle, Porphyry and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]. Two works published by Cousin and believed at the time to be by Abelard, the fragment ''De Generibus et Speciebus ''(published in the 1836 collection), and also the psychological treatise ''De Intellectibus'' (published separately by Cousin in  ''Fragmens Philosophiques'', vol. ii.), are'' ''now believed on upon internal evidence not to be by Abelard himself, but only to have sprung out of his school''.'' A genuine work, the ''Glossulae super Porphyrium'', from which [[Charles de R\u00e9musat]] gave extracts in his monograph ''Abelard'' (1845), was published in 1930. The fascinating hypothesis of Abaelard's influence on [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] and [[Spinoza]] has been developed by [[Robert Menasse]] and first published in his essay \"Enlightenment as Harmonious Strategy\" edited by ''Versopolis'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |title=Enlightenment as a Harmonious Strategy |website=Versopolis |first=Robert |last=Menasse |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=2018-03-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401004614/http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |archivedate=2018-04-01 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Notes from Pope Benedict XVI ===\nDuring his general audience on 4 November 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] talked about [[Saint]] [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and Peter Abelard to illustrate differences in the [[monastic]] and [[scholasticism|scholastic]] approaches to [[theology]] in the 12th century. The Pope recalled that theology is the search for a rational understanding (if possible) of the mysteries of Christian [[revelation]], which is believed through [[faith]] \u2014 faith that seeks intelligibility (''fides quaerens intellectum''). But St. Bernard, a representative of monastic theology, emphasized \"faith\" whereas Abelard, who is a scholastic, stressed \"understanding through reason\".<ref name=\"NCR\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |title=St. Bernard and Peter Abelard |publisher=National Catholic Register \u2013 [[EWTN News, Inc.]] |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619153341/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |archivedate=June 19, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nFor Bernard, faith is based on the testimony of [[Scripture]] and on the teaching of the [[Fathers of the Church]]. Thus, Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and, in a more general way, with those who would subject the truths of faith to the critical examination of reason \u2014 an examination which, in his opinion, posed a grave danger: [[intellectualism]], the relativizing of truth, and the questioning of the truths of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in [[contemplative prayer]], by the affective union of the heart and mind with God, with only one purpose: to promote the living, intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.<ref name=\"NCR\" />\n\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, an excessive use of [[philosophy]] rendered Abelard's [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]] dangerously fragile and, thus, his idea of God. In the field of morals, his teaching was vague, as he insisted on considering the intention of the subject as the only basis for describing the goodness or evil of moral acts, thereby ignoring the objective meaning and moral value of the acts, resulting in a dangerous [[subjectivism]]. But the Pope recognized the great achievements of Abelard, who made a decisive contribution to the development of scholastic theology, which eventually expressed itself in a more mature and fruitful way during the following century. And some of Abelard's insights should not be underestimated, for example, his affirmation that non-Christian religious traditions already contain some form of preparation for welcoming Christ.<ref name=\"NCR\" />\n\nPope Benedict XVI concluded that Bernard's \"theology of the heart\" and Abelard's \"theology of reason\" represent the importance of healthy theological discussion and [[Humility|humble]] obedience to the authority of the Church, especially when the questions being debated have not been defined by the [[magisterium]]. St. Bernard, and even Abelard himself, always recognized without any hesitation the authority of the magisterium. Abelard showed [[humility]] in acknowledging his errors, and Bernard exercised great [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]. The Pope emphasized, in the field of theology, there should be a balance between [[architecture|architectonic]] principles, which are given through Revelation and which always maintain their primary importance, and the interpretative principles proposed by philosophy (that is, by reason), which have an important function, but only as a tool. When the balance breaks down, theological reflection runs the risk of becoming marred by error; it is then up to the magisterium to exercise the needed service to truth, for which it is responsible.<ref name=\"NCR\" />\n\n== The letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse ==\nThe story of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse has proved immensely popular in modern European culture. This story is known almost entirely from a few sources: first, the ''Historia Calamitatum; ''secondly, the seven letters between Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse which survive (three written by Abelard, and four by H\u00e9lo\u00efse), and always follow the ''Historia Calamitatum'' in the manuscript tradition; thirdly, four letters between Peter the Venerable and H\u00e9lo\u00efse (three by Peter, one by H\u00e9lo\u00efse).<ref>In the Latin categorising of Abelard's work, these are numbered ''Epistolae'' 2-8, because the ''Historia calamitatum'' (which takes the form of a letter) is termed ''Epistolae ''1.</ref> They are, in modern times, the best known and most widely translated parts of Abelard's work.\n\nIt is unclear quite how the letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual references to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and [[Walter Map]]. It seems unlikely, however, that the letters were widely known in this period. Rather, the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore seems likely that the letters sent between Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse were kept by H\u00e9lo\u00efse at the Paraclete along with the 'Letters of Direction', and that more than a century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=47}}.</ref> At this time, the story of their love affair was summarised by [[Jean de Meun]] in his continuation to ''Le Roman de la Rose''.\n\nTheir story does not appear to have been widely known in the later Middle Ages, either. There is no mention of the couple in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]; [[Chaucer]] makes a very brief reference in the Wife of Bath's Prologue (lines 677\u20138), but no more. One of the first people to show a deeper interest in the couple appears to have been [[Petrarch]], who owned an early 14th-century manuscript of the couple's letters. This silence on what is today seen as a particularly touching story is perhaps surprising, given the Renaissance ideal of courtly love \u2013 but it is possible that the story of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse could not be appropriately fitted into the ideals of the lover's devotion to the chaste and unattainable lady.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=48}}.</ref>\n\nThe first publication of the letters, in Latin, was in Paris in 1616, simultaneously in two editions. These editions gave rise to numerous translations of the letters into European languages \u2013 and consequent 18th- and 19th-century interest in the story of the medieval lovers.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=49}}.</ref> In the 18th century, the couple were revered as tragic lovers, who endured adversity in life but were united in death. With this reputation, they were the only individuals from the [[French Revolution|pre-Revolutionary]] period whose remains were given a place of honour at the newly founded cemetery of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise]] in Paris. At this time, they were effectively revered as romantic saints; for some, they were forerunners of modernity, at odds with the ecclesiastical and monastic structures of their day and to be celebrated more for rejecting the traditions of the past than for any particular intellectual achievement.<ref>Constant J Mews, ''Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse'', (Oxford: OUP, 2005), p4</ref>\n\nThe ''Historia'' was first published in 1841 by John Caspar Orelli of Turici. Then, in 1849, [[Victor Cousin]] published ''Petri Abaelardi opera'', in part based on the two Paris editions of 1616 but also based on the reading of four manuscripts; this became the standard edition of the letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=50}}.</ref> Soon after, in 1855, Migne printed an expanded version of the 1616 edition under the title ''Opera Petri Abaelardi'', without the name of H\u00e9lo\u00efse on the title page.\n\nCritical editions of the ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' and the letters were subsequently published in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAt various times in the past two hundred years, it has been suggested that not all the letters are genuine. Questions were first raised in 1806 by Ignaz Fessler, and were renewed by J. C. Orelli in 1844 and [[Ludovic Lalanne]] in 1855, who all suggested that the letters might simply be a literary fiction. Doubts were raised at intervals in the succeeding decades. More recently, John Benton hypothesised (in 1972) that the entire letter collection might have been forged in the late 13th century, or by Abelard himself (a position Benton had reverted to by 1979). In the aftermath of reaction to Benton's thought, though, scholars have become more confident in asserting the genuine nature of the letters.<ref>Constant J. Mews, ''Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse'', (Oxford: OUP, 2005), p16</ref>\n\nAccording to historian [[Constant Mews]], ''The Lost Love Letters of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard'', 113 anonymous love letters found in a 15th-century manuscript represent the correspondence exchanged by H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard during the earlier phase of their affair.<ref name=\"Mews2001\">{{cite book |last=Mews|first=Constant|title=The Lost Love Letters of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard: Perceptions of Dialogue in Twelfth-Century France| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2001|isbn=978-0-312-23941-1 }}</ref> These are not to be confused with the accepted ''Letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse'' which were written nearly fifteen years after their romance ended.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-866262-4|author=Marenbon, John|editor=Robert E.

He composed some celebrated love songs for H\u00e9lo\u00efse that are now lost, and which have not been identified in the anonymous repertoire. H\u00e9lo\u00efse praised these songs in a letter: \"The great charm and sweetness in language and music, and a soft attractiveness of the melody obliged even the unlettered\".<ref name=\"grove\">{{GroveOnline|title=Peter Abelard|author=Lorenz Weinrich|access-date=April 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAbelard composed a hymnbook for the religious community that H\u00e9lo\u00efse joined. This hymnbook, written after 1130, differed from contemporary hymnals, such as that of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in that Abelard used completely new and homogeneous material. The songs were grouped by metre, which meant that comparatively few melodies could be used. Only one melody from this hymnal survives, ''O quanta qualia''.<ref name=\"grove\" />\n\nAbelard also wrote six biblical ''[[planctus]]'' ([[lament]]s):\n* Planctus Dinae filiae Iacob; inc.: Abrahae proles Israel nata (Planctus I)\n* Planctus Iacob super filios suos; inc.: Infelices filii, patri nati misero (Planctus II)\n* Planctus virginum Israel super filia Jepte Galadite; inc.: Ad festas choreas celibes (Planctus III)\n* Planctus Israel super Samson; inc.: Abissus vere multa (Planctus IV)\n* Planctus David super Abner, filio Neronis, quem Ioab occidit; inc.: Abner fidelissime (Planctus V)\n* Planctus David super Saul et Jonatha; inc.: Dolorum solatium (Planctus VI).\n\nIn surviving manuscripts these pieces have been notated in diastematic [[neume]]s which resist reliable transcription.

Instead of entering a military career, as his father had done, Abelard became an academic.

In the great [[cathedral school]] of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (before the current cathedral was actually built), he was taught for a while by [[William of Champeaux]], the disciple of [[Anselm of Laon]] (not to be confused with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]]), a leading proponent of [[Philosophical realism|Realism]].<ref name=\"CBD\" /> During this time he changed his surname to \"Abelard\", sometimes written \"Abailard\" or \"Abaelardus\".

On his return, after 1108, he found William lecturing at the hermitage of Saint-Victor, just outside the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]], and there they once again became rivals, with Abelard challenging William over his theory of universals. Abelard was once more victorious, and Abelard was almost able to hold the position of master at Notre Dame. For a short time, however, William was able to prevent Abelard from lecturing in Paris. Abelard accordingly was forced to resume his school at Melun, which he was then able to move, from  {{circa|1110-12}}, to Paris itself, on the heights of [[Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]], overlooking Notre-Dame.{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=40}}\n\nFrom his success in dialectic, he next turned to [[theology]] and in 1113 moved to [[Laon]] to attend the lectures of [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] on Biblical [[exegesis]] and Christian doctrine.<ref name=EB /> Unimpressed by Anselm's teaching, Abelard began to offer his own lectures on the book of Ezekiel. Anselm forbade him to continue this teaching, and Abelard returned to Paris where, in around 1115, he became master of the cathedral school of [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] (though the present cathedral was not yet begun) and a canon of [[Sens]] (the cathedral of the archdiocese to which Paris belonged).<ref name=\"Calamitatum\" />\n\n=== H\u00e9lo\u00efse ===\n[[File:Abelard and Heloise.jpeg|thumb|Abelard and [[Helo\u00efse]] in a manuscript of the [[Roman de la Rose]] (14th century)]]\nDistinguished in figure and manners, Abelard was seen surrounded by crowds\u2014it is said thousands of students\u2014drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as he says, to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, at the height of his fame, he encountered romance.<ref name=\"Calamitatum\" /><!---a guess-->[[File:Helo\u00efse et d'Ab\u00e9lard.jpg|thumb|right|\"Abaelardus and Helo\u00efse surprised by Master Fulbert\", by [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] painter [[Jean Vignaud]] (1819)]]\n\n[[H\u00e9lo\u00efse d'Argenteuil]] lived within the precincts of Notre-Dame, under the care of her uncle, the secular [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Fulbert. She was remarkable for her knowledge of [[classics|classical letters]], which extended beyond [[Latin]] to [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Abelard sought a place in Fulbert's house and, in 1115 or 1116, began an affair with H\u00e9lo\u00efse. The affair interfered with his career, and Abelard himself boasted of his conquest. Once Fulbert found out, he separated them, but they continued to meet in secret. H\u00e9lo\u00efse became pregnant and was sent by Abelard to be looked after by his family in Brittany, where she gave birth to a son whom she named Astrolabe after the [[astrolabe|scientific instrument]].<ref name=EB /><ref name=\"Calamitatum\" />{{efn|Astrolabe, the son of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse, is mentioned by Peter the Venerable of Cluny, where Abelard spent his last years, when Peter the Venerable wrote to H\u00e9loise: \"I will gladly do my best to obtain a prebend in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake\". A 'Petrus Astralabius' is recorded at the Cathedral of Nantes in 1150, and the same name appears at the Cistercian abbey at Hauterive in what is now Switzerland, but it is uncertain whether this is the same man. However, Astrolabe is recorded as dying at Paraclete on 29 or 30 October, year unknown, appearing in the necrology as \"Petrus Astralabius magistri nostri Petri filius\". (See {{harvnb|Radice|1947|loc= (trans.)}}, The Letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 287; for the necrology, see Enid McLeod, H\u00e9loise (London: Chatto & Windus, 2nd edn., 1971, pp. 253, 283-84)).}}\n\nTo appease Fulbert, Abelard proposed a secret marriage so as not to mar his career prospects. H\u00e9lo\u00efse initially opposed it, but the couple were married. When Fulbert publicly disclosed the marriage, and H\u00e9lo\u00efse denied it, Abelard sent H\u00e9lo\u00efse to the convent at [[Argenteuil]], where she had been brought up, in order to protect her from her uncle. H\u00e9lo\u00efse dressed as a nun and shared the nun's life, though she was not veiled.\n\nFulbert, most probably believing that Abelard wanted to be rid of H\u00e9lo\u00efse by forcing her to become a nun, arranged for a band of men to break into Abelard's room one night and [[Castration|castrate]] him. [[Roscellinus]] would later belittle Abelard for getting castrated.<ref>Russell, Bertrand. ''The History of Western Philosophy''. Simon & Schuster, 1945, p. 436.</ref> Later, Abelard decided to become a monk at the monastery of St Denis, near Paris.<ref name=EB /> Before doing so he insisted that H\u00e9lo\u00efse take vows as a nun. H\u00e9lo\u00efse sent letters to Abelard, questioning why she must submit to a religious life for which she had no calling.<ref name=\"Calamitatum\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nIn the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], the 40-year-old Abelard sought to bury himself as a monk with his woes out of sight.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kevin Guilfoy|first=Jeffrey E.

His lectures, now framed in a devotional spirit, and with lectures on theology as well as his previous lectures on logic, were once again heard by crowds of students, and his old influence seemed to have returned. Using his studies of the Bible and \u2014 in his view \u2014 inconsistent writings of the leaders of the church as his basis, he wrote ''[[Sic et Non]]'' (''Yes and No'').<ref name=EB />\n\nNo sooner had he published his theological lectures (the ''Theologia Summi Boni'') than his adversaries picked up on his rationalistic interpretation of the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] dogma. Two pupils of [[Anselm of Laon]], [[Alberich of Reims]] and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with the heresy of [[Sabellianism|Sabellius]] in a provincial [[synod]] held at [[Soissons]] in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn the ''Theologia'' himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, but it seems to have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked almost immediately, because after a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.<ref name=Marenbon-15 />\n\nLife in his own monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard himself was partly responsible. He took a sort of malicious pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for the sake of a joke, he cited [[Bede]] to prove that the believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] had been [[Bishop of Corinth]], while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot [[Hilduin]] that he had been [[Bishop of Athens]]. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard wrote a letter to the Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' and St. [[Jerome]], according to whom [[Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth]], was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=41}}\n\nAbelard initially lodged at St Ayoul of Provins, where the prior was a friend. Then, after the death of Abbot Adam in March 1122, Abelard was able to gain permission from the new abbot, [[Abbot Suger|Suger]], to live \"in whatever solitary place he wished\". In a deserted place near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] in [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]], he built a cabin of stubble and reeds, and a simple oratory dedicated to the Trinity and became a [[hermit]]. When his retreat became known, students flocked from Paris, and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts. He began to teach again there. The oratory was rebuilt in wood and stone and rededicated as the [[Oratory of the Paraclete]].{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=41}}\n[[File:Abelard cour Napoleon Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Abelard at [[Louvre Palace]] in Paris by [[Jules Cavelier]]]]\n\nAbelard remained at the Paraclete for about five years.

The region was inhospitable, the domain a prey to outlaws, the house itself savage and disorderly.{{sfn|Robertson|Shotwell|1911|p=41}} There, too, his relations with the community deteriorated.<ref name=\"Luscombe\" />\n\nDuring this time, however, Abelard came back into contact with H\u00e9lo\u00efse. In April 1129, [[Abbot Suger]] of St Denis succeeded in his plans to have the nuns, including H\u00e9lo\u00efse, expelled from the convent at Argenteuil, in order to take over the property for St Denis. H\u00e9lo\u00efse had meanwhile become the head of a new foundation of nuns called the [[Paraclete]]. Abelard became the abbot of the new community and provided it with a rule and with a justification of the nun's way of life; in this he emphasized the virtue of literary study. He also provided books of hymns he had composed, and in the early 1130s he and H\u00e9lo\u00efse composed a collection of their own love letters and religious correspondence.<ref name=\"Luscombe\" />\n[[File:France illustr\u00e9e I p473.png|thumb|Abelard receives the monastery of the [[Paraclete]] H\u00e9lo\u00efse (1129)]]\n\nLack of success at St Gildas made Abelard decide to take up public teaching again (although he remained for a few more years, officially, Abbot of St Gildas). It is not entirely certain what he then did, but given that [[John of Salisbury]] heard Abelard lecture on dialectic in 1136, it is presumed that he returned to Paris and resumed teaching on the [[Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]]. It is presumed his lectures included logic, at least until 1136,{{efn|Given John of Salisbury's testimony.}} but were mainly concerned with the Bible, Christian doctrine, and ethics. Then he produced further drafts of his ''Theologia'' in which he analyzed the sources of belief in the Trinity and praised the pagan philosophers of classical antiquity for their virtues and for their discovery by the use of [[reason]] of many fundamental aspects of Christian revelation.<ref name=\"Luscombe\" />\n\nAt some point in this time Abelard wrote, among other things, his famous ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]''. This moved H\u00e9lo\u00efse to write her first Letter;<ref>{{cite book |last=Wheeler|first=Bonnie|title=Listening to H\u00e9lo\u00efse: the voice of a twelfth-century woman|year=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-21354-1|pages=150\u2013151|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f4ETQPKFVwoC&pg=PA150&dq=H\u00e9lo\u00efse+first+letter+passion#v=onepage&q=H\u00e9lo\u00efse%20first%20letter%20passion&f=false}}</ref> the first being followed by the two other Letters, in which she finally accepted the part of resignation, which, now as a brother to a sister, Abelard commended to her. Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, ''Ethica'' or ''[[Scito te ipsum]]'' (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions.<ref name=EB /> During this period, he also wrote ''[[Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum]]'' (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also ''[[Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos]]'', a commentary on [[St. Paul]]'s epistle to the Romans, where he expands on the meaning of [[Christ]]'s life.<ref name=EB />\n\n==== Conflicts with Bernard of Clairvaux====\nAbelard was to face, however, another challenge which would put a final end to his teaching career. After 1136, it is not clear whether Abelard had stopped teaching, or whether he perhaps continued with all except his lectures on logic until as late as 1141. Whatever the exact timing, a process was instigated by [[William of St-Thierry|William of St Thierry]], who discovered what he considered to be heresies in some of Abelard's teaching. In spring 1140 he wrote to the Bishop of Chartres and to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] denouncing them. Another, less distinguished, theologian, [[Thomas of Morigny]], also produced at the same time a list of Abelard's supposed heresies, perhaps at Bernard's instigation. Bernard's complaint mainly is that Abelard has applied logic where it is not applicable, and that is illogical.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj_CNqojMV8C |page=134 |title=Bernard of Clairvaux on the Life of the Mind |author=John R. Sommerfeldt |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8091-4203-3}}</ref> Amid pressure from Bernard, Abelard challenged Bernard either to withdraw his accusations, or to make them publicly at the important [[Councils of Sens|church council at Sens]] planned for 2 June 1141. In so doing, Abelard put himself into the position of the wronged party and forced Bernard to defend himself from the accusation of slander. Bernard avoided this trap, however: on the eve of the council, he called a private meeting of the assembled bishops and persuaded them to condemn, one by one, each of the heretical propositions he attributed to Abelard. When Abelard appeared at the council the next day, he was presented with a list of condemned propositions imputed to him.<ref name=\"John Marenbon 2004 p17\">{{harvnb|Marenbon|2004|p=17}}.</ref>\n\nRefusing to answer to these propositions, Abelard left the assembly, appealed to the Pope, and set off for Rome, hoping that the Pope would be more supportive. However, this hope was unfounded. On 16 July 1141, [[Pope Innocent II]] issued a bull [[excommunication|excommunicating]] Abelard and his followers and imposing perpetual silence on him, and in a second document he ordered Abelard to be confined in a monastery and his books to be burned. Abelard was saved from this sentence, however, by [[Peter the Venerable]], abbot of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]]. Abelard had stopped there, on his way to Rome, before the papal condemnation had reached France. Peter persuaded Abelard, already old, to give up his journey and stay at the monastery. Peter managed to arrange a reconciliation with Bernard, to have the sentence of excommunication lifted, and to persuade Innocent that it was enough if Abelard remained under the aegis of Cluny. Abelard was treated not as a condemned heretic, but as a revered and wise scholar.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He spent his final months at the priory of St. Marcel, near [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]], before he died on 21 April 1142.<ref name=\"John Marenbon 2004 p17\" /> He is said to have uttered the last words \"I don't know\", before expiring.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A history|page=[https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0/page/687 687]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|url=https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0|url-access=registration |accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref> He died from a combination of fever and a skin disorder, most likely [[scurvy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman and Betty|last=Donaldson|title=How Did They Die?|year=1980|publisher=Greenwich House|isbn=978-0-517-40302-0}}</ref>\n\n==== Disputed resting place/lovers' pilgrimage ====\n[[File:Abelardtomb closeup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dedicatory panel in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]\nAbelard was first buried at St. Marcel, but his remains were soon carried off secretly to the Paraclete, and given over to the loving care of H\u00e9lo\u00efse, who in time came herself to rest beside them in 1163.\n\nThe bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in eastern Paris.<ref>{{harvnb|Burge|2006|p=276}}.</ref> The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.\n\nThis remains, however, disputed. The [[Oratory of the Paraclete]] claims Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse are buried there and that what exists in P\u00e8re-Lachaise is merely a monument, or [[cenotaph]]. According to P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the remains of both lovers were transferred from the Oratory in the early 19th century and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds.<ref>{{harvnb|Burge|2006|pp=276\u2013277}}.</ref> Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at P\u00e8re-Lachaise, Helo\u00efse's remains are elsewhere.\n\n== Philosophy and theology ==\n{{Catholic philosophy}}\n\n=== Philosophical thought ===\nThe general importance of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with the object of giving a formal, rational expression to received ecclesiastical doctrine. Though his particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from the heads of the Church.\n\nHe helped to establish the ascendancy of the philosophical authority of [[Aristotle]] which became firmly established in the half-century after his death. It was at this time that the completed ''[[Organon]]'', and gradually all the other works of the Greek thinker, first came to be available in the schools. Before his time, [[Plato]]'s authority was the basis for the prevailing Realism. As regards his so-called Conceptualism and his attitude to the question of universals, a discussion can be found in the 1911 [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] article [[s:1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Scholasticism|''Scholasticism'']].\n\nOutside of his dialectic, it was in ethics that Abelard showed greatest activity of philosophical thought. He stressed the subjective intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value, of human action. His thought in this direction, anticipating something of modern speculation, is remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least in the field of morals, hardly venturing to bring the principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after they were made fully aware of Aristotle's great ethical inquiries.\n\nRegarding the un[[baptized]] who die in [[infancy]], Abelard\u2014in ''Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos''\u2014emphasized the goodness of God and interpreted St. [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s \"mildest punishment\" as the pain of loss at being denied the [[beatific vision]] (''carentia visionis Dei''), without hope of obtaining it, but with no additional punishments. His thought contributed to the forming of [[Limbo of Infants]] theory in the 12th\u201313th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|title=The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised|author=International Theological Commission, the Vatican|accessdate=7 December 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222011157/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|archivedate=22 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Philosophical works ===\n* ''Logica ingredientibus'' (\"Logic for Advanced\") completed before 1121\n* ''Petri Abaelardi Glossae in Porphyrium'' (\"The Glosses of Peter Abailard on Porphyry\"), c. 1120\n* ''Dialectica'', before 1125 (1115\u20131116 according to John Marenbon, ''The Philosophy of Peter Abelard'', Cambridge University Press 1997).<ref>Latin text in L.

Only one of his strictly philosophical works, the ethical treatise ''Scito te ipsum'', had been published before the 19th century, in 1721. It was only with the publication by Cousin in 1836 of the collection entitled ''Ouvrages inedits d'Abelard'' that Abelard's philosophical work began to be studied more closely. Cousin's collection gave extracts from the theological work ''[[Sic et Non]]'' (\"Yes and No\") which is an assemblage of what Abelard saw as opposite opinions on doctrinal points culled from the Fathers as a basis for discussion. The collection also includes the ''Dialectica, ''and commentaries on logical works of Aristotle, Porphyry and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]. Two works published by Cousin and believed at the time to be by Abelard, the fragment ''De Generibus et Speciebus ''(published in the 1836 collection), and also the psychological treatise ''De Intellectibus'' (published separately by Cousin in  ''Fragmens Philosophiques'', vol. ii.), are'' ''now believed on upon internal evidence not to be by Abelard himself, but only to have sprung out of his school''.'' A genuine work, the ''Glossulae super Porphyrium'', from which [[Charles de R\u00e9musat]] gave extracts in his monograph ''Abelard'' (1845), was published in 1930. The fascinating hypothesis of Abaelard's influence on [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] and [[Spinoza]] has been developed by [[Robert Menasse]] and first published in his essay \u201eEnlightenment as Harmonious Strategy\" edited by ''Versopolis'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401004614/http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |archivedate=2018-04-01 }} (retrieved on March 31, 2018).</ref>\n\n=== Notes from Pope Benedict XVI ===\nDuring his general audience on 4 November 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] talked about [[Saint]] [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and Peter Abelard to illustrate differences in the [[monastic]] and [[scholasticism|scholastic]] approaches to [[theology]] in the 12th century. The Pope recalled that theology is the search for a rational understanding (if possible) of the mysteries of Christian [[revelation]], which is believed through [[faith]] \u2014 faith that seeks intelligibility (''fides quaerens intellectum''). But St. Bernard, a representative of monastic theology, emphasized \"faith\" whereas Abelard, who is a scholastic, stressed \"understanding through reason\".<ref name=\"NCR\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |title=St. Bernard and Peter Abelard |publisher=National Catholic Register \u2013 [[EWTN News, Inc.]] |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619153341/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |archivedate=June 19, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nFor Bernard, faith is based on the testimony of [[Scripture]] and on the teaching of the [[Fathers of the Church]]. Thus, Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and, in a more general way, with those who would subject the truths of faith to the critical examination of reason \u2014 an examination which, in his opinion, posed a grave danger: [[intellectualism]], the relativizing of truth, and the questioning of the truths of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in [[contemplative prayer]], by the affective union of the heart and mind with God, with only one purpose: to promote the living, intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.<ref name=\"NCR\" />\n\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, an excessive use of [[philosophy]] rendered Abelard's [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]] dangerously fragile and, thus, his idea of God. In the field of morals, his teaching was vague, as he insisted on considering the intention of the subject as the only basis for describing the goodness or evil of moral acts, thereby ignoring the objective meaning and moral value of the acts, resulting in a dangerous [[subjectivism]]. But the Pope recognized the great achievements of Abelard, who made a decisive contribution to the development of scholastic theology, which eventually expressed itself in a more mature and fruitful way during the following century. And some of Abelard's insights should not be underestimated, for example, his affirmation that non-Christian religious traditions already contain some form of preparation for welcoming Christ.<ref name=\"NCR\" />\n\nPope Benedict XVI concluded that Bernard's \"theology of the heart\" and Abelard's \"theology of reason\" represent the importance of healthy theological discussion and [[Humility|humble]] obedience to the authority of the Church, especially when the questions being debated have not been defined by the [[magisterium]]. St. Bernard, and even Abelard himself, always recognized without any hesitation the authority of the magisterium. Abelard showed [[humility]] in acknowledging his errors, and Bernard exercised great [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]. The Pope emphasized, in the field of theology, there should be a balance between [[architecture|architectonic]] principles, which are given through Revelation and which always maintain their primary importance, and the interpretative principles proposed by philosophy (that is, by reason), which have an important function, but only as a tool. When the balance breaks down, theological reflection runs the risk of becoming marred by error; it is then up to the magisterium to exercise the needed service to truth, for which it is responsible.<ref name=\"NCR\" />\n\n== The letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse ==\nThe story of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse has proved immensely popular in modern European culture. This story is known almost entirely from a few sources: first, the ''Historia Calamitatum; ''secondly, the seven letters between Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse which survive (three written by Abelard, and four by H\u00e9lo\u00efse), and always follow the ''Historia Calamitatum'' in the manuscript tradition; thirdly, four letters between Peter the Venerable and H\u00e9lo\u00efse (three by Peter, one by H\u00e9lo\u00efse).<ref>In the Latin categorising of Abelard's work, these are numbered ''Epistolae'' 2-8, because the ''Historia calamitatum'' (which takes the form of a letter) is termed ''Epistolae ''1.</ref> They are, in modern times, the best known and most widely translated parts of Abelard's work.\n\nIt is unclear quite how the letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual references to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and [[Walter Map]]. It seems unlikely, however, that the letters were widely known in this period. Rather, the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore seems likely that the letters sent between Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse were kept by H\u00e9lo\u00efse at the Paraclete along with the 'Letters of Direction', and that more than a century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=47}}.</ref> At this time, the story of their love affair was summarised by [[Jean de Meun]] in his continuation to ''Le Roman de la Rose''.\n\nTheir story does not appear to have been widely known in the later Middle Ages, either. There is no mention of the couple in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]; [[Chaucer]] makes a very brief reference in the Wife of Bath's Prologue (lines 677\u20138), but no more. One of the first people to show a deeper interest in the couple appears to have been [[Petrarch]], who owned an early 14th-century manuscript of the couple's letters. This silence on what is today seen as a particularly touching story is perhaps surprising, given the Renaissance ideal of courtly love \u2013 but it is possible that the story of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse could not be appropriately fitted into the ideals of the lover's devotion to the chaste and unattainable lady.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=48}}.</ref>\n\nThe first publication of the letters, in Latin, was in Paris in 1616, simultaneously in two editions. These editions gave rise to numerous translations of the letters into European languages \u2013 and consequent 18th- and 19th-century interest in the story of the medieval lovers.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=49}}.</ref> In the 18th century, the couple were revered as tragic lovers, who endured adversity in life but were united in death. With this reputation, they were the only individuals from the [[French Revolution|pre-Revolutionary]] period whose remains were given a place of honour at the newly founded cemetery of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise]] in Paris. At this time, they were effectively revered as romantic saints; for some, they were forerunners of modernity, at odds with the ecclesiastical and monastic structures of their day and to be celebrated more for rejecting the traditions of the past than for any particular intellectual achievement.<ref>Constant J Mews, ''Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse'', (Oxford: OUP, 2005), p4</ref>\n\nThe ''Historia'' was first published in 1841 by John Caspar Orelli of Turici. Then, in 1849, [[Victor Cousin]] published ''Petri Abaelardi opera'', in part based on the two Paris editions of 1616 but also based on the reading of four manuscripts; this became the standard edition of the letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=50}}.</ref> Soon after, in 1855, Migne printed an expanded version of the 1616 edition under the title ''Opera Petri Abaelardi'', without the name of H\u00e9lo\u00efse on the title page.\n\nCritical editions of the ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' and the letters were subsequently published in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAt various times in the past two hundred years, it has been suggested that not all the letters are genuine. Questions were first raised in 1806 by Ignaz Fessler, and were renewed by J. C. Orelli in 1844 and [[Ludovic Lalanne]] in 1855, who all suggested that the letters might simply be a literary fiction. Doubts were raised at intervals in the succeeding decades. More recently, John Benton hypothesised (in 1972) that the entire letter collection might have been forged in the late 13th century, or by Abelard himself (a position Benton had reverted to by 1979). In the aftermath of reaction to Benton's thought, though, scholars have become more confident in asserting the genuine nature of the letters.<ref>Constant J. Mews, ''Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse'', (Oxford: OUP, 2005), p16</ref>\n\nAccording to historian [[Constant Mews]], ''The Lost Love Letters of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard'', 113 anonymous love letters found in a 15th-century manuscript represent the correspondence exchanged by H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard during the earlier phase of their affair.<ref name=\"Mews2001\">{{cite book |last=Mews|first=Constant|title=The Lost Love Letters of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard: Perceptions of Dialogue in Twelfth-Century France| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2001|isbn=978-0-312-23941-1 }}</ref> These are not to be confused with the accepted ''Letters of Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse'' which were written nearly fifteen years after their romance ended.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-866262-4|author=Marenbon, John|editor=Robert E.

He composed some celebrated love songs for H\u00e9lo\u00efse that are now lost, and which have not been identified in the anonymous repertoire. H\u00e9lo\u00efse praised these songs in a letter: \"The great charm and sweetness in language and music, and a soft attractiveness of the melody obliged even the unlettered\".<ref name=\"grove\">{{GroveOnline|title=Peter Abelard|author=Lorenz Weinrich|access-date=April 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAbelard composed a hymnbook for the religious community that H\u00e9lo\u00efse joined. This hymnbook, written after 1130, differed from contemporary hymnals, such as that of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in that Abelard used completely new and homogeneous material. The songs were grouped by metre, which meant that comparatively few melodies could be used. Only one melody from this hymnal survives, ''O quanta qualia''.<ref name=\"grove\" />\n\nAbelard also wrote six biblical ''[[planctus]]'' ([[lament]]s):\n* Planctus Dinae filiae Iacob; inc.: Abrahae proles Israel nata (Planctus I)\n* Planctus Iacob super filios suos; inc.: Infelices filii, patri nati misero (Planctus II)\n* Planctus virginum Israel super filia Jepte Galadite; inc.: Ad festas choreas celibes (Planctus III)\n* Planctus Israel super Samson; inc.: Abissus vere multa (Planctus IV)\n* Planctus David super Abner, filio Neronis, quem Ioab occidit; inc.: Abner fidelissime (Planctus V)\n* Planctus David super Saul et Jonatha; inc.: Dolorum solatium (Planctus VI).\n\nIn surviving manuscripts these pieces have been notated in diastematic [[neume]]s which resist reliable transcription. Only Planctus VI was fixed in square notation. Planctus as genre influenced the subsequent development of the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], a song form that flourished in northern Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nMelodies that have survived have been praised as \"flexible, expressive melodies [that] show an elegance and technical adroitness that are very similar to the qualities that have been long admired in Abelard's poetry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/gramofilereview.asp?reviewID=9503094&mediaID=38977&issue=Reviewed%3A+Gramophone+3%2F1995 |last=Oliver |first=Michael |title=Review: a CD of Abelard's music |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |year=1995 |accessdate=7 December 2008 |url-access=registration |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209235712/http://www.gramophone.co.uk/gramofilereview.asp?reviewID=9503094&mediaID=38977&issue=Reviewed%3A+Gramophone+3%2F1995 |archivedate=December 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Cultural references ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=March 2017|\n{{Prose|section|date=August 2015}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2015}}\n}}\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]] mentions H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard in his most famous poem \"[[Ballade des dames du temps jadis]]\".\n* The subtitle of ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' (1761), an [[epistolary novel]] by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], alludes to the history of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Abelard.\n* [[Helen Waddell]]'s novel ''Peter Abelard'' (1933) is loosely based on Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse.

He was the first [[Acharya (Jainism)|Acharya]] (preceptor) and a leader of his [[sect]] in the 20th century. Shantisagar revived the teaching and practice of traditional [[Digambara]] practices in [[North India]]. He was lustrated as a kshullaka into the Sangha (holy order) by Devappa (Devakirti) Swami. He took his ailaka (religious vows) before an image of the Tirthankara Neminatha. In about 1920, Shantisagar became a full muni (monk) of the Digambara sect of Jainism. In 1922, at Yarnal village, Belgaum district, Karnataka, he was given the name \"Shanti Sagara\" (\"Ocean of Peace\").\n\n==Early life==\nShantisagar was born in 1872{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=55}} near Bhoj village, [[Belgaum district|Belgavi district]] [[Karnataka]], [[India]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=185}} His father either worked as a farmer{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=56}} or was employed in the clothing business.{{sfn|Desjarlais|Eisenberg|1996|p=82}} At age eighteen, having read religious texts and undergone several pilgrimages,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=185}} Shantisagar decided to dedicate his life to a [[religious order]].\n\nShantisagar's parents died in 1912.

This implies that biodiversity arises at random, as each species follows a [[random walk]].<ref name=\"McGill2003\"/> The hypothesis has sparked controversy,<ref name=\"Pocheville2015\"/><ref name=\"Science Daily\"/><ref name=\"Connolly2014\"/> and some authors consider it a more complex version of other null models that fit the data better.<ref name=\"Nee2003\"/>\n\n''Neutrality'' means that at a given [[trophic level]] in a [[food web]], species are equivalent in birth rates, death rates, dispersal rates and speciation rates, when measured on a per-capita basis.<ref name=\"Hubbell2005\"/>  This can be considered a [[null hypothesis]] to [[ecological niche|niche theory]].  Hubbell built on earlier neutral concepts, including [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] & [[E.O. Wilson|Wilson]]'s theory of [[island biogeography]]<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/> and [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]]'s concepts of symmetry and null models.<ref name=\"Hubbell2005\"/>\n\nAn ''ecological community'' is a group of trophically similar, [[sympatric]] [[species]] that actually or potentially compete in a local area for the same or similar resources.<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/> Under the Unified Theory, complex [[ecological]] interactions are permitted among individuals of an ecological community (such as competition and cooperation), provided that all individuals obey the same rules. Asymmetric phenomena such as [[parasite|parasitism]] and [[predator|predation]] are ruled out by the terms of reference; but cooperative strategies such as swarming, and negative interaction such as competing for limited food or light are allowed (so long as all individuals behave in the same way).\n\nThe Unified Theory also makes predictions that have profound implications for the management of [[biodiversity]], especially the management of rare species.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe theory predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity constant, conventionally written ''\u03b8'', that appears to govern species richness on a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales.\n\n==Saturation==\n\nAlthough not strictly necessary for a neutral theory, many [[stochastic]] models of biodiversity assume a fixed, finite community size.  There are unavoidable physical constraints on the total number of individuals that can be packed into a given space (although space ''per se'' isn't necessarily a resource, it is often a useful surrogate variable for a limiting resource that is distributed over the landscape; examples would include [[sunlight]] or hosts, in the case of parasites).\n\nIf a wide range of species are considered (say, [[giant sequoia]] trees and [[duckweed]], two species that have very different saturation densities), then the assumption of constant community size might not be very good, because density would be higher if the smaller species were monodominant.\n\nHowever, because the Unified Theory refers only to communities of trophically similar, competing species, it is unlikely that population density will vary too widely from one place to another.\n\nHubbell considers the fact that population densities are constant and interprets it as a general principle: ''large landscapes are always biotically saturated with individuals''.  Hubbell thus treats communities as being of a fixed number of individuals, usually denoted by ''J''.\n\nExceptions to the saturation principle include disturbed ecosystems such as the [[Serengeti]], where saplings are trampled by [[elephant]]s and [[Blue wildebeest]]s; or [[garden]]s, where certain species are systematically removed.\n\n===Species abundances===\n\nWhen abundance data on natural populations are collected, two observations are almost universal:\n\n*  The most common species accounts for a substantial fraction of the individuals sampled;\n*  A substantial fraction of the species sampled are very rare.  Indeed, a substantial fraction of the species sampled are singletons, that is, species which are sufficiently rare for only a single individual to have been sampled.\n\nSuch observations typically generate a large number of questions.  Why are the rare species rare? Why is the most abundant species so much more abundant than the median species abundance?\n\nA non neutral explanation for the rarity of rare species might suggest that rarity is a result of poor adaptation to local conditions.  The UNTB implies that such considerations may be neglected from the perspective of population biology (because the explanation cited implies that the rare species behaves differently from the abundant species).\n\nSpecies composition in any community will change randomly with time.  However, any  particular abundance structure will have an associated probability.  The UNTB  predicts that the probability of a community of ''J'' individuals composed of ''S''  distinct species with abundances <math>n_1</math> for species 1, <math>n_2</math> for  species 2, and so on up to <math>n_S</math> for species ''S'' is given by\n\n:<math>\n\\Pr(n_1,n_2,\\ldots,n_S| \\theta, J)=\n\\frac{J!\\theta^S}\n{\n  1^{\\phi_1}2^{\\phi_2}\\cdots J^{\\phi_J}\n  \\phi_1!\\phi_2!\\cdots\\phi_J!\n  \\Pi_{k=1}^J(\\theta+k-1)\n}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta=2J\\nu</math> is the fundamental biodiversity number (<math>\\nu</math> is the speciation rate), and <math>\\phi_i</math> is the number of species that have ''i'' individuals in the sample.\n\nThis equation shows that the UNTB implies a nontrivial dominance-diversity equilibrium between speciation and extinction.\n\nAs an example, consider a community with 10 individuals and three species \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" with abundances 3, 6 and 1 respectively.  Then the formula above would allow us to assess the [[likelihood function|likelihood]] of different values of ''\u03b8''. There are thus ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 species and <math>\\phi_1=\\phi_3=\\phi_6=1</math>, all other <math>\\phi</math>'s being zero. The formula would give\n\n:<math>\n\\Pr(3,6,1| \\theta,10)=\n\\frac{10!\\theta^3}{\n1^1\\cdot 3^1\\cdot 6^1\n\\cdot\n1!1!1!\n\\cdot\n\\theta(\\theta+1)(\\theta+2)\\cdots(\\theta+9)}\n</math>\n\nwhich could be maximized to yield an estimate for ''\u03b8'' (in practice, [[numerical methods]] are used).  The [[maximum likelihood]] estimate for ''\u03b8'' is about 1.1478.\n\nWe could have labelled the species another way and counted the abundances being 1,3,6 instead (or 3,1,6, etc. etc.).  Logic tells us that the probability of observing a pattern of abundances will be the same observing any [[permutation]] of those abundances. Here we would have\n\n: <math>\\Pr(3;3,6,1)=\\Pr(3;1,3,6)=\\Pr(3;3,1,6)</math>\n\nand so on.\n\nTo account for this, it is helpful to consider only ranked abundances (that is, to sort the abundances before inserting into the formula).  A ranked dominance-diversity configuration is usually written as <math>\\Pr(S;r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_s,0,\\ldots,0)</math> where <math>r_i</math> is the abundance of the ''i''th most abundant species: <math>r_1</math> is the abundance of the most abundant, <math>r_2</math> the abundance of the second most abundant species, and so on.  For convenience, the expression is usually \"padded\" with enough zeros to ensure that there are ''J'' species (the zeros indicating that the extra species have zero abundance).\n\nIt is now possible to determine the [[Expected value|expected]] abundance of the ''i''th most abundant species:\n\n:<math>\nE(r_i)=\\sum_{k=1}^C\nr_i(k)\\cdot \\Pr(S;r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_s,0,\\ldots,0)\n</math>\n\nwhere ''C'' is the total number of configurations, <math>r_i(k)</math> is the abundance of the ''i''th ranked species in the ''k''th configuration,  and <math>Pr(\\ldots)</math> is the dominance-diversity probability.  This formula is difficult to manipulate mathematically, but relatively simple to simulate computationally.\n\nThe model discussed so far is a model of a regional community, which Hubbell calls the [[metacommunity]]. Hubbell also acknowledged that on a local scale, dispersal plays an important role. For example, seeds are more likely to come from nearby parents than from distant parents. Hubbell introduced the parameter m, which denotes the probability of immigration in the local community from the metacommunity. If m = 1, dispersal is unlimited; the local community is just a random sample from the metacommunity and the formulas above apply. If m < 1, however, dispersal is limited and the local community is a dispersal-limited sample from the metacommunity for which different formulas apply.\n\nIt has been shown<ref name=\"Volkov2003\"/> that <math>\\langle \\phi_n \\rangle </math>, the expected number of species with abundance n, may be calculated by\n\n:<math>\n\\theta\\frac{J!}{n!(J-n)!}\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\gamma)}{\\Gamma(J+\\gamma)}\n\\int_{y=0}^\\gamma\n\\frac{\\Gamma(n+y)}{\\Gamma(1+y)}\n\\frac{\\Gamma(J-n+\\gamma-y)}{\\Gamma(\\gamma-y)}\n\\exp(-y\\theta/\\gamma)\\,dy\n</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the fundamental biodiversity number, ''J'' the community size,  <math>\\Gamma</math> is the [[gamma function]], and <math>\\gamma=(J-1)m/(1-m)</math>. This formula is however an approximation.

The distribution of species in the metacommunity is given by a dynamic equilibrium of speciation and extinction. Both community dynamics are modelled by appropriate [[urn problem|urn processes]], where each individual is represented by a ball with a color corresponding to its species. With a certain rate <math>r</math> randomly chosen individuals reproduce, i.e. add another ball of their own color to the urn. Since one basic assumption is saturation, this reproduction has to happen at the cost of another random individual from the urn which is removed. At a different rate <math>\\mu</math> single individuals in the metacommunity are replaced by mutants of an entirely new species. Hubbell calls this simplified model for [[speciation]] a [[point mutation]], using the terminology of the [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]]. The urn scheme for the metacommunity of <math>J_M</math> individuals is the following.\n\nAt each time step take one of the two possible actions :\n\n# With probability <math>(1-\\nu)</math> draw an individual at random and replace another random individual from the urn with a copy of the first one.\n# With probability <math>\\nu</math> draw an individual and replace it with an individual of a new species.\n\nThe size <math>J_M</math> of the metacommunity does not change. This is a [[point process]] in time. The length of the time steps is distributed exponentially. For simplicity one can, however, assume that each time step is as long as the mean time between two changes which can be derived from the reproduction and mutation rates <math>r</math> and <math>\\mu</math>. The probability <math>\\nu</math> is given as <math>\\nu=\\mu/(r+\\mu)</math>.\n\nThe species abundance distribution for this urn process is given by [[Ewens's sampling formula]] which was originally derived in 1972 for the distribution of [[allele|alleles]] under neutral mutations. The expected number <math>S_M(n)</math> of species in the metacommunity having exactly <math>n</math> individuals is:<ref name=\"Vallade2003\"/>\n\n:<math>\nS_M(n) = \\frac{\\theta}{n}\\frac{\\Gamma(J_M+1)\\Gamma(J_M+\\theta-n)}{\\Gamma(J_M+1-n)\\Gamma(J_M+\\theta)}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta=(J_M-1)\\nu/(1-\\nu)\\approx J_M\\nu</math> is called the fundamental biodiversity number. For large\nmetacommunities and <math>n\\ll J_M</math> one recovers the [[Logarithmic distribution|Fisher Log-Series]] as species distribution.\n\n:<math>\nS_M(n) \\approx \\frac{\\theta}{n} \\left( \\frac{J_M}{J_M+\\theta} \\right)^n\n</math>\n\nThe urn scheme for the local community of fixed size <math>J</math> is very similar to the one for the metacommunity.\n\nAt each time step take one of the two actions :\n\n# With probability <math>(1-m)</math> draw an individual at random and replace another random individual from the urn with a copy of the first one.\n# With probability <math>m</math> replace a random individual with an immigrant drawn from the metacommunity.\n\nThe metacommunity is changing on a much larger timescale and is assumed to be fixed during the evolution of the local community. The resulting distribution of species in the local community and expected values depend on four parameters, <math>J</math>, <math>J_M</math>, <math>\\theta</math> and <math>m</math> (or <math>I</math>) and are derived in Etienne & Alonso (2005),<ref name=\"Etienne2005\"/> including several simplifying limit cases like the one presented in the previous section (there called <math>\\langle\\phi_n\\rangle</math>). The parameter <math>m</math> is a dispersal parameter. If <math>m=1</math> then the local community is just a sample from the metacommunity. For <math>m=0</math> the local community is completely isolated from the metacommunity and all species will go extinct except one. This case has been analyzed by Hubbell himself.<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/> The case <math>0<m<1</math> is characterized by a [[unimodal]] species distribution in a [[Preston Diagram]] and often fitted by a [[log-normal distribution]]. This is understood as an intermediate state between domination of the most common species and a sampling from the metacommunity, where singleton species are most abundant. UNTB thus predicts that in dispersal limited communities rare species become even rarer. The log-normal distribution describes the maximum and the abundance of common species very well but underestimates the number of very rare species considerably which becomes only apparent for very large sample sizes.<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/>\n\n==Species-area relationships==\n\nThe Unified Theory unifies ''biodiversity'', as measured by species-abundance curves, with ''biogeography'', as measured by species-area curves. Species-area relationships show the rate at which species diversity increases with area.  The topic is of great interest to conservation biologists in the design of reserves, as it is often desired to harbour as many species as possible.\n\nThe most commonly encountered relationship is the power law given by\n\n:<math>\nS=cA^z</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the number of species found, ''A'' is the area sampled, and ''c'' and ''z'' are constants.  This relationship, with different constants, has been found to fit a wide range of empirical data.\n\nFrom the perspective of Unified Theory, it is convenient to consider ''S'' as a function of total community size  ''J''.  Then <math>S=kJ^z</math> for some constant ''k'', and if this relationship were exactly true, the species area line would be straight on log scales.  It is typically found that the curve is not straight, but the slope changes from being steep at small areas, shallower at intermediate areas, and steep at the largest areas.\n\nThe formula for species composition <!--derived above ('''not done this bit yet''')--> may be used to calculate the expected number of species present in a community under the assumptions of the Unified Theory.  In symbols\n\n:<math>\nE\\left\\{S|\\theta,J\\right\\}=\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta  }+\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}+\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+2}+\n\\cdots +\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+J-1}\n</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the fundamental biodiversity number.  This formula specifies the expected number of species sampled in a community of size ''J''. The last term, <math>\\theta/(\\theta+J-1)</math>, is the expected number of ''new'' species encountered when adding one new individual to the community.  This is an increasing function of \u03b8 and a decreasing function of ''J'', as expected.\n\nBy making the substitution <math>J=\\rho A</math> (see section on saturation above), then the expected number of species becomes <math>\\Sigma\\theta/(\\theta+\\rho A-1)</math>.\n\nThe formula above may be approximated to an [[integral]] giving\n\n:<math>\nS(\\theta)=\n1+\\theta\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{J-1}{\\theta}\\right).\n</math>\n\nThis formulation is predicated on a random placement of individuals.\n\n===Example===\n\nConsider the following (synthetic) dataset of 27 individuals:\n\na,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,b,b,b,b,c,c,c,c,d,d,d,d,e,f,g,h,i\n\nThere are thus 27 individuals of 9 species (\"a\" to \"i\") in the sample. Tabulating this would give:\n\n  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i\n 10  4  4  4  1  1  1  1  1\n\nindicating that species \"a\" is the most abundant with 10 individuals and species \"e\" to \"i\" are singletons.  Tabulating the table gives:\n\n species abundance    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10\n number of species    5    0    0    3    0    0    0    0    0     1\n\nOn the second row, the 5 in the first column means that five species, species \"e\" through \"i\", have abundance one.  The following two zeros in columns 2 and 3 mean that zero species have abundance 2 or 3.  The 3 in column 4 means that three species, species \"b\", \"c\", and \"d\", have abundance four.  The final 1 in column 10 means that one species, species \"a\", has abundance 10.\n\nThis type of dataset is typical in biodiversity studies.  Observe how more than half the biodiversity (as measured by species count) is due to singletons.\n\nFor real datasets, the species abundances are binned into logarithmic categories, usually using base 2, which gives bins of  abundance 0-1, abundance 1-2, abundance 2-4, abundance 4-8, etc.  Such abundance classes are called ''octaves''; early developers of this concept included [[Frank W. Preston|F. W. Preston]] and histograms showing number of species as a function of abundance octave are known as [[Preston diagram]]s.\n\nThese bins are not mutually exclusive: a species with abundance 4, for example, could be considered as lying in the 2-4 abundance class or the 4-8 abundance class.  Species with an abundance of an exact power of 2 (i.e.  2,4,8,16, etc.) are conventionally considered as having 50% membership in the lower abundance class 50% membership in the upper class.  Such species are thus considered to be evenly split between the two adjacent classes (apart from singletons which are classified into the rarest category).   Thus in the example above, the Preston abundances would be\n\n abundance class 1    1-2   2-4   4-8  8-16\n species         5     0    1.5   1.5   1\n\nThe three species of abundance four thus appear, 1.5 in abundance class 2-4, and 1.5 in 4-8.\n\nThe above method of analysis cannot account for species that are unsampled: that is, species sufficiently rare to have been recorded zero times.  Preston diagrams are thus truncated at zero abundance. [[Frank W. Preston|Preston]] called this the ''veil line'' and noted that the cutoff point would move as more individuals are sampled.\n\n==Dynamics under neutral hypothesis==\n\nAll biodiversity patterns previously described are related to time-independent quantities. However, for biodiversity evolution and species preservation, it is crucial to compare the dynamics of ecosystems with models (Leigh, 2007). An easily accessible index of the underlying evolution is the so-called species turnover distribution (STD), defined as the probability P(r,t) that the population of any species has varied by a fraction r after a given time t.\n\nA neutral model that can analytically predict both the relative species abundance (RSA) at steady-state and the STD at time t has been presented in Azaele et al. (2006).<ref name=\"Azaele2006\"/> Within this framework the population of any species is represented by a continuous (random) variable x, whose evolution is governed by the following Langevin equation:\n:<math>\n\\dot{x}=b-x/\\tau+\\sqrt{Dx}\\xi(t)\n</math>\nwhere b is the immigration rate from a large regional community, <math>-x/\\tau</math> represents competition for finite resources and D is related to demographic stochasticity; <math>\\xi(t)</math> is a Gaussian white noise. The model can also be derived as a continuous approximation of a master equation, where birth and death rates are independent of species, and predicts that at steady-state the RSA is simply a gamma distribution.\n\nFrom the exact time-dependent solution of the previous equation, one can exactly calculate the STD at time t under stationary conditions: \n:<math>\nP(r,t)=A\\frac{\\lambda+1}{\\lambda}\\frac{(e^{t/\\tau})^{b/2D}}{1-e^{-t/\\tau}}\\left(\\frac{\\sinh(\\frac{t}{2\\tau})}{\\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{b}{D}+1}\\left(\\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda+1)^2e^{t/\\tau}-4\\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{b}{D}+\\frac{1}{2}}.\n</math>\nThis formula provides good fits of data collected in the Barro Colorado tropical forest from 1990 to 2000. From the best fit one can estimate <math>\\tau</math> ~ 3500 years with a broad uncertainty due to the relative short time interval of the sample. This parameter can be interpreted as the relaxation time of the system, i.e. the time the system needs to recover from a perturbation of species distribution. In the same framework, the estimated mean species lifetime is very close to the fitted temporal scale <math>\\tau</math>. This suggests that the neutral assumption could correspond to a scenario in which species originate and become extinct on the same timescales of fluctuations of the whole ecosystem.\n\n==Testing the theory==\n\nThe theory has provoked much controversy as it \"abandons\" the role of ecology when modelling ecosystems.<ref name=\"Ricklefs2006\"/> The theory has been criticized as it requires an equilibrium, yet climatic and geographical conditions are thought to change too frequently for this to be attained.<ref name=\"Ricklefs2006\"/>\nTests on bird and tree abundance data demonstrate that the theory is usually a poorer match to the data than alternative null hypotheses that use fewer parameters (a log-normal model with two tunable parameters, compared to the neutral theory's three<ref name=\"Nee2003\"/>), and are thus more parsimonious.<ref name=\"McGill2003\"/>  The theory also fails to describe coral reef communities<ref name=\"Dornelas2006\"/> and is a poor fit to data in intertidal communities.<ref name=\"Wootton2005\"/> It also fails to explain why families of tropical trees have statistically highly correlated numbers of species in phylogenetically unrelated and geographically distant forest plots in Central and South America, Africa, and South East Asia.<ref name=\"Ricklefs2012\"/>\n\nWhile the theory has been heralded as a valuable tool for palaeontologists,<ref name=\"Hubbell2005\"/> little work has so far been done to test the theory against the fossil record.<ref name=\"Bonuso2007\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]\n* [[Functional equivalence (ecology)]]\n* [[Ewens's sampling formula]]\n* [[Metabolic theory of ecology]]\n* [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]]\n* [[Warren Ewens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Azaele2006\">{{cite journal |last=Azaele |first=S. |author2=Pigolotti, S. |author3=Banavar, J.

This implies that biodiversity arises at random, as each species follows a [[random walk]].<ref name=\"McGill2003\"/> The hypothesis has sparked controversy,<ref name=\"Pocheville2015\"/><ref name=\"Science Daily\"/><ref name=\"Connolly2014\"/> and some authors consider it a more complex version of other null models that fit the data better.<ref name=\"Nee2003\"/>\n\n''Neutrality'' means that at a given [[trophic level]] in a [[food web]], species are equivalent in birth rates, death rates, dispersal rates and speciation rates, when measured on a per-capita basis.<ref name=\"Hubbell2005\"/>  This can be considered a [[null hypothesis]] to [[ecological niche|niche theory]].  Hubbell built on earlier neutral concepts, including [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] & [[E.O. Wilson|Wilson]]'s theory of [[island biogeography]]<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/> and [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]]'s concepts of symmetry and null models.<ref name=\"Hubbell2005\"/>\n\nAn ''ecological community'' is a group of trophically similar, [[sympatric]] [[species]] that actually or potentially compete in a local area for the same or similar resources.<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/> Under the Unified Theory, complex [[ecological]] interactions are permitted among individuals of an ecological community (such as competition and cooperation), provided that all individuals obey the same rules. Asymmetric phenomena such as [[parasite|parasitism]] and [[predator|predation]] are ruled out by the terms of reference; but cooperative strategies such as swarming, and negative interaction such as competing for limited food or light are allowed (so long as all individuals behave in the same way).\n\nThe Unified Theory also makes predictions that have profound implications for the management of [[biodiversity]], especially the management of rare species.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe theory predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity constant, conventionally written ''\u03b8'', that appears to govern species richness on a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales.\n\n==Saturation==\n\nAlthough not strictly necessary for a neutral theory, many [[stochastic]] models of biodiversity assume a fixed, finite community size.  There are unavoidable physical constraints on the total number of individuals that can be packed into a given space (although space ''per se'' isn't necessarily a resource, it is often a useful surrogate variable for a limiting resource that is distributed over the landscape; examples would include [[sunlight]] or hosts, in the case of parasites).\n\nIf a wide range of species are considered (say, [[giant sequoia]] trees and [[duckweed]], two species that have very different saturation densities), then the assumption of constant community size might not be very good, because density would be higher if the smaller species were monodominant.\n\nHowever, because the Unified Theory refers only to communities of trophically similar, competing species, it is unlikely that population density will vary too widely from one place to another.\n\nHubbell considers the fact that population densities are constant and interprets it as a general principle: ''large landscapes are always biotically saturated with individuals''.  Hubbell thus treats communities as being of a fixed number of individuals, usually denoted by ''J''.\n\nExceptions to the saturation principle include disturbed ecosystems such as the [[Serengeti]], where saplings are trampled by [[elephant]]s and [[Blue wildebeest]]s; or [[garden]]s, where certain species are systematically removed.\n\n===Species abundances===\n\nWhen abundance data on natural populations are collected, two observations are almost universal:\n\n*  The most common species accounts for a substantial fraction of the individuals sampled;\n*  A substantial fraction of the species sampled are very rare.  Indeed, a substantial fraction of the species sampled are singletons, that is, species which are sufficiently rare for only a single individual to have been sampled.\n\nSuch observations typically generate a large number of questions.  Why are the rare species rare? Why is the most abundant species so much more abundant than the median species abundance?\n\nA non neutral explanation for the rarity of rare species might suggest that rarity is a result of poor adaptation to local conditions.  The UNTB implies that such considerations may be neglected from the perspective of population biology (because the explanation cited implies that the rare species behaves differently from the abundant species).\n\nSpecies composition in any community will change randomly with time.  However, any  particular abundance structure will have an associated probability.  The UNTB  predicts that the probability of a community of ''J'' individuals composed of ''S''  distinct species with abundances <math>n_1</math> for species 1, <math>n_2</math> for  species 2, and so on up to <math>n_S</math> for species ''S'' is given by\n\n:<math>\n\\Pr(n_1,n_2,\\ldots,n_S| \\theta, J)=\n\\frac{J!\\theta^S}\n{\n  1^{\\phi_1}2^{\\phi_2}\\cdots J^{\\phi_J}\n  \\phi_1!\\phi_2!\\cdots\\phi_J!\n  \\Pi_{k=1}^J(\\theta+k-1)\n}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta=2J\\nu</math> is the fundamental biodiversity number (<math>\\nu</math> is the speciation rate), and <math>\\phi_i</math> is the number of species that have ''i'' individuals in the sample.\n\nThis equation shows that the UNTB implies a nontrivial dominance-diversity equilibrium between speciation and extinction.\n\nAs an example, consider a community with 10 individuals and three species \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" with abundances 3, 6 and 1 respectively.  Then the formula above would allow us to assess the [[likelihood function|likelihood]] of different values of ''\u03b8''. There are thus ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 species and <math>\\phi_1=\\phi_3=\\phi_6=1</math>, all other <math>\\phi</math>'s being zero. The formula would give\n\n:<math>\n\\Pr(3,6,1| \\theta,10)=\n\\frac{10!\\theta^3}{\n1^1\\cdot 3^1\\cdot 6^1\n\\cdot\n1!1!1!\n\\cdot\n\\theta(\\theta+1)(\\theta+2)\\cdots(\\theta+9)}\n</math>\n\nwhich could be maximized to yield an estimate for ''\u03b8'' (in practice, [[numerical methods]] are used).  The [[maximum likelihood]] estimate for ''\u03b8'' is about 1.1478.\n\nWe could have labelled the species another way and counted the abundances being 1,3,6 instead (or 3,1,6, etc. etc.).  Logic tells us that the probability of observing a pattern of abundances will be the same observing any [[permutation]] of those abundances. Here we would have\n\n: <math>\\Pr(3;3,6,1)=\\Pr(3;1,3,6)=\\Pr(3;3,1,6)</math>\n\nand so on.\n\nTo account for this, it is helpful to consider only ranked abundances (that is, to sort the abundances before inserting into the formula).  A ranked dominance-diversity configuration is usually written as <math>\\Pr(S;r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_s,0,\\ldots,0)</math> where <math>r_i</math> is the abundance of the ''i''th most abundant species: <math>r_1</math> is the abundance of the most abundant, <math>r_2</math> the abundance of the second most abundant species, and so on.  For convenience, the expression is usually \"padded\" with enough zeros to ensure that there are ''J'' species (the zeros indicating that the extra species have zero abundance).\n\nIt is now possible to determine the [[Expected value|expected]] abundance of the ''i''th most abundant species:\n\n:<math>\nE(r_i)=\\sum_{k=1}^C\nr_i(k)\\cdot \\Pr(S;r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_s,0,\\ldots,0)\n</math>\n\nwhere ''C'' is the total number of configurations, <math>r_i(k)</math> is the abundance of the ''i''th ranked species in the ''k''th configuration,  and <math>Pr(\\ldots)</math> is the dominance-diversity probability.  This formula is difficult to manipulate mathematically, but relatively simple to simulate computationally.\n\nThe model discussed so far is a model of a regional community, which Hubbell calls the [[metacommunity]]. Hubbell also acknowledged that on a local scale, dispersal plays an important role. For example, seeds are more likely to come from nearby parents than from distant parents. Hubbell introduced the parameter m, which denotes the probability of immigration in the local community from the metacommunity. If m = 1, dispersal is unlimited; the local community is just a random sample from the metacommunity and the formulas above apply. If m < 1, however, dispersal is limited and the local community is a dispersal-limited sample from the metacommunity for which different formulas apply.\n\nIt has been shown<ref name=\"Volkov2003\"/> that <math>\\langle \\phi_n \\rangle </math>, the expected number of species with abundance n, may be calculated by\n\n:<math>\n\\theta\\frac{J!}{n!(J-n)!}\n\\frac{\\Gamma(\\gamma)}{\\Gamma(J+\\gamma)}\n\\int_{y=0}^\\gamma\n\\frac{\\Gamma(n+y)}{\\Gamma(1+y)}\n\\frac{\\Gamma(J-n+\\gamma-y)}{\\Gamma(\\gamma-y)}\n\\exp(-y\\theta/\\gamma)\\,dy\n</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the fundamental biodiversity number, ''J'' the community size,  <math>\\Gamma</math> is the [[gamma function]], and <math>\\gamma=(J-1)m/(1-m)</math>. This formula is however an approximation.  The correct formula is derived in a series of papers, reviewed and synthesized by Etienne & Alonso 2005:<ref name=\"Etienne2005\"/>\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\theta }{(I)_{J}} {J \\choose n}\n\\int_{0}^{1}(Ix)_{n}(I(1-x))_{J-n}\\frac{(1-x)^{\\theta -1}}{x}\\,dx  \n</math>\n\nwhere <math>I = (J-1)*m/(1-m)</math> is a parameter that measures dispersal limitation.\n\n<math>\\langle \\phi_n \\rangle</math> is zero for ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''J'', as there cannot be more species than individuals.\n\nThis formula is important because it allows a quick evaluation of the Unified Theory. It is not suitable for testing the theory. For this purpose, the appropriate likelihood function should be used. For the metacommunity this was given above. For the local community with dispersal limitation it is given by:\n\n:<math>\n\\Pr(n_1,n_2,\\ldots,n_S| \\theta, m, J)=\n\\frac{J!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{S}n_{i}\n\\prod_{j=1}^{J}\\Phi_{j}!}\\frac{\\theta ^{S}}{(I)_{J}}\n\\sum_{A=S}^{J}K(\\overrightarrow{D},A)\\frac{I^{A}}{(\\theta) _{A}}\n</math>\n\nHere, the <math>K(\\overrightarrow{D},A)</math> for <math>A=S,...,J</math> are coefficients fully determined by the data, being defined as\n\n:<math>\nK(\\overrightarrow{D},A):=\\sum_{\\{a_{1},...,a_{S}|\\sum_{i=1}^{S}a_{i}=A\\}}\n\\prod_{i=1}^{S}\\frac{\\overline{s}\\left( n_{i},a_{i}\\right) \\overline{s}\n\\left( a_{i},1\\right) }{\\overline{s}\\left( n_{i},1\\right) }\n</math>\n\nThis seemingly complicated formula involves [[Stirling number]]s and [[Pochhammer symbol]]s, but can be easily calculated.<ref name=\"Etienne2005\"/>\n\nAn example of a species abundance curve can be found in Scientific American.<ref name=\"Scientific American\"/>\n\n==Stochastic modelling of species abundances under the UNTB==\n\nUNTB distinguishes between a dispersal-limited local community of size <math>J</math> and a so-called metacommunity from which species can (re)immigrate and which acts as a [[heat bath]] to the local community. The distribution of species in the metacommunity is given by a dynamic equilibrium of speciation and extinction. Both community dynamics are modelled by appropriate [[urn problem|urn processes]], where each individual is represented by a ball with a color corresponding to its species. With a certain rate <math>r</math> randomly chosen individuals reproduce, i.e. add another ball of their own color to the urn. Since one basic assumption is saturation, this reproduction has to happen at the cost of another random individual from the urn which is removed. At a different rate <math>\\mu</math> single individuals in the metacommunity are replaced by mutants of an entirely new species. Hubbell calls this simplified model for [[speciation]] a [[point mutation]], using the terminology of the [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]]. The urn scheme for the metacommunity of <math>J_M</math> individuals is the following.\n\nAt each time step take one of the two possible actions :\n\n# With probability <math>(1-\\nu)</math> draw an individual at random and replace another random individual from the urn with a copy of the first one.\n# With probability <math>\\nu</math> draw an individual and replace it with an individual of a new species.\n\nThe size <math>J_M</math> of the metacommunity does not change. This is a [[point process]] in time. The length of the time steps is distributed exponentially. For simplicity one can, however, assume that each time step is as long as the mean time between two changes which can be derived from the reproduction and mutation rates <math>r</math> and <math>\\mu</math>. The probability <math>\\nu</math> is given as <math>\\nu=\\mu/(r+\\mu)</math>.\n\nThe species abundance distribution for this urn process is given by [[Ewens's sampling formula]] which was originally derived in 1972 for the distribution of [[allele]] under neutral mutations. The expected number <math>S_M(n)</math> of species in the metacommunity having exactly <math>n</math> individuals is:<ref name=\"Vallade2003\"/>\n\n:<math>\nS_M(n) = \\frac{\\theta}{n}\\frac{\\Gamma(J_M+1)\\Gamma(J_M+\\theta-n)}{\\Gamma(J_M+1-n)\\Gamma(J_M+\\theta)}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta=(J_M-1)\\nu/(1-\\nu)\\approx J_M\\nu</math> is called the fundamental biodiversity number. For large\nmetacommunities and <math>n\\ll J_M</math> one recovers the [[Logarithmic distribution|Fisher Log-Series]] as species distribution.\n\n:<math>\nS_M(n) \\approx \\frac{\\theta}{n} \\left( \\frac{J_M}{J_M+\\theta} \\right)^n\n</math>\n\nThe urn scheme for the local community of fixed size <math>J</math> is very similar to the one for the metacommunity.\n\nAt each time step take one of the two actions :\n\n# With probability <math>(1-m)</math> draw an individual at random and replace another random individual from the urn with a copy of the first one.\n# With probability <math>m</math> replace a random individual with an immigrant drawn from the metacommunity.\n\nThe metacommunity is changing on a much larger timescale and is assumed to be fixed during the evolution of the local community. The resulting distribution of species in the local community and expected values depend on four parameters, <math>J</math>, <math>J_M</math>, <math>\\theta</math> and <math>m</math> (or <math>I</math>) and are derived in Etienne & Alonso (2005),<ref name=\"Etienne2005\"/> including several simplifying limit cases like the one presented in the previous section (there called <math>\\langle\\phi_n\\rangle</math>). The parameter <math>m</math> is a dispersal parameter. If <math>m=1</math> then the local community is just a sample from the metacommunity. For <math>m=0</math> the local community is completely isolated from the metacommunity and all species will go extinct except one. This case has been analyzed by Hubbell himself.<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/> The case <math>0<m<1</math> is characterized by a [[unimodal]] species distribution in a [[Preston Diagram]] and often fitted by a [[log-normal distribution]]. This is understood as an intermediate state between domination of the most common species and a sampling from the metacommunity, where singleton species are most abundant. UNTB thus predicts that in dispersal limited communities rare species become even rarer. The log-normal distribution describes the maximum and the abundance of common species very well but underestimates the number of very rare species considerably which becomes only apparent for very large sample sizes.<ref name=\"Hubbell2001\"/>\n\n==Species-area relationships==\n\nThe Unified Theory unifies ''biodiversity'', as measured by species-abundance curves, with ''biogeography'', as measured by species-area curves. Species-area relationships show the rate at which species diversity increases with area.  The topic is of great interest to conservation biologists in the design of reserves, as it is often desired to harbour as many species as possible.\n\nThe most commonly encountered relationship is the power law given by\n\n:<math>\nS=cA^z</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the number of species found, ''A'' is the area sampled, and ''c'' and ''z'' are constants.  This relationship, with different constants, has been found to fit a wide range of empirical data.\n\nFrom the perspective of Unified Theory, it is convenient to consider ''S'' as a function of total community size  ''J''.  Then <math>S=kJ^z</math> for some constant ''k'', and if this relationship were exactly true, the species area line would be straight on log scales.  It is typically found that the curve is not straight, but the slope changes from being steep at small areas, shallower at intermediate areas, and steep at the largest areas.\n\nThe formula for species composition <!--derived above ('''not done this bit yet''')--> may be used to calculate the expected number of species present in a community under the assumptions of the Unified Theory.  In symbols\n\n:<math>\nE\\left\\{S|\\theta,J\\right\\}=\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta  }+\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}+\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+2}+\n\\cdots +\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+J-1}\n</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the fundamental biodiversity number.  This formula specifies the expected number of species sampled in a community of size ''J''. The last term, <math>\\theta/(\\theta+J-1)</math>, is the expected number of ''new'' species encountered when adding one new individual to the community.  This is an increasing function of \u03b8 and a decreasing function of ''J'', as expected.\n\nBy making the substitution <math>J=\\rho A</math> (see section on saturation above), then the expected number of species becomes <math>\\Sigma\\theta/(\\theta+\\rho A-1)</math>.\n\nThe formula above may be approximated to an [[integral]] giving\n\n:<math>\nS(\\theta)=\n1+\\theta\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{J-1}{\\theta}\\right).\n</math>\n\nThis formulation is predicated on a random placement of individuals.\n\n===Example===\n\nConsider the following (synthetic) dataset of 27 individuals:\n\na,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,b,b,b,b,c,c,c,c,d,d,d,d,e,f,g,h,i\n\nThere are thus 27 individuals of 9 species (\"a\" to \"i\") in the sample. Tabulating this would give:\n\n  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i\n 10  4  4  4  1  1  1  1  1\n\nindicating that species \"a\" is the most abundant with 10 individuals and species \"e\" to \"i\" are singletons.  Tabulating the table gives:\n\n species abundance    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10\n number of species    5    0    0    3    0    0    0    0    0     1\n\nOn the second row, the 5 in the first column means that five species, species \"e\" through \"i\", have abundance one.  The following two zeros in columns 2 and 3 mean that zero species have abundance 2 or 3.  The 3 in column 4 means that three species, species \"b\", \"c\", and \"d\", have abundance four.  The final 1 in column 10 means that one species, species \"a\", has abundance 10.\n\nThis type of dataset is typical in biodiversity studies.  Observe how more than half the biodiversity (as measured by species count) is due to singletons.\n\nFor real datasets, the species abundances are binned into logarithmic categories, usually using base 2, which gives bins of  abundance 0-1, abundance 1-2, abundance 2-4, abundance 4-8, etc.  Such abundance classes are called ''octaves''; early developers of this concept included [[Frank W. Preston|F. W. Preston]] and histograms showing number of species as a function of abundance octave are known as [[Preston diagram]]s.\n\nThese bins are not mutually exclusive: a species with abundance 4, for example, could be considered as lying in the 2-4 abundance class or the 4-8 abundance class.  Species with an abundance of an exact power of 2 (i.e.  2,4,8,16, etc.) are conventionally considered as having 50% membership in the lower abundance class 50% membership in the upper class.  Such species are thus considered to be evenly split between the two adjacent classes (apart from singletons which are classified into the rarest category).   Thus in the example above, the Preston abundances would be\n\n abundance class 1    1-2   2-4   4-8  8-16\n species         5     0    1.5   1.5   1\n\nThe three species of abundance four thus appear, 1.5 in abundance class 2-4, and 1.5 in 4-8.\n\nThe above method of analysis cannot account for species that are unsampled: that is, species sufficiently rare to have been recorded zero times.  Preston diagrams are thus truncated at zero abundance. [[Frank W. Preston|Preston]] called this the ''veil line'' and noted that the cutoff point would move as more individuals are sampled.\n\n==Dynamics under neutral hypothesis==\n\nAll biodiversity patterns previously described are related to time-independent quantities. However, for biodiversity evolution and species preservation, it is crucial to compare the dynamics of ecosystems with models (Leigh, 2007). An easily accessible index of the underlying evolution is the so-called species turnover distribution (STD), defined as the probability P(r,t) that the population of any species has varied by a fraction r after a given time t.\n\nA neutral model that can analytically predict both the relative species abundance (RSA) at steady-state and the STD at time t has been presented in Azaele et al. (2006).<ref name=\"Azaele2006\"/> Within this framework the population of any species is represented by a continuous (random) variable x, whose evolution is governed by the following Langevin equation:\n:<math>\n\\dot{x}=b-x/\\tau+\\sqrt{Dx}\\xi(t)\n</math>\nwhere b is the immigration rate from a large regional community, <math>-x/\\tau</math> represents competition for finite resources and D is related to demographic stochasticity; <math>\\xi(t)</math> is a Gaussian white noise. The model can also be derived as a continuous approximation of a master equation, where birth and death rates are independent of species, and predicts that at steady-state the RSA is simply a gamma distribution.\n\nFrom the exact time-dependent solution of the previous equation, one can exactly calculate the STD at time t under stationary conditions: \n:<math>\nP(r,t)=A\\frac{\\lambda+1}{\\lambda}\\frac{(e^{t/\\tau})^{b/2D}}{1-e^{-t/\\tau}}\\left(\\frac{\\sinh(\\frac{t}{2\\tau})}{\\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{b}{D}+1}\\left(\\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda+1)^2e^{t/\\tau}-4\\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{b}{D}+\\frac{1}{2}}.\n</math>\nThis formula provides good fits of data collected in the Barro Colorado tropical forest from 1990 to 2000. From the best fit one can estimate <math>\\tau</math> ~ 3500 years with a broad uncertainty due to the relative short time interval of the sample. This parameter can be interpreted as the relaxation time of the system, i.e. the time the system needs to recover from a perturbation of species distribution.

'''Whipped cream''' is a culinary [[colloid]] produced when [[cream]] is aerated by one of two processes: mechanical agitation with a high-speed blade or whip, or injecting a gas under high pressure which expands rapidly when released from pressurized containment. It is often sweetened and sometimes flavored with [[vanilla]]. Whipped cream is also called '''Chantilly cream''' or '''Cr\u00e8me chantilly''' ({{IPA-fr|k\u0281\u025bm \u0283\u0251\u0303tiji|pron}}).\n\n== Fat content==\nThe typical fat content of cream used for whipping is high as fat globules contribute to forming a stable structure surrounding and stabilizing air bubbles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/whipped-cream-structure|title=Whipped Cream Structure {{!}} Food Science|website=www.uoguelph.ca|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>.

If, however, the whipping is continued, the fat droplets will stick together destroying the colloid and forming [[butter]].  Lower-fat cream (or milk) does not whip well, while higher-fat cream produces a more stable foam.<ref name=\"mcgee\"/>\n\n==Methods of whipping==\n<!--[[Whipping siphon]] redirects directly here.-->\nCream is usually mechanically whipped with a [[whisk]], an electric hand [[mixer (cooking)|mixer]], or a [[food processor]].

Thus mechanically whipped cream has a useful lifetime of one to two hours. Many 19th-century recipes recommend adding [[gum tragacanth]] to stabilize whipped cream, while a few include [[whipped egg whites]].<ref name=\"dubois\"/>  Various other substances, including [[gelatin]] and [[E450 (food additive)|diphosphate]], are used in commercial [[Stabiliser (food)|stabilizers]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Wayne Gisslen|title=Professional Baking|year=2008|ISBN=0471783498|p=264}}</ref><ref>Alan Imeson, ed., ''Food Stabilisers, Thickeners and Gelling Agents'', 2011, {{ISBN|1444360337}}, ''passim''</ref><ref>Rose Levy Beranbaum, ''The Pie and Pastry Bible'', 2009, {{ISBN|1439130876}}, p. 550</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Oetker Whip It|website=Dr. Oetker|url=http://www.oetker.ca/ca-en/our-products/dr-oetker-whip-it/dr-oetker-whip-it.html}}</ref>\n\nWhipped cream may also be made instantly as needed, in two ways: from a retail can, or in a [[soda siphon|'''whipping siphon''']]. Cream is placed into the siphon, and a [[whipped-cream charger]] is inserted into its holder in the siphon. When the top is screwed on the charger is automatically opened, and the pressurized gas contained therein is released to dissolve into the cream. Typically the gas is [[nitrous oxide]], as [[carbon dioxide]] tends to give a sour taste.<ref name=\"lange\"/> The nitrous oxide gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure. When the pressure is released bubbles are produced, and thus the cream is instantly whipped. \n\n== Flavorings ==\n\nWhipped cream is often flavored with sugar, [[vanilla]], [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], and so on.<ref>Jules Gouff\u00e9e ''et al.'', ''Le livre de p\u00e2tisserie'', 1873 p.

Cream is placed into the siphon, and a [[whipped-cream charger]] is inserted into its holder in the siphon. When the top is screwed on the charger is automatically opened, and the pressurized gas contained therein is released to dissolve into the cream. Typically the gas is [[nitrous oxide]], as [[carbon dioxide]] tends to give a sour taste.<ref name=\"lange\"/> The nitrous oxide gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure.
