It was designed by [[John Whitton]] as the Engineer-in-Chief for the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. The bridge was built during 1884 by Benjamin Barnes, with ironwork by Cochrane & Co, [[Middlesbrough|{{sic|hide=y|Middlesb|orough}}]], England. The railway bridge is also known as the '''Dubbo Lattice Railway Bridge'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1032>{{cite NSW SHR|5011997|Dubbo rail bridge over Macquarie River|hr=01032|fn=EF10/22236|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is sited {{convert|462.762|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 20-year period 1873-1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. It was a boom period that ended with a severe economic depression.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\nDespite the boom conditions, the respective Chief Engineers, for Roads, William C Bennett, and for Railways, John Whitton, were constrained to economise by using as much local material as possible, consequently an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridgeworks, mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges. However, there were many major rivers to be crossed, requiring long span bridges, for which no form of timber bridge was suitable. These large bridges had to be metal and supplied from England, a very expensive import cost to the successive colonial governments.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\nBoth Chief Engineers were British so they chose the widely used wrought iron lattice truss bridge in the half-through form. Twelve of these were built for the railways and 24 for roads. These two sets of iron lattice bridges are the most significant group of bridges of the colonial period. A high percentage are extant and still in use, 11 on railways and 18 on roads. The current railway lattice bridges are:<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n*1876{{spaced endash}}[[Bathurst Rail Bridge over Macquarie River]] - still standing but not in use.\n*1881{{spaced endash}}Macquarie River at [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]]\n*1882{{spaced endash}}[[Peel River (New South Wales)|Peel River]] at [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]]\n*1882{{spaced endash}}MacDonald River at [[Woolbrook, New South Wales|Woolbrook]]\n*1884{{spaced endash}}[[Rail Bridge over Murray River, Albury-Wodonga]]\n*1884{{spaced endash}}Macquarie River at Dubbo\n*1885{{spaced endash}}Murrumbidgee River at [[Narrandera]]\n*1887{{spaced endash}}[[Lachlan River railway bridge, Cowra|Lachlan River railway bridge]] at [[Cowra]].\n\nTwo former railway lattice bridges (1885 [[Georges River]] at [[Como, New South Wales|Como]] and 1886 [[Parramatta River]] at [[Meadowbank, New South Wales|Meadowbank]]) were converted for use by pedestrian/cycle ways.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\nThe 1871 lattice railway bridge over the [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]] at [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]] was replaced by steel girders and demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1032/> The 1881 [[Murrumbidgee River]] at [[Wagga Wagga]] was demolished in 2004 and replaced with a concrete structure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=15910|title=Australian Heritage Database|website=www.environment.gov.au|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nA 3-[[Span (architecture)|span]] continuous iron [[Latticework|lattice]] bridge. The spans are {{convert|159|ft|m|order=flip}} to centres of [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and the lattice work has four triangulations.

The bridge has [[wrought iron]] plate web girders at each end of the lattice bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 10 August 2006, the physical condition was good.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 10 August 2006, the bridge at the end of the yard is one of John Whitton's single track lattice bridges which were typical of the period of construction and is of high significance to the state system. The viaduct in leading to the actual bridge was originally timber but has been replaced by PWG steel.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\nThis bridge is a member of the most significant group of colonial bridges in New South Wales. Collectively, as items of railway infrastructure, they contributed significantly to the history and development of New South Wales. Each bridge is an imposing structure at its site.

It was designed by [[John Whitton]] as the Engineer-in-Chief for the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. The bridge was built during 1884 by Benjamin Barnes, with ironwork by Cochrane & Co, [[Middlesbrough|{{sic|hide=y|Middlesb|orough}}]], England. The railway bridge is also known as the '''Dubbo Lattice Railway Bridge'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1032>{{cite NSW SHR|5011997|Dubbo rail bridge over Macquarie River|hr=01032|fn=EF10/22236|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is sited {{convert|462.762|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 20-year period 1873-1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. It was a boom period that ended with a severe economic depression.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\nDespite the boom conditions, the respective Chief Engineers, for Roads, William C Bennett, and for Railways, John Whitton, were constrained to economise by using as much local material as possible, consequently an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridgeworks, mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges. However, there were many major rivers to be crossed, requiring long span bridges, for which no form of timber bridge was suitable. These large bridges had to be metal and supplied from England, a very expensive import cost to the successive colonial governments.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\nBoth Chief Engineers were British so they chose the widely used wrought iron lattice truss bridge in the half-through form. Twelve of these were built for the railways and 24 for roads. These two sets of iron lattice bridges are the most significant group of bridges of the colonial period. A high percentage are extant and still in use, 11 on railways and 18 on roads. The current railway lattice bridges are:<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n*1876{{spaced endash}}[[Bathurst Rail Bridge over Macquarie River]] - still standing but not in use.\n*1881{{spaced endash}}Macquarie River at [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]]\n*1882{{spaced endash}}[[Peel River (New South Wales)|Peel River]] at [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]]\n*1882{{spaced endash}}MacDonald River at [[Woolbrook, New South Wales|Woolbrook]]\n*1884{{spaced endash}}[[Rail Bridge over Murray River, Albury-Wodonga]]\n*1884{{spaced endash}}Macquarie River at Dubbo\n*1885{{spaced endash}}Murrumbidgee River at [[Narrandera]]\n*1887{{spaced endash}}[[Lachlan River railway bridge, Cowra|Lachlan River railway bridge]] at [[Cowra]].\n\nTwo former railway lattice bridges (1885 [[Georges River]] at [[Como, New South Wales|Como]] and 1886 [[Parramatta River]] at [[Meadowbank, New South Wales|Meadowbank]]) were converted for use by pedestrian/cycle ways.<ref name=nswshr-1032/>\n\nThe 1871 lattice railway bridge over the [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]] at [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]] was replaced by steel girders and demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1032/> The 1881 [[Murrumbidgee River]] at [[Wagga Wagga]] was demolished in 2004 and replaced with a concrete structure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=15910|title=Australian Heritage Database|website=www.environment.gov.au|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nA 3-[[Span (architecture)|span]] continuous iron [[Latticework|lattice]] bridge.

Advantages include low cost compared to other housing, and quick and easy moving to a new area, for example when taking a job in a distant place while keeping the same home.\n\nTrailer parks, especially in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], are stereotypically viewed as [[Affordable housing|lower income housing]] for occupants living at or below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] who have low social status and lead a desultory and deleterious lifestyle. Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser [[James Carville]] who, in the course of one of the [[Bill Clinton]] [[White House]] political scandals, suggested \"Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there's no telling what you'll find,\" in reference to [[Paula Jones]].<ref>{{cite news| title = Will she have her day in court?\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985789,00.html| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| location = New York| date = 1997-01-20| accessdate = 2008-01-21| archiveurl = | author = [[Adam Cohen (journalist)|Adam Cohen]]\n}}</ref> It is also seen in the Canadian [[mockumentary]] ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]''.\n\n[[Tornado]]es and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s often inflict serious damage on trailer parks, usually because the structures are not secured to the ground and their construction is significantly less able to withstand high wind forces than regular houses. However, most modern [[Manufactured housing|manufactured homes]] are built to withstand high winds, using hurricane straps and proper foundations.\n\n== By country ==\n[[File:Uptown25Jan06FEMAtrailerPark1.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[New Orleans]] in 2006 after [[Hurricane Katrina]]: A park in an unflooded part of town became the site of a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] trailer park for people whose homes were damaged or destroyed.]]\n\n=== In the United States ===\n{{further|RV park}}\nThe negative perception of trailer parks was not improved by the creation of emergency trailer parks by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) for the displaced victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the quality and temporary nature of which was disputed.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/us/nationalspecial/12exile.html ''Road to New Life After Katrina Is Closed to Many''], [[New York Times]], July 12, 2007]</ref>\n\nMany stereotypes have been developed regarding people who live in trailer parks, which are similar to [[stereotype]]s of the poor and the term ''[[trailer trash]]'' is often used<ref>{{cite book | title=Class and News | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-7425-2713-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edtUWDk4FWcC&pg=PA213 | access-date=January 4, 2020 | pages=213-214}}</ref> as an adjective in the same vein as the derogatory American terms ''[[white trash]]'' or ''[[ghetto]]''. Though trailer parks appear throughout the United States, they are often associated with the [[Deep South]] and rural areas.\n\nMore recently referred to in the U.S. as \"mobile home parks\" or \"[[manufactured housing]] communities\", the stereotypes are often just that. [[Age-Restricted communities]] exist in many locales that permit mobile home parks as \"55+ parks\" in keeping with the [[Housing for Older Persons Act]] (HOPA). Generally at least one homeowner in these age-restricted communities must be age 55 or over and persons under the age of 18 are rarely permitted to live there. These can be [[gated community|gated communities]] with amenities such as [[swimming pool]]s, [[community center|clubhouse]]s and on-site maintenance. Homes are often permanently installed on foundations. However, in certain circumstances residents may not own the land their homes occupy.\n\n====Corporate investment====\nMobile home parks in the U.S. have become an attractive investment for large financial firms, such as [[The Carlyle Group|Carlyle Group]], [[Apollo Global Management]] and [[TPG Capital]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-billion-dollar-empire-made-of-mobile-homes/2019/02/14/ac687342-2b0b-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html|title=A billion-dollar empire made of mobile homes|last=Whoriskey|first=Peter|date=February 14, 2019|website=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> Over 100,000 US mobile home sites were estimated to be owned by large firms in 2019.<ref name=\":0\" /> One firm, [[Stockbridge Capital Group]], owner of about 200 mobile-home parks throughout the US \"saw a return on investment of more than 30 percent between late 2016 and the end of 2017.\" <ref name=\":0\" /> The company's expansion into this market was facilitated by $1.3 billion in financing from [[Fannie Mae]], which has called mobile homes \"inherently affordable.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Profitability for the firms owning the parks has in some cases been tied to rent increases, and has not necessarily translated into good maintenance of the mobile homes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Outside United States ===\n\n==== Disputed Trailer Parks====\n[[File:Traveller Pride mural, St. Margaret\u2019s Park, Ballymun.jpg|thumb|TRAVELLER PRIDE - mural located at the entrance to the authorised [[Halting site]] of St. Margaret\u2019s Park in [[Ballymun]] ]]\nIn Britain and Ireland the term [[Halting site]] is used in place of trailer parks. The biggest difference in Europe is the presence of unauthorised halting sites (or trailer parks). This stems from the practice by traditionally itinerant ethnic groups, such as the [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Irish Travellers]] to periodically during the year set up a transient community. From the late 1970\u2019s onward there was also a growth in [[New Age travelers]] culture; these groups espoused alternative lifestyles combined with a Do-It-Yourself punk ethic. The latter were a commonplace phenomenon in Germany<ref>Cool Places: Geographies of Youth Cultures, (eds) Tracey Skelton, Gill Valentine, p. 289</ref>, giving rise to words such as ''Wagenburg'', ''Wagendorf'' or ''Bauwagenplatz'' (tr. \"wagon fort\", \"trailer village\" and \"construction trailer place\" respectively).  \n\nEither rejected from or refusing to seek entrance in municipally authorised halting sites, groups of families practising a nomadic lifestyle would establish themselves under the cover of darkness on idle land near urban centers.

This area is now a gated community with new houses]]\n\nA '''trailer park''' or '''caravan park''' is a temporary  or permanent area for [[mobile home]]s and [[travel trailer]]s. Advantages include low cost compared to other housing, and quick and easy moving to a new area, for example when taking a job in a distant place while keeping the same home.\n\nTrailer parks, especially in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], are stereotypically viewed as [[Affordable housing|lower income housing]] for occupants living at or below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] who have low social status and lead a desultory and deleterious lifestyle. Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser [[James Carville]] who, in the course of one of the [[Bill Clinton]] [[White House]] political scandals, suggested \"Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there's no telling what you'll find,\" in reference to [[Paula Jones]].<ref>{{cite news| title = Will she have her day in court?\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985789,00.html| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| location = New York| date = 1997-01-20| accessdate = 2008-01-21| archiveurl = | author = [[Adam Cohen (journalist)|Adam Cohen]]\n}}</ref> It is also seen in the Canadian [[mockumentary]] ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]''.\n\n[[Tornado]]es and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s often inflict serious damage on trailer parks, usually because the structures are not secured to the ground and their construction is significantly less able to withstand high wind forces than regular houses. However, most modern [[Manufactured housing|manufactured homes]] are built to withstand high winds, using hurricane straps and proper foundations.\n\n== By country ==\n[[File:Uptown25Jan06FEMAtrailerPark1.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[New Orleans]] in 2006 after [[Hurricane Katrina]]: A park in an unflooded part of town became the site of a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] trailer park for people whose homes were damaged or destroyed.]]\n\n=== In the United States ===\n{{further|RV park}}\nThe negative perception of trailer parks was not improved by the creation of emergency trailer parks by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) for the displaced victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the quality and temporary nature of which was disputed.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/us/nationalspecial/12exile.html ''Road to New Life After Katrina Is Closed to Many''], [[New York Times]], July 12, 2007]</ref>\n\nMany stereotypes have been developed regarding people who live in trailer parks, which are similar to [[stereotype]]s of the poor and the term ''[[trailer trash]]'' is often used<ref>{{cite book | title=Class and News | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-7425-2713-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edtUWDk4FWcC&pg=PA213 | access-date=January 4, 2020 | pages=213-214}}</ref> as an adjective in the same vein as the derogatory American terms ''[[white trash]]'' or ''[[ghetto]]''. Though trailer parks appear throughout the United States, they are often associated with the [[Deep South]] and rural areas.\n\nMore recently referred to in the U.S. as \"mobile home parks\" or \"[[manufactured housing]] communities\", the stereotypes are often just that. [[Age-Restricted communities]] exist in many locales that permit mobile home parks as \"55+ parks\" in keeping with the [[Housing for Older Persons Act]] (HOPA). Generally at least one homeowner in these age-restricted communities must be age 55 or over and persons under the age of 18 are rarely permitted to live there. These can be [[gated community|gated communities]] with amenities such as [[swimming pool]]s, [[community center|clubhouse]]s and on-site maintenance. Homes are often permanently installed on foundations. However, in certain circumstances residents may not own the land their homes occupy.\n\n====Corporate investment====\nMobile home parks in the U.S. have become an attractive investment for large financial firms, such as [[The Carlyle Group|Carlyle Group]], [[Apollo Global Management]] and [[TPG Capital]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-billion-dollar-empire-made-of-mobile-homes/2019/02/14/ac687342-2b0b-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html|title=A billion-dollar empire made of mobile homes|last=Whoriskey|first=Peter|date=February 14, 2019|website=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> Over 100,000 US mobile home sites were estimated to be owned by large firms in 2019.<ref name=\":0\" /> One firm, [[Stockbridge Capital Group]], owner of about 200 mobile-home parks throughout the US \"saw a return on investment of more than 30 percent between late 2016 and the end of 2017.\" <ref name=\":0\" /> The company's expansion into this market was facilitated by $1.3 billion in financing from [[Fannie Mae]], which has called mobile homes \"inherently affordable.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Profitability for the firms owning the parks has in some cases been tied to rent increases, and has not necessarily translated into good maintenance of the mobile homes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Outside United States ===\n\n==== Disputed Trailer Parks====\n[[File:Traveller Pride mural, St. Margaret\u2019s Park, Ballymun.jpg|thumb|TRAVELLER PRIDE - mural located at the entrance to the authorised [[Halting site]] of St. Margaret\u2019s Park in [[Ballymun]] ]]\nIn Britain and Ireland the term [[Halting site]] is used in place of trailer parks. The biggest difference in Europe is the presence of unauthorised halting sites (or trailer parks). This stems from the practice by traditionally itinerant ethnic groups, such as the [[Romani]] and [[Irish Travellers]] to periodically during the year set up a transient community. From the late 1970\u2019s onward there was also a growth in [[New Age travelers]] culture; these groups espoused alternative lifestyles combined with a Do-It-Yourself punk ethic. The latter were a commonplace phenomenon in Germany<ref>Cool Places: Geographies of Youth Cultures, (eds) Tracey Skelton, Gill Valentine, p. 289</ref>, giving rise to words such as ''Wagenburg'', ''Wagendorf'' or ''Bauwagenplatz'' (tr. \"wagon fort\", \"trailer village\" and \"construction trailer place\" respectively).  \n\nEither rejected from or refusing to seek entrance in municipally authorised halting sites, groups of families practising a nomadic lifestyle would establish themselves under the cover of darkness on idle land near urban centers. These unauthorised encampments were often resented by local people, perpetuating a cycle of discrimination, violence, fear and discrimination. The use of land without the necessary permission also carried the threat of imprisonment for the squatting families, further worsening the socio-economic disadvantage experienced by these minorities.<ref>{{cite news| title = Traveller couples given 24 hours to move away from vicinity of illegal halting site | url = https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/traveller-couples-given-24-hours-to-move-away-from-vicinity-of-illegal-halting-site-954709.html | work = [[The_Irish_Times#Digital | Breaking News.ie]]| location = Dublin| date = 2019-03-10| accessdate = 2020-04-20| archiveurl = | author = Aodhan O'Faolain}}</ref>  \n\n====Authorised Caravan Parks====  \nIn Germany, the Netherlands and some other European countries local law allows for normal camping at [[RV park]]s for a short time and seasonal camping for holiday makers, and also long-time camping (for years) with hardly movable travel trailers.
