These were also the first Firebirds with factory fuel injection, four-speed [[automatic transmission]]s, five-speed manual transmissions, four-cylinder engines, 16-inch wheels, and [[hatchback]] bodies.<ref name=\"new\">{{cite web |url=http://www.camaro3rdgen.20m.com/1982.html |title=1982 Camaro |accessdate=2010-10-10 |publisher=camaro3rdgen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415003743/http://www.camaro3rdgen.20m.com/1982.html |archivedate=April 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==1982==\n\nThe 3rd Generation of Firebirds consisted of three models: Firebird, Firebird S/E, and Firebird Trans Am. The Firebird was the base model, equivalent to the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Camaro Sport Coupe]]; the Firebird S/E was the luxury version; and the Trans Am, the high-performance version. For 1982, the new Firebird and Camaro had been completely restyled, with the windshield slope set at a dramatic, more aerodynamic 62 degrees,<ref>Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition (Motorbooks International, 1992) p.149</ref> (about 3 degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), flush mounted side glass, and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated rear [[hatchback]]. Electronically controlled retractable headlamps, and a rounded hoodline and front fenders were the primary characteristics that distinguished the Firebird from its Camaro sibling and its previous Firebird incarnations. The Firebird would retain hidden headlamps until the end of all production in 2002. Pontiac had also hoped to drop the \"Trans Am\" moniker from the redesigned cars to save royalties paid to the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] for use of the name. Early promotional cars were marked \"T/A\" as an alternative, however it was decided that doing so might cause more problems than it was worth and the \"Trans Am\" nameplate remained. Still, with its dimensions reduced, wheelbase shortened, and weight reduced, the Third Generation Firebird was also the closest yet in size to the original 1967 model. It won \"Best Sports GT\" category in the $11,000 to $14,000 range (also along with the Camaro). Road & Track called the fuel-injected Trans Am \"a dramatic improvement on its predecessors,\" accelerating from 0\u201360 in 9.2 seconds.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition (Motorbooks International, 1992) p.152</ref>\n\nThe new Firebird shrank to a 101-inch wheelbase, losing more than 8&nbsp;inches in overall length, measured about an inch narrower, and weighed nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than its 1981 predecessor. It also was the most aerodynamic production Firebird to date with a drag coefficient of 0.33. The new Trans Am took things a bit further, with a coefficient of .32.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition(Motorbooks International, 1992) p. 150</ref> The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 would be the most aerodynamic vehicle to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The retractable headlamps popped up from the leading edge of the hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided {{convert|30.9|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}. of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Standard Catalog of Firebird 1967\u20132002'' (Krause Publications, 2002) p. 97</ref> It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.\nThe front end of the vehicle featured {{convert|10.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} power disc brakes and were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a Firebird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower front control arms. In the rear, coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions tailshaft to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.\n\nThe interior now featured aircraft inspired details and gauges, using both fake and real Torx head screws that fastened the dash and console trim panels. Optional Recaro seats were offered. The 1981, non-Formula 3 spoke steering wheel was re-used and featured a Firebird logo mounted in the center of the horn pad, with optional leather grip. Many power options could be had. Special Viscount \"PMD\" bucket seats were optional, featuring a small opening in the headrest and a PMD logo in the center of the backrest. Leather seats were also available on both the standard seats and Viscount \"PMD\" seats. A standard locking rear glovebox was mounted on the rear driver\"s side of the cargo area and a mini spare tire was hidden behind the opposite panel on the passenger side. A lockable cargo door on the rear floor area and a retractable cargo area privacy shade were also available as options on all Firebirds.\n\nThe Firebird lineup was available with several engines:\n\n# The standard fuel-injected 90&nbsp;hp 2.5L 4-cylinder Pontiac \"Iron Duke\": This marked the first time a 4-cylinder engine was offered in the Firebird and was the last true Pontiac engine to be offered in the Firebird. This engine was only offered for the first few years of the generation. It provided almost the same power as the V6, but when coupled with the 5-speed manual transmission, provided between 31 and 34 miles per gallon on the highway, depending on the year.<ref>fueleconomy.gov \"Find a Car; 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 Firebird 2.5L 5-speed fuel economy Official EPA Window Sticker MPG\" Web. July 4, 2010</ref> \n# There was a carbureted 102&nbsp;hp 2.8L V6.\n# The LG4 5.0L: Utilizing GM's improved \"Computer Command Control\" system, the computer assisted E4ME carburetor, and computer controlled distributor, this Chevy 305ci produced 145&nbsp;hp and 240Lbs.Ft. of torque.\n# The LU5 5.0L: The new high-performance \"Crossfire Fuel Injection\" 5.0L V8, which employed a twin throttle body fuel injection system similar to that used in the 1982 Corvette's \"Crossfire\" 5.7L, and produced 165&nbsp;hp.\n\nThe Firebird came standard with 14-inch steel wheels, with several wheel options available unique to the base model. 14-inch turbo cast aluminum wheels were standard on the S/E and Trans Am models and featured smooth plastic hubcaps with a Pontiac \"Arrowhead\" in the center. The WS6 performance package option, available on the S/E and Trans Am, included 4-wheel disc brakes, P215/65R15 Goodyear Eagle GT radials with 15-inch cast aluminum wheels, stiffer springs, thicker 32&nbsp;mm front & 21&nbsp;mm rear sway bars, a 12.7:1 quick-ratio steering box, and limited slip rear differential. Also available was the WS7 option, which was the same as RPO WS6, but utilized rear drum brake. This option was created due to a shortage of rear disc brake components.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Standard Catalog of Firebird 1967\u20132002'' (Krause Publications, 2002) pp. 99\u2013101</ref>\n \nThe Firebird S/E was Pontiac's attempt to lure buyers interested in more luxury features; it could be had with the basic fuel saving \"Iron Duke\" I-4 drivetrain, but offered more options. Even the Trans Am's WS6 suspension was available on the S/E. It was delineated from the base Firebird model by \"S/E\" script on the sail panels, in place of the standard Firebird decals, and the Trans Am's dark tinted tail lights. The interior featured color-coded plastics to match the exterior/interior paint scheme. On S/E models equipped with the 14-inch or 15-inch \"Turbocast\" rims, with \"Bowling Ball\" hubcaps were color-coded to match the car's exterior paint.\n\nThe Trans Am came standard with a new incarnation of its traditional \"Air Extractors\" on the fenders. A dark-tinted version of the base Firebird's tail lights were fitted to the rear of the car and also featured a Silver or Gold \"Phoenix\" between them. Rubber \"Mini-Spats\" (stone deflectors) were mounted just before the front and rear wheels, and were toned down from the 70's design used on the earlier 2nd Gen Trans Am. Styled loosely after the earlier '80/'81 Turbo Trans Am, an optional \"Turbo Bulge\" hood was available on the Trans Am. Plans had originally been made to use a refined version of Pontiac's Turbo 4.9L engine. It was scrapped at the last minute, leaving many to speculate as to what could have been, had the engine been allowed to survive like its turbocharged companion, the Buick Turbo 3.8L [[V6]]. Despite this, the Turbo Bulge hood remained on the option list; on the Crossfire V-8, it was made functional, and even a lightweight aluminum version of this hood, \"RPO T45\", was available on the option list. It was a curved piece of pressed steel, and would be used in later years as the centerpiece of the Formula option. A new, smaller \"Phoenix\" was placed upon the Turbo Bulge hood or on the nose of flat hood equipped T/A's. The Trans Am came standard with one of the two 305 Chevy V8s. The well worn Borg-Warner four-speed manual transmission came mated only to the weak 145&nbsp;bhp LG4 305ci, while the Crossfire-injected LU5 305ci rated at 165&nbsp;hp came with the TH-200c automatic 3-speed transmission.  [[File:KITT1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A black Pontiac Firebird Trans Am built to mimic [[KITT]] from the TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.]]  \n\nThe new version of the Trans Am Pontiac's \"RPO Y84\" Black and Gold Trans Am S/E, made famous by [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Jackie Gleason]] in 1977's \"[[Smokey and the Bandit]]\", carried on into 1982 as the limited edition \"Recaro T/A\". The package added about 25% to the price of a Trans Am. Standard with a host of options, some features included charcoal Parella cloth Recaro seats, t-tops, a black exterior with gold trim, and black \"Bowling Ball\" hubcaps with special Gold Pontiac Arrowhead emblems on its center, mounted on gold-painted 15-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nAnother Special Trans Am also returned: the Daytona 500 Pace Car Edition. These models are quite rare, and much is still unknown about how many were built or how they were optioned. All were bright red, with special NASCAR decals, similar to both the 1981 Daytona Pace Car and the 1983 Daytona Pace Car. 15\" Aero Rims adorned with Black Bowling Ball hubcaps and a WS6 suspension. All had a black interior; it is not known if they included black Recaro seats. As it was Pontiac's debut of the still-fresh 3rd Generation 1982 Trans Am, it is possible that they would have been optioned with many of Pontiac's best amenities; however few are known to still exist at this time. Therefore, it is hard to ascertain what options they actually came with. These cars are featured in 1982 Daytona 500 race footage and in various advertisements.\n\nA modified black third gen 1982 Firebird Trans Am appeared in the new for 1982 television series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' as [[KITT]], voiced by [[William Daniels]], KARR, KITT's very evil twin voiced by [[Peter Cullen]], later [[Paul Frees]] in the original series in Seasons 1 and Seasons 3 of the original NBC TV  show Knight Rider was also a Modified Pontiac Firebird Trans AM as well.  For the reunion movie ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'', KITT underwent a makeover and became the \"Knight Industries 4000,\" a vehicle resembling the [[Pontiac Banshee]] concept car, but it was actually built using a Dodge Stealth and not a Firebird Trans Am.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jayohrberg.com/Knight_Rider_2000.html |title=Knight Rider 2000 - Jay Ohrberg's Hollywood Cars |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==1983==\n\nThe Firebird remained basically unchanged from the previous model year. All automatic transmission Firebirds now received a T-handle shifter knob, and the shift indicator changed for the Automatic Overdrive 700-R4. Midyear, the L69 high output 305 was introduced. This carbureted 190&nbsp;hp V8 was virtually identical to the L69 engine in the Camaro Z28, but used a different air cleaner assembly (instead of the Camaro's dual-snorkel air cleaner, the Trans Am received yet another functional cold air intake, designed to utilize the bulged hood).\n\nThe S/E Firebirds remained primarily the same outside of some color changes from the 1982 model year.\n\nThe RPO \"Y84\" Recaro Edition Trans Am or \"Recaro T/A\", was revised for 1983. It was now built to the owner's tastes, including many more, or less options, and RPO \"Y81\" returned as the Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E without T-Tops. The LG4 was standard as was the WS6 package. The exterior remained virtually the same, except now the Firebird logo decals on the sail panels were replaced with Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Logo Medallions. The interior now featured Tan leather Recaro seats, carpeting, side panels, and the headliner.\n\nIn its second year, the third generation Trans Am was again selected as the [[Daytona 500]] [[Pace Car]], and Pontiac offered a total of 2,500 Daytona Pace Car replicas through their dealerships. \nThe exterior was painted with a two-tone white/charcoal paint scheme, \"Official Pace Car\" decals on the doors, \"NASCAR\" decals on the rear quarter panels, and \"PONTIAC\" decals on the front windshield and rear glass. \nDecorating the front fenders just above the \"TRANS AM\" script were \"25th ANNIVERSARY DAYTONA 500\" emblems. \nA new graphic adorned the power bulge of the pace car's hood, and these limited-edition cars were the first to feature a special RPO W62, full-body ground-effects package that extended around the entire car and molded plastic panels.\n\"TRANS AM\" script appeared on the right-hand panel, in place of the standard Firebird nose grilles. \nTwo different set of wheels were offered: 1) 15-inch \"AERO\" wheels with White \"Bowling Ball\" hub caps, or 2) silver-finned wheels.\nThe interior featured red gauge lighting, leather clad steering wheel, shifter knob, and brake handle, a special dash plaque, \"Daytona 500\" floor-mats, and two-tone grey leather/suede Recaro seats.\n1,980 of these pace cars came with the LU5 Crossfire-injected 305 mated to the new 700R4 4-speed overdrive automatic; 520 had the carbureted LG4 305, mated to the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed manual.\n\n==1984==\n\nTotal production for Firebird models increased to 128,304 units, making this the best-selling year of the 3rd Generation Firebird.\n \nThe Firebird's interior options and design remained virtually unchanged for 1984, the only exceptions being a slightly revised dashpad, with screwed-in speaker grilles, an optional driver's knee pad bolster on the left side of the center console for manual cars, the T-tops were also redesigned to use a pin-mounting arrangement, rather than the earlier latch-based setup, and a new 1 piece horncap embossed with the Firebird logo replaced the earlier medallion version. Base model Firebird production increased to 62,621 units.\n \nThe S/E Firebirds also remained virtually unchanged as well, with 10,309 units built.\n\nThe Trans Am's basic layout was very similar to the earlier 1983 Trans Am, except they were now available with the optional RPO W62 ground effects package, previously used on the 1983 Daytona Pace Car Edition. Another new for 1984 option was the \"High-Tech\" 15-inch, 20-slot, concave aluminum wheels, painted Gold or Silver, with Black plastic centercaps containing a Gold or Silver Firebird logo. The only drivetrain changes made for the 1984 model year were the deletion of the Trans Am only EFI Crossfire 305, a hydraulic clutch was now used on the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed transmission, and on L69 equipped cars, a lightweight flywheel and an aluminum belhousing were employed. L69 equipped Trans Ams also received an 8000 RPM tachometer, an 80 PSI oil pressure gauge, a high output single electric fan, a functional cold-air induction hood, a higher output mechanical fuel pump, and a secondary electric fuel pump to help prevent vapor lock. Trans Am production increased to 55,374 units.\n\nThe RPO \"Y84\" & \"Y81\" Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E's were slightly revised. The H.O 305 L69 engine was now the only available engine. The exterior still featured a Black painted body, but gone was the Gold paint on the lower half of the body. All now featured Black painted, RPO W62 Aero package ground effects, the special \"RECARO T/A\" door handle inserts, the 1983 style Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Medallions on the sail panels, Gold painted High Tech 15-inch rims with a Black plastic center cap and Gold Firebird logo, WS6 package, functional cold air induction \"Turbo Hood\", with a Gold \"fade\" decal and Gold \"5.0 Liter H.O.\" script on the turbo hood's bulge, Gold \"TRANS AM\" decals on the fenders and right side of the rear bumper, a special 3-row Gold pinstripe that wrapped around 98% of the lower area of the car, extending up, around the wheelwells, (similar to the 2nd Generaration Y84 S/E Trans Am's pinstripes). The interior still featured its namesake Tan leather Recaro seats. Sadly, this was to be the swan song year for Pontiac's storied Black and Gold RPO \"Y84\" Trans Am S/E's... a mere 1321 Recaro T/A's were produced.\n \nFor the 15th Anniversary of the Trans Am, Pontiac released a stunning, White and Blue Trans Am, following in the original 1969 Trams Am's striking color scheme for $3499 over the base $10,699, and limited to just 1500 units. It also only utilized the H.O. 305 L69, with 1000 automatics and only 500 with the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed. The exterior featured a White painted body, T-tops, White painted RPO W62 ground effects, special Blue \"TRANS AM\" decals on the lower rear half of the doors, Blue pinstripes similar to the Recaro T/A except they extend around the entire body, special Blue and White 15th ANNIVERSARY medallions on the sail panels, a functional cold air induction \"Turbo Hood\", with a Blue \"fade\" decal and Blue \"5.0 Liter H.O.\" script on the turbo hood's bulge. The Black tinted Trans Am tail lights featured White paint on the horizontal bars, and a stunning Blue on White Firebird logo on the tail light center panel. Another special item featured only on the 15th Anniversary cars was the all new \"Aero-Tech\" 16-inch convex aluminum wheels, (front/rear specific). They wheels were painted White, with Blue pinstripes around the clear coated polished lip's outer perimeter, and were shod with Goodyear P245/50/VR16 \"Gatorback\" uni-directional tires (the new wheel/tire combo was very similar to the Corvette's P255/50/VR16 arrangement), marking the first appearance of 16 by 8-inch wheels on any F-body and a first for Pontiac. The WS6 package was standard with a 15th Anniversary Only 25&nbsp;mm rear sway bar, (as opposed to the ordinary WS6's 23&nbsp;mm bar). Interior features included: Off-White leather with grey cloth inserts Recaro seats with repeating \"TRANS AM' script on the center portions, a special Off-White Leather-wrapped steering wheel with a special Blue and White 15th medallion inset in an Off-White Horn Button, Off-White leather shifter knob and parking brake handle, and Off-White pass-side map pocket w/ a Blue Firebird logo and Blue \"TRANS AM\" script.\n\n==1985==\n\n[[File:TAside-gallery.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1985 Firebird Trans Am: Pontiac would use this 15-inch \"High Tech\" aluminum wheel pattern until 1992.]] [[File:Pontiac red Trans Am.png|200px|thumb|right|1985's benchmark makeover: restyled nose with integrated fog lights, functional hood \"nostrils\" and rear edge vents to vent unwanted engine heat out of the engine bay]]\nAll Firebird models underwent redevelopment to boost sales as a number of power train improvements were introduced. The Firebird received a restyled nose with Black wrap-around inserts known as \"bumperettes\" to replace the grille inserts; wrap-around \"bumperettes\" were also added to the rear bumper. The tail lights remained unchanged from the previous \"louvered\" style design. The carbureted V6 was replaced with a new, multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 making 135&nbsp;hp. The interior evolved with a new dash design containing redesigned gauges that used a graph-patterned background, a slightly refined dashpad, new T-handle shifter for automatics; a padded and more ergonomic center console design, updated stereo and HVAC faceplates, and an optional version of the previous year's more ergonomic 15th Anniversary's steering wheel.\n\nThe Firebird S/E underwent some changes as well. It too used the new for '85 nose and rear bumper, but it now included some new items to set it apart. It received a new special hood, similar to the new Trans Am hood except with only the front vents, the new Trans Am tail light design, color-coded Firebird logo medallions on the sail panels, (similar to the '83/'84 Recaro version), and a color-coded rear Firebird logo on the center section of the tail lights. Cloth Recaro seats were also now available.\n\nThe Recaro T/A was no longer available, but cloth Recaro seats were optional on the Trans Am.\n\nThe Trans Am also underwent changes. The LG4 & L69 continued on, but a new fuel-injected 305ci was now available in the Trans Am. The LB9 Tuned Port Injection (TPI) 305 was released, using a tuned runner design. The LB9 produced 210&nbsp;hp, which brought it suitable attention from buyers despite being unavailable with a manual transmission. The \"Turbo Bulge\" hood was discontinued in favor of a new flat hood with twin louvered vents or \"nostrils\" that were functional, with heat exhaust vents on the rear edges. The Trans Am also received a restyled nose, integral fog lights, and newly redesigned ground effects. It utilized new \"low density\" taillight lenses with a grid-style pattern rather than the \"louvered\" pattern in use since 1981. The Trans Am came standard with the \"High Tech\" 15-inch concave aluminum wheels from the previous year, but it was also now available with the a version of the 15th Anniversary's WS6 suspension and its \"Aero Tech\" 16-inch aluminum wheels, but in finished Natural Silver. A Borg-Warner 9-bolt differential was made available for the first time, and was said to be stronger than the standard corporate 10 bolt axle. Further attempts to put the Trans Am into higher regard included overhead console from the Camaro lineup, which included several manually adjusted reminder wheels, a positionable map light, a removable flashlight with \"FIREBIRD\" script, and a small pocket for a garage door opener or sunglasses. The standard rear spoiler from previous years was still standard, but an optional wrap-around \"Aero Spoiler\" was now available in black and gave the car a new more modern look, (it is unique for 1985 & 1986 as it had a texture). The Trans Am drag coefficient was measured at 0.32 but was as low as 0.29 with the standard Aero wheels instead of the High-Tech turbo aluminum wheels. At the time, it was the most aerodynamically efficient car GM ever produced.\n\n==1986==\n\nAll Firebirds received center, high-mounted stop lamps to comply with Federal legislation; these were placed on top of the back hatch window. All cars received restyled, more modern instrument gauges. New tail light lenses were now introduced on the base Firebird, completing the replacement of the \"slit\" or \"louvered\" taillight lenses that had been a Firebird signature since 1967. The 2.5L 4-cylinder engine was dropped, replaced by the multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 as the standard engine. The Firebird S/E model was discontinued at the end of the year. The rubber\u2013vinyl wrap-around rear [[wing (automotive)|wing]] became standard on Trans Am (available only in black; as these wings aged, these and those offered on subsequent model-year vehicles would suffer from cracking and splitting problems), the Wing spoiler was a credit option on the Trans Am, and mandatory if the louvered rear window was ordered. Midyear, Pontiac introduced a new light-weight, cross-lace wheel, available for the Trans Am.\n\nOnly 26 Trans Ams with the 305 H.O L69 were built in 1986; it was discontinued because of fuel vapor lock (boiling) problems. Some sources indicate the 305 TPI engine output was decreased from 210&nbsp;hp to 190&nbsp;hp, while others maintain it stayed at 210&nbsp;hp. Paint RPO's were changed to reflect the new base-coat/clear-coat paint process. American Sunroof (ASC), licensed by Chevrolet to build the 1987 Camaro convertible, also built three 1986 Trans Am convertibles as a \"design exercise\".\n\nIn spite of rumors, there were no 350 TPI L98 cars made in 1986 according to Pontiac.\n\n==1987==\nThe Firebird body remained basically unchanged. All center, high-mounted stop lamps were relocated to a new position between the spoiler and the rear deck lid, and the large Firebird hood emblem disappeared forever. All V8s now received factory roller camshafts, and faced with consumer demands for more power, GM officially released the new 5.7L with tuned port fuel injection. Available only with an automatic transmission, it produced 215&nbsp;hp and takes the top performance seat from the 5.0L TPI which was rated at 205HP. The 5.0L TPI, however, was available with a 5-speed manual transmission and, in fact, was quicker than the 5.7L TPI coupled with the automatic transmission. L69 production was stopped, leaving the LG4 as the only remaining carbureted [[V8 engine|V8]] used in the F-body. Trans Am GTA ('''G'''ran '''T'''urismo '''A'''mericano) was introduced, available with the LB9 305 TPI engine (which was returned to 205&nbsp;hp) or the L98 350 TPI. Gold 16-inch, flat-mesh, diamond-spoke wheels were standard on GTA, with 16-inch, 20-slot wheels standard on Trans Am.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1987-1992 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA Cloisonn\u00e9 Nose Emblem.jpg|thumb|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA 1987-1992 Nose Emblem]] -->\n\nFirebird Formula was re-introduced, available with a choice of V8s (LG4, LB9 305 TPI, or L98 350 TPI), 16-inch convex wheels, and the earlier Trans Am \"Turbo Bulge\" hood. The wrap-around wing was updated and now standard on Trans Am and Formula; the regular, flat-surfaced spoiler from earlier Trans Am models was now made standard on Firebird. Trans Am and Formula were also offered with an optional 140&nbsp;mph speedometer.\n\nWS6 was standard equipment on the Formula and GTA from 1987 to 1992, and optional on the Trans Am. WS6 from 1987 thru 1992 included 36&nbsp;mm front sway bars, 24&nbsp;mm rear sway bars, quick ratio steering box, gas filled struts and 16\" Wheels with 245/50R16 Tires. Later WS6 cars used ZR rated tires.\n\nThe Trans Am GTA was Pontiac's pride and joy with a standard 5.7L 350 Tuned Port Injection (TPI). Many people like to say, incorrectly, that the engine itself was pulled directly out of the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4|C4 Corvette]], which itself began using the engine in 1985, but the heads on the Corvette were aluminum whereas the Firebird heads were cast Iron, although it did give the GTA performance numbers comparable to GM's flagship performance platform from whence it came. The GTA came with a standard TH-700R4 (4L60) automatic transmission, A/C, new seats with inflatable lumbar and side bolsters, special door panels, epoxy-filled emblems, body-colored ground effects, a special GTA horn button, and the WS6 performance handling package. All of these options were packaged into the Trans Am under the RPO code Y84, and the model was produced until the end of Third Generation F-body production in 1992.\n\nDealerships could finally order a Firebird Convertible from a recognized coach builder that was already converting other GM products (though more than a dozen other companies had been converting F-bodies into convertibles since 1982 for Pontiac & Chevrolet dealers).  ASC (American Sunroof Company, Later \"American Specialty Cars\") (of ASC McLaren fame) offered Pontiac Dealerships a Firebird/Formula/Trans Am/GTA convertible. ASC was contracted to convert all of the official Camaro Convertibles from 1987 to 1992. However, due to fuel economy restrictions mandated by the EPA, a convertible Firebird would have been assessed a $1200 [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] because the LB9 & L98 when paired with a Trans Am or GTA would have been lower than 22.5 average MPG. For this reason Pontiac did not directly offer a convertible through dealers like the Camaro. However these were not an official Pontiac offering, they are considered coach convertibles. The conversion of the Firebird was identical to the \"Factory\" Camaros of the same model year. The exception was the obvious cosmetic changes, the rear quarter caps, spoiler (Which was a Base spoiler Wing cut off) and the high mount 3rd brake light were Firebird convertible specific.\n\nTo order a Firebird Convertible the dealership would order a T-top Firebird and have it Drop shipped to ASC, One Sunroof Center, Southgate, MI 48195 for the conversion alongside \"Factory\" Camaros. Once complete, ASC would ship the now Firebird convertible to the participating dealership for delivery. This remained the procedure for dealerships through the 1989 model year. According to ASC they did not convert any Firebirds for the 1990 model year. As popularity increased and car became lighter & more aerodynamic for the 1991 model year the process was simplified as Pontiac offered a convertible through normal dealer ordering channels via RPO's. A Total of 173 Firebird Convertibles were reported by ASC for 1987.\n\n==1988==\n\n[[File:88 notcback2.png|300px|thumb|left|1988 Trans Am GTA Notchback]]\nThe Firebird remained basically unchanged. The 170&nbsp;hp LG4 carbureted 5.0L V8 was dropped in favor of the new 170&nbsp;hp L03 5.0L V8 with throttle body injection. All V8 engines received serpentine belt systems and the A/C compressors were moved to the passenger's side of the engine, de-cluttering the engine compartment. The Firebird Formula received new high tech 16x8-inch aluminum wheels with distinctive silver \"WS6\" center caps. The GTA wheels were slightly restyled, and the convex 16-inch wheels were dropped as all Trans Ams received the 16x8\" diamond-spoke aluminum wheels, available in different colors (white, red, charcoal, and black) in addition to the GTA's gold. The GTA received a new steering wheel with integral radio controls. The Trans Am was made available with body-colored ground effects like those on the GTA.\n[[File:1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA.jpg|200px|thumb|right|1988 Trans Am GTA equipped with a 305 TPI V8, and rare 5-speed manual transmission.]]\nThe optional convertible model also carried over, and now optional on the GTA was a new \"notchback\" hatch: rather than the large, glass hatchback that had been common to the Third Generation Firebird, the optional notchback consisted of a fiberglass trunk lid with a small, flat, vertical glass window. The notchback also incorporated redesigned rear seatbacks with integral headrests. The notchback became popular with onlookers, who often assumed the notchback-equipped GTA was a [[Ferrari]], thereby encouraging some owners of the type to dub their GTA the \"Ferrari Back.\"  Many Trans Am owners were unaware that the $800 notchback option was even available, and for those who were, the vehicle typically had to be ordered from the factory, on a six-month waiting list, as the notchback was retrofitted to the vehicle. In rare instances, a dealership would get a notchback-equipped GTA on their lot. Another reason for the relative obscurity of the notchback is that the sales information was not very well disseminated to Pontiac salespeople, so many of them had no idea it was available as an option. As attractive as the notchback was, GTA owners were constantly plagued with structural and cosmetic issues with the design. The fiberglass would blister, causing surface bubbles resembling a bad case of acne. The Pontiac repair solutions were simply to sand the notchback down and repaint it, but the problem would always return, and GTA owners could expect multiple trips in order to achieve a final repair of the problem, or to have a new notchback installed. The notchback was intended to carry over and be standard-issue on the 1989 20th Anniversary GTA, but the plan never materialized; the aforementioned quality control issues apparently caused GM not to carry it over to the next year..\n\nASC continued to offer a Convertible for dealerships in 1988. A total of 104 Firebird Convertibles are reported from ASC for Pontiac Dealerships.\n\nTrans Am GTA production figures\nUS:9765 Canadian:1261\n\n==1989==\n\n[[File:20th Anniversary TransAm Convertible One of 2.png|thumb|right|'''1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am Convertible (TTA)''' Oddly, Pontiac Motor Division had this first TTA convertible built on spec by influencing a Pontiac dealer to order it.<ref>Heasley, Jerry \"Vroom with a View; 1989 Turbo Trans Am Pace Car...convertible?\" ''Muscle Car Review'' February 1990: p.64. Print</ref> Two were reportedly built, one with Leather, one with cloth.]]\n1989 was the biggest year for Pontiac with respect to press coverage, promotions, and performance. It was not well known at the time, but in 1989, Pontiac produced the quickest<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Csere, Csaba \"20th Anniversary Pontiac Trans Am; Gentlemen, light your tires\" ''Car and Driver'' June 1989 Print</ref> and fastest<ref>''Motor Trend'', June 1989-Volume 41 Number 6 pp. 42\u201347, 50, 54</ref> American production car. The \"Excitement Division\" was also asked to provide a car to pace the 73rd running of the [[Indianapolis 500]]; sadly, it would be the final time a Pontiac would ever receive that honor. The Trans Am model was now 20 years old, and it was time for another anniversary edition, with this special 20th Anniversary Trans Am to be based on the existing Trans Am GTA. Through a unique partnership between Pontiac and an engineering firm called Prototype Automotive Services (PAS), the Trans Am GTA was equipped with a more powerful version of the [[Buick V6 engine#LD5|turbocharged Buick 3.8L V6]], originally developed for the [[Buick Regal#Grand National, T-Type and GNX|Buick Regal Grand National]], and the Turbo Trans Am (TTA) became the vehicle Pontiac supplied to pace the Indianapolis 500. Ultimately, 1,555 TTA replicas, rated at 250&nbsp;hp, were produced for sale, five of those being test cars. But after ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine tested the car, logging a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph run in 4.6 seconds, and a standing quarter-mile in 13.4 seconds at 101&nbsp;mph, they called the 250&nbsp;hp rating \"exceedingly modest,\" estimating the actual output to be \"closer to 300&nbsp;hp.\" They also subsequently reported that it was the \"quickest 0\u201360 sprinter available in any US production-car showroom \u2013 at any price.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Car and Driver'' evaluation produced the best acceleration performance of any mainstream publication to test a regular TTA press car from the Pontiac fleet, partly because ''Car and Driver'' realized that the turbo boost must be \"preloaded\" to get maximum performance figures. But short-distance sprinting was not all this car could do well. Early in 1989, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' ran their top speed test article \"Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel.\"  During this test, the TTA did 162&nbsp;mph, and was the fastest production car evaluated in the test. However, ''Motor Trend'' declared the winner to be a 1989 [[Chevrolet Corvette C4#ZR-1 (1990-95)|Corvette ZR-1]], which went much faster, but was not a production car (it was a prototype that Chevrolet intended to release for production in 1989, but did not come out until 1990).<ref>\"Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel.\" ''Motor Trend'' June 1989-Volume 41 Number 6: pp. 42\u201347, 50, 54. Print</ref>  So by a slight technicality, the TTA could be called the flat-out quickest (0\u201360 4.6 sec.) and fastest (162&nbsp;mph) American production car in 1989. The only constraint on the top speed of 162&nbsp;mph was that the TTA was being limited by the engine [[redline]] and automatic transmission (with which all TTA's were equipped). When PAS installed a ZF 6-speed manual transmission into one of the cars, they were able to reach 181&nbsp;mph.<ref>\"Pontiac Playthings\" ''High Performance Pontiac'' December 1989: pp.19\u201322. Print</ref> Perhaps more importantly than the performance tests provided by the industry magazines was the fact that these cars were capable of much faster acceleration times \u2013 with minimal modifications. In fact, with $300 in new parts installed, 12.5-second quarter-mile runs were achievable \u2013 without manually shifting gears or the need to trailer the vehicle to the track!  Because of this, the TTA has gained a cult following among amateur racing enthusiasts.\n\nPontiac sub-contracted the job of engineering the TTA engine modifications to PAS. The narrow engine bay of the Trans Am required the use of different [[cylinder heads]], which happened to have better flow characteristics than the old Buick heads. Special stainless steel [[Exhaust manifold|headers]] were made specifically for the project as well. The heads, headers, along with more refined tuning of the boost and fuel curves, all added up to a more powerful package than the older Buicks. PAS was also in charge of testing and assembling the engines. Most TTA's came with T-tops and leather interior, but there were also hardtops and cloth-interior cars. And every TTA had an automatic transmission \u2013 the TH200-4R, equipped with overdrive and a torque converter clutch. The three actual pace cars were randomly selected from the production run, and sent to Indianapolis to pace the race. Thus, the pace car replicas were closer to the actual pace cars than any replica previously offered; the only difference between the replicas and the three actual pace cars was the addition of strobe lights and safety equipment to the latter. In addition, the TTA was relatively economical to drive; it returned 24&nbsp;mpg on the highway, while the only cars (besides the [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] [[Lotus Esprit#Turbo and S3 Esprits (1980)|Esprit Turbo SE]]) that could approach its performance at the time ([[Ferrari]]s, [[Lamborghini]]s, etc.) were far more costly, and providing only around 10 to 12&nbsp;mpg. As has been proven to be the case in subsequent years, relying on a small engine for cruising, and a turbocharger for power, provides an exciting driving experience while returning impressive fuel mileage.\n[[File:1989 Pontiac Trans Am Firebird GTA.png|thumb|right|1989 Trans Am GTA]]\n\nThe rarest 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Ams are the hardtops and convertibles. Only 40 hardtops were made. Only three convertible TTA's were built by ASC,<ref>Heasley, Jerry \"Vroom With a View; 1989 Turbo Trans Am Pace Car...convertible?\" ''Muscle Car Review'' February 1990: p.65</ref><ref>Pontiac Historic Services, Letter signed by Jim Mattison, September 21, 2007</ref> one of which was bought by the president of PAS, with the other two falling into private hands. Only two are generally known to exist, however, as the ASC order log shows records for only two TTA convertibles.<ref>American Specialty Cars Inc. Firebird order log, August 21, 1989</ref>  The five test TTA's, because they were for pre-production use, were pulled off of the assembly line without regard to color, and therefore were not necessarily white. At least two of these test cars were sold to private individuals, so there are at least two extremely rare, non-white, factory TTA's in existence; in fact, one is known to be red.\n\nAs for the rest of the Firebird line, GM made a new dual [[catalytic converter]] exhaust system (RPO code N10) available, freeing up 13% more power from some LB9- and L98-equipped Formulas and Trans Ams; so equipped, LB9 engine output was increased to 225&nbsp;hp while the L98 increased to 235&nbsp;hp. The N10 option remained available throughout the balance of the Third Generation production run, however the L98 powerplant was only available with an automatic transmission, whereas the LB9/N10 combination could only be coupled to a 5-speed manual (RPO code MM5) and a [[Limited slip differential|limited-slip differential]] (RPO code G80) using a 3.45 performance [[Gear ratio|axle ratio]] (RPO code GM3). According to a March 1990 (Vol. 35, No. 9) ''Car and Driver'' article, when the latter set of options were combined into the relatively unassuming (and 300-pounds-lighter) Formula body, which shared the same WS6 suspension with the top-end Trans Am GTA, it created a \"[[Sleeper (car)|sleeper]]\" Firebird that could out-perform the heavier Trans Am GTA (even when equipped with the L98 engine) \u2013 at a roughly 30% lower sticker price.  ''Car and Driver'' also reported that (aside from the TTA, offered only in 1989) these \"sleeper\" Formulas were the fastest Third-Generation Firebirds \u2013 capable of accelerating from 0\u201360&nbsp;mph in under 7 seconds and boasting a top speed of more than {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (quite impressive for the day). Although not an exhaustive comparison, these claims would seem to be supported by a simple examination of the [[power-to-weight ratio|weight-to-power ratios]] of both models: a 225&nbsp;hp Formula at a [[curb weight]] of {{convert|3300|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} versus a 235&nbsp;hp Trans Am GTA at a curb weight of {{convert|3600|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}; the weight-to-power ratio for the Formula is 14.67&nbsp;lb/hp compared to 15.32&nbsp;lb/hp for the Trans Am GTA. According to the same ''Car and Driver'' article, very few of these \"sleeper\" Formulas hit the streets; only about 50 were built each model year, as almost all LB9-equipped Formulas came with an automatic transmission \u2013 which disqualified them from receiving the high-performance N10 and GM3 options.\n\nFirebirds optioned with T-tops received new [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] plastic tops made by Leximar for GM. The new tops were lighter in weight and tinted darker, but were more dome shaped and aged rapidly. GM replaced many sets with tops made of glass under warranty, but the acrylic tops continued as standard-issue through 1992. All Firebirds optioned with rear disc brakes now received PBR brake calipers and larger brake rotors, which resolved issues encountered with previous-model rear discs and increased stopping power. Introduction of GM's '''V'''ehicle '''A'''nti '''T'''heft '''S'''ystem (VATS) or PASS-Key made all Firebirds more theft-resistant. The system was adapted from GM's higher-end Corvette and [[Cadillac]] vehicles in response to an escalating trend among car thieves to target the Camaro and Firebird. VATS incorporated a small resistor into the ignition key shaft which was read by a sensor when the key was inserted. VATS-equipped cars also displayed anti-theft system warning decals in the lower rear corners of the side windows. A new CD player was offered, shoulder belts were added in the back seat, and the convertible model carried over.\n\n[[File:1989 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA Turbo t-top 20th anniv Indy Pace Car.jpg|thumb|right|1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am (TTA)]]\n\n'''TTA production figures:'''\n\n* 1,323 T-Top & Leather Interior\n* 187 T-Top & Cloth Interior\n* 24 Hardtop & Leather Interior\n* 15 Hardtop & Cloth Interior (Base)\n* 3 Test Cars / T-Top & Cloth Interior\n* 1 ASC Convertible Leather int\n* 1 Test Car / ASC Convertible Cloth int\n* 1 Test Car / Hardtop & Leather Interior\n\nASC continued to make Convertibles for Pontiac dealerships. A total of 330 Convertibles were reported by ASC. A portion of those were 350 powered Convertibles. NOTE: 1989 was the First year a '''US''' Dealership could order T-top and a 350 Engine in a firebird. Since all Convertibles started as a CC1 (T-Top) car and converted by ASC 1989 would also be the only year to get a 350 powered third generation Firebird convertible.\n\n'''1989 Firebird [[Convertible (car)|Convertible]] production figures From 1989 ASC order logs'''\n* '''2''' \u2013 TURBO TRANS AM (V6 Turbo)\n* '''144''' \u2013 GTA or Trans Am -w/L98 (350 TPI)\n* '''43''' \u2013 FORMULA 350 \u2013 w/L98 (350 TPI)\n* 9 \u2013 GTA or Trans Am LB9 \"F\" (305 TPI)\n* 17 \u2013 FORMULA \u2013 W/LB9 (305 TPI)\n* 4 \u2013 Trans Am LO3 \"E\" (305 TBI)\n* 57 \u2013 Firebird or Formula \u2013 W/LO3 (305 TBI)\n* 37 \u2013 Firebird \u2013 W/LB8 (2.8L V6)\n* 10 \u2013 Exported, and trim was not able to be determined\n* 4 \u2013 Trim was not able to be determined\n* 5 - Not Listed in Dealer Order Logs \n\n\u2013 - \u2013\nASC Reported a total of 330 Firebird Convertibles in 1989, \n\nInformation comes from 1989 ASC Order log, the Order log show only 324 of the reported 330 convertibles, as of June 2018, three of those missing 6 vehicles have been identified and added to the above data.

The Firebird interior again received a re-design, this time the changes were much less drastic: the lower dash and under-dash panels were altered, and accessory switches were moved to a new panel above the heater and radio controls. The deluxe contoured interior door panels that were standard in GTAs and available in Trans Ams were no longer available. All models would have to make do with the rather crude, flat, carpeted door panels, although if leather seats were ordered, genuine perforated leather was added above the armrest on the basic door panels. In GTAs the cheap door panels looked very out of place next to the exotic looking articulating seats. The console got a new shift indicator. This time, there was actually a needle to indicate what gear you had selected. Previously, you just had to line up the shifter handle with the markings. Steering wheel mounted radio controls disappeared from the GTA (due to the addition of the airbag), and the L98 engine was no longer offered in the T-top cars due to fuel economy regulations. The LB9 and L98 platforms were updated with new speed density fuel injection, and the elimination of the MAF sensor reduced production costs and supposedly improved performance. All L98-equipped cars now received the N10 dual catalytic converters as standard, which technically was a mid year change for 1989.\n\nLike the Camaro, the 1990 Firebird only received a half-year production run, as Pontiac labored to release the re-styled 1991 model. Production ceased on December 31, 1989.\n\nASC reported making no Firebird Convertibles for 1990.\n\n==1991==\n\n[[File:1991 Pontiac Firebird.jpg|200px|thumb|right|1991 Firebird with re-styled nose.]]\n[[File:91 green camel.png|250px|thumb|left|Trans Am Convertible's with Camel leather had GTA wheels and seats standard. There were no GTA convertibles from 1991 on.]]\nAll Firebirds received re-styled noses loosely fashioned after the \"Banshee IV\" show car while Pontiac was developing the all-new Fourth Generation platform. The Trans Am's ground effects were re-styled as well, and were made available on the base model Firebird, but NA on the Formula. The Trans Am and Firebird Formula received a new fiberglass-constructed, flat, wrap-around wing, The Trans Am and GTA received updated two-piece tail lights with \"PONTIAC\" scripted in orange across the panels, and the center, high-mounted stop lamps were moved to inside the top edge of the rear hatch.\n\nThe FORMULA was the only third Gen F-body to get to T-tops with a 350 Engine starting in MID year 1991 & 1992, to get a FORMULA 350 T-top car the black cross laced wheels (as installed on the Trans AM) were mandatory.\n\nDue to its lighter weight and improved aerodynamics the Firebird Convertible was finally available through GM's normal ordering procedures. ASC still converted T-top cars into convertibles but the ordering process was simplified and dealers would no longer need to have the cars drop shipped to ASC in Michigan. The Convertibles were offered with one of three engine options: LHO 3.1L V6, the L03 5.0L V8 for the base Firebird, or the LB9 5.0L [[V8 engine|V8]] Trans Am only.\n\nAn improvement on the T-top cars was introduced mid year on all F-bodies. T-top cars now came with new seals which greatly reduced leaks into the passenger compartment.\n\nBeginning in 1991, SLP (Street Legal Performance) modified a factory-built Formula into what they called the \"'''Firehawk'''\". Once a Formula had been ordered or purchased, this limited-availability option (RPO code B4U) could be specified, and the vehicle was sent to SLP to be modified. No two cars SLP produced were alike; they all were special orders. SLP had anticipated making 250 of these special Firebird Formulas, but in fact, only 27 were ordered; and of those, only 25 were ever built (numbered 1\u201325 for hardtops \u2013 with numbers 18 and 23 never being built \u2013 and the only Firehawk Convertible was numbered 27 which was the only non-formula). Of those 25 Firehawks, 21 were \"Mandatory\" Red, 1 Aqua, 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green; 11 had the Competition Package, 3 came with Aluminum Engine Blocks, 1 had T-Tops, and 1 was a Convertible.\n\n'''FIREHAWK SPECIFICATIONS'''\n\n'''Standard Features''': $39,995\n* SLP modified 350 engine rated at 350&nbsp;hp @ 5500&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|390|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} @ 4400&nbsp;rpm\n* 17\"X9.5\" Ronal alloy wheels with [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk SZ P275/40/ZR17 tires\n* ZF 6-speed [[manual transmission]] with carbon fiber clutch\n* Stainless Steel catalytic converter and exhaust system\n* A [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44 rear axle with 3.54:1 Posi-gears\n* Special Firehawk badging, decals and numbered plaque\n\n'''Competition Package''': $9,995\n* Cross-drilled 13 in Brembo Ferrari F-40 brakes\n* Full roll cage minus the back seat\n* Aluminum hood\n* Recaro racing seats with full harnesses by Simpson and rear seat delete.\n\n'''Engine''':\n* 4-bolt main engine block\n* Forged steel crankshaft\n* 1053 alloy, forged steel \"Pink\" connecting rods\n* Light-weight, high-silicon, cast aluminum pistons\n* Steel billet hydraulic roller camshaft\n* High-output aluminum cylinder heads with stainless steel valves\n* Port injection intake manifold designed by Ray Falconer\n\n'''Performance''':(according to SLP brochure)\n*Weight-to-power ratio: 9.7&nbsp;lb per hp\n*Acceleration (0 to 60&nbsp;mph): 4.6 seconds\n*Quarter mile: 13.2 seconds @ {{convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Top speed: {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Skid pad: 0.88g on full tread\n\n'''Motor Trend test results''':<ref>Ross, Daniel Charlton \"Pontiac Formula Firehawk; The Genie in the Bottle Delivers\" ''Motor Trend'' December 1991: pp. 50\u201352.

Release of the Fourth Generation model was imminent, and Pontiac made few changes to the 1992 Firebird. The special edition Formula Firehawk that appeared in 1991 was still available, although a lot of dealers were unaware of its existence. The lack of awareness and a sky high price tag conspired to keep the sales figures down on the special Firehawk. As for the rest of the line, new exterior colors were available, including a bright \"Jamaica Yellow\". One interior color was changed, from the camel colored beechwood to a greyish beige. Convertibles were still available. One improvement made on all 1992 F-bodies was the addition of some extra bonding agents to stiffen the structure of the cars. The extra bonding was an attempt to correct squeaks and rattles that some owners had complained about. This also allowed GM to experiment with some of the new technologies which were to be implemented on the fourth generation cars. Mid-year, TPI-equipped cars only received blank throttle body plates rather than ones that had been marked \"TUNED PORT INJECTION\" on similar engines in prior model years; and black-painted valve covers replaced the silver components from previous years. As use of the L98 in the Corvette had come to an end, rough-cast runners found their way into L98-equipped Firebirds, and some cars received special rubber snubbers on the rear hatch frame that were designed to make the hatch more stable. This would be the last year for the light weight deep dish cross-laced wheels that had been available since 1987, and had been styled to look like expensive aftermarket rims. It would be the last year for the GTA, the last year for concealed windshield wipers, and the last year for the aerodynamic body with the long hood and low roofline. It was also the last year for full leather covering on the front seats. Some GTA's ended up with drum brakes on the rear, presumably because of a shortage of disc brake parts. Buyers were compensated for the downgrade. Ultimately, very few Trans Ams, GTA's, and Formulas were produced in this model year, as most buyers were waiting for the next-generation models.\n\nGTA production figures:\n*USA: 226\n*Canada:48\n\n==Engines==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||90%;\"\n| 1982|| rowspan=\"4\" | [[GM Iron Duke engine|{{convert|151|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac]]<br>Throttle Body Injection I4 || rowspan=\"3\" | [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Longitudinal|{{convert|173|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} \"X\"]] 2-barrel V6 || rowspan=\"6\" | [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|{{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Chevrolet]] 4-barrel V8 || rowspan=\"2\" | [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|{{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Chevrolet]] Cross-Fire Injection V8<br>(first year for fuel injection in Trans Am) || || rowspan=\"7\" |\n|-\n| 1983|| {{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Chevrolet 4-barrel H.O.

These were also the first Firebirds with factory fuel injection, four-speed [[automatic transmission]]s, five-speed manual transmissions, four-cylinder engines, 16-inch wheels, and [[hatchback]] bodies.<ref name=\"new\">{{cite web |url=http://www.camaro3rdgen.20m.com/1982.html |title=1982 Camaro |accessdate=2010-10-10 |publisher=camaro3rdgen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415003743/http://www.camaro3rdgen.20m.com/1982.html |archivedate=April 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==1982==\n\nThe 3rd Generation of Firebirds consisted of three models: Firebird, Firebird S/E, and Firebird Trans Am. The Firebird was the base model, equivalent to the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Camaro Sport Coupe]]; the Firebird S/E was the luxury version; and the Trans Am, the high-performance version. For 1982, the new Firebird and Camaro had been completely restyled, with the windshield slope set at a dramatic, more aerodynamic 62 degrees,<ref>Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition (Motorbooks International, 1992) p.149</ref> (about 3 degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), flush mounted side glass, and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated rear [[hatchback]]. Electronically controlled retractable headlamps, and a rounded hoodline and front fenders were the primary characteristics that distinguished the Firebird from its Camaro sibling and its previous Firebird incarnations. The Firebird would retain hidden headlamps until the end of all production in 2002. Pontiac had also hoped to drop the \"Trans Am\" moniker from the redesigned cars to save royalties paid to the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] for use of the name. Early promotional cars were marked \"T/A\" as an alternative, however it was decided that doing so might cause more problems than it was worth and the \"Trans Am\" nameplate remained. Still, with its dimensions reduced, wheelbase shortened, and weight reduced, the Third Generation Firebird was also the closest yet in size to the original 1967 model. It won \"Best Sports GT\" category in the $11,000 to $14,000 range (also along with the Camaro). Road & Track called the fuel-injected Trans Am \"a dramatic improvement on its predecessors,\" accelerating from 0\u201360 in 9.2 seconds.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition (Motorbooks International, 1992) p.152</ref>\n\nThe new Firebird shrank to a 101-inch wheelbase, losing more than 8&nbsp;inches in overall length, measured about an inch narrower, and weighed nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than its 1981 predecessor. It also was the most aerodynamic production Firebird to date with a drag coefficient of 0.33. The new Trans Am took things a bit further, with a coefficient of .32.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition(Motorbooks International, 1992) p. 150</ref> The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 would be the most aerodynamic vehicle to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The retractable headlamps popped up from the leading edge of the hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided {{convert|30.9|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}. of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Standard Catalog of Firebird 1967\u20132002'' (Krause Publications, 2002) p. 97</ref> It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.\nThe front end of the vehicle featured {{convert|10.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} power disc brakes and were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a Firebird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower front control arms. In the rear, coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions tailshaft to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.\n\nThe interior now featured aircraft inspired details and gauges, using both fake and real Torx head screws that fastened the dash and console trim panels. Optional Recaro seats were offered. The 1981, non-Formula 3 spoke steering wheel was re-used and featured a Firebird logo mounted in the center of the horn pad, with optional leather grip. Many power options could be had. Special Viscount \"PMD\" bucket seats were optional, featuring a small opening in the headrest and a PMD logo in the center of the backrest. Leather seats were also available on both the standard seats and Viscount \"PMD\" seats. A standard locking rear glovebox was mounted on the rear driver\"s side of the cargo area and a mini spare tire was hidden behind the opposite panel on the passenger side. A lockable cargo door on the rear floor area and a retractable cargo area privacy shade were also available as options on all Firebirds.\n\nThe Firebird lineup was available with several engines:\n\n# The standard fuel-injected 90&nbsp;hp 2.5L 4-cylinder Pontiac \"Iron Duke\": This marked the first time a 4-cylinder engine was offered in the Firebird and was the last true Pontiac engine to be offered in the Firebird. This engine was only offered for the first few years of the generation. It provided almost the same power as the V6, but when coupled with the 5-speed manual transmission, provided between 31 and 34 miles per gallon on the highway, depending on the year.<ref>fueleconomy.gov \"Find a Car; 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 Firebird 2.5L 5-speed fuel economy Official EPA Window Sticker MPG\" Web. July 4, 2010</ref> \n# There was a carbureted 102&nbsp;hp 2.8L V6.\n# The LG4 5.0L: Utilizing GM's improved \"Computer Command Control\" system, the computer assisted E4ME carburetor, and computer controlled distributor, this Chevy 305ci produced 145&nbsp;hp and 240Lbs.Ft. of torque.\n# The LU5 5.0L: The new high-performance \"Crossfire Fuel Injection\" 5.0L V8, which employed a twin throttle body fuel injection system similar to that used in the 1982 Corvette's \"Crossfire\" 5.7L, and produced 165&nbsp;hp.\n\nThe Firebird came standard with 14-inch steel wheels, with several wheel options available unique to the base model. 14-inch turbo cast aluminum wheels were standard on the S/E and Trans Am models and featured smooth plastic hubcaps with a Pontiac \"Arrowhead\" in the center. The WS6 performance package option, available on the S/E and Trans Am, included 4-wheel disc brakes, P215/65R15 Goodyear Eagle GT radials with 15-inch cast aluminum wheels, stiffer springs, thicker 32&nbsp;mm front & 21&nbsp;mm rear sway bars, a 12.7:1 quick-ratio steering box, and limited slip rear differential. Also available was the WS7 option, which was the same as RPO WS6, but utilized rear drum brake. This option was created due to a shortage of rear disc brake components.<ref>Gunnel, John ''Standard Catalog of Firebird 1967\u20132002'' (Krause Publications, 2002) pp. 99\u2013101</ref>\n \nThe Firebird S/E was Pontiac's attempt to lure buyers interested in more luxury features; it could be had with the basic fuel saving \"Iron Duke\" I-4 drivetrain, but offered more options. Even the Trans Am's WS6 suspension was available on the S/E. It was delineated from the base Firebird model by \"S/E\" script on the sail panels, in place of the standard Firebird decals, and the Trans Am's dark tinted tail lights. The interior featured color-coded plastics to match the exterior/interior paint scheme. On S/E models equipped with the 14-inch or 15-inch \"Turbocast\" rims, with \"Bowling Ball\" hubcaps were color-coded to match the car's exterior paint.\n\nThe Trans Am came standard with a new incarnation of its traditional \"Air Extractors\" on the fenders. A dark-tinted version of the base Firebird's tail lights were fitted to the rear of the car and also featured a Silver or Gold \"Phoenix\" between them. Rubber \"Mini-Spats\" (stone deflectors) were mounted just before the front and rear wheels, and were toned down from the 70's design used on the earlier 2nd Gen Trans Am. Styled loosely after the earlier '80/'81 Turbo Trans Am, an optional \"Turbo Bulge\" hood was available on the Trans Am. Plans had originally been made to use a refined version of Pontiac's Turbo 4.9L engine. It was scrapped at the last minute, leaving many to speculate as to what could have been, had the engine been allowed to survive like its turbocharged companion, the Buick Turbo 3.8L [[V6]]. Despite this, the Turbo Bulge hood remained on the option list; on the Crossfire V-8, it was made functional, and even a lightweight aluminum version of this hood, \"RPO T45\", was available on the option list. It was a curved piece of pressed steel, and would be used in later years as the centerpiece of the Formula option. A new, smaller \"Phoenix\" was placed upon the Turbo Bulge hood or on the nose of flat hood equipped T/A's. The Trans Am came standard with one of the two 305 Chevy V8s. The well worn Borg-Warner four-speed manual transmission came mated only to the weak 145&nbsp;bhp LG4 305ci, while the Crossfire-injected LU5 305ci rated at 165&nbsp;hp came with the TH-200c automatic 3-speed transmission.  [[File:KITT1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A black Pontiac Firebird Trans Am built to mimic [[KITT]] from the TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.]]  \n\nThe new version of the Trans Am Pontiac's \"RPO Y84\" Black and Gold Trans Am S/E, made famous by [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Jackie Gleason]] in 1977's \"[[Smokey and the Bandit]]\", carried on into 1982 as the limited edition \"Recaro T/A\". The package added about 25% to the price of a Trans Am. Standard with a host of options, some features included charcoal Parella cloth Recaro seats, t-tops, a black exterior with gold trim, and black \"Bowling Ball\" hubcaps with special Gold Pontiac Arrowhead emblems on its center, mounted on gold-painted 15-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nAnother Special Trans Am also returned: the Daytona 500 Pace Car Edition. These models are quite rare, and much is still unknown about how many were built or how they were optioned. All were bright red, with special NASCAR decals, similar to both the 1981 Daytona Pace Car and the 1983 Daytona Pace Car. 15\" Aero Rims adorned with Black Bowling Ball hubcaps and a WS6 suspension. All had a black interior; it is not known if they included black Recaro seats. As it was Pontiac's debut of the still-fresh 3rd Generation 1982 Trans Am, it is possible that they would have been optioned with many of Pontiac's best amenities; however few are known to still exist at this time. Therefore, it is hard to ascertain what options they actually came with. These cars are featured in 1982 Daytona 500 race footage and in various advertisements.\n\nA modified black third gen 1982 Firebird Trans Am appeared in the new for 1982 television series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' as [[KITT]], voiced by [[William Daniels]], KARR, KITT's very evil twin voiced by [[Peter Cullen]], later [[Paul Frees]] in the original series in Seasons 1 and Seasons 3 of the original NBC TV  show Knight Rider was also a Modified Pontiac Firebird Trans AM as well.  For the reunion movie ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'', KITT underwent a makeover and became the \"Knight Industries 4000,\" a vehicle resembling the [[Pontiac Banshee]] concept car, but it was actually built using a Dodge Stealth and not a Firebird Trans Am.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jayohrberg.com/Knight_Rider_2000.html |title=Knight Rider 2000 - Jay Ohrberg's Hollywood Cars |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==1983==\n\nThe Firebird remained basically unchanged from the previous model year. All automatic transmission Firebirds now received a T-handle shifter knob, and the shift indicator changed for the Automatic Overdrive 700-R4. Midyear, the L69 high output 305 was introduced. This carbureted 190&nbsp;hp V8 was virtually identical to the L69 engine in the Camaro Z28, but used a different air cleaner assembly (instead of the Camaro's dual-snorkel air cleaner, the Trans Am received yet another functional cold air intake, designed to utilize the bulged hood).\n\nThe S/E Firebirds remained primarily the same outside of some color changes from the 1982 model year.\n\nThe RPO \"Y84\" Recaro Edition Trans Am or \"Recaro T/A\", was revised for 1983. It was now built to the owner's tastes, including many more, or less options, and RPO \"Y81\" returned as the Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E without T-Tops. The LG4 was standard as was the WS6 package. The exterior remained virtually the same, except now the Firebird logo decals on the sail panels were replaced with Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Logo Medallions. The interior now featured Tan leather Recaro seats, carpeting, side panels, and the headliner.\n\nIn its second year, the third generation Trans Am was again selected as the [[Daytona 500]] [[Pace Car]], and Pontiac offered a total of 2,500 Daytona Pace Car replicas through their dealerships. \nThe exterior was painted with a two-tone white/charcoal paint scheme, \"Official Pace Car\" decals on the doors, \"NASCAR\" decals on the rear quarter panels, and \"PONTIAC\" decals on the front windshield and rear glass. \nDecorating the front fenders just above the \"TRANS AM\" script were \"25th ANNIVERSARY DAYTONA 500\" emblems. \nA new graphic adorned the power bulge of the pace car's hood, and these limited-edition cars were the first to feature a special RPO W62, full-body ground-effects package that extended around the entire car and molded plastic panels.\n\"TRANS AM\" script appeared on the right-hand panel, in place of the standard Firebird nose grilles. \nTwo different set of wheels were offered: 1) 15-inch \"AERO\" wheels with White \"Bowling Ball\" hub caps, or 2) silver-finned wheels.\nThe interior featured red gauge lighting, leather clad steering wheel, shifter knob, and brake handle, a special dash plaque, \"Daytona 500\" floor-mats, and two-tone grey leather/suede Recaro seats.\n1,980 of these pace cars came with the LU5 Crossfire-injected 305 mated to the new 700R4 4-speed overdrive automatic; 520 had the carbureted LG4 305, mated to the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed manual.\n\n==1984==\n\nTotal production for Firebird models increased to 128,304 units, making this the best-selling year of the 3rd Generation Firebird.\n \nThe Firebird's interior options and design remained virtually unchanged for 1984, the only exceptions being a slightly revised dashpad, with screwed-in speaker grilles, an optional driver's knee pad bolster on the left side of the center console for manual cars, the T-tops were also redesigned to use a pin-mounting arrangement, rather than the earlier latch-based setup, and a new 1 piece horncap embossed with the Firebird logo replaced the earlier medallion version. Base model Firebird production increased to 62,621 units.\n \nThe S/E Firebirds also remained virtually unchanged as well, with 10,309 units built.\n\nThe Trans Am's basic layout was very similar to the earlier 1983 Trans Am, except they were now available with the optional RPO W62 ground effects package, previously used on the 1983 Daytona Pace Car Edition. Another new for 1984 option was the \"High-Tech\" 15-inch, 20-slot, concave aluminum wheels, painted Gold or Silver, with Black plastic centercaps containing a Gold or Silver Firebird logo. The only drivetrain changes made for the 1984 model year were the deletion of the Trans Am only EFI Crossfire 305, a hydraulic clutch was now used on the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed transmission, and on L69 equipped cars, a lightweight flywheel and an aluminum belhousing were employed. L69 equipped Trans Ams also received an 8000 RPM tachometer, an 80 PSI oil pressure gauge, a high output single electric fan, a functional cold-air induction hood, a higher output mechanical fuel pump, and a secondary electric fuel pump to help prevent vapor lock. Trans Am production increased to 55,374 units.\n\nThe RPO \"Y84\" & \"Y81\" Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E's were slightly revised. The H.O 305 L69 engine was now the only available engine. The exterior still featured a Black painted body, but gone was the Gold paint on the lower half of the body. All now featured Black painted, RPO W62 Aero package ground effects, the special \"RECARO T/A\" door handle inserts, the 1983 style Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Medallions on the sail panels, Gold painted High Tech 15-inch rims with a Black plastic center cap and Gold Firebird logo, WS6 package, functional cold air induction \"Turbo Hood\", with a Gold \"fade\" decal and Gold \"5.0 Liter H.O.\" script on the turbo hood's bulge, Gold \"TRANS AM\" decals on the fenders and right side of the rear bumper, a special 3-row Gold pinstripe that wrapped around 98% of the lower area of the car, extending up, around the wheelwells, (similar to the 2nd Generaration Y84 S/E Trans Am's pinstripes). The interior still featured its namesake Tan leather Recaro seats. Sadly, this was to be the swan song year for Pontiac's storied Black and Gold RPO \"Y84\" Trans Am S/E's... a mere 1321 Recaro T/A's were produced.\n \nFor the 15th Anniversary of the Trans Am, Pontiac released a stunning, White and Blue Trans Am, following in the original 1969 Trams Am's striking color scheme for $3499 over the base $10,699, and limited to just 1500 units. It also only utilized the H.O. 305 L69, with 1000 automatics and only 500 with the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed. The exterior featured a White painted body, T-tops, White painted RPO W62 ground effects, special Blue \"TRANS AM\" decals on the lower rear half of the doors, Blue pinstripes similar to the Recaro T/A except they extend around the entire body, special Blue and White 15th ANNIVERSARY medallions on the sail panels, a functional cold air induction \"Turbo Hood\", with a Blue \"fade\" decal and Blue \"5.0 Liter H.O.\" script on the turbo hood's bulge. The Black tinted Trans Am tail lights featured White paint on the horizontal bars, and a stunning Blue on White Firebird logo on the tail light center panel. Another special item featured only on the 15th Anniversary cars was the all new \"Aero-Tech\" 16-inch convex aluminum wheels, (front/rear specific). They wheels were painted White, with Blue pinstripes around the clear coated polished lip's outer perimeter, and were shod with Goodyear P245/50/VR16 \"Gatorback\" uni-directional tires (the new wheel/tire combo was very similar to the Corvette's P255/50/VR16 arrangement), marking the first appearance of 16 by 8-inch wheels on any F-body and a first for Pontiac. The WS6 package was standard with a 15th Anniversary Only 25&nbsp;mm rear sway bar, (as opposed to the ordinary WS6's 23&nbsp;mm bar). Interior features included: Off-White leather with grey cloth inserts Recaro seats with repeating \"TRANS AM' script on the center portions, a special Off-White Leather-wrapped steering wheel with a special Blue and White 15th medallion inset in an Off-White Horn Button, Off-White leather shifter knob and parking brake handle, and Off-White pass-side map pocket w/ a Blue Firebird logo and Blue \"TRANS AM\" script.\n\n==1985==\n\n[[File:TAside-gallery.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1985 Firebird Trans Am: Pontiac would use this 15-inch \"High Tech\" aluminum wheel pattern until 1992.]] [[File:Pontiac red Trans Am.png|200px|thumb|right|1985's benchmark makeover: restyled nose with integrated fog lights, functional hood \"nostrils\" and rear edge vents to vent unwanted engine heat out of the engine bay]]\nAll Firebird models underwent redevelopment to boost sales as a number of power train improvements were introduced. The Firebird received a restyled nose with Black wrap-around inserts known as \"bumperettes\" to replace the grille inserts; wrap-around \"bumperettes\" were also added to the rear bumper. The tail lights remained unchanged from the previous \"louvered\" style design. The carbureted V6 was replaced with a new, multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 making 135&nbsp;hp. The interior evolved with a new dash design containing redesigned gauges that used a graph-patterned background, a slightly refined dashpad, new T-handle shifter for automatics; a padded and more ergonomic center console design, updated stereo and HVAC faceplates, and an optional version of the previous year's more ergonomic 15th Anniversary's steering wheel.\n\nThe Firebird S/E underwent some changes as well. It too used the new for '85 nose and rear bumper, but it now included some new items to set it apart. It received a new special hood, similar to the new Trans Am hood except with only the front vents, the new Trans Am tail light design, color-coded Firebird logo medallions on the sail panels, (similar to the '83/'84 Recaro version), and a color-coded rear Firebird logo on the center section of the tail lights. Cloth Recaro seats were also now available.\n\nThe Recaro T/A was no longer available, but cloth Recaro seats were optional on the Trans Am.\n\nThe Trans Am also underwent changes. The LG4 & L69 continued on, but a new fuel-injected 305ci was now available in the Trans Am. The LB9 Tuned Port Injection (TPI) 305 was released, using a tuned runner design. The LB9 produced 210&nbsp;hp, which brought it suitable attention from buyers despite being unavailable with a manual transmission. The \"Turbo Bulge\" hood was discontinued in favor of a new flat hood with twin louvered vents or \"nostrils\" that were functional, with heat exhaust vents on the rear edges. The Trans Am also received a restyled nose, integral fog lights, and newly redesigned ground effects. It utilized new \"low density\" taillight lenses with a grid-style pattern rather than the \"louvered\" pattern in use since 1981. The Trans Am came standard with the \"High Tech\" 15-inch concave aluminum wheels from the previous year, but it was also now available with the a version of the 15th Anniversary's WS6 suspension and its \"Aero Tech\" 16-inch aluminum wheels, but in finished Natural Silver. A Borg-Warner 9-bolt differential was made available for the first time, and was said to be stronger than the standard corporate 10 bolt axle. Further attempts to put the Trans Am into higher regard included overhead console from the Camaro lineup, which included several manually adjusted reminder wheels, a positionable map light, a removable flashlight with \"FIREBIRD\" script, and a small pocket for a garage door opener or sunglasses. The standard rear spoiler from previous years was still standard, but an optional wrap-around \"Aero Spoiler\" was now available in black and gave the car a new more modern look, (it is unique for 1985 & 1986 as it had a texture). The Trans Am drag coefficient was measured at 0.32 but was as low as 0.29 with the standard Aero wheels instead of the High-Tech turbo aluminum wheels. At the time, it was the most aerodynamically efficient car GM ever produced.\n\n==1986==\n\nAll Firebirds received center, high-mounted stop lamps to comply with Federal legislation; these were placed on top of the back hatch window. All cars received restyled, more modern instrument gauges. New tail light lenses were now introduced on the base Firebird, completing the replacement of the \"slit\" or \"louvered\" taillight lenses that had been a Firebird signature since 1967. The 2.5L 4-cylinder engine was dropped, replaced by the multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 as the standard engine. The Firebird S/E model was discontinued at the end of the year. The rubber\u2013vinyl wrap-around rear [[wing (automotive)|wing]] became standard on Trans Am (available only in black; as these wings aged, these and those offered on subsequent model-year vehicles would suffer from cracking and splitting problems), the Wing spoiler was a credit option on the Trans Am, and mandatory if the louvered rear window was ordered. Midyear, Pontiac introduced a new light-weight, cross-lace wheel, available for the Trans Am.\n\nOnly 26 Trans Ams with the 305 H.O L69 were built in 1986; it was discontinued because of fuel vapor lock (boiling) problems. Some sources indicate the 305 TPI engine output was decreased from 210&nbsp;hp to 190&nbsp;hp, while others maintain it stayed at 210&nbsp;hp. Paint RPO's were changed to reflect the new base-coat/clear-coat paint process. American Sunroof (ASC), licensed by Chevrolet to build the 1987 Camaro convertible, also built three 1986 Trans Am convertibles as a \"design exercise\".\n\nIn spite of rumors, there were no 350 TPI L98 cars made in 1986 according to Pontiac.\n\n==1987==\nThe Firebird body remained basically unchanged. All center, high-mounted stop lamps were relocated to a new position between the spoiler and the rear deck lid, and the large Firebird hood emblem disappeared forever. All V8s now received factory roller camshafts, and faced with consumer demands for more power, GM officially released the new 5.7L with tuned port fuel injection. Available only with an automatic transmission, it produced 215&nbsp;hp and takes the top performance seat from the 5.0L TPI which was rated at 205HP. The 5.0L TPI, however, was available with a 5-speed manual transmission and, in fact, was quicker than the 5.7L TPI coupled with the automatic transmission. L69 production was stopped, leaving the LG4 as the only remaining carbureted [[V8 engine|V8]] used in the F-body. Trans Am GTA ('''G'''ran '''T'''urismo '''A'''mericano) was introduced, available with the LB9 305 TPI engine (which was returned to 205&nbsp;hp) or the L98 350 TPI. Gold 16-inch, flat-mesh, diamond-spoke wheels were standard on GTA, with 16-inch, 20-slot wheels standard on Trans Am.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1987-1992 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA Cloisonn\u00e9 Nose Emblem.jpg|thumb|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA 1987-1992 Nose Emblem]] -->\n\nFirebird Formula was re-introduced, available with a choice of V8s (LG4, LB9 305 TPI, or L98 350 TPI), 16-inch convex wheels, and the earlier Trans Am \"Turbo Bulge\" hood. The wrap-around wing was updated and now standard on Trans Am and Formula; the regular, flat-surfaced spoiler from earlier Trans Am models was now made standard on Firebird. Trans Am and Formula were also offered with an optional 140&nbsp;mph speedometer.\n\nWS6 was standard equipment on the Formula and GTA from 1987 to 1992, and optional on the Trans Am. WS6 from 1987 thru 1992 included 36&nbsp;mm front sway bars, 24&nbsp;mm rear sway bars, quick ratio steering box, gas filled struts and 16\" Wheels with 245/50R16 Tires. Later WS6 cars used ZR rated tires.\n\nThe Trans Am GTA was Pontiac's pride and joy with a standard 5.7L 350 Tuned Port Injection (TPI). Many people like to say, incorrectly, that the engine itself was pulled directly out of the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4|C4 Corvette]], which itself began using the engine in 1985, but the heads on the Corvette were aluminum whereas the Firebird heads were cast Iron, although it did give the GTA performance numbers comparable to GM's flagship performance platform from whence it came. The GTA came with a standard TH-700R4 (4L60) automatic transmission, A/C, new seats with inflatable lumbar and side bolsters, special door panels, epoxy-filled emblems, body-colored ground effects, a special GTA horn button, and the WS6 performance handling package. All of these options were packaged into the Trans Am under the RPO code Y84, and the model was produced until the end of Third Generation F-body production in 1992.\n\nDealerships could finally order a Firebird Convertible from a recognized coach builder that was already converting other GM products (though more than a dozen other companies had been converting F-bodies into convertibles since 1982 for Pontiac & Chevrolet dealers).  ASC (American Sunroof Company, Later \"American Specialty Cars\") (of ASC McLaren fame) offered Pontiac Dealerships a Firebird/Formula/Trans Am/GTA convertible. ASC was contracted to convert all of the official Camaro Convertibles from 1987 to 1992. However, due to fuel economy restrictions mandated by the EPA, a convertible Firebird would have been assessed a $1200 [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] because the LB9 & L98 when paired with a Trans Am or GTA would have been lower than 22.5 average MPG. For this reason Pontiac did not directly offer a convertible through dealers like the Camaro. However these were not an official Pontiac offering, they are considered coach convertibles. The conversion of the Firebird was identical to the \"Factory\" Camaros of the same model year. The exception was the obvious cosmetic changes, the rear quarter caps, spoiler (Which was a Base spoiler Wing cut off) and the high mount 3rd brake light were Firebird convertible specific.\n\nTo order a Firebird Convertible the dealership would order a T-top Firebird and have it Drop shipped to ASC, One Sunroof Center, Southgate, MI 48195 for the conversion alongside \"Factory\" Camaros. Once complete, ASC would ship the now Firebird convertible to the participating dealership for delivery. This remained the procedure for dealerships through the 1989 model year. According to ASC they did not convert any Firebirds for the 1990 model year. As popularity increased and car became lighter & more aerodynamic for the 1991 model year the process was simplified as Pontiac offered a convertible through normal dealer ordering channels via RPO's. A Total of 173 Firebird Convertibles were reported by ASC for 1987.\n\n==1988==\n\n[[File:88 notcback2.png|300px|thumb|left|1988 Trans Am GTA Notchback]]\nThe Firebird remained basically unchanged. The 170&nbsp;hp LG4 carbureted 5.0L V8 was dropped in favor of the new 170&nbsp;hp L03 5.0L V8 with throttle body injection. All V8 engines received serpentine belt systems and the A/C compressors were moved to the passenger's side of the engine, de-cluttering the engine compartment. The Firebird Formula received new high tech 16x8-inch aluminum wheels with distinctive silver \"WS6\" center caps. The GTA wheels were slightly restyled, and the convex 16-inch wheels were dropped as all Trans Ams received the 16x8\" diamond-spoke aluminum wheels, available in different colors (white, red, charcoal, and black) in addition to the GTA's gold. The GTA received a new steering wheel with integral radio controls. The Trans Am was made available with body-colored ground effects like those on the GTA.\n[[File:1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA.jpg|200px|thumb|right|1988 Trans Am GTA equipped with a 305 TPI V8, and rare 5-speed manual transmission.]]\nThe optional convertible model also carried over, and now optional on the GTA was a new \"notchback\" hatch: rather than the large, glass hatchback that had been common to the Third Generation Firebird, the optional notchback consisted of a fiberglass trunk lid with a small, flat, vertical glass window. The notchback also incorporated redesigned rear seatbacks with integral headrests. The notchback became popular with onlookers, who often assumed the notchback-equipped GTA was a [[Ferrari]], thereby encouraging some owners of the type to dub their GTA the \"Ferrari Back.\"  Many Trans Am owners were unaware that the $800 notchback option was even available, and for those who were, the vehicle typically had to be ordered from the factory, on a six-month waiting list, as the notchback was retrofitted to the vehicle. In rare instances, a dealership would get a notchback-equipped GTA on their lot. Another reason for the relative obscurity of the notchback is that the sales information was not very well disseminated to Pontiac salespeople, so many of them had no idea it was available as an option. As attractive as the notchback was, GTA owners were constantly plagued with structural and cosmetic issues with the design. The fiberglass would blister, causing surface bubbles resembling a bad case of acne. The Pontiac repair solutions were simply to sand the notchback down and repaint it, but the problem would always return, and GTA owners could expect multiple trips in order to achieve a final repair of the problem, or to have a new notchback installed. The notchback was intended to carry over and be standard-issue on the 1989 20th Anniversary GTA, but the plan never materialized; the aforementioned quality control issues apparently caused GM not to carry it over to the next year..\n\nASC continued to offer a Convertible for dealerships in 1988. A total of 104 Firebird Convertibles are reported from ASC for Pontiac Dealerships.\n\nTrans Am GTA production figures\nUS:9765 Canadian:1261\n\n==1989==\n\n[[File:20th Anniversary TransAm Convertible One of 2.png|thumb|right|'''1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am Convertible (TTA)''' Oddly, Pontiac Motor Division had this first TTA convertible built on spec by influencing a Pontiac dealer to order it.<ref>Heasley, Jerry \"Vroom with a View; 1989 Turbo Trans Am Pace Car...convertible?\" ''Muscle Car Review'' February 1990: p.64. Print</ref> Two were reportedly built, one with Leather, one with cloth.]]\n1989 was the biggest year for Pontiac with respect to press coverage, promotions, and performance. It was not well known at the time, but in 1989, Pontiac produced the quickest<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Csere, Csaba \"20th Anniversary Pontiac Trans Am; Gentlemen, light your tires\" ''Car and Driver'' June 1989 Print</ref> and fastest<ref>''Motor Trend'', June 1989-Volume 41 Number 6 pp. 42\u201347, 50, 54</ref> American production car. The \"Excitement Division\" was also asked to provide a car to pace the 73rd running of the [[Indianapolis 500]]; sadly, it would be the final time a Pontiac would ever receive that honor. The Trans Am model was now 20 years old, and it was time for another anniversary edition, with this special 20th Anniversary Trans Am to be based on the existing Trans Am GTA. Through a unique partnership between Pontiac and an engineering firm called Prototype Automotive Services (PAS), the Trans Am GTA was equipped with a more powerful version of the [[Buick V6 engine#LD5|turbocharged Buick 3.8L V6]], originally developed for the [[Buick Regal#Grand National, T-Type and GNX|Buick Regal Grand National]], and the Turbo Trans Am (TTA) became the vehicle Pontiac supplied to pace the Indianapolis 500. Ultimately, 1,555 TTA replicas, rated at 250&nbsp;hp, were produced for sale, five of those being test cars. But after ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine tested the car, logging a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph run in 4.6 seconds, and a standing quarter-mile in 13.4 seconds at 101&nbsp;mph, they called the 250&nbsp;hp rating \"exceedingly modest,\" estimating the actual output to be \"closer to 300&nbsp;hp.\" They also subsequently reported that it was the \"quickest 0\u201360 sprinter available in any US production-car showroom \u2013 at any price.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Car and Driver'' evaluation produced the best acceleration performance of any mainstream publication to test a regular TTA press car from the Pontiac fleet, partly because ''Car and Driver'' realized that the turbo boost must be \"preloaded\" to get maximum performance figures. But short-distance sprinting was not all this car could do well. Early in 1989, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' ran their top speed test article \"Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel.\"  During this test, the TTA did 162&nbsp;mph, and was the fastest production car evaluated in the test. However, ''Motor Trend'' declared the winner to be a 1989 [[Chevrolet Corvette C4#ZR-1 (1990-95)|Corvette ZR-1]], which went much faster, but was not a production car (it was a prototype that Chevrolet intended to release for production in 1989, but did not come out until 1990).<ref>\"Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel.\" ''Motor Trend'' June 1989-Volume 41 Number 6: pp. 42\u201347, 50, 54. Print</ref>  So by a slight technicality, the TTA could be called the flat-out quickest (0\u201360 4.6 sec.) and fastest (162&nbsp;mph) American production car in 1989. The only constraint on the top speed of 162&nbsp;mph was that the TTA was being limited by the engine [[redline]] and automatic transmission (with which all TTA's were equipped). When PAS installed a ZF 6-speed manual transmission into one of the cars, they were able to reach 181&nbsp;mph.<ref>\"Pontiac Playthings\" ''High Performance Pontiac'' December 1989: pp.19\u201322. Print</ref> Perhaps more importantly than the performance tests provided by the industry magazines was the fact that these cars were capable of much faster acceleration times \u2013 with minimal modifications. In fact, with $300 in new parts installed, 12.5-second quarter-mile runs were achievable \u2013 without manually shifting gears or the need to trailer the vehicle to the track!  Because of this, the TTA has gained a cult following among amateur racing enthusiasts.\n\nPontiac sub-contracted the job of engineering the TTA engine modifications to PAS. The narrow engine bay of the Trans Am required the use of different [[cylinder heads]], which happened to have better flow characteristics than the old Buick heads. Special stainless steel [[Exhaust manifold|headers]] were made specifically for the project as well. The heads, headers, along with more refined tuning of the boost and fuel curves, all added up to a more powerful package than the older Buicks. PAS was also in charge of testing and assembling the engines. Most TTA's came with T-tops and leather interior, but there were also hardtops and cloth-interior cars. And every TTA had an automatic transmission \u2013 the TH200-4R, equipped with overdrive and a torque converter clutch. The three actual pace cars were randomly selected from the production run, and sent to Indianapolis to pace the race. Thus, the pace car replicas were closer to the actual pace cars than any replica previously offered; the only difference between the replicas and the three actual pace cars was the addition of strobe lights and safety equipment to the latter. In addition, the TTA was relatively economical to drive; it returned 24&nbsp;mpg on the highway, while the only cars (besides the [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] [[Lotus Esprit#Turbo and S3 Esprits (1980)|Esprit Turbo SE]]) that could approach its performance at the time ([[Ferrari]]s, [[Lamborghini]]s, etc.) were far more costly, and providing only around 10 to 12&nbsp;mpg. As has been proven to be the case in subsequent years, relying on a small engine for cruising, and a turbocharger for power, provides an exciting driving experience while returning impressive fuel mileage.\n[[File:1989 Pontiac Trans Am Firebird GTA.png|thumb|right|1989 Trans Am GTA]]\n\nThe rarest 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Ams are the hardtops and convertibles. Only 40 hardtops were made. Only three convertible TTA's were built by ASC,<ref>Heasley, Jerry \"Vroom With a View; 1989 Turbo Trans Am Pace Car...convertible?\" ''Muscle Car Review'' February 1990: p.65</ref><ref>Pontiac Historic Services, Letter signed by Jim Mattison, September 21, 2007</ref> one of which was bought by the president of PAS, with the other two falling into private hands. Only two are generally known to exist, however, as the ASC order log shows records for only two TTA convertibles.<ref>American Specialty Cars Inc. Firebird order log, August 21, 1989</ref>  The five test TTA's, because they were for pre-production use, were pulled off of the assembly line without regard to color, and therefore were not necessarily white. At least two of these test cars were sold to private individuals, so there are at least two extremely rare, non-white, factory TTA's in existence; in fact, one is known to be red.\n\nAs for the rest of the Firebird line, GM made a new dual [[catalytic converter]] exhaust system (RPO code N10) available, freeing up 13% more power from some LB9- and L98-equipped Formulas and Trans Ams; so equipped, LB9 engine output was increased to 225&nbsp;hp while the L98 increased to 235&nbsp;hp. The N10 option remained available throughout the balance of the Third Generation production run, however the L98 powerplant was only available with an automatic transmission, whereas the LB9/N10 combination could only be coupled to a 5-speed manual (RPO code MM5) and a [[Limited slip differential|limited-slip differential]] (RPO code G80) using a 3.45 performance [[Gear ratio|axle ratio]] (RPO code GM3). According to a March 1990 (Vol. 35, No. 9) ''Car and Driver'' article, when the latter set of options were combined into the relatively unassuming (and 300-pounds-lighter) Formula body, which shared the same WS6 suspension with the top-end Trans Am GTA, it created a \"[[Sleeper (car)|sleeper]]\" Firebird that could out-perform the heavier Trans Am GTA (even when equipped with the L98 engine) \u2013 at a roughly 30% lower sticker price.  ''Car and Driver'' also reported that (aside from the TTA, offered only in 1989) these \"sleeper\" Formulas were the fastest Third-Generation Firebirds \u2013 capable of accelerating from 0\u201360&nbsp;mph in under 7 seconds and boasting a top speed of more than {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (quite impressive for the day). Although not an exhaustive comparison, these claims would seem to be supported by a simple examination of the [[power-to-weight ratio|weight-to-power ratios]] of both models: a 225&nbsp;hp Formula at a [[curb weight]] of {{convert|3300|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} versus a 235&nbsp;hp Trans Am GTA at a curb weight of {{convert|3600|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}; the weight-to-power ratio for the Formula is 14.67&nbsp;lb/hp compared to 15.32&nbsp;lb/hp for the Trans Am GTA. According to the same ''Car and Driver'' article, very few of these \"sleeper\" Formulas hit the streets; only about 50 were built each model year, as almost all LB9-equipped Formulas came with an automatic transmission \u2013 which disqualified them from receiving the high-performance N10 and GM3 options.\n\nFirebirds optioned with T-tops received new [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] plastic tops made by Leximar for GM. The new tops were lighter in weight and tinted darker, but were more dome shaped and aged rapidly. GM replaced many sets with tops made of glass under warranty, but the acrylic tops continued as standard-issue through 1992. All Firebirds optioned with rear disc brakes now received PBR brake calipers and larger brake rotors, which resolved issues encountered with previous-model rear discs and increased stopping power. Introduction of GM's '''V'''ehicle '''A'''nti '''T'''heft '''S'''ystem (VATS) or PASS-Key made all Firebirds more theft-resistant. The system was adapted from GM's higher-end Corvette and [[Cadillac]] vehicles in response to an escalating trend among car thieves to target the Camaro and Firebird. VATS incorporated a small resistor into the ignition key shaft which was read by a sensor when the key was inserted. VATS-equipped cars also displayed anti-theft system warning decals in the lower rear corners of the side windows. A new CD player was offered, shoulder belts were added in the back seat, and the convertible model carried over.\n\n[[File:1989 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA Turbo t-top 20th anniv Indy Pace Car.jpg|thumb|right|1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am (TTA)]]\n\n'''TTA production figures:'''\n\n* 1,323 T-Top & Leather Interior\n* 187 T-Top & Cloth Interior\n* 24 Hardtop & Leather Interior\n* 15 Hardtop & Cloth Interior (Base)\n* 3 Test Cars / T-Top & Cloth Interior\n* 1 ASC Convertible Leather int\n* 1 Test Car / ASC Convertible Cloth int\n* 1 Test Car / Hardtop & Leather Interior\n\nASC continued to make Convertibles for Pontiac dealerships. A total of 330 Convertibles were reported by ASC. A portion of those were 350 powered Convertibles. NOTE: 1989 was the First year a '''US''' Dealership could order T-top and a 350 Engine in a firebird. Since all Convertibles started as a CC1 (T-Top) car and converted by ASC 1989 would also be the only year to get a 350 powered third generation Firebird convertible.\n\n'''1989 Firebird [[Convertible (car)|Convertible]] production figures From 1989 ASC order logs'''\n* '''2''' \u2013 TURBO TRANS AM (V6 Turbo)\n* '''144''' \u2013 GTA or Trans Am -w/L98 (350 TPI)\n* '''43''' \u2013 FORMULA 350 \u2013 w/L98 (350 TPI)\n* 9 \u2013 GTA or Trans Am LB9 \"F\" (305 TPI)\n* 17 \u2013 FORMULA \u2013 W/LB9 (305 TPI)\n* 4 \u2013 Trans Am LO3 \"E\" (305 TBI)\n* 57 \u2013 Firebird or Formula \u2013 W/LO3 (305 TBI)\n* 37 \u2013 Firebird \u2013 W/LB8 (2.8L V6)\n* 10 \u2013 Exported, and trim was not able to be determined\n* 4 \u2013 Trim was not able to be determined\n* 5 - Not Listed in Dealer Order Logs \n\n\u2013 - \u2013\nASC Reported a total of 330 Firebird Convertibles in 1989, \n\nInformation comes from 1989 ASC Order log, the Order log show only 324 of the reported 330 convertibles, as of June 2018, three of those missing 6 vehicles have been identified and added to the above data.

The Firebird interior again received a re-design, this time the changes were much less drastic: the lower dash and under-dash panels were altered, and accessory switches were moved to a new panel above the heater and radio controls. The deluxe contoured interior door panels that were standard in GTAs and available in Trans Ams were no longer available. All models would have to make do with the rather crude, flat, carpeted door panels, although if leather seats were ordered, genuine perforated leather was added above the armrest on the basic door panels. In GTAs the cheap door panels looked very out of place next to the exotic looking articulating seats. The console got a new shift indicator. This time, there was actually a needle to indicate what gear you had selected. Previously, you just had to line up the shifter handle with the markings. Steering wheel mounted radio controls disappeared from the GTA (due to the addition of the airbag), and the L98 engine was no longer offered in the T-top cars due to fuel economy regulations. The LB9 and L98 platforms were updated with new speed density fuel injection, and the elimination of the MAF sensor reduced production costs and supposedly improved performance. All L98-equipped cars now received the N10 dual catalytic converters as standard, which technically was a mid year change for 1989.\n\nLike the Camaro, the 1990 Firebird only received a half-year production run, as Pontiac labored to release the re-styled 1991 model. Production ceased on December 31, 1989.\n\nASC reported making no Firebird Convertibles for 1990.\n\n==1991==\n\n[[File:1991 Pontiac Firebird.jpg|200px|thumb|right|1991 Firebird with re-styled nose.]]\n[[File:91 green camel.png|250px|thumb|left|Trans Am Convertible's with Camel leather had GTA wheels and seats standard. There were no GTA convertibles from 1991 on.]]\nAll Firebirds received re-styled noses loosely fashioned after the \"Banshee IV\" show car while Pontiac was developing the all-new Fourth Generation platform. The Trans Am's ground effects were re-styled as well, and were made available on the base model Firebird, but NA on the Formula. The Trans Am and Firebird Formula received a new fiberglass-constructed, flat, wrap-around wing, The Trans Am and GTA received updated two-piece tail lights with \"PONTIAC\" scripted in orange across the panels, and the center, high-mounted stop lamps were moved to inside the top edge of the rear hatch.\n\nThe FORMULA was the only third Gen F-body to get to T-tops with a 350 Engine starting in MID year 1991 & 1992, to get a FORMULA 350 T-top car the black cross laced wheels (as installed on the Trans AM) were mandatory.\n\nDue to its lighter weight and improved aerodynamics the Firebird Convertible was finally available through GM's normal ordering procedures. ASC still converted T-top cars into convertibles but the ordering process was simplified and dealers would no longer need to have the cars drop shipped to ASC in Michigan. The Convertibles were offered with one of three engine options: LHO 3.1L V6, the L03 5.0L V8 for the base Firebird, or the LB9 5.0L [[V8 engine|V8]] Trans Am only.\n\nAn improvement on the T-top cars was introduced mid year on all F-bodies. T-top cars now came with new seals which greatly reduced leaks into the passenger compartment.\n\nBeginning in 1991, SLP (Street Legal Performance) modified a factory-built Formula into what they called the \"'''Firehawk'''\". Once a Formula had been ordered or purchased, this limited-availability option (RPO code B4U) could be specified, and the vehicle was sent to SLP to be modified. No two cars SLP produced were alike; they all were special orders. SLP had anticipated making 250 of these special Firebird Formulas, but in fact, only 27 were ordered; and of those, only 25 were ever built (numbered 1\u201325 for hardtops \u2013 with numbers 18 and 23 never being built \u2013 and the only Firehawk Convertible was numbered 27 which was the only non-formula). Of those 25 Firehawks, 21 were \"Mandatory\" Red, 1 Aqua, 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green; 11 had the Competition Package, 3 came with Aluminum Engine Blocks, 1 had T-Tops, and 1 was a Convertible.\n\n'''FIREHAWK SPECIFICATIONS'''\n\n'''Standard Features''': $39,995\n* SLP modified 350 engine rated at 350&nbsp;hp @ 5500&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|390|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} @ 4400&nbsp;rpm\n* 17\"X9.5\" Ronal alloy wheels with [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk SZ P275/40/ZR17 tires\n* ZF 6-speed [[manual transmission]] with carbon fiber clutch\n* Stainless Steel catalytic converter and exhaust system\n* A [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44 rear axle with 3.54:1 Posi-gears\n* Special Firehawk badging, decals and numbered plaque\n\n'''Competition Package''': $9,995\n* Cross-drilled 13 in Brembo Ferrari F-40 brakes\n* Full roll cage minus the back seat\n* Aluminum hood\n* Recaro racing seats with full harnesses by Simpson and rear seat delete.\n\n'''Engine''':\n* 4-bolt main engine block\n* Forged steel crankshaft\n* 1053 alloy, forged steel \"Pink\" connecting rods\n* Light-weight, high-silicon, cast aluminum pistons\n* Steel billet hydraulic roller camshaft\n* High-output aluminum cylinder heads with stainless steel valves\n* Port injection intake manifold designed by Ray Falconer\n\n'''Performance''':(according to SLP brochure)\n*Weight-to-power ratio: 9.7&nbsp;lb per hp\n*Acceleration (0 to 60&nbsp;mph): 4.6 seconds\n*Quarter mile: 13.2 seconds @ {{convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Top speed: {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Skid pad: 0.88g on full tread\n\n'''Motor Trend test results''':<ref>Ross, Daniel Charlton \"Pontiac Formula Firehawk; The Genie in the Bottle Delivers\" ''Motor Trend'' December 1991: pp. 50\u201352.

Release of the Fourth Generation model was imminent, and Pontiac made few changes to the 1992 Firebird. The special edition Formula Firehawk that appeared in 1991 was still available, although a lot of dealers were unaware of its existence. The lack of awareness and a sky high price tag conspired to keep the sales figures down on the special Firehawk. As for the rest of the line, new exterior colors were available, including a bright \"Jamaica Yellow\". One interior color was changed, from the camel colored beechwood to a greyish beige. Convertibles were still available. One improvement made on all 1992 F-bodies was the addition of some extra bonding agents to stiffen the structure of the cars. The extra bonding was an attempt to correct squeaks and rattles that some owners had complained about. This also allowed GM to experiment with some of the new technologies which were to be implemented on the fourth generation cars. Mid-year, TPI-equipped cars only received blank throttle body plates rather than ones that had been marked \"TUNED PORT INJECTION\" on similar engines in prior model years; and black-painted valve covers replaced the silver components from previous years. As use of the L98 in the Corvette had come to an end, rough-cast runners found their way into L98-equipped Firebirds, and some cars received special rubber snubbers on the rear hatch frame that were designed to make the hatch more stable. This would be the last year for the light weight deep dish cross-laced wheels that had been available since 1987, and had been styled to look like expensive aftermarket rims. It would be the last year for the GTA, the last year for concealed windshield wipers, and the last year for the aerodynamic body with the long hood and low roofline. It was also the last year for full leather covering on the front seats. Some GTA's ended up with drum brakes on the rear, presumably because of a shortage of disc brake parts. Buyers were compensated for the downgrade. Ultimately, very few Trans Ams, GTA's, and Formulas were produced in this model year, as most buyers were waiting for the next-generation models.\n\nGTA production figures:\n*USA: 226\n*Canada:48\n\n==Engines==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||90%;\"\n| 1982|| rowspan=\"4\" | [[GM Iron Duke engine|{{convert|151|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac]]<br>Throttle Body Injection I4 || rowspan=\"3\" | [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Longitudinal|{{convert|173|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} \"X\"]] 2-barrel V6 || rowspan=\"6\" | [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|{{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Chevrolet]] 4-barrel V8 || rowspan=\"2\" | [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|{{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Chevrolet]] Cross-Fire Injection V8<br>(first year for fuel injection in Trans Am) || || rowspan=\"7\" |\n|-\n| 1983|| {{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Chevrolet 4-barrel H.O.

Jeffrey was a butcher and John was educated as a [[sizar]] (a poor scholar who had to work as a servant to pay his way) at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], receiving an MA in 1644. Wildman may have had legal training as he later described himself as an attorney or solicitor.\n\n===Civil War===\nIn the [[English Civil War]] Wildman served briefly under Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]]. He became prominent, however, as a civilian adviser to the Army agitators, being in 1647 one of the leaders of that section of the army that opposed all compromise with [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=640}}\n\nIn December 1647 Wildman wrote a pamphlet, ''Putney Projects'', that attacked [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Henry Ireton]] for betraying the New Model Army's Declaration of 14 June 1647 in the [[Heads of Proposals]]. He may have written parts of ''The Case of the Army Stated'',<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=232}} cites ''Clarke Papers'', i. 347, 356</ref> and he put the views of his associates before the [[Council of the Army]] at the [[Putney Debates]] that were partly held in [[St. Mary's Church, Putney|Putney parish church]] between 28 October and 11 November 1647.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=640}} The soldiers, explained Wildman, ''\"desired me to be their mouth\"'', and he argued on their behalf that the engagements entered into with the King should be cancelled, monarchy and the House of Lords abolished, and manhood suffrage established. He also demanded that the officers should accept an ''[[Agreement of the People]]'' just put forth by the five regiments,<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=232}} cites: ''Clarke Papers'', vol. i. pp. xlviii, 240, 259, 317, 386.</ref> a document that some modern historians consider he had the principal hand in drafting.<ref>{{harvnb|Vernon and Baker|2010|}}</ref>\n\nWildman and [[John Lilburne]] attempted to build a movement to campaign for the Agreement of the People. The [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]] alleged that preparations were made ''\"for his trial and towards his execution\"''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=640}} On 18 January 1648 George Masterson, minister of [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch|Shoreditch]] informed against Wildman and Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Lilburne]] for promoting a seditious petition.  Wildman and Lilburne were summoned to the bar of the House of Commons, which committed both men to [[Newgate Prison]].  Bail was refused, and, in spite of frequent petitions for their release, they remained in prison until 2 August 1648.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=232}} cites: ''A Declaration of the Proceedings of Lieutenant-colonel John Lilburne and his Associates'', 1648, [[4to]]; Commons' Journals, v. 437, 469.</ref> The historian [[Charles Harding Firth|C.H. Firth]] stated in the [[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]] (1900) that Wildman's speech at the bar of the house was very ineffective, and the pamphlet he published in answer to Masterson's charges, entitled ''Truth's Triumph'', was derisively refuted by Masterson in the ''Triumph Stained''.{{sfn|Firth|1900|pp=232, 233}}\n\nOn the release of the two prisoners the [[Levellers]] held a meeting at the Nag's Head tavern,{{clarify|date=March 2012}} in which, says Lilburne, ''\"the just ends of the war were as exactly laid open by Mr. John Wildman as ever I heard in my life\"'',{{sfn|Firth|1900|p=233}} and the party agreed to oppose the execution or deposition of the king until the fundamental principles of the future constitution were settled.  To that end a new ''Agreement of the People'' was drawn up by sixteen representatives of different parties, but, after long debates in the [[Council of Officers]], it was so altered by the officers that Lilburne and other leaders of the levellers refused to accept it, and published in May 1649 a rival ''Agreement'', drawn up by themselves.{{sfn|Firth|1900|p=233}}\n\nIt seems that Wildman was satisfied with what the [[Army Council (1647)|Council of Officers]] were suggesting because he abandoned further agitation, and in the winter of 1648\u201349 he joined the [[New Model Army]] as major in the regiment of horse of Colonel [[John Reynolds (soldier)|John Reynolds]].  However he did not accompany the regiment to Ireland in August 1649.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=233}} cites ''Clarke MSS''.</ref>\n\n===Commonwealth===\nWildman remained in England and became one of the greatest speculators in the forfeited lands of royalists, clergy, and Roman Catholics.  His purchases of land, either for himself or for others, were scattered over at least twenty counties.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=233}} cites ''Cal. of Committee for Compounding'', pp. 1653, 1769, 3100, 2201; cf.

Hist''. xx. 305.</ref> By the end of 1654 he was plotting the overthrow of [[The Protectorate|the Protector]] Oliver Cromwell by means of a combined rising of Royalists and Levellers.  Consequently, he was arrested on 10 February 1655 at the village of [[Easton Royal|Easton]], near [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]],{{sfn|Ashley|1947|p=90}}{{sfn|Waylen|1854|p=277}}<ref>{{harvnb|Crowley|Baggs|Freeman|Smith|1999|pp=140\u2013149}} endnote 93.</ref> while dictating ''A Declaration of the free and well-affected People of England now in Arms against the Tyrant Oliver Cromwell, esq'' to his secretary William Parker.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=233}} cites Thurloe, iii. 147; Whitelocke, ''Memorials'', iv. 183.</ref> He was sent a prisoner first to [[Chepstow Castle]], and afterwards to the [[Tower of London]].  Nearly a year and a half later, on 26 June 1656 a petition begging for Wildman's release was presented to the Protector by various persons engaged in business speculations with him, and on giving security for \u00a310,000 he was provisionally set free.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=233}} cites ''Cal. State Papers'', Dom. 1655\u201356, p. 387.</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the Protectorate Wildman kept out of prison, though he still continued in intrigue.  He was in frequent communication with Royalist agents, whom he contrived to persuade that he was working for the King's cause, and he signed the address presented to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] on behalf of the Levellers in July 1656.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=233}} cites Clarendon, ''Rebellion'', xv. 104; ''Clarendon State Papers'', iii. 311, 315, 331, 336.</ref> It is fairly certain that Cromwell's government was aware of these intrigues, and it is probable that Wildman purchased impunity by giving information of some kind to Cromwell's spy master [[John Thurloe]].  For this reason [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]] and the wiser Royalists did not trust him.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=233}} cites ''Clarendon State Papers''. iii. 408, 419; ''Hist. MSS. Comm''. 10th Rep. vi. 197.</ref> C.H. Firth speculated that Wildman's political object in this complicated web of treachery was probably to overthrow Cromwell, and to set up in his place either a republic or a monarchy limited by some elaborate constitution of his own devising.{{sfn|Firth|1900|p=233}}\n\nIn the late 1650s Wildman was associated with the Commonwealth Club, a Republican club meeting at a [[Covent Garden]] tavern called The Nonsuch in [[Bow Street]].

In the plots for armed resistance to the King which followed the dissolution of Charles II's [[Oxford Parliament (1681)|last parliament]] in 1681 he appears to have played a considerable part. Wildman was closely associated with [[Algernon Sidney]], both of whom were distrusted by the leaders of the Scottish malcontents, and by the English noblemen concerned, as too republican in their aims. Wildman drew up a manifesto to be published at the time of the intended insurrection, and, though not one of the \"public managers\", was privately consulted upon all occasions and applied unto as their \"chief oracle\";<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=234}} cites ''Informations as to the Rye House Plot'', p. 50 ed. 1696; Ferguson, ''Life of Robert Ferguson'' pp. 145, 434.</ref> He was also credited with suggesting the assassination of the King and the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], ''\"whom he expressed by the name of stags that would not be impaled, but leapt over all the fences which the care and wisdom of the authors of the constitution had made to restrain them from committing spoils\"''.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=234}} cites Ferguson, ''Life of Robert Ferguson'' pp. 78, 419, 434.</ref> On 26 June 1683 he was committed to the [[Tower of London]] for complicity in the [[Rye House Plot]], but allowed out on bail on 24 November following, and finally discharged on 12 February 1684.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=234}} cites Luttrell, ''Diary'', i. 263, 292, 301; The Proceedings upon the bailing the Lord Brandon Gerrard \u2026 Major Wildman, &c., folio, 1683.</ref> The chief witness against him was [[William Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Escrick|Lord Howard]], who testified that Wildman undertook to furnish the rebels with some guns, which the discovery of two small field-pieces at his house seemed to confirm.<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=234}} cites Burnet, ''Own Time'', ed.

He sent a certain Robert Cragg, alias Smith, to Monmouth and the English exiles in Holland. According to Cragg, Monmouth complained of Wildman's backwardness in providing money for the expedition, and that Wildman would hinder the expedition from coming until Wildman judged the time right. Wildman, on the other hand, complained that Monmouth and a small group of exiles were resolved ''\"to conclude the scheme of the government of the nation without the knowledge of any of the people in England\"'',<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=234}} cites ''Hist.

(ii. 330).\n\n==Family==\nWildman's first wife was Frances, daughter of Sir [[Sir Francis Englefield, 2nd Baronet|Francis Englefield]], and his second was Lucy, daughter of \"[[Baron Lovelace|Lord Lovelace]]\".{{sfn|Greaves}}\n\nWildman had a son, John, who married Eleanor, daughter of Edward Chute of [[Bethersden]], Kent, in 1676,<ref>{{harvnb|Firth|1900|p=235}} cites  Chester, ''London Marriage Licenses'', p. 1467; Le Neve, ''Knights'', p. 43.</ref> and died childless in 1710, though he made [[John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington|John Shute]], later Viscount Barrington, his chief heir, particularly of Beckett Hall,{{sfn|Firth|1900|p=235}} which the elder Wildman had bought in 1657 from the regicide Henry Marten (see above).{{sfn|Nash Ford|2010|loc=}}{{sfn|Nash Ford|2010a|loc=}}{{sfn|Nash Ford|2010b|loc=}}<ref group=Controversy name=MC/>\n\n==Notes==\n;Footnotes\n{{reflist|group=Controversy|refs=\n<ref name=MC>\nThe ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (2004)'' (''ODNB'') states that Wildman's first wife was Frances, daughter of Sir [[Sir Francis Englefield, 2nd Baronet|Francis Englefield]], while the second was Lucy \"daughter of Lord Lovelace\".\n<p>\nThe ''ODNB'' account fails to identify its sources for the identity of either wife, so checking the secondary or primary sources used by the author of the ODNB article is difficult. The details of the first marriage as described by the ODNB match those of Ashley's work, and the ODNB may have used Ashley as a source, but Ashley does not cite another source (Ashley 17). The identity of Wildman's first wife therefore remains unclear pending the discovery of more reliable sources. However, it is noteworthy that, in 1689, Wildman sat as MP for [[Wootton Bassett (UK Parliament constituency)|Wootton Bassett]] in [[Wiltshire]] where the Englefields lived (Nash Ford 2010).\n<p>\nThe ''ODNB'''s identification Lucy \"daughter of Lord Lovelace\" appears also to be based on Ashley, but his referenced source (Ashley 18, 304), the '[https://archive.org/stream/reportofroyalcom_13grea#page/n5/mode/2up 13th Report] of the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts]]', does not mention this marriage. Richmond, however, cites several items of direct primary source evidence that Lucy was the daughter of Anthony Richmond of [[Idstone]] at [[Ashbury, Oxfordshire|Ashbury]] in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) (see Richmond, v. 3, p.&nbsp;134-5), and Nash Ford states this is confirmed by the arms of Wildman impaling Richmond on the ledger stone above their grave in Shrivenham Church.(Nash Ford 2010; Ball & Ball, 2002) It seems that \"Lord Lovelace\" (presumably [[Richard Lovelace, 1st Baron Lovelace]] (1564\u20131634)) may not have a daughter named Lucy. There is certainly none recorded in the [[Hurley, Berkshire|Hurley]] parish register with the rest of his children (Nash Ford 2010c). He did, however, have a daughter, Elizabeth, who married Henry Marten (Nash Ford 2010a) and Ford suggests the two have been confused (Nash Ford 2010).</ref>\n}}\n;Citations\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Ashley |first=M. |year= 1947|title=John Wildman: Plotter and Postmaster, a Study of the English Republican Movement in the Seventeenth Century|location=London|page=90}}\n*{{cite web |ref=harv |last=Ball |first=Duncan |last2=Ball  |first2=Mandy  |year=2002 |title=Shrivenham |publisher=Duncan and Mandy Ball|url= http://www.oodwooc.co.uk/ph_shriv_28.htm|accessdate=<!-- June 2014 -->}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Crowley |first1=D.A.

Jeffrey was a butcher and John was educated as a [[sizar]] (a poor scholar who had to work as a servant to pay his way) at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], receiving an MA in 1644. Wildman may have had legal training as he later described himself as an attorney or solicitor.\n\n===Civil War===\nIn the [[English Civil War]] Wildman served briefly under Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]]. He became prominent, however, as a civilian adviser to the Army agitators, being in 1647 one of the leaders of that section of the army that opposed all compromise with [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=640}}\n\nIn December 1647 Wildman wrote a pamphlet, ''Putney Projects'', that attacked [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Henry Ireton]] for betraying the New Model Army's Declaration of 14 June 1647 in the [[Heads of Proposals]].

According to Cragg, Monmouth complained of Wildman's backwardness in providing money for the expedition, and that Wildman would hinder the expedition from coming until Wildman judged the time right.

The identity of Wildman's first wife therefore remains unclear pending the discovery of more reliable sources.

Richmond, however, cites several items of direct primary source evidence that Lucy was the daughter of Anthony Richmond of [[Idstone]] at [[Ashbury, Oxfordshire|Ashbury]] in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) (see Richmond, v. 3, p.&nbsp;134-5), and Nash Ford states this is confirmed by the arms of Wildman impaling Richmond on the ledger stone above their grave in Shrivenham Church.(Nash Ford 2010; Ball & Ball, 2002) It seems that \"Lord Lovelace\" (presumably [[Richard Lovelace, 1st Baron Lovelace]] (1564\u20131634)) may not have a daughter named Lucy. There is certainly none recorded in the [[Hurley, Berkshire|Hurley]] parish register with the rest of his children (Nash Ford 2010c).

The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically {{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}.\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born.

At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863.

In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting. According to Dmitrieva, \"the boy was like a boy, gifted, but rather promising a versatile amateur than an obsessed artist, whom he later became\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel with his sister Anna.

At that time, a copy of \"[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The last Judgement]]\" by [[Michelangelo]] was exhibited in Saratov. The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century. The 1880s have just only passed, the first search for national antiquity just started, which no one else besides specialists was interested in, and even those specialists were interested more from the historical point rather than artistic <\u2026> Vrubel in Kiev was the first who bridged archaeological pioneering and restorations to a live contemporary art. At the same time, he did not think of stylization. He felt like an accomplice in the hard work of the ancient masters and tried to be worthy of them.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}}}}\n\nPrakhov\u2019s invitation was almost coincidental \u2013 he was looking for a qualified painter with some academic training to paint murals in the church but at the same time not to be recognised enough so he would not require a higher salary{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=113}}. Judging from the correspondence with the family, Vrubel's contract with Prakhov was for the completion of four icons in the duration of 76 days. The salary  indicated  was 300 rubles paid in every 24 working days.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=123}}\n[[File:St. Cyril's Church's Frescoes.jpg|thumb|right|\"Descent of Holy Spirit on the Apostles\"]] \nVrubel staged his arrival in Kiev in his signature style. Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|... Against a background of primitive Kirillovsky hills, a blond, almost white, young man with a particular head and small, almost white, moustaches, stood behind my back.

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition. The background is coloured in blue while the golden rays are coming up to the apostles from the circle featuring the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}} The model for the Mary\u2019s figure was a paramedic M. Ershova \u2013 a frequent guest in the Prakhov's house and the future wife of one of the painters participating in the restoration process.  To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum. To Mary's right stands the second apostle for whom the Kiev archaeologist {{ill|Viktor Goshkevich|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} was modelling. The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]]{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}.\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle. Fresco sketch for the Vladimir Cathedral, 1887]]\nAfter returning from Venice in 1885, Vrubel spent May and part of June in Kiev. There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"... But still tell me, Mikhail Alexandrovich, why did you cut yourself \u2013 it must be painful.

Edwards, together with [[Kyriak Kostandi]], tried to reform the Odessa Art School and decided to decided to elicit Vrubel's help. He settled Vrubel in his own house and tried to persuade him to stay in Odessa forever.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=151\u2014153}} In summer, Serov arrived in Odessa and Vrubel for the first time told him about his plan to paint the \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\". In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version.

Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but could be seen in some icons from  the period of Italian Renaissance. However, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings even though he clearly understood their significance and originality. The reason for this was that these paintings differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would only unbalance a relative integrity of already assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noticed that the whole new cathedral \"in a very special style\" needs to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint the composition \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886.

Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer his acquired during the painting of sacred images techniques to  create completely the opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would unlikely connect both with the public and the critics from the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued the destroyed shit together. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich \u2013 the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait - fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis manifested itself in the following incident. Once, Vrubel visited Prakhov where was already a company of artists participating in the painting of the cathedral. Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and he will have to urgently travel to Kharkiv; thus, painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for a sun.

However, Vrubel' illustrations passed with difficulties since due to its complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. However, the main difficulty was the fact that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. Despite this, on April 10, 1891, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] and right after the publication was widely discussed in the press. It was the press that harshly criticized illustrations made by Vrubel, primarily for its \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him and thus the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious in his eyes as for others was  \"incomprehensibility\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the plot and at the same time made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist. The Demon was an archetypal \"fallen angel\" that simultaneously bridged men and female figures. Tamara was differently depicted on every image, and that emphasized her unavoidable choice between earthly and heavenly.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=14}} According to Dmitrieva, Vrubel\u2019 illustrations show the painterl being at the top of his game as a graphic artist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=37}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Demon Seated, 1890.

His friend Mikhail Vrubel attended the funeral and was so fond of local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that Mikhail proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and by any means was trying to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to be a freeloader in noble families and started earning good money by fulfilling orders on several furnace compositions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

From the one hand, movement supporters discussed a revival of Russian traditional crafts. From the other hand, machine fabrication contradicted the uniqueness which was the main art principle in Art Nouveau.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|pp=195\u2014196}} Vrubel worked in both Abramtsevo and Talashkino. However, both of these studies differed in the accents of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolic art in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow.

The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place. The figures were chaotically arranged, \"compressing\" space, which is projected onto the plane.

For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A.

The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries.

According to the Korovin\u2019s memoirs, after getting a large salary for watercolour panels, he spent them as follows:\n{{quote|He organized the dinner in the hotel \"Paris\" where he also lived.

Savva Mamontov was a curator of the exposition dedicated to the [[Far North (Russia)|Russian North]]. It was him who noticed that the neighbouring section of arts lacks the paintings that would cover two large empty walls. Mamontov discussed with the Minister of Finance his idea to cover these walls with large panels with total area 20 \u00d7 5 m and ordered these panels from Vrubel.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=297}} At that time, the painter was busy decorating the Morozov's mansion in Moscow.

For the second wall, Vrubel chose \"The Princess of the Dream\" inspired by a work of the same name made by the French poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. The second painting symbolically represented the painter's dream of beauty.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=60}}\n\nIt was impossible to complete the order in such short notice. That is why Vrubel instructed painter T. Safonov from Nizhny Novgorod to start working on \"Mikula\". Safonov was supposed to paint according to Vrubel's sketches.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

On the contrary, Maxim Gorky was against Vrubel. He made fun of \"Mikula\" by comparing it with a fictional character Chernomor. \"The Princess of the Dream\" resent him with its \"antics, ugliness of otherwise beautiful plot\".

Stored at the [[Russian Museum]]]]\n\nTen years later, Vrubel returned to the theme of Demon which is evident from his correspondence with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the end of 1898. Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom. His eyes, as if prophetically, captured the whole tragic fate of his fragility.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}}}\n\nThe birth of Savva led to a dramatic change in the routine of the family. Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively. Despite usual 3-4 hours, he worked up to 14 hours, and sometimes even more, with a flash of artificial lightning, never leaving the room and barely coming off the painting. Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910)==\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients. The doctor constantly invited artists and singers for organized house concerts. Patients attended evening events together with medical staff{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nVera Usoltseva, the wife of doctor Usoltsev, described Vrubel's condition to Nadezhda Vrubel as follows:\n{{Quote| Mikhail's condition did not change. His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time. But, unfortunately, he tore his new summer coat and trousers apart. He pretended to be calm, went to bed, covered himself with a blanket, and started to tugging the cloth underneath and tearing it into strips before the servant had noticed \u2026 His physical strength is high, which is rare for an intelligent person\u2026 You asked, should you write to him or not. No, you should not. He does not pay attention to letters and does not write them himself. He is often in the hands of delusion\u2026. the love to you is a red thread which is visible in all of his conversations\u2026 So, he explained to me that the coat and trousers would be of use to you if one puts multi-coloured pieces of matter into the holes\u2026.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=446\u2014448}}}}\nOnly after half of the year Vrubel started more or less adequately show responsiveness to the physical environment. However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis. In addition, the painter was diagnosed with an [[optic neuropathy]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=449\u2014450}} Mikhail was kept in the clinic almost exclusively at the expense of his wife, which was not an easy task because a month of stay in the Usoltsev's clinic cost 100-150 rubles. On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

On  November 28 1905, he was awarded the title Academician of painting \"for fame in the artistic field\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=452\u2014453}} After that, the editor of \"{{ill|Zolotoe runo|ru|\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u043d\u043e (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b)}}\" Nicolai Ryabushinsky visited Vrubel in the clinic with the offer to paint  [[Valery Bryusov]]. The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in. He entered with a wrong, heavy gait as if he was dragging his feet. To tell the truth, I was shocked when I saw Vrubel. It was a frail and sick person in a dirty, crumpled shirt. He had a reddish face and bird of prey eyes; protruding hair instead of a beard. First impression: crazy! <...> In real life, all small Vrubel's movement reflected his disorder. However, when his hand took a pencil or a lump of coal, it became very steady and confident. Lines that he drew were infallible.\n\nHis artistic strength survived everything else in him. The human died, was destroyed, but the master continued to live.\n\nDuring the first session, the first draft was already finished. I am really sorry that nobody thought of taking a picture of this dark drawing. It was almost even more remarkable in terms of performance, facial expression, and similarity than the later portrait painted with coloured pencils.{{sfn|\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432|2002|pp=242\u2014244}}}}\n\nThen Ryabushinsky commissioned Serov to paint the portrait of Vrubel. They organized the work, so Vrubel was able to paint Bruysov in the mornings, while Serov painted Vrubel in the afternoons.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=453}} Even though Nadezhda Zabela was concerned if Vrubel could handle such stress, Usoltsev categorically said that \"as an artist, he was healthy and deeply healthy.\" The first issue of the \"Zolotoe runo\" was published on February 1, 1906, with the Bryusov's poem \"To M. A. Vrubel\" opening the issue. Twelve days later, Vrubel complained to his wife that he could not read or paint. In few days, he became completely blind.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=456}}\n===Fading away.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses. The request was approved, and Vrubel started receiving 75 rubles in summer and 100 rubles in winter months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=458}}\n\nAfter Vrubel lost his sight, his violent seizures occurred much rarer. Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him. Especially often they re-read [[Ivan Turgenev]] 's [[prose poetry]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] 's novella [[The Steppe (novella)|The Steppe]] on the grounds of which Vrubel once created a painting. Ekaterina Ge later recalled:\n{{quote|... Mikhail Alexandrovich was very much engaged into reading and could not stand only sad endings, and always composed a new one instead, a more happy one \u2026 sometimes he was so got into himself that could listen to neither reading nor songs and was telling something like fairytales of his emerald eyes, life in the ancient world and how he made all the famous [[Renaissance]] works.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}}}}\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel\u2019s funeral on April 3, 1910.

Some days he experienced enlightening and then complained about the misfortune that befell him. Besides, he followed the ascetic practices that promised to bring back his lost sight \u2013 refused to eat, stood the whole night before the bed. Vrubel could not even recognize his old friends, for example, Polenov.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=459}} Later Anna Vrubel recalled that in the last year her brother was saying that he is tired of living. In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\". Even before that the doctor Usoltsev wrote that \"It was different with him than with any other patients that usually lose the most thin or aesthetic sense first because for them they come the last; Vrubel's aesthetic sense died last because it was the first for him\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=461}}\n\nOn the eve of his death on 1 (14) April, 1910, Vrubel put himself in order, washed with cologne, and at night said to the nurse who was caring of him: \u201cNikolay, it\u2019s enough for me to lie here \u2013 we will go to the Academy.\u201d Indeed, the next day the coffin with Vrubel was put in the Academy of Arts.

He came back soon, took a large basin and a bucket of water, and poured some cologne from a beautiful bottle from  [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]]  into the water. He undressed and stood in a basin, pouring himself out of a bucket. Then he lighted the iron stove and put four eggs inside, and later ate them with a loaf of baked bread.

She was buried near with her husband. Russian sculptor [[Leonid Sherwood]] decided to construct the tombstone on their graves, but by 1913 he was able only to set up the black granite pedestal. After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. Then they started to move the graves of famous artists from the Novodevichy Cemetery to a new museum, but the transfer remained unfinished due to lack of finance and later beginning of the [[World War II|war]]. An alleged transfer of the Vrubel\u2019s ash did not take place as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://family-history.ru/material/biography/mesto/vrubel/mogila/ |title=\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 |publisher=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Family-History.ru |access-date=2014-11-17}}</ref> In 2015, the public initiated establishment of the new tombstone on the Vrubel\u2019s grave, but local authorities refused the installation<ref>{{cite web\n|title=\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://planeta.ru/campaigns/mihail_vrubel |publisher=Planeta.ru |access-date=2017-10-29}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0410. |title=\u0412 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26736/3763475/ |date=2017-09-26 |publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 |access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>\n\nVrubel\u2019s works are exhibited in [[The State Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow, [[Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg, Vrubel Museum of Fine Arts in Omsk, Kiev Art Gallery, [[Odessa Art Museum]], [[Belarusian National Arts Museum]], and other places.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D|title=\u041c. \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u201c\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u201d - \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c |publisher=www.artmuseum.by|accessdate=2019-01-11 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103060635/http://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D |archivedate=2019-01-03}}</ref> Many commemorative sights and objects are named after Vrubel in Omsk, Kiev, Voronezh, Moscow, Saratov, Odessa.\n\nMany researchers and critics have differently evaluated the impact that Vrubel had on Russian and Global art. According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia. Vrubel had to wait for his admirers, customers and patrons to appear only in the mid-1890s.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68, 73}}\n\n==In the cinema==\n* [[1953]] \u2014 ''[[Rimsky-Korsakov (film)|Rimsky-Korsakov]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430, \u0410. \u041d.\n|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0432 XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0435\n|publisher=\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|year=1999\n|pages=448\n|isbn=5-250-02693-1\n|ref=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412. \u042f.\n|title=\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430. \u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u041e\u041b\u041c\u0410-\u041f\u0420\u0415\u0421\u0421\n|year=2002\n|pages=415\n|isbn=5-94850-030-6\n|ref=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\n|title=\u0412\u0435\u0441\u044c \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 \u043d\u0430 1914 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0433. \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\n|place=Saint Petersburg\n|publisher=\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0410. \u0421. \u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\u00bb\n|year=1914\n|isbn=5-94030-052-9\n|ref=Suvorkin}} \n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\n|title=\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\n|place=Leningrad\n|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\n|year=1976\n|pages=383\n|ref=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d, \u041c. \u042e.\n|title=\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u0410\u0412\u0420\u041e\u0420\u0410\n|year=2010\n|pages=160\n|isbn=978-5-7300-0825-0\n|ref=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d. \u0410.\n|title=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432. \u0412\u044b\u043f.

19th-20th century Russian painter who worked in all genres of art, including painting, graphics, decorative sculpture, and theatrical art. In 1896, Vrubel married the famous singer [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]] whom he regularly painted. \n\nSoviet historian {{ill|Nina Dmitrieva|ru|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} compared Vrubel\u2019s artistic biography to a three-act drama with prologue and epilogue, while the transition between acts was rapid and unexpected. The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically {{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}.\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

Great-grandfather of the artist \u2013 Anton Antonovich Vrubel \u2013 was originally from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and served as a judge in his local town. His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military.

At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863.

In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting.

The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century.

Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|...

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition.

To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum.

The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]]{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}.\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle. Fresco sketch for the Vladimir Cathedral, 1887]]\nAfter returning from Venice in 1885, Vrubel spent May and part of June in Kiev. There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"...

Edwards, together with [[Kyriak Kostandi]], tried to reform the Odessa Art School and decided to decided to elicit Vrubel's help. He settled Vrubel in his own house and tried to persuade him to stay in Odessa forever.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=151\u2014153}} In summer, Serov arrived in Odessa and Vrubel for the first time told him about his plan to paint the \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\". In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version.

Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\n\nAt the same time, Adrian Prakhov organized painting of the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] and, without regard to his personal attitudes, invited Vrubel. Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The plot is not present in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but could be seen in some icons from  the period of Italian Renaissance. However, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings even though he clearly understood their significance and originality. The reason for this was that these paintings differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would only unbalance a relative integrity of already assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noticed that the whole new cathedral \"in a very special style\" needs to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint the composition \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously appealed to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer his acquired during the painting of sacred images techniques to  create completely the opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would unlikely connect both with the public and the critics from the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued the destroyed shit together. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich \u2013 the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait - fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis manifested itself in the following incident. Once, Vrubel visited Prakhov where was already a company of artists participating in the painting of the cathedral. Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and he will have to urgently travel to Kharkiv; thus, painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for a sun. Confused Prakhiv had to explain to him the Vrubel\u2019s disappearance with his infatuation with one English singer from the cafesantan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=183\u2014184}} Furthermore, friends tried to ensure that Vrubel gets a regular income. He was assigned with a minor work in the Vladimyr's Cathedral \u2013 to draw ornaments and the \"Seven days for an eternity\" in one of the [[plafond]]s according to the sketches made by brothers [[Pavel Svedomsky|Pavel]] and {{ill|Alexander Swedomsky|ru|\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. In this cohort, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the attention of the publishers to Vrubel.

However, Vrubel' illustrations passed with difficulties since due to its complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. However, the main difficulty was the fact that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. Despite this, on April 10, 1891, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] and right after the publication was widely discussed in the press. It was the press that harshly criticized illustrations made by Vrubel, primarily for its \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him and thus the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious in his eyes as for others was  \"incomprehensibility\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the plot and at the same time made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist.

Later was used as a stamp of Abramtsevo factory]] \n\nOn July 20, 1890, a 22-year old painter A. Mamontov died in the [[Abramtsevo Colony]]. His friend Mikhail Vrubel attended the funeral and was so fond of local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that Mikhail proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and by any means was trying to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to be a freeloader in noble families and started earning good money by fulfilling orders on several furnace compositions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

From the one hand, movement supporters discussed a revival of Russian traditional crafts. From the other hand, machine fabrication contradicted the uniqueness which was the main art principle in Art Nouveau.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|pp=195\u2014196}} Vrubel worked in both Abramtsevo and Talashkino. However, both of these studies differed in the accents of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolic art in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow. Beautiful in colours, but the face had gumboil and angry eyes. How ironic, he had to come to Rome to paint the Russian winter.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=268}}}}\n\nVrubel continued to work in Abramtsevo.

The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place. The figures were chaotically arranged, \"compressing\" space, which is projected onto the plane. A pair for the Venice became the \"Spain\" which critics recognize as one of the Vrubel's most perfectly arranged paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=55}}\n\n===Decorative works===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043d\u0438.jpg|thumb|left|\u201dRobert and the Nuns.

Due to regular commissioned works made for Mamontov, Vrubel\u2019s reputation in Moscow grew greatly. For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A. Morozov's house in Podsosenskiy lane.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=272}}\n\nVrubel' decorative works illustrate how universal his talents were. The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau. The artist created several compositions (small sculptural plastics from maiolica and tiles) which decorated important buildings in modern and pseudo-Russian style ([[Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station]], {{ill|Osobnyak M.

Thus, Benois demanded from Vrubel sketches of the alleged panels. After arriving in Nizhny Novgorod on April 25, Benois sent a telegram: \n{{quote| Vrubel's panels are terrifying; we need to take them off, waiting for the juri.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=304}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

On the contrary, Maxim Gorky was against Vrubel. He made fun of \"Mikula\" by comparing it with a fictional character Chernomor. \"The Princess of the Dream\" resent him with its \"antics, ugliness of otherwise beautiful plot\". In five articles, Gorky exposed Vrubel's \"poverty of spirit and poverty of imagination\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=309\u2014311}}\n\n[[File:Vrubel Siren.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Lilacs, 1900.

Around the same time, the Russian premiere of the [[fairy-tail opera]] \u201c[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]\u201d was about to take place.

Originally, Konstantin Korovin was responsible for the decorations and costumes but because of illness had to renounce the order in favour of Mikhail Vrubel who had never even attended an opera before.

Nevertheless, on July 28 they engaged in the [[Russian Church, Geneva|Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] in Geneva, Switzerland. The couple spent their honeymoon in a guesthouse in [[Lucerne]]. Then Vrubel continued his work on the panel for the Morozov\u2019s gothic cabinet.

However, Vrubel did not many commissions in the city and had to live on his wife\u2019s money. This prompted him to turn to theatrical painting and costume designs.

His [[migraine]]s got so strong that the painter had to take [[phenacetin]] in large quantities (according to his sister in law \u2013 up to 25 [[grain]]s and more).

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]].

Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom.

Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively.

Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910)==\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

At the same time, Vrubel\u2019s hallucinations were caused by a [[bipolar disorder]] common among artists.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=437}} Due to progressive methods applied in the Usoltsev's clinic and frequent visits of Nadezhda and Anna Vrubel (they rented a house nearby and visited Mikhail daily), Vrubel almost fully rehabilitated. Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients. The doctor constantly invited artists and singers for organized house concerts. Patients attended evening events together with medical staff{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}. Usoltsev valued Vrubel's art and in every possible way, encouraged his creative pursuits.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906.

His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time.

However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis.

On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses.

Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him.

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\".

Hence he borrowed 25 rubles from me and left. He came back soon, took a large basin and a bucket of water, and poured some cologne from a beautiful bottle from  [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]]  into the water. He undressed and stood in a basin, pouring himself out of a bucket. Then he lighted the iron stove and put four eggs inside, and later ate them with a loaf of baked bread.

After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].

According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia.

HURDAT is the official source for hurricane data such as track and intensity, although due to sparse records, listings on some storms are incomplete.\n\nThe first tropical cyclone was a hurricane observed in the [[Tuxpan]] area of [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]], on July&nbsp;1. Hurricane conditions were observed along the coast and several vessels were lost. On September&nbsp;2, another hurricane struck [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], damaging ships on the former. The fifth storm of the season, possibly the most devastating of the season, brought storm surge and hurricane-force winds to the [[Florida Panhandle]] and [[Mobile, Alabama]], as well as flooding and wind damage to some areas of the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]]. In early October, the sixth cyclone brought damage to Inagua in the Bahamas. At least 25 boats sunk, with several people drowning after one vessel capsized. Two ships capsized in the Bahamas due to the seventh storm. A ship in the Gulf of Mexico capsized during the eighth and final cyclone, drowning an unknown number of people.

It existed in the northwestern Atlantic in the middle of August with the only evidence of the storm being reports from two vessels in the vicinity of bad weather. One vessel, the ''Tornado'', encountered severe winds, starting on August&nbsp;17, which forced her to abandon her easterly course and sail into [[New York City]].

It was described by W. H. Alexander in a 1902 publication as a \"mild\" system which passed over [[St. Kitts]] and later [[St. Croix]] on September&nbsp;2. A short track formulated for the storm in 1995 indicated a path across the northern [[Lesser Antilles]] on September&nbsp;2; the track was shifted slightly toward the south for its inclusion within HURDAT.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}<ref name=\"Partagas2\"/> The highest sustained winds are estimated to have been 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h).{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Hurricane Four===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=1859 Atlantic hurricane 4 track.png\n|Formed=September 12\n|Dissipated=September 13\n|1-min winds=90\n}}\nBased on reports of strong winds from a ship near 40\u00b0N, 50\u00b0W, Partag\u00e1s documented another new storm near that point on September 12.<ref name=\"Partagas2\"/> As with the previous hurricane, no track existed for this storm until the 1995 HURDAT, when more extensive observations from several additional vessels were utilized. At least four ships sustained structural damage or took on water, and the ''Bell Flower'' lost her captain and a crew member to the sea.

After a wharf was flooded, authorities warned residents to seek higher ground. Businesses also moved their merchandise to the second floors of their buildings. Wharves, bathhouses, bales, barrels, and boxes washed away. The train system was also interrupted for a few days. A few ships, such as the schooner ''W W. Harkness'' and the steamboat ''Crescent'' suffered damage. Winds downed fences, trees, and telegraph lines. Damage reached at least US$10,000. Later, flooding was reported in [[Virginia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. The [[Potomac River]] rose considerably in some areas of Virginia and Washington, D.C., especially at [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], where water reached the wharves.

Garriott in 1900. After being first observed by a ship near [[Jamaica]] on October&nbsp;2, the hurricane tracked northward over the extreme eastern tip of Cuba, according to its reconstructed track. Heavy weather was reported in [[Baracoa]]. The storm later reached southeastern [[Bahamas]], where the cyclone severely impacted the [[Inagua]] region on October 2 and 3, destroying at least 25&nbsp;boats. Several ships underway around Inagua endured rough seas and strong winds; \"several of the crew and two soldiers\" aboard one vessel wrecked by the hurricane died.<ref name=\"Partagas4\"/> Meteorological reports from ships confirm that the hurricane continued northward, passing about midway between [[Bermuda]] and the [[East Coast of the United States]].

It created the [[Northwest Territory]], the first [[organized territory]] of the United States, from lands beyond the [[Appalachian Mountains]], between [[British North America]] and the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Ohio River]] to the south. The upper [[Mississippi River]] formed the territory's western boundary. \n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which formally ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] yielded this region to the United States. However, the Confederation Congress faced numerous problems gaining control of the land; these included: the unsanctioned movement of [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory|American settlers]] into the Ohio Valley, violent confrontations with the region's [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]], the ongoing presence of the British Army which continued to occupy forts in the region, and an empty U.S. treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Land Ordinance of 1785| url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Land_Ordinance_of_1785?rec=1472| publisher=Ohio History Central| accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref> The ordinance superseded the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] (which declared that [[U.S. state|states]] would one day be formed within the region) and the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] (which described how the Confederation Congress would sell the land to private citizens). Designed to serve as a blueprint for the development and settlement of the region, what the 1787 ordinance lacked was a strong central government to implement it. This need was addressed shortly thereafter, when the new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] came into existence in 1789.

It also helped set the stage for later political conflicts over slavery at the federal level in the 19th century until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Context and history==\n{{Main|Northwest Territory}}\n\nThe territory was acquired by [[Great Britain]] from [[France]] following victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]]. Great Britain took over the [[Ohio Country]], as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later closed it to new European settlement by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].  The Crown tried to restrict settlement of the thirteen colonies between the Appalachians and the Atlantic, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. With the colonials' victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and signing of the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the United States claimed the territory, as well as the areas south of the Ohio.  The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting [[State cession|claims of the states]] of [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]] dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border area until after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe region had long been desired for expansion by colonists.  The states were encouraged to settle their claims by the US government's ''de facto'' opening of the area to settlement following the defeat of Great Britain.  In 1784, Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, proposed that the states should relinquish their particular claims to all the territory west of the Appalachians, and the area should be divided into new states of the Union. Jefferson's proposal to create a federal domain through state cessions of western lands was derived from earlier proposals dating back to 1776 and debates about the [[Articles of Confederation]].<ref name=hubbard>{{Cite book|last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 46\u201347, 114}}</ref> Jefferson proposed creating ten roughly rectangular states from the territory, and suggested names for the new states: ''Cherronesus'', ''Sylvania'', ''Assenisipia'', ''Illinoia'', ''Metropotamia'', ''Polypotamia'', ''Pelisipia'', ''Washington'', ''Michigania'' and ''Saratoga''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 }}</ref> The Congress of the Confederation modified the proposal, passing it as the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]].  This ordinance established the example that would become the basis for the Northwest Ordinance three years later.\n\nThe 1784 ordinance was criticized by [[George Washington]] in 1785 and [[James Monroe]] in 1786. Monroe convinced Congress to reconsider the proposed state boundaries; a review committee recommended repealing that part of the ordinance. Other politicians questioned the 1784 ordinance's plan for organizing governments in new states, and worried that the new states' relatively small sizes would undermine the original states' power in Congress. Other events such as the reluctance of states south of the Ohio River to cede their western claims resulted in a narrowed geographic focus.<ref name=hubbard/>\n\nWhen passed in New York in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance showed the influence of Jefferson. It called for dividing the territory into gridded townships, so that once the lands were surveyed, they could be sold to individuals and speculative land companies.  This would provide both a new source of federal government revenue and an orderly pattern for future settlement.<ref>Jerel A. Rosati, James M.

These territories were to be administered directly by Congress, with the intent of their eventual admission as newly created states. The legislation was revolutionary in that it established the precedent for new lands to be administered by the central government, albeit temporarily, rather than under the jurisdiction of the individually sovereign original states, as it was with the [[Articles of Confederation]].  The legislation also broke colonial precedent by defining future use of the natural navigation, transportation and communication routes; it did so in a way that anticipated future acquisitions beyond the Northwest Territories, and established federal policy.<ref name=\"Nat&WatRes\">''The Nation and its Water Resources'', Leonard B.

It provided that at least three but not more than five states would be established in the territory, and that once such a state achieved a population of 60,000 it would be admitted into representation in the Continental Congress on an [[equal footing]] with the original thirteen states. The first state created from the Northwest Territory was [[Ohio]], in 1803, at which time the remainder was renamed Indiana Territory. The other four states were Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A portion (about a third) of what later became the state of Minnesota was also part of the territory.\n\n===Education===\nThe ordinance of Congress called for a [[public university]] as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the [[Northwest Territory]], further stipulating, \"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" In 1786, [[Manasseh Cutler]] became interested in the settlement of western lands by [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory]]. The following year, as agent of the [[Ohio Company of Associates]] that he had been involved in creating, he organized a contract with Congress whereby his associates (former soldiers of the Revolutionary War) might purchase {{convert|1,500,000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land at the mouth of the [[Muskingum River]] with their Certificate of Indebtedness. Cutler also took a leading part in drafting the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was finally presented to Congress by Massachusetts delegate [[Nathan Dane]]. To smooth passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Cutler bribed key congressmen by making them partners in his land company.  By changing the office of provisional governor from an elected to an appointed position, Cutler was able to offer the position to the president of Congress, Arthur St. Clair.<ref>McDougall, Walter A.

It created the [[Northwest Territory]], the first [[organized territory]] of the United States, from lands beyond the [[Appalachian Mountains]], between [[British North America]] and the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Ohio River]] to the south. The upper [[Mississippi River]] formed the territory's western boundary. \n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which formally ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] yielded this region to the United States.

Designed to serve as a blueprint for the development and settlement of the region, what the 1787 ordinance lacked was a strong central government to implement it. This need was addressed shortly thereafter, when the new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] came into existence in 1789.

It also helped set the stage for later political conflicts over slavery at the federal level in the 19th century until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Context and history==\n{{Main|Northwest Territory}}\n\nThe territory was acquired by [[Great Britain]] from [[France]] following victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]]. Great Britain took over the [[Ohio Country]], as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later closed it to new European settlement by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].  The Crown tried to restrict settlement of the thirteen colonies between the Appalachians and the Atlantic, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. With the colonials' victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and signing of the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the United States claimed the territory, as well as the areas south of the Ohio.  The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting [[State cession|claims of the states]] of [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]] dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border area until after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe region had long been desired for expansion by colonists.  The states were encouraged to settle their claims by the US government's ''de facto'' opening of the area to settlement following the defeat of Great Britain.  In 1784, Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, proposed that the states should relinquish their particular claims to all the territory west of the Appalachians, and the area should be divided into new states of the Union. Jefferson's proposal to create a federal domain through state cessions of western lands was derived from earlier proposals dating back to 1776 and debates about the [[Articles of Confederation]].<ref name=hubbard>{{Cite book|last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 46\u201347, 114}}</ref> Jefferson proposed creating ten roughly rectangular states from the territory, and suggested names for the new states: ''Cherronesus'', ''Sylvania'', ''Assenisipia'', ''Illinoia'', ''Metropotamia'', ''Polypotamia'', ''Pelisipia'', ''Washington'', ''Michigania'' and ''Saratoga''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 }}</ref> The Congress of the Confederation modified the proposal, passing it as the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]].

Monroe convinced Congress to reconsider the proposed state boundaries; a review committee recommended repealing that part of the ordinance. Other politicians questioned the 1784 ordinance's plan for organizing governments in new states, and worried that the new states' relatively small sizes would undermine the original states' power in Congress. Other events such as the reluctance of states south of the Ohio River to cede their western claims resulted in a narrowed geographic focus.<ref name=hubbard/>\n\nWhen passed in New York in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance showed the influence of Jefferson.

This was called the \"first guarantee of freedom of contract in the United States\".<ref>\n{{cite book |title      = The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else\n |last       = De Soto\n |first      = Hernando\n |year       = 2000\n |publisher  = Basic Books\n |location   = \n |isbn       = 978-0465016143\n |pages      = \n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/mysteryofcapital00soto\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Abolition and transfer of state claims===\n{{Main|State cession}}\n\nPassage of the ordinance, which ceded all unsettled lands to the federal government and established the [[Public domain (land)|public domain]], followed the relinquishing of all such claims over the territory by the states. These territories were to be administered directly by Congress, with the intent of their eventual admission as newly created states. The legislation was revolutionary in that it established the precedent for new lands to be administered by the central government, albeit temporarily, rather than under the jurisdiction of the individually sovereign original states, as it was with the [[Articles of Confederation]].  The legislation also broke colonial precedent by defining future use of the natural navigation, transportation and communication routes; it did so in a way that anticipated future acquisitions beyond the Northwest Territories, and established federal policy.<ref name=\"Nat&WatRes\">''The Nation and its Water Resources'', Leonard B.

It provided that at least three but not more than five states would be established in the territory, and that once such a state achieved a population of 60,000 it would be admitted into representation in the Continental Congress on an [[equal footing]] with the original thirteen states. The first state created from the Northwest Territory was [[Ohio]], in 1803, at which time the remainder was renamed Indiana Territory. The other four states were Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A portion (about a third) of what later became the state of Minnesota was also part of the territory.\n\n===Education===\nThe ordinance of Congress called for a [[public university]] as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the [[Northwest Territory]], further stipulating, \"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" In 1786, [[Manasseh Cutler]] became interested in the settlement of western lands by [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory]]. The following year, as agent of the [[Ohio Company of Associates]] that he had been involved in creating, he organized a contract with Congress whereby his associates (former soldiers of the Revolutionary War) might purchase {{convert|1,500,000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land at the mouth of the [[Muskingum River]] with their Certificate of Indebtedness. Cutler also took a leading part in drafting the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was finally presented to Congress by Massachusetts delegate [[Nathan Dane]]. To smooth passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Cutler bribed key congressmen by making them partners in his land company.  By changing the office of provisional governor from an elected to an appointed position, Cutler was able to offer the position to the president of Congress, Arthur St. Clair.<ref>McDougall, Walter A.

Originally named in 1802 as the American Western University, the school never opened. Instead, [[Ohio University]] was formally established on February 18, 1804, when its charter was approved by the Ohio General Assembly. Its establishment came 11 months after [[Ohio]] was admitted to the Union. The first three students enrolled in 1809. Ohio University graduated two students with bachelor's degrees in 1815.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=786|title=Ohio University|publisher=Ohio History Central: An Online Encyclopedia of Ohio History|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of territorial government===\nWhile the population of free, male inhabitants of a territory was less than 5,000, there would be a limited form of government: a governor, a secretary, and three judges, all appointed by Congress. The governor\u2014appointed for a three-year term and given a \"freehold estate therein, in one thousand acres of land\"\u2014would be commander-in-chief of the militia, appoint magistrates and other civil officers, and help create and publish laws as they saw fit for their territory. The secretary\u2014appointed for a four-year term and given a similar freehold estate as the governor but of five hundred acres\u2014would be in charge of keeping and preserving the acts and laws passed by the territorial legislatures, keeping the public records of the district, and transmitting authentic copies of such acts and proceedings every six months to the secretary of the Continental Congress. Three judges\u2014whose appointments would continue indefinitely \"during good behaviour\" and each given the same freehold as the secretary\u2014would be in charge of helping the governor create and pass acts and laws and in making official court rulings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northwest Ordinance |url=http://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html |date=July 13, 1787 |pages=335\u2013337 |website=Library of Congress |department=Primary Documents in American History |access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOnce the population of a territory reached 5,000 free, male inhabitants, then they would receive authority to elect representatives from their counties or townships to a territorial general assembly. For every 500 free males there would be one representative, until there were 25 representatives. Then the Congress would control the number and proportion of the representatives from that legislature. No male could be a representative unless they were a citizen of the United States for at least three years or lived in the district for three years and who did not own at least 200 acres of land within the same district. These representatives would serve for a term of two years. If a representative died or was removed from office, a new one would be elected to serve out the remaining time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northwest Ordinance |url=http://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html |date=July 13, 1787 |pages=337\u2013338 |website=Library of Congress |department=Primary Documents in American History |access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of natural rights===\nThe [[natural rights]] provisions of the ordinance foreshadowed the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the first ten amendments to the [[U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chardavoyne |first1=David G. |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last=Finkelman\n| editor2-last  = Hershock | editor2-first = Martin J. |title=The history of Michigan law |series=Ohio University Press series on law, society, and politics in the Midwest |year=2006 |publisher=Ohio University Press |location=Athens, Ohio |isbn=978-0-8214-1661-7 |oclc=65205057 |chapter=The Northwest Ordinance and Michigan's Territorial Heritage |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjSD45-P2_YC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote=Its provisions established a structure of government that encouraged settlement of that vast region and provided those settlers a startling set of civil rights that presaged the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights }}</ref> Many of the concepts and guarantees of the Ordinance of 1787 were incorporated in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

In a conflict sometimes known as the [[Northwest Indian War]], [[Blue Jacket]] of the [[Shawnee]]s and [[Little Turtle]] of the [[Miami tribe|Miamis]] formed a confederation to stop white expropriation of the territory. After the Indian confederation had killed more than 800 soldiers in two battles \u2013 the worst defeats ever suffered by the U.S. at the hands of the Indians \u2013 [[George Washington|President Washington]] assigned [[Anthony Wayne|General Anthony Wayne]] command of a [[Legion of the United States|new army]], which eventually defeated the confederation and thus allowed European-Americans to continue settling the territory.\n\n==Commemoration==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"min-width:200px\" |[[File:DSCN3504 ohiocompany e.JPG|200px]]\n|In 1907, a plaque commemorating the \"first permanent settlement in the territory northwest of the Ohio\" and the Northwest Ordinance was placed on the exterior of the [[Federal Hall National Memorial]] at the corner of Broad and Nassau Streets in [[Lower Manhattan]].
