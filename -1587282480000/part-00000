At the time, Coulter was a [[Pizza Hut]] Franchisee, and later founded and ran [[Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon|Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon]] and other chains.

With the help of his family as tasters, he decided to put four sandwiches on his original menu. On January 13, 1983 Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches opened in [[Charleston, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Bloomberg: Jimmy John's Founder Abandons IPO, Saying He's Not a Wall Street Guy\" /><ref name=\"Success: Success Stories: Jimmy John Liautaud\" /> Due to the poor location of his first store, Liautaud decided to include delivery of his sandwiches to boost sales. He began by bringing samples door-to-door to the nearby Eastern Illinois University dorms.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune: Jimmy John's founder opens up on expansion, big game hunting, possible IPO\" /> By the end of his first year, the restaurant started making a profit. At the end of his second year, Liautaud was able to purchase his father's share in the business and he became sole owner. The business continued to grow, and he was able to open his second and third shops in 1986 and 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Liautaud met businessman Jamie Coulter. At the time, Coulter was a [[Pizza Hut]] Franchisee, and later founded and ran [[Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon|Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon]] and other chains. Coulter helped Liautaud take his business to the next level.

Sons live with their father's clan, and when daughters marry, they go to live with the clan of their husband.  However, inheritance of wealth does not follow the patriclan but is determined by the matriclan, that is, a son does not inherit his father's cattle but his maternal uncle's instead. Along with the inheritance of wealth, moral obligations are also important within the tribal structure. When a person dies, the OvaHimba evaluate the care of those who are left behind, such as orphans and widows. Access to water-points and pastures are another part of the OvaHimba inheritance structure.\n\nBilateral descent is found among only a few groups in West Africa, India, Australia, Melanesia and Polynesia, and anthropologists consider the system advantageous for groups that live in extreme environments because it allows individuals to rely on two sets of kin dispersed over a wide area.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=0005596A-DE68-1C6F-84A9809EC588EF21|title=The Himba and the Dam|first=Carol|last=Ezzell|date=17 June 2001|magazine=[[Scientific American]]|url-access=subscription|journal=|access-date=20 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012142329/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=0005596A-DE68-1C6F-84A9809EC588EF21|archive-date=12 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe OvaHimba history is fraught with disasters, including severe droughts and guerrilla warfare, especially during Namibia's war of independence and as a result of the civil war in neighboring [[Angola]].

Members live under a tribal structure based on [[bilateral descent]] that helps them live in one of the most extreme environments on earth.\n\n[[File:Himba-Arbeit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Himba girl at work]]\nUnder bilateral descent, every tribe member belongs to two clans: one through the father (a patriclan, called ''oruzo'') and another through the mother (a matriclan, called ''eanda'').{{sfn|Crandall|2000}} Himba clans are led by the eldest male in the clan.  Sons live with their father's clan, and when daughters marry, they go to live with the clan of their husband.  However, inheritance of wealth does not follow the patriclan but is determined by the matriclan, that is, a son does not inherit his father's cattle but his maternal uncle's instead. Along with the inheritance of wealth, moral obligations are also important within the tribal structure.

The station is owned by the [[CBS Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Sacramento-licensed [[The CW|CW]] owned-and-operated station [[KMAX-TV]] (channel 31). The two stations share studios on KOVR Drive in [[West Sacramento, California|West Sacramento]] and [[KXTV/KOVR tower|transmitter facilities]] in [[Walnut Grove, California|Walnut Grove]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe station first signed on the air on September 6, 1954, with its first broadcast originating from the [[California State Fair]]. KOVR is the oldest continuously operating television station in the Sacramento market. Originally serving as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] with its transmitter located on [[Mount Diablo]], its signal reached the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], lending to the KOVR call letters (\"covering\" all of [[Northern California]]). The station originally operated from studio facilities located on Miner Avenue in Stockton. [[Art Finley]] hosted an afternoon [[children's television series|children's program]], ''Toonytown'', on the station for several years, before moving to [[San Francisco]]'s [[KRON-TV]].\n\n===As an ABC affiliate===\nIn May 1957, KOVR merged its operations with Sacramento's original [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, KCCC-TV (channel 40, which signed on eleven months before KOVR in September 1953). KCCC shut down, with KOVR acquiring the ABC affiliation. At the network's request, the station moved its transmitter facilities to a temporary site near [[Jackson, California|Jackson]] to avoid competition with [[KGO-TV]] in San Francisco. By this time, it was obvious that Sacramento, Stockton and [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] were going to be a single television market. In 1960, KOVR teamed up with [[KCRA-TV]] (channel 3) and [[KXTV]] (channel 10) to build a new [[KXTV/KOVR/KCRA Tower|{{convert|1,549|ft|m|sing=on}} tower]] in Walnut Grove. In 1985, KOVR and KXTV moved to their current {{convert|2049|ft|m|sing=on}} tower while KCRA moved to [[Hearst-Argyle Tower|its own {{convert|2000|ft|m|sing=on}} tower]]; KCRA still uses the old tower as an auxiliary facility.\n\nIn 1958, the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]] (whose successor company, [[Tegna Inc.|Tegna]], now owns rival KXTV) bought KOVR from its original owners, then sold it the following year to [[John Kluge]]'s Metropolitan Broadcasting (which later became [[Metromedia]]). In 1960, the station moved its business offices and news department to a new studio facility on Arden Way in Sacramento. In 1987, KOVR consolidated its operations into its current facility in West Sacramento.\n\n[[Image:651211-KOVR News 1965.png|thumb|250px|A 1965 advertisement for then ABC affiliate KOVR touting [[Peter Jennings]] as anchor of ''[[ABC World News Tonight|Peter Jennings with the News]]''.]]\nMetromedia sold KOVR to [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers]] in 1964. McClatchy ran the station alongside ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'' and ''[[Modesto Bee]]'' newspapers, as well as radio stations [[KWG (AM)|KWG]] (1230 AM) in Stockton, [[KESP|KBEE]] (970 AM) in Modesto and [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]] (1530 AM) in Sacramento. McClatchy was able to own KOVR, KWG, KBEE and KFBK because Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto, then as now, were separate radio markets. McClatchy had established a trio of bee mascots (originally designed by [[Walt Disney]], whose [[The Walt Disney Company|namesake company]] would eventually acquire ABC in 1996) for its properties. Teevee the Bee was KOVR's official mascot during the years that McClatchy owned the station \u2013 short cartoons of the bee bookended KOVR's broadcast day, either ushering in or concluding the day's programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNgecUK3SJA|title=KOVR \"McClatchy Bee\" Sign-Off|first=|last=KLXT77|date=April 6, 2008|publisher=|access-date=February 22, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAfter McClatchy sold the station to [[The Outlet Company|Outlet Communications]] in 1978, KOVR went into a gradual decline in terms of both ratings and programming quality (even as ABC became the country's highest-rated network), and has been in third place in the Sacramento ratings for most of the time since then. The station was then sold to Narragansett Television [[Limited partnership|LP]] in 1986, then to Anchor Media in 1988. Anchor Media was merged into [[River City Broadcasting]] in 1993, and River City was purchased by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] three years later. KOVR has made some firsts in local broadcasting: it was the first station in Northern California to use [[videotape]] (rather than film) for its newscasts, and was the first station in the Sacramento/Stockton area to broadcast in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]].\n\nAs an ABC affiliate, KOVR preempted a moderate amount of programming, even the 30-minute soap opera ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]''. It also aired some ABC programming out of pattern: ''[[All My Children]]'' in the early years was aired at 11 a.m. (half of ABC's affiliates aired the soap at 11 a.m. to follow it with their noon newscasts; until the series was cancelled in 2011, the network recommended that the program run in the noon timeslot). In the mid-1990s, KOVR moved the soap opera to 3 p.m., a practice continued by KXTV following its affiliation switch with KOVR until the early 2000s.\n\n===Switching to CBS===\nOn March 6, 1995, KOVR [[1994-96 United States broadcast TV realignment|swapped networks]] with longtime [[CBS]] affiliate KXTV; KOVR is the third station in Sacramento to have been affiliated with CBS: before moving to KXTV, KCCC carried the network secondarily to its primary ABC affiliation. Despite joining CBS, KOVR chose not to air ''[[Guiding Light]]'', a practice originated by KXTV during its CBS days (due to the show's below-average ratings in the area). When the program ended its run on September 18, 2009, it was one of only two CBS affiliates that did not carry the show; the other, [[WNEM-TV]] in [[Bay City, Michigan]], aired it on a [[MyNetworkTV]]-affiliated [[digital subchannel]]. During ''Guiding Light''{{'}}s last 16 seasons, Sacramento viewers had to view it on cable via future sister station [[KPIX]].\n\n[[Image:KOVR.jpg|thumb|KOVR's previous logo, under Sinclair ownership. This logo is similar to a former logo of another Sinclair-owned station, [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]]'s [[WGME]].]]\nA more notable oddity with KOVR's affiliation with CBS is that the station runs the network's prime time lineup one hour earlier than the standard 8 (7 on Sundays) to 11 p.m. scheduling for the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] as well as the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] time zones, opting to run it from 7 to 10 p.m. (the standard scheduling used by stations in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones). When KOVR was an ABC affiliate, the station had an 11 p.m. newscast like most stations on the coastal time zones. Upon the network switch, the station followed the then-practice of now-sister station KPIX in having an hour-long prime time newscast at 10 p.m. (KPIX later moved its late evening newscast back to the 11 p.m. slot in 1998). In recent ratings periods, KOVR has battled [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KTXL]] (channel 40) for the lead among the newscasts in the 10 p.m. timeslot, with KOVR leading in total households and KTXL leading in the key demographics.\n\nIn 2001, KOVR gained attention when it landed a \"local exclusive\" interview with Congressman [[Gary Condit]] regarding the [[Chandra Levy]] murder case (Condit appeared the same evening on ABC, in an interview with [[Connie Chung]]). The station televised an interview on August 30 in which Condit claimed that he did not kill Levy after a visit with the slain intern. Despite numerous KOVR reports filed by reporter Gloria Gomez, the Condit interview was granted to another KOVR reporter, Jodi Hernandez. Much of the national interest in the case was lost days later, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nIn December 2004, Sinclair sold KOVR to [[Viacom (1971\u20132005)|Viacom]] Television Stations Group (now part of [[ViacomCBS]] as [[CBS Television Stations]]), creating the third duopoly in the Sacramento market with [[KMAX-TV]] (channel 31, then a [[UPN]] owned-and-operated station, now a [[The CW|CW]] O&O) and CBS' third television duopoly in California (after [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]; and KPIX and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]] in San Francisco). Viacom was forced to sell [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC radio]] in San Francisco as a condition of the sale, as the station's city-grade signal reaches Sacramento; the purchase was finalized on April 29, 2005. The station then changed its on-air branding from \"KOVR 13\" to \"CBS 13\".\n\n==Digital television==\n\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After CBS purchased channel 13, some, including station management, had speculated that KOVR would move the CBS prime time lineup back to its standard 8\u201311 p.m. slot and add ''Guiding Light'' to the schedule, as well as drop ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]''. It was assumed that as an O&O, KOVR would have to carry ''Guiding Light'' (most network-owned stations run the entire network programming schedule, with exceptions only for breaking news coverage or special programming). However, on May 3, 2005, CBS announced that it would make no immediate programming changes, including any addition of ''Guiding Light'' (which remained off the station through its final episode in September 2009).\n\nOn August 11, 2005, CBS announced that KOVR's 7\u201310 p.m. scheduling of the prime time lineup, the 10 p.m. newscast and the 11 p.m. airing of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' would remain in place due to the success of the early prime schedule. At that point, it also stated that ''Guiding Light'' would not join the KOVR schedule; it is believed that this was based on the logic that a show that had not been available in the market for over 14 years would not receive good ratings, and that there were few requests to run the program. On July 31, 2006, KOVR received approval from CBS to move the weekend prime time lineup back an hour in order to maintain an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast seven days a week, to take effect August 27. ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' (which had been airing at 1 a.m.) was also pushed one hour earlier, while ''Jerry Springer'' (which aired at 3 p.m. until September 8, 2006) was bumped to a later timeslot before moving to [[KMAX-TV]] in September 2006 (the program moved to [[KQCA]] one year later). KOVR began clearing the entire CBS network schedule in September 2009, after ''Guiding Light'' ended and was temporarily replaced by a secondary run of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''; ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' began airing the following month at 9 a.m. (outside of the show's more common 2 p.m. slot for stations in the Pacific Time Zone).\n\nOn July 30, 2018, KOVR began airing a newscast at 11 p.m., relocating the program from sister station KMAX-TV where it has aired for six years. ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' moved to 11:35 p.m. and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]'' moved to 12:37 a.m. The scheduling changes marked the first time KOVR will air an 11 p.m. weeknight newscast since its affiliation switch from ABC to CBS in 1995. It also marked the first time since 1995 the CBS late night lineup on KOVR will be in pattern with the rest of the CBS stations in the Pacific Time Zone.\n\n==News operation==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}\nKOVR presently broadcasts 37 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6\u00bd hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and 2\u00bd hours on Sundays). KOVR debuted its noon newscast in 1965 as a 15-minute broadcast, which was followed by ''People, Places & Things'' at 12:15&nbsp;p.m. In the 1980s, KOVR aired the ABC soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' at 11 a.m. (on a day-behind [[broadcast delay|tape delay]]) in order to free the noon slot for the newscast.\n\nWhile under Sinclair ownership, KOVR had worked with a small to medium-sized news staff, unusual considering Sacramento's dramatic growth during the 1980s had made it a top-20 market. It was one of several Sinclair-owned stations that did not participate in Sinclair's controversial ''[[News Central]]'' hybrid news format; this [[Centralcasting|centralized]] operation incorporated national news segments, local [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] segments, and some sports coverage based out of studios at Sinclair's corporate headquarters on Beaver Dam Road in [[Hunt Valley, Maryland|Hunt Valley]], [[Maryland]] that was supplemented by local content at most of Sinclair's in-house news departments. After CBS purchased KOVR, both it and KMAX-TV's news departments were consolidated at KOVR's West Sacramento facility. On-air staff from both stations periodically appear on their respective newscasts.\n\nMost of KOVR's on-air staffers that were with the station under Sinclair ownership have either been fired or have resigned. Dismissals of former lead anchors Paul Joncich and Jennifer Whitney were sudden and unannounced whereas Marcy Valenzuela and Jennifer Krier were allowed to say farewell to viewers on air. Remaining on-air staff include chief meteorologist [[Dave Bender]] and investigative reporter Kurtis Ming. On February 1, 2006, Pallas Hup\u00e9 and former KCRA anchor Sam Shane became the station's new main anchor team; the evening newscast also instituted a three-anchor format, which began with Shane and Hup\u00e9 anchoring the day's major news stories, deferring to anchor/reporter Christina Anderson (now Janes) for national and international headlines. The unique three-anchor setup remained during the weekend 10 p.m. newscasts with rotating anchors. In July 2006, KOVR debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast on weekdays. In January 2018, KOVR reinstated a sports department, which has been without one since the departure of John Henk in the late 1990s.\n\nIn October 2008, KOVR began broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high-definition]]. Only the in-studio segments are presented in HD; however, for over a year-and-a-half after KTXL upgraded its newscasts to HD, KOVR was the only station in the Sacramento market that still presented its remote field reports in [[pillarbox]]ed [[4:3]] [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]]. Atypical for a duopoly, sister station KMAX-TV did not upgrade its newscasts to HD until summer 2009. KOVR has since begun using HD cameras for its field reports; however, much of the field footage is still downconverted to 16:9 widescreen standard definition in the control room. The station's 10 p.m. newscast won a 2010 Emmy Award for \"Best Evening Newscast\" and was the #1 rated late newscast in Sacramento during the May 2010 ratings period.\n\nKOVR also produces a newscast for sister station KMAX, which air weekdays at 6:30 p.m.. In addition, KOVR provides news updates during [[KMAX-TV|KMAX]]'s morning news program ''Good Day''. The weekend afternoon, evening, and late newscasts are translated into [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish]] via the station's [[Second audio program|SAP]] feed.\n\n===CBS13.com Rush Limbaugh controversy===\nIn May 2007, KOVR revamped its morning news program with an emphasis on its website. The 5\u20136&nbsp;a.m. hour of the newscast, titled ''CBS13.com'', centered around viewer feedback through the web, viral videos and news found on the Internet. On May 7, 2007, the program reported on a song that conservative radio broadcaster [[Rush Limbaugh]] played heavily on his nationally syndicated program called \"Barack the [[Magic Negro]]\" (to the tune of \"[[Puff the Magic Dragon]]\") that spoofed the then-upcoming [[2008 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Barack Obama]]. The song was a satire of an article called \"Magic Negro Returns\"<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/19/opinion/oe-ehrenstein19 `Magic Negro' returns], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 19, 2007.</ref> that had appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' claiming that Mr. Obama was \u2013 in many people's minds \u2013 fulfilling a Hollywood film archetype the author called the \"Magic Negro\", who has only positive attributes and exists to improve the lives of the main protagonists, who are white.\n\nThe program ran an online poll asking people whether they thought the song was [[Racism in the United States|racist]]. Limbaugh blasted KOVR, claiming it was a part of the \"liberal media\", and called the anchor team of Chris Burrous, Lisa Gonzales and weather anchor Jeff James \"morons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509041608/http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_050707/content/01125108.guest.html|title=KOVR in Sacramento Misreports \"Barack, the Magic Negro\"|author=|date=May 9, 2007|website=web.Archive.org|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref> Throughout that day's newscasts, KOVR covered Limbaugh's remarks against the station, adding with a disclaimer after every story that KOVR never intended to couple Limbaugh with the parody song<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6WXGWMdAs4|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref> and admitting that the station found the song on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Notable current on-air staff===\n* [[Kristine Hanson]] \u2013 meteorologist (since 2016; previously at KOVR from 2004 to 2005)\n* [[Christina Anderson (journalist)|Christina Janes]] \u2013 anchor\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Stan Atkinson]] \u2013 anchor (1994\u20131999; previously with [[KCRA-TV]], now retired running local ads)\n* [[Claudia Cowan]] \u2013 anchor/reporter (later moved to [[KRON-TV]] in [[San Francisco]]; now reporter for [[Fox News]] in [[New York City]])\n* [[Jonathan Elias]] \u2013 investigative reporter (1991\u20131993, now anchor/reporter at [[WJLA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]])\n* [[Lois Hart]] \u2013 anchor (later at KCRA-TV, now retired)\n* [[Bob Hilton]] \u2013 anchor\n* [[Kinsey Schofield]] \u2013 anchor/reporter (2017)\n* [[Steve Somers]] (now at [[sports radio]] station [[WFAN]] in New York City)\n* [[Jim Wieder]] \u2013 reporter/anchor (1989\u20132005; retired from anchoring in 2006)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Out-of-market cable coverage==\n{{Expand section|date = June 2010}}\nKOVR is available on [[cable television|cable]] in the northern parts of the Bay Area, mostly in northern [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] communities that are part of the Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto media market as defined by Nielsen.

The station is owned by the [[CBS Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Sacramento-licensed [[The CW|CW]] owned-and-operated station [[KMAX-TV]] (channel 31). The two stations share studios on KOVR Drive in [[West Sacramento, California|West Sacramento]] and [[KXTV/KOVR tower|transmitter facilities]] in [[Walnut Grove, California|Walnut Grove]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe station first signed on the air on September 6, 1954, with its first broadcast originating from the [[California State Fair]]. KOVR is the oldest continuously operating television station in the Sacramento market. Originally serving as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] with its transmitter located on [[Mount Diablo]], its signal reached the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], lending to the KOVR call letters (\"covering\" all of [[Northern California]]). The station originally operated from studio facilities located on Miner Avenue in Stockton. [[Art Finley]] hosted an afternoon [[children's television series|children's program]], ''Toonytown'', on the station for several years, before moving to [[San Francisco]]'s [[KRON-TV]].\n\n===As an ABC affiliate===\nIn May 1957, KOVR merged its operations with Sacramento's original [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, KCCC-TV (channel 40, which signed on eleven months before KOVR in September 1953). KCCC shut down, with KOVR acquiring the ABC affiliation. At the network's request, the station moved its transmitter facilities to a temporary site near [[Jackson, California|Jackson]] to avoid competition with [[KGO-TV]] in San Francisco. By this time, it was obvious that Sacramento, Stockton and [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] were going to be a single television market. In 1960, KOVR teamed up with [[KCRA-TV]] (channel 3) and [[KXTV]] (channel 10) to build a new [[KXTV/KOVR/KCRA Tower|{{convert|1,549|ft|m|sing=on}} tower]] in Walnut Grove. In 1985, KOVR and KXTV moved to their current {{convert|2049|ft|m|sing=on}} tower while KCRA moved to [[Hearst-Argyle Tower|its own {{convert|2000|ft|m|sing=on}} tower]]; KCRA still uses the old tower as an auxiliary facility.\n\nIn 1958, the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]] (whose successor company, [[Tegna Inc.|Tegna]], now owns rival KXTV) bought KOVR from its original owners, then sold it the following year to [[John Kluge]]'s Metropolitan Broadcasting (which later became [[Metromedia]]). In 1960, the station moved its business offices and news department to a new studio facility on Arden Way in Sacramento. In 1987, KOVR consolidated its operations into its current facility in West Sacramento.\n\n[[Image:651211-KOVR News 1965.png|thumb|250px|A 1965 advertisement for then ABC affiliate KOVR touting [[Peter Jennings]] as anchor of ''[[ABC World News Tonight|Peter Jennings with the News]]''.]]\nMetromedia sold KOVR to [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers]] in 1964. McClatchy ran the station alongside ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'' and ''[[Modesto Bee]]'' newspapers, as well as radio stations [[KWG (AM)|KWG]] (1230 AM) in Stockton, [[KESP|KBEE]] (970 AM) in Modesto and [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]] (1530 AM) in Sacramento. McClatchy was able to own KOVR, KWG, KBEE and KFBK because Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto, then as now, were separate radio markets. McClatchy had established a trio of bee mascots (originally designed by [[Walt Disney]], whose [[The Walt Disney Company|namesake company]] would eventually acquire ABC in 1996) for its properties. Teevee the Bee was KOVR's official mascot during the years that McClatchy owned the station \u2013 short cartoons of the bee bookended KOVR's broadcast day, either ushering in or concluding the day's programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNgecUK3SJA|title=KOVR \"McClatchy Bee\" Sign-Off|first=|last=KLXT77|date=April 6, 2008|publisher=|access-date=February 22, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAfter McClatchy sold the station to [[The Outlet Company|Outlet Communications]] in 1978, KOVR went into a gradual decline in terms of both ratings and programming quality (even as ABC became the country's highest-rated network), and has been in third place in the Sacramento ratings for most of the time since then. The station was then sold to Narragansett Television [[Limited partnership|LP]] in 1986, then to Anchor Media in 1988. Anchor Media was merged into [[River City Broadcasting]] in 1993, and River City was purchased by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] three years later. KOVR has made some firsts in local broadcasting: it was the first station in Northern California to use [[videotape]] (rather than film) for its newscasts, and was the first station in the Sacramento/Stockton area to broadcast in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]].\n\nAs an ABC affiliate, KOVR preempted a moderate amount of programming, even the 30-minute soap opera ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]''. It also aired some ABC programming out of pattern: ''[[All My Children]]'' in the early years was aired at 11 a.m. (half of ABC's affiliates aired the soap at 11 a.m. to follow it with their noon newscasts; until the series was cancelled in 2011, the network recommended that the program run in the noon timeslot). In the mid-1990s, KOVR moved the soap opera to 3 p.m., a practice continued by KXTV following its affiliation switch with KOVR until the early 2000s.\n\n===Switching to CBS===\nOn March 6, 1995, KOVR [[1994-96 United States broadcast TV realignment|swapped networks]] with longtime [[CBS]] affiliate KXTV; KOVR is the third station in Sacramento to have been affiliated with CBS: before moving to KXTV, KCCC carried the network secondarily to its primary ABC affiliation. Despite joining CBS, KOVR chose not to air ''[[Guiding Light]]'', a practice originated by KXTV during its CBS days (due to the show's below-average ratings in the area). When the program ended its run on September 18, 2009, it was one of only two CBS affiliates that did not carry the show; the other, [[WNEM-TV]] in [[Bay City, Michigan]], aired it on a [[MyNetworkTV]]-affiliated [[digital subchannel]]. During ''Guiding Light''{{'}}s last 16 seasons, Sacramento viewers had to view it on cable via future sister station [[KPIX]].\n\n[[Image:KOVR.jpg|thumb|KOVR's previous logo, under Sinclair ownership. This logo is similar to a former logo of another Sinclair-owned station, [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]]'s [[WGME]].]]\nA more notable oddity with KOVR's affiliation with CBS is that the station runs the network's prime time lineup one hour earlier than the standard 8 (7 on Sundays) to 11 p.m. scheduling for the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] as well as the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] time zones, opting to run it from 7 to 10 p.m. (the standard scheduling used by stations in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones). When KOVR was an ABC affiliate, the station had an 11 p.m. newscast like most stations on the coastal time zones. Upon the network switch, the station followed the then-practice of now-sister station KPIX in having an hour-long prime time newscast at 10 p.m. (KPIX later moved its late evening newscast back to the 11 p.m. slot in 1998). In recent ratings periods, KOVR has battled [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KTXL]] (channel 40) for the lead among the newscasts in the 10 p.m. timeslot, with KOVR leading in total households and KTXL leading in the key demographics.\n\nIn 2001, KOVR gained attention when it landed a \"local exclusive\" interview with Congressman [[Gary Condit]] regarding the [[Chandra Levy]] murder case (Condit appeared the same evening on ABC, in an interview with [[Connie Chung]]). The station televised an interview on August 30 in which Condit claimed that he did not kill Levy after a visit with the slain intern. Despite numerous KOVR reports filed by reporter Gloria Gomez, the Condit interview was granted to another KOVR reporter, Jodi Hernandez. Much of the national interest in the case was lost days later, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nIn December 2004, Sinclair sold KOVR to [[Viacom (1971\u20132005)|Viacom]] Television Stations Group (now part of [[ViacomCBS]] as [[CBS Television Stations]]), creating the third duopoly in the Sacramento market with [[KMAX-TV]] (channel 31, then a [[UPN]] owned-and-operated station, now a [[The CW|CW]] O&O) and CBS' third television duopoly in California (after [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]; and KPIX and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]] in San Francisco). Viacom was forced to sell [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC radio]] in San Francisco as a condition of the sale, as the station's city-grade signal reaches Sacramento; the purchase was finalized on April 29, 2005. The station then changed its on-air branding from \"KOVR 13\" to \"CBS 13\".\n\n==Digital television==\n\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After CBS purchased channel 13, some, including station management, had speculated that KOVR would move the CBS prime time lineup back to its standard 8\u201311 p.m. slot and add ''Guiding Light'' to the schedule, as well as drop ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]''. It was assumed that as an O&O, KOVR would have to carry ''Guiding Light'' (most network-owned stations run the entire network programming schedule, with exceptions only for breaking news coverage or special programming). However, on May 3, 2005, CBS announced that it would make no immediate programming changes, including any addition of ''Guiding Light'' (which remained off the station through its final episode in September 2009).\n\nOn August 11, 2005, CBS announced that KOVR's 7\u201310 p.m. scheduling of the prime time lineup, the 10 p.m. newscast and the 11 p.m. airing of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' would remain in place due to the success of the early prime schedule. At that point, it also stated that ''Guiding Light'' would not join the KOVR schedule; it is believed that this was based on the logic that a show that had not been available in the market for over 14 years would not receive good ratings, and that there were few requests to run the program. On July 31, 2006, KOVR received approval from CBS to move the weekend prime time lineup back an hour in order to maintain an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast seven days a week, to take effect August 27. ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' (which had been airing at 1 a.m.) was also pushed one hour earlier, while ''Jerry Springer'' (which aired at 3 p.m. until September 8, 2006) was bumped to a later timeslot before moving to [[KMAX-TV]] in September 2006 (the program moved to [[KQCA]] one year later). KOVR began clearing the entire CBS network schedule in September 2009, after ''Guiding Light'' ended and was temporarily replaced by a secondary run of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''; ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' began airing the following month at 9 a.m. (outside of the show's more common 2 p.m. slot for stations in the Pacific Time Zone).\n\nOn July 30, 2018, KOVR began airing a newscast at 11 p.m., relocating the program from sister station KMAX-TV where it has aired for six years. ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' moved to 11:35 p.m. and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]'' moved to 12:37 a.m. The scheduling changes marked the first time KOVR will air an 11 p.m. weeknight newscast since its affiliation switch from ABC to CBS in 1995. It also marked the first time since 1995 the CBS late night lineup on KOVR will be in pattern with the rest of the CBS stations in the Pacific Time Zone.\n\n==News operation==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}\nKOVR presently broadcasts 37 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6\u00bd hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and 2\u00bd hours on Sundays). KOVR debuted its noon newscast in 1965 as a 15-minute broadcast, which was followed by ''People, Places & Things'' at 12:15&nbsp;p.m. In the 1980s, KOVR aired the ABC soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' at 11 a.m. (on a day-behind [[broadcast delay|tape delay]]) in order to free the noon slot for the newscast.\n\nWhile under Sinclair ownership, KOVR had worked with a small to medium-sized news staff, unusual considering Sacramento's dramatic growth during the 1980s had made it a top-20 market. It was one of several Sinclair-owned stations that did not participate in Sinclair's controversial ''[[News Central]]'' hybrid news format; this [[Centralcasting|centralized]] operation incorporated national news segments, local [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] segments, and some sports coverage based out of studios at Sinclair's corporate headquarters on Beaver Dam Road in [[Hunt Valley, Maryland|Hunt Valley]], [[Maryland]] that was supplemented by local content at most of Sinclair's in-house news departments. After CBS purchased KOVR, both it and KMAX-TV's news departments were consolidated at KOVR's West Sacramento facility. On-air staff from both stations periodically appear on their respective newscasts.\n\nMost of KOVR's on-air staffers that were with the station under Sinclair ownership have either been fired or have resigned. Dismissals of former lead anchors Paul Joncich and Jennifer Whitney were sudden and unannounced whereas Marcy Valenzuela and Jennifer Krier were allowed to say farewell to viewers on air. Remaining on-air staff include chief meteorologist [[Dave Bender]] and investigative reporter Kurtis Ming. On February 1, 2006, Pallas Hup\u00e9 and former KCRA anchor Sam Shane became the station's new main anchor team; the evening newscast also instituted a three-anchor format, which began with Shane and Hup\u00e9 anchoring the day's major news stories, deferring to anchor/reporter Christina Anderson (now Janes) for national and international headlines. The unique three-anchor setup remained during the weekend 10 p.m. newscasts with rotating anchors. In July 2006, KOVR debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast on weekdays. In January 2018, KOVR reinstated a sports department, which has been without one since the departure of John Henk in the late 1990s.\n\nIn October 2008, KOVR began broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high-definition]]. Only the in-studio segments are presented in HD; however, for over a year-and-a-half after KTXL upgraded its newscasts to HD, KOVR was the only station in the Sacramento market that still presented its remote field reports in [[pillarbox]]ed [[4:3]] [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]]. Atypical for a duopoly, sister station KMAX-TV did not upgrade its newscasts to HD until summer 2009. KOVR has since begun using HD cameras for its field reports; however, much of the field footage is still downconverted to 16:9 widescreen standard definition in the control room. The station's 10 p.m. newscast won a 2010 Emmy Award for \"Best Evening Newscast\" and was the #1 rated late newscast in Sacramento during the May 2010 ratings period.\n\nKOVR also produces a newscast for sister station KMAX, which air weekdays at 6:30 p.m.. In addition, KOVR provides news updates during [[KMAX-TV|KMAX]]'s morning news program ''Good Day''. The weekend afternoon, evening, and late newscasts are translated into [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish]] via the station's [[Second audio program|SAP]] feed.\n\n===CBS13.com Rush Limbaugh controversy===\nIn May 2007, KOVR revamped its morning news program with an emphasis on its website. The 5\u20136&nbsp;a.m. hour of the newscast, titled ''CBS13.com'', centered around viewer feedback through the web, viral videos and news found on the Internet. On May 7, 2007, the program reported on a song that conservative radio broadcaster [[Rush Limbaugh]] played heavily on his nationally syndicated program called \"Barack the [[Magic Negro]]\" (to the tune of \"[[Puff the Magic Dragon]]\") that spoofed the then-upcoming [[2008 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Barack Obama]]. The song was a satire of an article called \"Magic Negro Returns\"<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/19/opinion/oe-ehrenstein19 `Magic Negro' returns], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 19, 2007.</ref> that had appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' claiming that Mr. Obama was \u2013 in many people's minds \u2013 fulfilling a Hollywood film archetype the author called the \"Magic Negro\", who has only positive attributes and exists to improve the lives of the main protagonists, who are white.\n\nThe program ran an online poll asking people whether they thought the song was [[Racism in the United States|racist]]. Limbaugh blasted KOVR, claiming it was a part of the \"liberal media\", and called the anchor team of Chris Burrous, Lisa Gonzales and weather anchor Jeff James \"morons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509041608/http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_050707/content/01125108.guest.html|title=KOVR in Sacramento Misreports \"Barack, the Magic Negro\"|author=|date=May 9, 2007|website=web.Archive.org|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref> Throughout that day's newscasts, KOVR covered Limbaugh's remarks against the station, adding with a disclaimer after every story that KOVR never intended to couple Limbaugh with the parody song<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6WXGWMdAs4|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=February 22, 2019}}</ref> and admitting that the station found the song on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Notable current on-air staff===\n* [[Kristine Hanson]] \u2013 meteorologist (since 2016; previously at KOVR from 2004 to 2005)\n* [[Christina Anderson (journalist)|Christina Janes]] \u2013 anchor\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Stan Atkinson]] \u2013 anchor (1994\u20131999; previously with [[KCRA-TV]], now retired running local ads)\n* [[Claudia Cowan]] \u2013 anchor/reporter (later moved to [[KRON-TV]] in [[San Francisco]]; now reporter for [[Fox News]] in [[New York City]])\n* [[Jonathan Elias]] \u2013 investigative reporter (1991\u20131993, now anchor/reporter at [[WJLA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]])\n* [[Lois Hart]] \u2013 anchor (later at KCRA-TV, now retired)\n* [[Bob Hilton]] \u2013 anchor\n* [[Kinsey Schofield]] \u2013 anchor/reporter (2017)\n* [[Steve Somers]] (now at [[sports radio]] station [[WFAN]] in New York City)\n* [[Jim Wieder]] \u2013 reporter/anchor (1989\u20132005; retired from anchoring in 2006)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Out-of-market cable coverage==\n{{Expand section|date = June 2010}}\nKOVR is available on [[cable television|cable]] in the northern parts of the Bay Area, mostly in [[Solano County, California|Solano County]].

[[Lake H\u0101wea]] is a 15-minute drive away, en route to the frontier town of [[Makarora]], the last stop before the West Coast Glacier region. To the south is the historic [[Cardrona Valley]], a popular scenic alpine route to neighbouring [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].\n\n===Geology===\nAt its greatest extent, which is roughly along a north\u2013south axis, the lake is 42 kilometres long. Its widest point, at the southern end, is 10 kilometres. The lake's western shore is lined with high peaks rising to over 2000 metres above sea level. Along the eastern shore the land is also mountainous, but the peaks are somewhat lower.\n\nLake W\u0101naka lies in a [[u-shaped valley]] formed by [[glacier|glacial]] erosion during the last [[ice age]], more than 10,000 years ago. It is fed by the [[Matukituki River|Matukituki]] and [[Makarora River]]s, and is the source of the [[Clutha River]]. Nearby [[Lake H\u0101wea]] lies in a parallel valley carved by a neighbouring glacier eight kilometres to the east.

The township, which sits in a glacier-carved basin on the shores of the lake, is the gateway to [[Mount Aspiring National Park|Mt Aspiring National Park]]. [[Lake H\u0101wea]] is a 15-minute drive away, en route to the frontier town of [[Makarora]], the last stop before the West Coast Glacier region. To the south is the historic [[Cardrona Valley]], a popular scenic alpine route to neighbouring [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].\n\n===Geology===\nAt its greatest extent, which is roughly along a north\u2013south axis, the lake is 42 kilometres long. Its widest point, at the southern end, is 10 kilometres. The lake's western shore is lined with high peaks rising to over 2000 metres above sea level. Along the eastern shore the land is also mountainous, but the peaks are somewhat lower.\n\nLake W\u0101naka lies in a [[u-shaped valley]] formed by [[glacier|glacial]] erosion during the last [[ice age]], more than 10,000 years ago. It is fed by the [[Matukituki River|Matukituki]] and [[Makarora River]]s, and is the source of the [[Clutha River]]. Nearby [[Lake H\u0101wea]] lies in a parallel valley carved by a neighbouring glacier eight kilometres to the east. At their closest point (a rocky ridge called The Neck), the lakes are only 1,000 metres apart.<ref name=\"T2\">[http://www.newzealand.com/travel/sights-activities/scenic-highlights/lakes/sh-lake-wanaka-and-hawea.cfm Lakes: Laka Wanaka and Hawea] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/676ClFFma?url=http://www.newzealand.com/int/article/lakes-wanaka-and-hawea/ |date=2012-04-21 }} (from the [[Tourism New Zealand]] website)</ref>\n\nSmall islands towards the foot of the lake include Ruby Island, [[Stevensons Island]] and Harwich Island.

At first titled the General Staff Academy of the Red Army, taking on a similar role to its pre-revolutionary predecessor, the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|Imperial Nicholas Military Academy]], it was renamed the Military Academy in 1921 and then the M. V. Frunze Military Academy in 1925, honouring [[Mikhail Frunze]], who had been a commandant of the academy. It became a higher staff college with the addition of courses for senior command officers in the 1930s, before these were transferred to the newly-formed [[Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia|Military Academy of the General Staff]] in 1936. By this time many of the Red Army's most senior commanders were graduates of the academy. During the Second World War large numbers of staff and students were called up to fight. Many won decorations and awards, including 244 [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]], and 18 twice Heroes of the Soviet Union. Training and research at the academy continued throughout the war.\n\nThe academy continued to train senior officers for the Soviet Armed Forces after the war, acting as a stepping stone for those tipped for high command before they attended the Military Academy of the General Staff. It was ranked as the most prestigious of all the Soviet military academies, taking officers ranked captain or above for a three-year course of study to prepare them for higher commands. The academy also offered research and postgraduate degrees in various aspects of military studies. Between 1934 and 1988, 722 graduates of the academy were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, while the academy itself received the [[Order of Lenin]], the [[Order of Suvorov]] First Class, and the [[Order of the October Revolution]].\n\nThe academy continued to operate after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, until being merged with the [[Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy|Malinovsky Military Armoured Forces Academy]] and the [[Vystrel course|Vystrel officer training courses]] in 1998 to form the [[Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mikhail Frunze by Isaak Brodsky (1929).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Frunze]], a posthumous 1929 portrait by [[Isaak Brodsky]].

At first titled the General Staff Academy of the Red Army, taking on a similar role to its pre-revolutionary predecessor, the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|Imperial Nicholas Military Academy]], it was renamed the Military Academy in 1921 and then the M. V. Frunze Military Academy in 1925, honouring [[Mikhail Frunze]], who had been a commandant of the academy. It became a higher staff college with the addition of courses for senior command officers in the 1930s, before these were transferred to the newly-formed [[Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia|Military Academy of the General Staff]] in 1936. By this time many of the Red Army's most senior commanders were graduates of the academy. During the Second World War large numbers of staff and students were called up to fight. Many won decorations and awards, including 244 [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]], and 18 twice Heroes of the Soviet Union. Training and research at the academy continued throughout the war.\n\nThe academy continued to train senior officers for the Soviet Armed Forces after the war, acting as a stepping stone for those tipped for high command before they attended the Military Academy of the General Staff. It was ranked as the most prestigious of all the Soviet military academies, taking officers ranked captain or above for a three-year course of study to prepare them for higher commands. The academy also offered research and postgraduate degrees in various aspects of military studies. Between 1934 and 1988, 722 graduates of the academy were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, while the academy itself received the [[Order of Lenin]], the [[Order of Suvorov]] First Class, and the [[Order of the October Revolution]].\n\nThe academy continued to operate after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, until being merged with the [[Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy|Malinovsky Military Armoured Forces Academy]] and the [[Vystrel course|Vystrel officer training courses]] in 1998 to form the [[Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mikhail Frunze by Isaak Brodsky (1929).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Frunze]], a posthumous 1929 portrait by [[Isaak Brodsky]].
