After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence.

Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the [[Beqaa Valley]] for its meat pastries (such as [[sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida ([[Sidon]]) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food.

Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref> More recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Byblos- Jbeil.jpg|alt=|thumb|A restaurant in the historic quarter and souks of [[Byblos]] (also called Jbeil)]]\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the [[Beqaa Valley]] for its meat pastries (such as [[sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida ([[Sidon]]) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s.

The population was 1,573 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"American FactFinder\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|accessdate=2017-08-07|year=2010|publisher=US Census Bureau}}</ref> Ligonier was settled in the 1760s. The borough is well known for nearby [[Idlewild and Soak Zone|Idlewild Park]], one of the oldest [[amusement park]]s in the country; and nearby [[Seven Springs Mountain Resort]]. Another tourist attraction is Fort Ligonier Days, a parade and craft market that takes place every fall over the course of three days, and the Ligonier Country Market in the summer months. Ligonier is part of the [[Pittsburgh]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/99mfips.txt |title=Metropolitan Areas and Components |accessdate=2010-02-02 |year=1999 |publisher=Population Division, US Census Bureau }}</ref>\n\nLigonier is the site of a reconstruction of [[Fort Ligonier]], an example of a frontier fort of the [[French and Indian War]]. Ligonier is also known for its downtown square, the Diamond, which has a [[bandstand]] in the middle.\n\n==History==\nIn 1758, when British forces launched a major campaign to remove [[France|French]] forces from the forks of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]], now [[Pittsburgh]], this spot on [[Loyalhanna Creek]] was the site of their westernmost camp before reaching the Ohio. The British maintained a large army, a virtual moving city of 6,000 people, that temporarily made this the most populated spot in Pennsylvania, second only to [[Philadelphia]]. The fort was named Fort Ligonier after [[John Ligonier]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n185 186]}}</ref> a [[British people|British]] noble of French origin who held the rank of [[Field Marshal]] in the [[British Army]]. Eventually, the name of the settlement that grew up around the fort was shortened to Ligonier.\n\nIn 1817, the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh Turnpike was completed, a gravel road that was the precursor to today's [[US Route 30]]. Fort Ligonier was a logical place for travelers to break their journey, and with such commercial opportunities in mind, a local resident named John Ramsay (sometimes spelled Ramsey) laid out the street plan, including the space now known as the Diamond. He initially called the town Ramseytown, later changed to Wellington (after the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]), and finally the name was changed to Ligonier.<ref>{{cite book | last = Shirey | first = Salley | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ligonier Valley | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2001 | location = Mount Pleasant, South Carolina | pages = 27 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7385-0535-8 }}</ref> Several decades of prosperity followed.

Traffic shifted from horse-drawn vehicles to the railroad, causing the community's population to drop to 350 according to the 1860 census.<ref name=\"Ligonier-NRHP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.state.pa.us/ |title=National Register of Historical Places - Ligonier Historic District |accessdate=2008-05-04 |format=PDF |work=ARCH: Pennsylvania's Historic Architecture & Archeology |publisher=Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission }}</ref>\n\nLigonier enjoyed a new impetus when the [[Ligonier Valley Railroad]]<ref name=\"lvrra\">{{cite web| url=http://www.lvrra.org |title=Ligonier Valley Rail Road Association}}</ref> was completed in 1877, linking the community to Latrobe where connections to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] were possible. The Ligonier Valley Railroad enabled lumber, coal, and quarried stone to be transported out of the [[Ligonier Valley, Pennsylvania|Ligonier Valley]], which spurred development of the town. Also, the railroad made it easier for Pittsburgh residents to visit Ligonier, causing the town to develop as a summer resort. Some major physical changes to Ligonier occurred during this period. In 1894, the Diamond, which had been used as a corral for horses and wagons, was transformed into a park with a bandstand. A large hotel, the Hotel Breniser, was built in 1900 where the town hall currently sits.<ref name=\"Ligonier-NRHP\"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Rachel E. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Latrobe and the Ligonier Valley | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2008 | location = Charleston, South Carolina | pages = 66 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7385-5729-8 }}</ref> In 1909-1910, the Ligonier Valley Railroad built an ornate station and headquarters building, which still stands at 339 West Main Street.\n\nIn 1952, the Ligonier Valley Railroad ceased operation, due to a combination of [[overlogging]], decline of the [[coal industry]], and the loss of passenger traffic to motor vehicles.\n\nThe [[Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad]] also served Ligonier from 1899 to 1916, although it did not enjoy the success of the Ligonier Valley Railroad.\n\nLigonier has three listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: the [[Fort Ligonier|Fort Ligonier site]] at 216 South Market Street; the [[Ligonier Historic District (Ligonier, Pennsylvania)|Ligonier Historic District]], which encompasses the Diamond and the oldest parts of the borough; and the demolished [[Ligonier Armory]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nLigonier and its surrounding countryside are strongly associated with the [[Mellon family|Mellon]] banking family, which still owns considerable tracts of land in the area.

States. The population was 1,573 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"American FactFinder\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|accessdate=2017-08-07|year=2010|publisher=US Census Bureau}}</ref> Ligonier was settled in the 1760s. The borough is well known for nearby [[Idlewild and Soak Zone|Idlewild Park]], one of the oldest [[amusement park]]s in the country; and nearby [[Seven Springs Mountain Resort]]. Another tourist attraction is Fort Ligonier Days, a parade and craft market that takes place every fall over the course of three days, and the Ligonier Country Market in the summer months. Ligonier is part of the [[Pittsburgh]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/99mfips.txt |title=Metropolitan Areas and Components |accessdate=2010-02-02 |year=1999 |publisher=Population Division, US Census Bureau }}</ref>\n\nLigonier is the site of a reconstruction of [[Fort Ligonier]], an example of a frontier fort of the [[French and Indian War]]. Ligonier is also known for its downtown square, the Diamond, which has a [[bandstand]] in the middle.\n\n==History==\nIn 1758, when British forces launched a major campaign to remove [[France|French]] forces from the forks of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]], now [[Pittsburgh]], this spot on [[Loyalhanna Creek]] was the site of their westernmost camp before reaching the Ohio. The British maintained a large army, a virtual moving city of 6,000 people, that temporarily made this the most populated spot in Pennsylvania, second only to [[Philadelphia]]. The fort was named Fort Ligonier after [[John Ligonier]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n185 186]}}</ref> a [[British people|British]] noble of French origin who held the rank of [[Field Marshal]] in the [[British Army]]. Eventually, the name of the settlement that grew up around the fort was shortened to Ligonier.\n\nIn 1817, the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh Turnpike was completed, a gravel road that was the precursor to today's [[US Route 30]]. Fort Ligonier was a logical place for travelers to break their journey, and with such commercial opportunities in mind, a local resident named John Ramsay (sometimes spelled Ramsey) laid out the street plan, including the space now known as the Diamond. He initially called the town Ramseytown, later changed to Wellington (after the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]), and finally the name was changed to Ligonier.<ref>{{cite book | last = Shirey | first = Salley | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ligonier Valley | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2001 | location = Mount Pleasant, South Carolina | pages = 27 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7385-0535-8 }}</ref> Several decades of prosperity followed.

Traffic shifted from horse-drawn vehicles to the railroad, causing the community's population to drop to 350 according to the 1860 census.<ref name=\"Ligonier-NRHP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.state.pa.us/ |title=National Register of Historical Places - Ligonier Historic District |accessdate=2008-05-04 |format=PDF |work=ARCH: Pennsylvania's Historic Architecture & Archeology |publisher=Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission }}</ref>\n\nLigonier enjoyed a new impetus when the [[Ligonier Valley Railroad]]<ref name=\"lvrra\">{{cite web| url=http://www.lvrra.org |title=Ligonier Valley Rail Road Association}}</ref> was completed in 1877, linking the community to Latrobe where connections to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] were possible. The Ligonier Valley Railroad enabled lumber, coal, and quarried stone to be transported out of the [[Ligonier Valley, Pennsylvania|Ligonier Valley]], which spurred development of the town. Also, the railroad made it easier for Pittsburgh residents to visit Ligonier, causing the town to develop as a summer resort. Some major physical changes to Ligonier occurred during this period. In 1894, the Diamond, which had been used as a corral for horses and wagons, was transformed into a park with a bandstand. A large hotel, the Hotel Breniser, was built in 1900 where the town hall currently sits.<ref name=\"Ligonier-NRHP\"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Rachel E. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Latrobe and the Ligonier Valley | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2008 | location = Charleston, South Carolina | pages = 66 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7385-5729-8 }}</ref> In 1909-1910, the Ligonier Valley Railroad built an ornate station and headquarters building, which still stands at 339 West Main Street.\n\nIn 1952, the Ligonier Valley Railroad ceased operation, due to a combination of [[overlogging]], decline of the [[coal industry]], and the loss of passenger traffic to motor vehicles.\n\nThe [[Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad]] also served Ligonier from 1899 to 1916, although it did not enjoy the success of the Ligonier Valley Railroad.\n\nLigonier has three listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: the [[Fort Ligonier|Fort Ligonier site]] at 216 South Market Street; the [[Ligonier Historic District (Ligonier, Pennsylvania)|Ligonier Historic District]], which encompasses the Diamond and the oldest parts of the borough; and the demolished [[Ligonier Armory]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nLigonier and its surrounding countryside are strongly associated with the [[Mellon family|Mellon]] banking family, which still owns considerable tracts of land in the area.
