She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]]]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland (1923)]]\n[[File:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Carroll, Robinson - S119 - 'What day of the month is it' he said, turning to Alice.jpg|thumb|Mad tea party.

It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty.<ref>{{cite news |title='Alice' Through the Years: 16 Actresses Who Played the Iconic Character |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/alice-wonderland-16-actresses-who-897699 |accessdate=15 April 2020 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]]]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland (1923)]]\n[[File:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Carroll, Robinson - S119 - 'What day of the month is it' he said, turning to Alice.jpg|thumb|Mad tea party.

[[Leon Coward|Dr Leon Coward]] asserts the book 'suffers' from \"readings which reflect today's fascination with postmodernism and psychology, rather than delving into an historically informed interpretation,\" and speculates that this has been partly driven by audiences encountering the narrative through a 'second-hand' source, explaining \"our impressions of the original text are based on a multiplicity of reinterpretations. We don't necessarily realise we're missing anything in understanding the original product, because we're usually never dealing ''with'' the original product.\"<ref name=\"Coward 18\" />\n\n=== Language ===\nIt has been suggested by several people, including [[Martin Gardner]] and Selwyn Goodacre,<ref name=\"more_annotated\">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|url=https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363|title=More Annotated Alice|publisher=Random House|year=1990|isbn=978-0-394-58571-0|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363 363]}}</ref> that Dodgson had an interest in the French language, choosing to make references and puns about it in the story. It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty.<ref>{{cite news |title='Alice' Through the Years: 16 Actresses Who Played the Iconic Character |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/alice-wonderland-16-actresses-who-897699 |accessdate=15 April 2020 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002.

He is currently a free agent. Andrew is best known for his time in \ufffc[[WWE]]\ufffc under the ring name Luke Gallows\n\nDuring his first stint with WWE, Hankinson also appeared briefly as an imposter of the wrestler [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] during 2006 and then returned as '''Festus''', a seemingly [[mentally handicapped]] character who teamed with [[Ray Gordy|Jesse]], but the team achieved little success. After disappearing from television, Hankinson later became the [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]] and \"disciple\" of [[CM Punk]], sporting a cleaner, militant look, with the Festus character's \"real identity\" revealed as Luke Gallows. His first run in WWE ended in 2010. He is perhaps best known for working for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]]  (NJPW) under the ring name '''Doc Gallows''', and he also wrestled prominently for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), where he was a member of the [[Aces & Eights]] [[Stable (professional wrestling)|faction]] under the [[ring name]] '''D.O.C.''' ('''Director of Chaos'''). Along with [[Karl Anderson]], Hankinson has won the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship]] twice. He has also won the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] three times.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career (2005)===\nHankinson began his career in West Virginia with [[Mason-Dixon Wrestling]] and in [[Pennsylvania]] with the World Star Wrestling Federation ([[American Wrestling Association|AWA]]/World Star Wrestling), Summit Wrestling Association of Southern Pennsylvania, and [[Maryland]]-based promotions National Wrestling League and the Eastern Wrestling Alliance,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewamaryland.com/main/alumni.html|title=Eastern Wrestling Alliance ~ Alumni|work=ewamaryland.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231034255/http://www.ewamaryland.com/main/alumni.html|archivedate=December 31, 2009}}</ref> wrestling as Dorian Deville, and for West Virginia's Championship Pro Wrestling as the masked wrestler Dargon.\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment===\n\n====Deep South Wrestling (2005\u20132007)====\nIn April 2005, despite failing to make it as one of the final ten contestants on the [[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|$1,000,000 Tough Enough]], he was signed to a contract by [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) and was assigned to the [[Deep South Wrestling]] (DSW) [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]].\n\nHankinson wrestled in DSW as '''Dorian \"Deacon\" Deville''' before changing his ring name to '''The Freakin' Deacon'''. He adopted the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of a deranged, facepaint-wearing wrestler who came to the ring with a pet spider named Willow, whom he sometimes spoke to.<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/l/luke-gallows.html|title=Festus Profile|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> He formed a partnership with executive [[Brian Mailhot|Palmer Cannon]] and his posterior associate [[The Great Khali|Dalip Singh]], helping Cannon to gain DSW's ownership and attack his enemies, but Palmer and Singh betrayed Deacon and stole his spider. He then formed an alliance with announcer and wrestler [[Bill DeMott]], who was in a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] against [[The Gymini]]. The team proved to be effective, but Deacon abandoned DeMott during a match, causing him to be beaten down until other wrestlers made the save. It was later revealed that Quintin Michaels had captured Willow and used it to blackmail Deacon into leaving, but he later got his pet back, regaining his freedom.<ref name=\"DSW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/deepsouth/2006.html|title=Deep South Wrestling Results 2006|accessdate=January 25, 2016|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>\n\n==== Main roster debut (2006\u20132007) ====\nOn May 29, 2006, Hankinson debuted on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' as an imposter [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. Wearing Kane's old mask and ring attire, he [[chokeslam]]med Kane during his match against [[Shelton Benjamin]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]]. Subsequently, Hankinson repeatedly attacked the real Kane during or after his matches. The pair finally faced off in a match at the [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]] pay-per-view, with Hankinson winning using one of Kane's trademark moves. One night later, however, the storyline was abruptly ended when the original Kane attacked the Imposter Kane, removed his mask, and threw him out of the building.\n\nHankinson returned to Deep South Wrestling, in addition to appearing at [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] [[house show]]s. In August, he got involved in a storyline with [[Melissa Coates|The Bag Lady]], who acted as his [[Valet (professional wrestling)|valet]] and [[love interest]]. Though he got often distracted by her, she helped him to win matches. In October, Deacon and Bag Lady formed an alliance with [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|The Major Brothers]] ([[Curt Hawkins|Brian]] and [[Zack Ryder|Brett Major]]) against the team Urban Assault ([[Eric Perez]], [[Sonny Siaki]], [[Afa Anoai, Jr.|Afa Jr.]] and [[Brodus Clay|G-Rilla]]), as their enforcer G-Rilla had clashed with Bag Lady earlier. In December 2006, Deacon defeated G-Rilla in a singles match, causing the rest of Urban Assault to turn on G-Rilla and beat him up.<ref name=\"DSW\"/> Deacon then aided G-Rilla and formed a tag team with him, helping him to get revenge on Urban Assault. The pair also feuded with Team Elite ([[Derrick Neikirk]] and [[Mike Knox]]) for the [[DSW Tag Team Championship]]. However, in March 2007 Deacon was beaten up with steel chairs by Neikirk and Knox and needed to be carried to the hospital by G-Rilla. There G-Rilla sat accidentally over Willow, which killed the spider and sent its owner into a [[mental breakdown]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\n====Teaming with Jesse (2007\u20132009)====\n{{Main|Jesse and Festus}}\n[[File:Festuscropped.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Hankinson as Festus in 2008]]\nOn the May 11, 2007, episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', a vignette aired suggesting that Hankinson would be repackaged as Festus Dalton as part of a tag team using a Southern gimmick, alongside fellow WWE developmental talent [[Ray Gordy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/05112007/|title=In with the new|date=May 11, 2007|last=Starr|first=Noah|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> On June 2, 2007, however, it was reported that WWE was dropping the \"Dalton Boys\" gimmick. The explanation for them not showing up on ''SmackDown'' was that they got lost on their way to the arena. Hankinson and Gordy had actually been sent to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], where Hankinson changed his name to \"Justice Dalton\".\n\nHankinson was then renamed \"Festus\" while Gordy was dubbed \"Jesse\", and on the June 29, 2007, episode of ''SmackDown!'', vignettes hyping [[Jesse and Festus]] began to air. For weeks, Jesse was presented as the mouth-piece of the tandem, who was in awe of his tag team partner. Hankinson, however, played a character that was [[mentally challenged]] and unresponsive. In spite of Festus' dimwitted nature, Jesse kept claiming that Festus was an emotionally driven and physically unstoppable giant. On the September 7, 2007, episode of ''SmackDown!'', there was a segment featuring Jesse and Festus now actually in the arena rather than in a studio. On October 5, Hankinson won his debut match on ''SmackDown!'' with Jesse.<ref name=\"firstmatch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10052007/|title=Locked in|date=October 5, 2007|last=Dee|first=Louie|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> When the opening bell rang, Festus' personality changed into a very focused and angry competitor as compared to the mentally challenged character he had portrayed.<ref name=\"firstmatch\"/> When the bell rang to signify the end of the match, Festus returned to his docile self.<ref name=\"firstmatch\"/> On the December 21 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Festus defeated [[Deuce (wrestler)|Deuce]] in a Santa Match, with both of them wearing [[Santa Claus]] outfits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12212007/|title=Saint Nick slugfest|date=December 21, 2007|author=Lennie DiFino|accessdate=January 9, 2009|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> On the January 25 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Jesse explained the reason that they had not been on television was because Festus has been seeing doctors about his \"problems\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/01252008/|title=On their way to Madison Square Garden|date=January 25, 2008|last=Passero|first=Mitch|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, before the bell rang, Jesse explained that Festus had changed.

After accompanying [[CM Punk]] to the ring for his match with [[Matt Hardy]], Punk revealed that Gallows was actually Festus' true identity and claimed that Gallows' family and friends enabled his [[Alcoholism|alcoholic inclination]], which led to the mental state he was in as Festus, before stating that Gallows was cured due to Punk showing him the [[straight edge]] lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/lukegallows/bio/|title=WWE Bio|accessdate=November 27, 2009|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208224929/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/lukegallows/bio/|archivedate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> On the December 11 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Gallows and Punk defeated Hardy and [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]], after Gallows pinned Hardy with his new finishing move, the \"Twelfth Step\".<ref name=Redebut>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12112009|title=Street Fight night|website=WWE}}</ref> On the January 8, 2010, episode of ''SmackDown'', Gallows defeated Hardy.<ref name=Singles>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/01082010/mainarticle|title=Stunned contenders|date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=August 11, 2012|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> The next week, Gallows and Punk defeated Matt Hardy and [[The Great Khali]], [[The Hart Dynasty]], and [[Cryme Tyme]] in a fatal four-way match to become the number one contenders for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship.\n\nOn the February 10 episode of ''Raw'', The Straight Edge Society was eliminated in a Triple Threat elimination tag team match between them, [[The Miz]] and [[Big Show]] and [[D-Generation X|DX]] for the Unified Tag Team Championship. The Miz and The Big Show became the new Unified Tag Team Champions. At [[WrestleMania XXVI]] Luke Gallows competed in a dark 30-man battle royal, which was won by [[Yoshi Tatsu]]. On the April 13 episode of ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'', he challenged CM Punk's rookie [[Darren Young]] and the stipulation, if Young loses, he will have to surrender his hair to Punk and have it shaved bald. Gallows came close to getting the victory when Young came up with a roll-up and saved his hair, with Punk showing some favor to his rookie and Gallows seeming unhappy. At [[Extreme Rules (2010)|Extreme Rules]], during Punk's Hair match against [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]], Gallows and Serena helped Punk throughout the match until they were banned from ringside.\n\n[[File:Luke Gallows.jpg|thumb|upright|Hankinson in August 2009]]\nOn the July 2 tapings of ''SmackDown'', after a match between Luke Gallows and Kane, a security video was shown by Serena of her being caught drinking in a bar by Punk on the same day of The Undertaker's attack proving The Straight Edge Society's innocence in order to save Punk. Serena begged for forgiveness even after Punk warned her not to, but the Straight Edge Society simply left without her. The following week, however, Serena was forgiven by Punk for her actions, as they embraced, but Gallows did not approve. The following week Gallows was set to fight Big Show but gave the match to the SES Masked Man, who was unmasked as [[Joey Mercury]] during the match. On the September 3 episode of ''SmackDown'', Gallows and Punk faced The Big Show in a two-on-one handicap match, which Gallows and Punk lost. After the match Punk delivered the GTS on Gallows.\n\nOn the September 16 episode of ''[[WWE Superstars]]'', before a match with [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]], Gallows cut a promo announcing that he was no longer part of the Society by proclaiming he was his own man. Gallows went on to lose the match. On the September 21 taping of ''SmackDown'', Gallows began a slow face turn when he confronted CM Punk in a backstage segment stating that after defeating him, he would have a beer, but lost a match to Punk later in the night.\n\nGallows, now officially established as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], defeated [[Lance Hoyt|Vance Archer]] on the November 4 airing of ''Superstars''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwesuperstars/results/16183236/|title=Soaring to new heights|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|first=Ryan|last=Murphy|date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> His final TV appearance was during a backstage segment in which Kane was looking for his father, on the November 19, episode of ''SmackDown''.

He is currently a free agent. Andrew is best known for his time in \ufffc[[WWE]]\ufffc under the ring name Luke Gallows\n\nDuring his first stint with WWE, Hankinson also appeared briefly as an imposter of the wrestler [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] during 2006 and then returned as '''Festus''', a seemingly [[mentally handicapped]] character who teamed with [[Ray Gordy|Jesse]], but the team achieved little success. After disappearing from television, Hankinson later became the [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]] and \"disciple\" of [[CM Punk]], sporting a cleaner, militant look, with the Festus character's \"real identity\" revealed as Luke Gallows. His first run in WWE ended in 2010. He is perhaps best known for working for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]]  (NJPW) under the ring name '''Doc Gallows''', and he also wrestled prominently for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), where he was a member of the [[Aces & Eights]] [[Stable (professional wrestling)|faction]] under the [[ring name]] '''D.O.C.''' ('''Director of Chaos'''). Along with [[Karl Anderson]], Hankinson has won the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship]] twice. He has also won the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] three times.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career (2005)===\nHankinson began his career in West Virginia with [[Mason-Dixon Wrestling]] and in [[Pennsylvania]] with the World Star Wrestling Federation ([[American Wrestling Association|AWA]]/World Star Wrestling), Summit Wrestling Association of Southern Pennsylvania, and [[Maryland]]-based promotions National Wrestling League and the Eastern Wrestling Alliance,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewamaryland.com/main/alumni.html|title=Eastern Wrestling Alliance ~ Alumni|work=ewamaryland.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231034255/http://www.ewamaryland.com/main/alumni.html|archivedate=December 31, 2009}}</ref> wrestling as Dorian Deville, and for West Virginia's Championship Pro Wrestling as the masked wrestler Dargon.\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment===\n\n====Deep South Wrestling (2005\u20132007)====\nIn April 2005, despite failing to make it as one of the final ten contestants on the [[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|$1,000,000 Tough Enough]], he was signed to a contract by [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) and was assigned to the [[Deep South Wrestling]] (DSW) [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]].\n\nHankinson wrestled in DSW as '''Dorian \"Deacon\" Deville''' before changing his ring name to '''The Freakin' Deacon'''. He adopted the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of a deranged, facepaint-wearing wrestler who came to the ring with a pet spider named Willow, whom he sometimes spoke to.<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/l/luke-gallows.html|title=Festus Profile|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> He formed a partnership with executive [[Brian Mailhot|Palmer Cannon]] and his posterior associate [[The Great Khali|Dalip Singh]], helping Cannon to gain DSW's ownership and attack his enemies, but Palmer and Singh betrayed Deacon and stole his spider. He then formed an alliance with announcer and wrestler [[Bill DeMott]], who was in a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] against [[The Gymini]]. The team proved to be effective, but Deacon abandoned DeMott during a match, causing him to be beaten down until other wrestlers made the save. It was later revealed that Quintin Michaels had captured Willow and used it to blackmail Deacon into leaving, but he later got his pet back, regaining his freedom.<ref name=\"DSW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/deepsouth/2006.html|title=Deep South Wrestling Results 2006|accessdate=January 25, 2016|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>\n\n==== Main roster debut (2006\u20132007) ====\nOn May 29, 2006, Hankinson debuted on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' as an imposter [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. Wearing Kane's old mask and ring attire, he [[chokeslam]]med Kane during his match against [[Shelton Benjamin]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]]. Subsequently, Hankinson repeatedly attacked the real Kane during or after his matches. The pair finally faced off in a match at the [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]] pay-per-view, with Hankinson winning using one of Kane's trademark moves. One night later, however, the storyline was abruptly ended when the original Kane attacked the Imposter Kane, removed his mask, and threw him out of the building.\n\nHankinson returned to Deep South Wrestling, in addition to appearing at [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] [[house show]]s. In August, he got involved in a storyline with [[Melissa Coates|The Bag Lady]], who acted as his [[Valet (professional wrestling)|valet]] and [[love interest]]. Though he got often distracted by her, she helped him to win matches. In October, Deacon and Bag Lady formed an alliance with [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|The Major Brothers]] ([[Curt Hawkins|Brian]] and [[Zack Ryder|Brett Major]]) against the team Urban Assault ([[Eric Perez]], [[Sonny Siaki]], [[Afa Anoai, Jr.|Afa Jr.]] and [[Brodus Clay|G-Rilla]]), as their enforcer G-Rilla had clashed with Bag Lady earlier. In December 2006, Deacon defeated G-Rilla in a singles match, causing the rest of Urban Assault to turn on G-Rilla and beat him up.<ref name=\"DSW\"/> Deacon then aided G-Rilla and formed a tag team with him, helping him to get revenge on Urban Assault. The pair also feuded with Team Elite ([[Derrick Neikirk]] and [[Mike Knox]]) for the [[DSW Tag Team Championship]]. However, in March 2007 Deacon was beaten up with steel chairs by Neikirk and Knox and needed to be carried to the hospital by G-Rilla. There G-Rilla sat accidentally over Willow, which killed the spider and sent its owner into a [[mental breakdown]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\n====Teaming with Jesse (2007\u20132009)====\n{{Main|Jesse and Festus}}\n[[File:Festuscropped.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Hankinson as Festus in 2008]]\nOn the May 11, 2007, episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', a vignette aired suggesting that Hankinson would be repackaged as Festus Dalton as part of a tag team using a Southern gimmick, alongside fellow WWE developmental talent [[Ray Gordy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/05112007/|title=In with the new|date=May 11, 2007|last=Starr|first=Noah|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> On June 2, 2007, however, it was reported that WWE was dropping the \"Dalton Boys\" gimmick. The explanation for them not showing up on ''SmackDown'' was that they got lost on their way to the arena. Hankinson and Gordy had actually been sent to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], where Hankinson changed his name to \"Justice Dalton\".\n\nHankinson was then renamed \"Festus\" while Gordy was dubbed \"Jesse\", and on the June 29, 2007, episode of ''SmackDown!'', vignettes hyping [[Jesse and Festus]] began to air. For weeks, Jesse was presented as the mouth-piece of the tandem, who was in awe of his tag team partner. Hankinson, however, played a character that was [[mentally challenged]] and unresponsive. In spite of Festus' dimwitted nature, Jesse kept claiming that Festus was an emotionally driven and physically unstoppable giant. On the September 7, 2007, episode of ''SmackDown!'', there was a segment featuring Jesse and Festus now actually in the arena rather than in a studio. On October 5, Hankinson won his debut match on ''SmackDown!'' with Jesse.<ref name=\"firstmatch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10052007/|title=Locked in|date=October 5, 2007|last=Dee|first=Louie|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> When the opening bell rang, Festus' personality changed into a very focused and angry competitor as compared to the mentally challenged character he had portrayed.<ref name=\"firstmatch\"/> When the bell rang to signify the end of the match, Festus returned to his docile self.<ref name=\"firstmatch\"/> On the December 21 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Festus defeated [[Deuce (wrestler)|Deuce]] in a Santa Match, with both of them wearing [[Santa Claus]] outfits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12212007/|title=Saint Nick slugfest|date=December 21, 2007|author=Lennie DiFino|accessdate=January 9, 2009|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> On the January 25 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Jesse explained the reason that they had not been on television was because Festus has been seeing doctors about his \"problems\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/01252008/|title=On their way to Madison Square Garden|date=January 25, 2008|last=Passero|first=Mitch|accessdate=October 18, 2008|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, before the bell rang, Jesse explained that Festus had changed.

After accompanying [[CM Punk]] to the ring for his match with [[Matt Hardy]], Punk revealed that Gallows was actually Festus' true identity and claimed that Gallows' family and friends enabled his [[Alcoholism|alcoholic inclination]], which led to the mental state he was in as Festus, before stating that Gallows was cured due to Punk showing him the [[straight edge]] lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/lukegallows/bio/|title=WWE Bio|accessdate=November 27, 2009|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208224929/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/lukegallows/bio/|archivedate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> On the December 11 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Gallows and Punk defeated Hardy and [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]], after Gallows pinned Hardy with his new finishing move, the \"Twelfth Step\".<ref name=Redebut>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12112009|title=Street Fight night|website=WWE}}</ref> On the January 8, 2010, episode of ''SmackDown'', Gallows defeated Hardy.<ref name=Singles>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/01082010/mainarticle|title=Stunned contenders|date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=August 11, 2012|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> The next week, Gallows and Punk defeated Matt Hardy and [[The Great Khali]], [[The Hart Dynasty]], and [[Cryme Tyme]] in a fatal four-way match to become the number one contenders for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship.\n\nOn the February 10 episode of ''Raw'', The Straight Edge Society was eliminated in a Triple Threat elimination tag team match between them, [[The Miz]] and [[Big Show]] and [[D-Generation X|DX]] for the Unified Tag Team Championship. The Miz and The Big Show became the new Unified Tag Team Champions. At [[WrestleMania XXVI]] Luke Gallows competed in a dark 30-man battle royal, which was won by [[Yoshi Tatsu]]. On the April 13 episode of ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'', he challenged CM Punk's rookie [[Darren Young]] and the stipulation, if Young loses, he will have to surrender his hair to Punk and have it shaved bald. Gallows came close to getting the victory when Young came up with a roll-up and saved his hair, with Punk showing some favor to his rookie and Gallows seeming unhappy. At [[Extreme Rules (2010)|Extreme Rules]], during Punk's Hair match against [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]], Gallows and Serena helped Punk throughout the match until they were banned from ringside.\n\n[[File:Luke Gallows.jpg|thumb|upright|Hankinson in August 2009]]\nOn the July 2 tapings of ''SmackDown'', after a match between Luke Gallows and Kane, a security video was shown by Serena of her being caught drinking in a bar by Punk on the same day of The Undertaker's attack proving The Straight Edge Society's innocence in order to save Punk. Serena begged for forgiveness even after Punk warned her not to, but the Straight Edge Society simply left without her. The following week, however, Serena was forgiven by Punk for her actions, as they embraced, but Gallows did not approve. The following week Gallows was set to fight Big Show but gave the match to the SES Masked Man, who was unmasked as [[Joey Mercury]] during the match. On the September 3 episode of ''SmackDown'', Gallows and Punk faced The Big Show in a two-on-one handicap match, which Gallows and Punk lost. After the match Punk delivered the GTS on Gallows.\n\nOn the September 16 episode of ''[[WWE Superstars]]'', before a match with [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]], Gallows cut a promo announcing that he was no longer part of the Society by proclaiming he was his own man. Gallows went on to lose the match. On the September 21 taping of ''SmackDown'', Gallows began a slow face turn when he confronted CM Punk in a backstage segment stating that after defeating him, he would have a beer, but lost a match to Punk later in the night.\n\nGallows, now officially established as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], defeated [[Lance Hoyt|Vance Archer]] on the November 4 airing of ''Superstars''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwesuperstars/results/16183236/|title=Soaring to new heights|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|first=Ryan|last=Murphy|date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> His final TV appearance was during a backstage segment in which Kane was looking for his father, on the November 19, episode of ''SmackDown''.

Supposedly, if a person on a [[Chatroulette]]-style website types the phrase \"I did it for the [[LOL|lulz]]\" three times, their chat partner will be murdered by a killer called Smiley (so named because he mutilated his own face by stitching his own eyes shut and [[Glasgow smile|carved his mouth into a smile]]) before they themselves are killed.\n\nA college student named Ashley (Gerard) becomes roommates with Proxy (Papalia). Ashley decides to go to a party where she meets Zane (Allen), Mark (Turner) and Binder (Dawson), who is mocked by his classmates for having reported a case of pedophilia, earning him the nickname [[Pedobear]].\n\nOne night Ashley and Proxy test out the Smiley myth with a random person online. After typing \"I did it for the lulz\" three times, to their horror, the stranger is murdered. Proxy convinces Ashley to stay silent. However, Ashley begins experiencing guilt over the stranger's death. She also begins to believe that Smiley is stalking her and intends to kill her; her friends and a psychiatrist write this off as anxious hallucinations and nightmares. Ashley eventually goes to the police; there she tries to convince them, to no avail, to investigate the murders caused by Smiley. The police dismiss her, implying that she is going crazy and quite possibly on the receiving end of a large, elaborate prank.\n\nWhen Proxy loses contact with Zane, she video chats Ashley in hysterics. Ashley goes to his house to check on him, only to find him shot dead with a handgun he purchased for self-defense. Instead of calling the police, Ashley picks up the gun and orders Proxy to type \"I did it for the lulz\" three times, hoping to ambush and kill Smiley. However, she accidentally shoots Binder, who had been coming over to check on her. Moments later, Smiley appears and slits Binder's throat. Ashley is then attacked by multiple Smileys, finally throwing herself out a window to her presumed death to escape them.\n\nIt is then revealed that all Ashley's classmates, including Proxy, Binder, and the babysitter murdered in the opening, are all part of a fringe group of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. They created the Smiley myth as a large-scale prank, although they are satisfied with Ashley's death. Binder states that Smiley will likely live on long after them and inspire copycat killings.\n\nLater, Proxy is video-chatting with Zane, questioning their morality. Zane dismisses her worries and types \"I did it for the lulz\" three times as a joke. However, a real Smiley appears behind Proxy, kills her, and then waves at Zane via webcam. In a [[post-credits scene]], Ashley is revealed to have survived her fall.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Caitlin Gerard]] as Ashley Brookes\n* [[Melanie Papalia]] as Proxy\n* [[Shane Dawson]] as Binder\n*[[Hyenas

Supposedly, if a person on a [[Chatroulette]]-style website types the phrase \"I did it for the [[LOL|lulz]]\" three times, their chat partner will be murdered by a killer called Smiley (so named because he mutilated his own face by stitching his own eyes shut and [[Glasgow smile|carved his mouth into a smile]]) before they themselves are killed.\n\nA college student named Ashley (Gerard) becomes roommates with Proxy (Papalia). Ashley decides to go to a party where she meets Zane (Allen), Mark (Turner) and Binder (Dawson), who is mocked by his classmates for having reported a case of pedophilia, earning him the nickname [[Pedobear]].\n\nOne night Ashley and Proxy test out the Smiley myth with a random person online. After typing \"I did it for the lulz\" three times, to their horror, the stranger is murdered. Proxy convinces Ashley to stay silent. However, Ashley begins experiencing guilt over the stranger's death. She also begins to believe that Smiley is stalking her and intends to kill her; her friends and a psychiatrist write this off as anxious hallucinations and nightmares. Ashley eventually goes to the police; there she tries to convince them, to no avail, to investigate the murders caused by Smiley. The police dismiss her, implying that she is going crazy and quite possibly on the receiving end of a large, elaborate prank.\n\nWhen Proxy loses contact with Zane, she video chats Ashley in hysterics. Ashley goes to his house to check on him, only to find him shot dead with a handgun he purchased for self-defense. Instead of calling the police, Ashley picks up the gun and orders Proxy to type \"I did it for the lulz\" three times, hoping to ambush and kill Smiley. However, she accidentally shoots Binder, who had been coming over to check on her. Moments later, Smiley appears and slits Binder's throat. Ashley is then attacked by multiple Smileys, finally throwing herself out a window to her presumed death to escape them.\n\nIt is then revealed that all Ashley's classmates, including Proxy, Binder, and the babysitter murdered in the opening, are all part of a fringe group of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. They created the Smiley myth as a large-scale prank, although they are satisfied with Ashley's death. Binder states that Smiley will likely live on long after them and inspire copycat killings.\n\nLater, Proxy is video-chatting with Zane, questioning their morality. Zane dismisses her worries and types \"I did it for the lulz\" three times as a joke. However, a real Smiley appears behind Proxy, kills her, and then waves at Zane via webcam. In a [[post-credits scene]], Ashley is revealed to have survived her fall.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Caitlin Gerard]] as Ashley Brookes\n* [[Melanie Papalia]] as Proxy\n* [[Shane Dawson]] as Binder\n* Andrew

Jiminez also won the mountains classification at the 1965 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a&nbsp;\u2013 becoming one of (now) four riders to complete the Tour/Vuelta double by winning both races' mountains competitions in the same year.\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1965 Tour de France}}\n\nThe 1965 Tour started with 130 cyclists, divided into 13 teams of 10 cyclists.<ref name=\"letour-start-list\">{{cite web|title=The history of the Tour de France \u2013 Year 1965 \u2013 The starters|url=http://histo.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1965/partants.html|work=[[Tour de France]]|publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]]|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Each team had to include at least six cyclists with the same nationality.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010372634:mpeg21:a0111|title=130 renners in de Tour de France|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 August 2016|date=8 June 1965|work=De waarheid|publisher=Delpher|page=5}}</ref> The Molteni\u2013Ignis team was a combined team, with 5 cyclists from {{ct|Molteni|1965}} and 5 from {{ct|Ignis|1965}}.<ref name=\"letour-start-list\" />\n\nThe teams entering the race were:<ref name=\"letour-start-list\" />\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{ct|Ford France|1965}}\n* {{ct|Margnat|1965}}\n* {{ct|Mercier|1965}}\n* {{ct|Pelforth|1965}}\n* {{ct|Peugeot|1965}}\n* {{ct|Flandria|1965}}\n* {{ct|Solo|1965}}\n* {{ct|Groene Leeuw|1965}}\n* {{ct|Televizier|1965}}\n* {{ct|Ferrys|1965}}\n* {{ct|KAS|1965}}\n* {{ct|Molteni|1965}}\u2013{{ct|Ignis|1965}}\n* {{ct|Salvarani|1965}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Pre-race favourites==\n[[Jacques Anquetil]], who won the previous four Tours de France (1961\u20131964), did not participate in this tour.

On the second stage, run over [[cobbles]], three riders escaped: [[Bernard Vandekerkhove]], [[Felice Gimondi]] and [[Victor Van Schil]]. Vandekerkhove won the stage, and became the new leader.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nOn the third stage, there was again a group away, including Gimondi and [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]]. Darrigade was one of the best sprinters of that time, so Gimondi knew he would not win if it would end in a sprint. Gimondi therefore escaped with one kilometer to go. Gimondi was able to stay away, and won the stage; it was the first victory in his professional career.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}} Gimondi also took the lead in the general classification, represented by the yellow jersey; this made Gimondi a protected rider in his team because his sponsor wanted to keep the publicity associated with the yellow jersey as long as possible.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nThe second part of the fifth stage was run as an individual time trial. It was won by [[Raymond Poulidor]], but Gimondi was second, and kept his lead. He had a margin in the general classification of over two minutes on Vandekerkhove, while his team leader Adorni was in third place.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nIn the seventh stage, Adorni fell. His team-mates, including Gimondi, waited for him and lost some time; because of this, Vandekerkhove took back the lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nThe ninth stage was the first Pyrenean stage, and during that stage eleven riders abandoned because of sickness. This included the leader of the general classification Vandekerkhove, and also Adorni. Rumours about doping that went wrong circulated, but nothing was ever proven. Gimondi became the leader of the general classification again, and because his team leader Adorni had left the race, he also became the undisputed leader of this team.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\n[[File:Tour de l'Avenir 1964 winner Felice Gimondi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Felice Gimondi]], winner of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], pictured after he won the 1964 [[Tour de l'Avenir]] \u2013 the then semi-professional equivalent of the [[Tour de France]]]]\nThere were two more days in the Pyrenees, but these gave no big changes in the general classification. After stage eleven, Gimondi was still leading, with Poulidor in second place, more than three minutes behind. Poulidor expected that the inexperienced Gimondi would fail somewhere, and expected fourth-placed Motta to be his biggest rival. Poulidor announced he would attack on [[Mont Ventoux]] in stage fourteen.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nDuring that stage, Poulidor showed his strength, and won. He had a big margin over Motta, but Gimondi had stayed surprisingly close, and kept the lead in the general classification with 34 seconds.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nIn the following Alp stages, Poulidor did not attack; he planned to take the lead in the mountain time trial of stage eighteen. But this was won by Gimondi, who thus increased his lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nThe only realistic chance left for Poulidor to win back time was in the individual time trial that ended the race. Poulidor was a good time trialist, and on a good day he should have been able to win back enough time to win the race. But Gimondi was the fastest man that day, and won the stage, and thereby the Tour de France.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1965 Tour de France, two of them awarding [[Cycling jersey|jerseys]] to their leaders.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013455}} The most important was the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave \"stars\". The cyclist with the most \"stars\" in all stages lead the \"star classification\".{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} Felice Gimondi won this classification.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=56}} The jury gave [[Cees Haast]] the prize more most unlucky cyclist, because he lost his sixth place in the general classification after a fall, and the prize for most sympathetic cyclist to [[Gianni Motta]], because he was always in a good mood and did not look for apologies after losing to Gimondi.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19650715&id=GVA-19650715-01016007|date=15 July 1965|accessdate=21 August 2016|work=Gazet Van Antwerpen|publisher=Concentra|language=Dutch|title=Ongelukkigste: Duez en super-ongelukkigste: Kees Haast}}</ref> The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Lautaret]] on stage 17.

It took place between 22 June and 14 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of {{convert|4188|km|0|abbr=on}}. In his first year as a professional, [[Felice Gimondi]], a substitute replacement on the {{ct|Salvarani|1965}} team, captured the overall title ahead of [[Raymond Poulidor]], last year's second-place finisher.\n\nGimondi became one of only seven riders, the others being [[Alberto Contador]], [[Vincenzo Nibali]], [[Chris Froome]] and five-time Tour winners [[Jacques Anquetil]], [[Eddy Merckx]] and [[Bernard Hinault]] to have won all three of the major [[Grand Tours|Tours]]. Besides Gimondi's first tour and win, it was a first for other reasons: the 1965 Tour started in [[Cologne|Cologne, Germany]] (the first time the Tour started in Germany,<ref name=\"mdc1965\" /> and only the third time it started outside France), and it was the first time the start ramp was used in [[Individual time trial|time trials]].\n\n[[Jan Janssen (cyclist)|Jan Janssen]], who won the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] the previous year successfully defended his title; he won another points title in [[1967 Tour de France|1967]] and the overall title at the [[1968 Tour de France]].\n\n[[Julio Jim\u00e9nez]] won two stages and his first of three consecutive [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Jiminez also won the mountains classification at the 1965 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a&nbsp;\u2013 becoming one of (now) four riders to complete the Tour/Vuelta double by winning both races' mountains competitions in the same year.\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1965 Tour de France}}\n\nThe 1965 Tour started with 130 cyclists, divided into 13 teams of 10 cyclists.<ref name=\"letour-start-list\">{{cite web|title=The history of the Tour de France \u2013 Year 1965 \u2013 The starters|url=http://histo.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1965/partants.html|work=[[Tour de France]]|publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]]|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Each team had to include at least six cyclists with the same nationality.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010372634:mpeg21:a0111|title=130 renners in de Tour de France|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 August 2016|date=8 June 1965|work=De waarheid|publisher=Delpher|page=5}}</ref> The Molteni\u2013Ignis team was a combined team, with 5 cyclists from {{ct|Molteni|1965}} and 5 from {{ct|Ignis|1965}}.<ref name=\"letour-start-list\" />\n\nThe teams entering the race were:<ref name=\"letour-start-list\" />\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* {{ct|Ford France|1965}}\n* {{ct|Margnat|1965}}\n* {{ct|Mercier|1965}}\n* {{ct|Pelforth|1965}}\n* {{ct|Peugeot|1965}}\n* {{ct|Flandria|1965}}\n* {{ct|Solo|1965}}\n* {{ct|Groene Leeuw|1965}}\n* {{ct|Televizier|1965}}\n* {{ct|Ferrys|1965}}\n* {{ct|KAS|1965}}\n* {{ct|Molteni|1965}}\u2013{{ct|Ignis|1965}}\n* {{ct|Salvarani|1965}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Pre-race favourites==\n[[Jacques Anquetil]], who won the previous four Tours de France (1961\u20131964), did not participate in this tour.

On the second stage, run over [[cobbles]], three riders escaped: [[Bernard Vandekerkhove]], [[Felice Gimondi]] and [[Victor Van Schil]]. Vandekerkhove won the stage, and became the new leader.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nOn the third stage, there was again a group away, including Gimondi and [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]]. Darrigade was one of the best sprinters of that time, so Gimondi knew he would not win if it would end in a sprint. Gimondi therefore escaped with one kilometer to go. Gimondi was able to stay away, and won the stage; it was the first victory in his professional career.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}} Gimondi also took the lead in the general classification, represented by the yellow jersey; this made Gimondi a protected rider in his team because his sponsor wanted to keep the publicity associated with the yellow jersey as long as possible.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nThe second part of the fifth stage was run as an individual time trial. It was won by [[Raymond Poulidor]], but Gimondi was second, and kept his lead. He had a margin in the general classification of over two minutes on Vandekerkhove, while his team leader Adorni was in third place.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nIn the seventh stage, Adorni fell. His team-mates, including Gimondi, waited for him and lost some time; because of this, Vandekerkhove took back the lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nThe ninth stage was the first Pyrenean stage, and during that stage eleven riders abandoned because of sickness. This included the leader of the general classification Vandekerkhove, and also Adorni. Rumours about doping that went wrong circulated, but nothing was ever proven. Gimondi became the leader of the general classification again, and because his team leader Adorni had left the race, he also became the undisputed leader of this team.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\n[[File:Tour de l'Avenir 1964 winner Felice Gimondi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Felice Gimondi]], winner of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], pictured after he won the 1964 [[Tour de l'Avenir]] \u2013 the then semi-professional equivalent of the [[Tour de France]]]]\nThere were two more days in the Pyrenees, but these gave no big changes in the general classification. After stage eleven, Gimondi was still leading, with Poulidor in second place, more than three minutes behind. Poulidor expected that the inexperienced Gimondi would fail somewhere, and expected fourth-placed Motta to be his biggest rival. Poulidor announced he would attack on [[Mont Ventoux]] in stage fourteen.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nDuring that stage, Poulidor showed his strength, and won. He had a big margin over Motta, but Gimondi had stayed surprisingly close, and kept the lead in the general classification with 34 seconds.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nIn the following Alp stages, Poulidor did not attack; he planned to take the lead in the mountain time trial of stage eighteen. But this was won by Gimondi, who thus increased his lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nThe only realistic chance left for Poulidor to win back time was in the individual time trial that ended the race. Poulidor was a good time trialist, and on a good day he should have been able to win back enough time to win the race. But Gimondi was the fastest man that day, and won the stage, and thereby the Tour de France.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=6\u201313}}\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1965 Tour de France, two of them awarding [[Cycling jersey|jerseys]] to their leaders.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013455}} The most important was the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave \"stars\". The cyclist with the most \"stars\" in all stages lead the \"star classification\".{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} Felice Gimondi won this classification.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=56}} The jury gave [[Cees Haast]] the prize more most unlucky cyclist, because he lost his sixth place in the general classification after a fall, and the prize for most sympathetic cyclist to [[Gianni Motta]], because he was always in a good mood and did not look for apologies after losing to Gimondi.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19650715&id=GVA-19650715-01016007|date=15 July 1965|accessdate=21 August 2016|work=Gazet Van Antwerpen|publisher=Concentra|language=Dutch|title=Ongelukkigste: Duez en super-ongelukkigste: Kees Haast}}</ref> The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Lautaret]] on stage 17.
