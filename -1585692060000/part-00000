This specialization likely contributed to the decline in their populations, as collectors could easily identify their specific habitats.<ref name=cryptobranchus291/> One collector noted, at one time, \"one could find a specimen under almost every suitable rock\", but after years of collecting, the population had declined significantly.<ref name=pennsylvania362>{{cite journal |last=Swanson |first=P.L. |title=Notes on the Amphibians of Venango County, Pennsylvania |journal=American Midland Naturalist |date=September 1948 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=362\u2013371 |doi=10.2307/2421606|jstor=2421606 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/de97dc599e48a9f71ccb80e8e9fe906ed4932ea2 }}</ref> The same collector noted, he \"never found two specimens under the same rock\", corroborating the account given by other researchers that hellbenders are generally solitary; they are thought to gather only during the mating season.<ref name=pennsylvania362/><ref name=cryptobranchus604>{{cite journal |last=Humphries |first=W.J. |last2=Pauley |first2=T.K. |title=Seasonal Changes in Nocturnal Activity of the Hellbender, ''Cryptobranchus alleganiensis'', in West Virginia |journal=Journal of Herpetology |date=December 2000 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=604\u2013607 |jstor=1565279 |doi=10.2307/1565279}}</ref>\n\nBoth subspecies, ''C. a. alleganiensis'' and ''C. a. bishopi'' undergo a [[metamorphosis]] after around a year and a half of life.<ref name=cryptobranchus291/> At this point, when they are roughly 13.5&nbsp;cm long, they lose the gills present during their larval stage. Until then, they are easily confused with mudpuppies, and can be differentiated often only through toe number.<ref name=fws1/> After this metamorphosis, hellbenders must be able to absorb oxygen through the folds in their skin, which is largely behind the need for fast-moving, oxygenated water. If a hellbender ends up in an area of slow-moving water, not enough of it will pass over its skin in a given time, making it difficult to garner enough oxygen to support necessary respiratory functions. A below-favorable oxygen content can make life equally difficult.<ref name=pennsylvania362/>\n\nHellbenders are preyed upon by diverse predators, including various fish and reptiles (including both snakes and turtles). [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] of eggs is also considered a common occurrence.<ref name=amphibiaweb1/>\n\n==Life history and behavior==\n===Behavior===\nOnce a hellbender finds a favorable location, it generally does not stray too far from it\u2014except occasionally for breeding and hunting\u2014and will protect it from other hellbenders both in and out of the breeding season.<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/> While the range of two hellbenders may overlap, they are noted as rarely being present in the overlapping area when the other salamander is in the area. The species is at least somewhat nocturnal, with peak activity being reported by one source as occurring around \"two hours after dark\" and again at dawn (although the dawn peak was recorded in the lab and could be misleading as a result).<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/><ref name=fws1/> Nocturnal activity has been found to be most prevalent in early summer, perhaps coinciding with highest water depths.\n\n===Diet===\n''C. alleganiensis'' feeds primarily on [[crayfish]] and small fish. One report, written by a commercial collector in the 1940s, noted a trend of more crayfish predation in the summer during times of higher prey activity, whereas fish made up a larger part of the winter diet, when crayfish are less active. There seems to be a specific temperature range in which hellbenders feed, as well: between 45 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0F. Cannibalism\u2014mainly on eggs\u2014has been known to occur within hellbender populations. One researcher claimed perhaps density is maintained, and density dependence in turn created, in part by [[intraspecific]] predation.<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/><ref name=cryptobranchus291/><ref name=fws1/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe hellbenders' [[breeding season]] begins in late August or early- to mid-September and can continue as late as the end of November, depending on region. They exhibit no [[sexual dimorphism]], except during the fall mating season, when males have a bulging ring around their [[cloaca]]l glands. Unlike most salamanders, the hellbender performs [[external fertilization]]. Before mating, each male excavates a brood site, a saucer-shaped depression under a rock or log, with its entrance positioned out of the direct current, usually pointing downstream. The male remains in the brood site awaiting a female. When a female approaches, the male guides or drives her into his burrow and prevents her from leaving until she [[Oviposition|oviposits]].<ref name=fws1/>\n\nFemale hellbenders lay 150\u2013200 eggs over a two- to three-day period; the eggs are 18\u201320&nbsp;mm in diameter, connected by five to 10 cords. As the female lays eggs, the male positions himself alongside or slightly above them, spraying the eggs with sperm while swaying his tail and moving his hind limbs, which disperses the sperm uniformly. The male often tempts other females to lay eggs in his nest, and as many as 1,946<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|author=Chris Mattison|year=2005|page=23|publisher=The Brown Reference Group}}</ref> eggs have been counted in a single nest. [[Cannibalism]], however, leads to a much lower number of eggs in hellbender nests than would be predicted by egg counts.<ref name=fws1/>\n\nAfter oviposition, the male drives the female away from the nest and guards the eggs. Incubating males rock back and forth and undulate their lateral skin folds, which circulates the water, increasing oxygen supply to both eggs and adult. Incubation lasts from 45 to 75 days, depending on region.<ref name=fws1/>\n\nHatchling hellbenders are 25\u201333&nbsp;mm long, have a [[yolk sac]] as a source of energy for the first few months of life, and lack functional limbs.<ref name=fws1/>\n\n==Adaptations==\nHellbenders are superbly adapted to the shallow, fast-flowing, rocky streams in which they live. Their flattened shape offers little resistance to the flowing water, allowing them to work their way upstream and also to crawl into narrow spaces under rocks. Although their eyesight is relatively poor, they have light-sensitive cells all over their bodies. Those on their tails are especially finely tuned and may help them position safely under rocks without their tails poking out to give themselves away.

This specialization likely contributed to the decline in their populations, as collectors could easily identify their specific habitats.<ref name=cryptobranchus291/> One collector noted, at one time, \"one could find a specimen under almost every suitable rock\", but after years of collecting, the population had declined significantly.<ref name=pennsylvania362>{{cite journal |last=Swanson |first=P.L. |title=Notes on the Amphibians of Venango County, Pennsylvania |journal=American Midland Naturalist |date=September 1948 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=362\u2013371 |doi=10.2307/2421606|jstor=2421606 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/de97dc599e48a9f71ccb80e8e9fe906ed4932ea2 }}</ref> The same collector noted, he \"never found two specimens under the same rock\", corroborating the account given by other researchers that hellbenders are generally solitary; they are thought to gather only during the mating season.<ref name=pennsylvania362/><ref name=cryptobranchus604>{{cite journal |last=Humphries |first=W.J. |last2=Pauley |first2=T.K. |title=Seasonal Changes in Nocturnal Activity of the Hellbender, ''Cryptobranchus alleganiensis'', in West Virginia |journal=Journal of Herpetology |date=December 2000 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=604\u2013607 |jstor=1565279 |doi=10.2307/1565279}}</ref>\n\nBoth subspecies, ''C. a. alleganiensis'' and ''C. a. bishopi'' undergo a [[metamorphosis]] after around a year and a half of life.<ref name=cryptobranchus291/> At this point, when they are roughly 13.5&nbsp;cm long, they lose the gills present during their larval stage. Until then, they are easily confused with mudpuppies, and can be differentiated often only through toe number.<ref name=fws1/> After this metamorphosis, hellbenders must be able to absorb oxygen through the folds in their skin, which is largely behind the need for fast-moving, oxygenated water. If a hellbender ends up in an area of slow-moving water, not enough of it will pass over its skin in a given time, making it difficult to garner enough oxygen to support necessary respiratory functions. A below-favorable oxygen content can make life equally difficult.<ref name=pennsylvania362/>\n\nHellbenders are preyed upon by diverse predators, including various fish and reptiles (including both snakes and turtles). [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] of eggs is also considered a common occurrence.<ref name=amphibiaweb1/>\n\n==Life history and behavior==\n===Behavior===\nOnce a hellbender finds a favorable location, it generally does not stray too far from it\u2014except occasionally for breeding and hunting\u2014and will protect it from other hellbenders both in and out of the breeding season.<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/> While the range of two hellbenders may overlap, they are noted as rarely being present in the overlapping area when the other salamander is in the area. The species is at least somewhat nocturnal, with peak activity being reported by one source as occurring around \"two hours after dark\" and again at dawn (although the dawn peak was recorded in the lab and could be misleading as a result).<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/><ref name=fws1/> Nocturnal activity has been found to be most prevalent in early summer, perhaps coinciding with highest water depths.\n\n===Diet===\n''C. alleganiensis'' feeds primarily on [[crayfish]] and small fish. One report, written by a commercial collector in the 1940s, noted a trend of more crayfish predation in the summer during times of higher prey activity, whereas fish made up a larger part of the winter diet, when crayfish are less active. There seems to be a specific temperature range in which hellbenders feed, as well: between 45 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0F. Cannibalism\u2014mainly on eggs\u2014has been known to occur within hellbender populations. One researcher claimed perhaps density is maintained, and density dependence in turn created, in part by [[intraspecific]] predation.<ref name=\"cryptobranchus604\"/><ref name=cryptobranchus291/><ref name=fws1/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe hellbenders' [[breeding season]] begins in late August or early- to mid-September and can continue as late as the end of November, depending on region. They exhibit no [[sexual dimorphism]], except during the fall mating season, when males have a bulging ring around their [[cloaca]]l glands. Unlike most salamanders, the hellbender performs [[external fertilization]]. Before mating, each male excavates a brood site, a saucer-shaped depression under a rock or log, with its entrance positioned out of the direct current, usually pointing downstream. The male remains in the brood site awaiting a female. When a female approaches, the male guides or drives her into his burrow and prevents her from leaving until she [[Oviposition|oviposits]].<ref name=fws1/>\n\nFemale hellbenders lay 150\u2013200 eggs over a two- to three-day period; the eggs are 18\u201320&nbsp;mm in diameter, connected by five to 10 cords. As the female lays eggs, the male positions himself alongside or slightly above them, spraying the eggs with sperm while swaying his tail and moving his hind limbs, which disperses the sperm uniformly. The male often tempts other females to lay eggs in his nest, and as many as 1,946<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|author=Chris Mattison|year=2005|page=23|publisher=The Brown Reference Group}}</ref> eggs have been counted in a single nest. [[Cannibalism]], however, leads to a much lower number of eggs in hellbender nests than would be predicted by egg counts.<ref name=fws1/>\n\nAfter oviposition, the male drives the female away from the nest and guards the eggs. Incubating males rock back and forth and undulate their lateral skin folds, which circulates the water, increasing oxygen supply to both eggs and adult. Incubation lasts from 45 to 75 days, depending on region.<ref name=fws1/>\n\nHatchling hellbenders are 25\u201333&nbsp;mm long, have a [[yolk sac]] as a source of energy for the first few months of life, and lack functional limbs.<ref name=fws1/>\n\n==Adaptations==\nHellbenders are superbly adapted to the shallow, fast-flowing, rocky streams in which they live. Their flattened shape offers little resistance to the flowing water, allowing them to work their way upstream and also to crawl into narrow spaces under rocks. Although their eyesight is relatively poor, they have light-sensitive cells all over their bodies. Those on their tails are especially finely tuned and may help them position safely under rocks without their tails poking out to give themselves away. They have a good sense of smell and move upstream in search of food such as dead fish, following the trail of scent molecules. Smell is possibly their most important sense when hunting. They also have a [[lateral line]] similar to those of fish, with which they can detect vibrations in the water.<ref name=Mattison2>{{cite book|last=Mattison|first=Chris|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|year=2005|publisher=Grange Books|location=Rochester, Kent|isbn=978-1-84013-794-1|page=22|chapter=What is an amphibian?}}</ref>\n[[File:Hellbender Salamander.JPG|thumb|Hellbender on display at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Washington, DC]]\n\n==Conservation status==\nResearch throughout the range of the hellbender has shown a dramatic decline in populations in the majority of locations. Many different [[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] sources have helped to create this decline, including the [[siltation]] and sedimentation, blocking of dispersal/migration routes, and destruction of riverine habitats created by dams and other development, as well as pollution, disease and overharvesting for commercial and scientific purposes.<ref name=hellbender94/><ref name=phylogeography1235/> As many of these detrimental effects have irreversibly damaged hellbender populations, it is important to conserve the remaining populations through protecting habitats and\u2014perhaps in places where the species was once endemic and has been extirpated\u2014by augmenting numbers through [[reintroduction]].<ref name=hellbender94/>\n\nDue to sharp decreases seen in the Ozark subspecies, researchers have been trying to differentiate ''C. a. alleganiensis'' and ''C. a. bishopi'' into two management units. Indeed, researchers found significant genetic divergence between the two groups, as well as between them and another isolated population of ''C. a. alleganiensis''. This could be reason enough to ensure work is done on both subspecies, as preserving extant [[genetic diversity]] is of crucial ecological importance.<ref name=hellbender94/>\n\nThe Ozark hellbender has been listed as an endangered species under the [[Endangered Species Act]] by the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] since October 5, 2011. This hellbender subspecies inhabits the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] and Spring River systems in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, and its population has declined an estimated 75% since the 1980s, with only about 590 individuals remaining in the wild. Degraded water quality, habitat loss resulting from impoundments, ore and gravel mining, sedimentation, and collection for the [[pet trade]] are thought to be the main factors resulting in the amphibian's decline.<ref>{{cite press release |title=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Lists the Ozark Hellbender as Endangered and Moves to Include Hellbenders in Appendix III of CITES |publisher=U.

The Upanishad asserts that this knowledge of \"I am Brahman\", and that there is no difference between \"I\" and \"you\", or \"I\" and \"him\" is a source of liberation, and not even gods can prevail over such a liberated man. For example, in hymn 1.4.10,<ref name=bu1410/>\n\n{{quote|\nBrahman was this before; therefore it knew even the \u0100tma (soul, himself). I am Brahman, therefore it became all. And whoever among the gods had this enlightenment, also became That. It is the same with the sages, the same with men. Whoever knows the self as \u201cI am Brahman,\u201d becomes all this universe. Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their \u0100tma. Now, if a man worships another god, thinking: \u201cHe is one and I am another,\u201d he does not know. He is like an animal to the gods. As many animals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes anguish; how much more so when many are taken away?

In hymn 4.10.1 through 4.10.3, for example, it explains it with example of rivers, some of which flow to the east and some to the west, but ultimately all merge into the ocean and become one. In the same way, the individual souls are pure being, states the ''Chandogya Upanishad''; an individual soul is pure truth, and an individual soul is a manifestation of the ocean of one universal soul.<ref>[[Max M\u00fcller]], Upanishads, Wordsworth, {{ISBN|978-1840221022}}, pages XXIII-XXIV</ref>\n\n====Other Upanishads====\n\u0100tman is a key topic of the Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some teach that Brahman (highest reality; universal principle; being-consciousness-bliss) is identical with \u0100tman, while others teach that \u0100tman is part of Brahman but not identical to it.<ref name=johnkoller/><ref>[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|B0QzAQAAMAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads}}, Dover Publications, pages 86-111, 182-212</ref> This ancient debate flowered into various dual and non-dual theories in Hinduism. The [[Brahmasutra]] by Badarayana (~100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects, particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different (advaita).<ref name=johnkoller/> This synthesis overcame the dualistic tradition of Samkhya-Yoga schools and realism-driven traditions of Nyaya-Vaiseshika schools, enabling it to become the foundation of Vedanta as Hinduism's enduring spiritual tradition.<ref name=johnkoller>John Koller (2012), Shankara, in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-102</ref>\n\n==Schools of thought==\n{{Hindu philosophy}}\nAll major orthodox schools of Hinduism \u2013 Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta \u2013 accept the foundational premise of the Vedas and Upanishads that \"\u0100tman exists\". [[\u0100tman (Jainism)|Jainism]] too accepts this premise, though it has its own idea of what that means. In contrast, both Buddhism and the [[Charvaka]]s deny that there is anything called \"\u0100tman/soul/self\".<ref name=johnplott/>\n\nKnowing \u0100tman, also referred to as self-knowledge, is one of the defining themes of all major orthodox schools of Hinduism, but they diverge on how. In Hinduism, self-knowledge is the knowledge and understanding of Atman, what it is, and what it is not. Hinduism considers Atman as distinct from the ever-evolving individual personality characterized with ''Ahamkara'' (ego, non-spiritual psychological I-ness Me-ness), habits, prejudices, desires, impulses, delusions, fads, behaviors, pleasures, sufferings and fears. Human personality and ''Ahamkara'' shift, evolve or change with time, state the schools of Hinduism; while, Atman doesn't.<ref name=johnplott/> Atman, state these schools, is the unchanging, eternal, innermost radiant self that is unaffected by personality, unaffected by ego of oneself, unaffected by ego of others; Atman is that which is ever-free, never-bound, one that seeks, realizes and is the realized purpose, meaning, liberation in life.<ref>James Hart (2009), Who One Is: Book 2: Existenz and Transcendental Phenomenology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1402091773}}, pages 2-3, 46-47</ref><ref>Richard White (2012), The Heart of Wisdom: A Philosophy of Spiritual Life, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1442221161}}, pages 125-131</ref> Puchalski states, \"the ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to transcend individually, to realize one's own true nature\", the inner essence of oneself, which is divine and pure.<ref>Christina Puchalski (2006), A Time for Listening and Caring, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195146820}}, page 172</ref>\n\n===Vedanta school===\nPhilosophical schools such as [[Advaita]] (non-dualism) see the \"spirit/soul/self\" within each living entity as being fully identical with Brahman.<ref name=arvindsharmaintro/> The Advaita school believes that there is one soul that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, and there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (Atman), no separate god soul (Brahman).<ref name=arvindsharmaintro>Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86</ref> The oneness unifies all beings, there is divine in every being, and that all existence is a single reality, state the Advaita Vedanta Hindus.

Jivas are bound by maya, which hides their true self, which is characterized by eternal existence, consciousness, and bliss. There are an infinite number of jivas. They are extremely subtle, indivisible, impierceable, ageless, and immortal. While residing within the heart, a jiva pervades the entire body by its capacity to know (gn\u0101nshakti), making it animate. It is the form of knowledge (gn\u0101nswar\u016bp) as well as the knower (gn\u0101t\u0101). The jiva is the performer of virtuous and immoral actions (karmas) and experiences the fruits of these actions. It has been eternally bound by maya; as a result, it roams within the cycle of birth and death. Birth is when a jiva acquires a new body, and death is when it departs from its body. Just as one abandons one's old clothes and wears new ones, the jiva renounces its old body and acquires a new one.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An introduction to Swaminarayan Hindu theology|last=Paramtattvadas, Sadhu|date=2017-08-17|isbn=9781107158672|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|oclc=964861190}}</ref>\n\n===Mimamsa school===\n\u0100tman, in the ritualism-based [[M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101]] school of Hinduism, is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active essence that is identified as I-consciousness.<ref name=ptraju2>PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 79-80</ref><ref name=chrisbartley>Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445</ref> Unlike all other schools of Hinduism, Mimamsaka scholars considered ego and Atman as the same.

The Upanishad asserts that this knowledge of \"I am Brahman\", and that there is no difference between \"I\" and \"you\", or \"I\" and \"him\" is a source of liberation, and not even gods can prevail over such a liberated man. For example, in hymn 1.4.10,<ref name=bu1410/>\n\n{{quote|\nBrahman was this before; therefore it knew even the \u0100tma (soul, himself). I am Brahman, therefore it became all.

Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their \u0100tma. Now, if a man worships another god, thinking: \u201cHe is one and I am another,\u201d he does not know.

In hymn 4.10.1 through 4.10.3, for example, it explains it with example of rivers, some of which flow to the east and some to the west, but ultimately all merge into the ocean and become one. In the same way, the individual souls are pure being, states the ''Chandogya Upanishad''; an individual soul is pure truth, and an individual soul is a manifestation of the ocean of one universal soul.<ref>[[Max M\u00fcller]], Upanishads, Wordsworth, {{ISBN|978-1840221022}}, pages XXIII-XXIV</ref>\n\n====Other Upanishads====\n\u0100tman is a key topic of the Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some teach that Brahman (highest reality; universal principle; being-consciousness-bliss) is identical with \u0100tman, while others teach that \u0100tman is part of Brahman but not identical to it.<ref name=johnkoller/><ref>[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|B0QzAQAAMAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads}}, Dover Publications, pages 86-111, 182-212</ref> This ancient debate flowered into various dual and non-dual theories in Hinduism. The [[Brahmasutra]] by Badarayana (~100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects, particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different (advaita).<ref name=johnkoller/> This synthesis overcame the dualistic tradition of Samkhya-Yoga schools and realism-driven traditions of Nyaya-Vaiseshika schools, enabling it to become the foundation of Vedanta as Hinduism's enduring spiritual tradition.<ref name=johnkoller>John Koller (2012), Shankara, in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-102</ref>\n\n==Schools of thought==\n{{Hindu philosophy}}\nAll major orthodox schools of Hinduism \u2013 Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta \u2013 accept the foundational premise of the Vedas and Upanishads that \"\u0100tman exists\". [[\u0100tman (Jainism)|Jainism]] too accepts this premise, though it has its own idea of what that means. In contrast, both Buddhism and the [[Charvaka]]s deny that there is anything called \"\u0100tman/soul/self\".<ref name=johnplott/>\n\nKnowing \u0100tman, also referred to as self-knowledge, is one of the defining themes of all major orthodox schools of Hinduism, but they diverge on how. In Hinduism, self-knowledge is the knowledge and understanding of Atman, what it is, and what it is not. Hinduism considers Atman as distinct from the ever-evolving individual personality characterized with ''Ahamkara'' (ego, non-spiritual psychological I-ness Me-ness), habits, prejudices, desires, impulses, delusions, fads, behaviors, pleasures, sufferings and fears. Human personality and ''Ahamkara'' shift, evolve or change with time, state the schools of Hinduism; while, Atman doesn't.<ref name=johnplott/> Atman, state these schools, is the unchanging, eternal, innermost radiant self that is unaffected by personality, unaffected by ego of oneself, unaffected by ego of others; Atman is that which is ever-free, never-bound, one that seeks, realizes and is the realized purpose, meaning, liberation in life.<ref>James Hart (2009), Who One Is: Book 2: Existenz and Transcendental Phenomenology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1402091773}}, pages 2-3, 46-47</ref><ref>Richard White (2012), The Heart of Wisdom: A Philosophy of Spiritual Life, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1442221161}}, pages 125-131</ref> Puchalski states, \"the ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to transcend individually, to realize one's own true nature\", the inner essence of oneself, which is divine and pure.<ref>Christina Puchalski (2006), A Time for Listening and Caring, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195146820}}, page 172</ref>\n\n===Vedanta school===\nPhilosophical schools such as [[Advaita]] (non-dualism) see the \"spirit/soul/self\" within each living entity as being fully identical with Brahman.<ref name=arvindsharmaintro/> The Advaita school believes that there is one soul that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, and there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (Atman), no separate god soul (Brahman).<ref name=arvindsharmaintro>Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86</ref> The oneness unifies all beings, there is divine in every being, and that all existence is a single reality, state the Advaita Vedanta Hindus.

Jivas are bound by maya, which hides their true self, which is characterized by eternal existence, consciousness, and bliss. There are an infinite number of jivas. They are extremely subtle, indivisible, impierceable, ageless, and immortal. While residing within the heart, a jiva pervades the entire body by its capacity to know (gn\u0101nshakti), making it animate. It is the form of knowledge (gn\u0101nswar\u016bp) as well as the knower (gn\u0101t\u0101). The jiva is the performer of virtuous and immoral actions (karmas) and experiences the fruits of these actions. It has been eternally bound by maya; as a result, it roams within the cycle of birth and death. Birth is when a jiva acquires a new body, and death is when it departs from its body. Just as one abandons one's old clothes and wears new ones, the jiva renounces its old body and acquires a new one.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An introduction to Swaminarayan Hindu theology|last=Paramtattvadas, Sadhu|date=2017-08-17|isbn=9781107158672|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|oclc=964861190}}</ref>\n\n===Mimamsa school===\n\u0100tman, in the ritualism-based [[M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101]] school of Hinduism, is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active essence that is identified as I-consciousness.<ref name=ptraju2>PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 79-80</ref><ref name=chrisbartley>Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445</ref> Unlike all other schools of Hinduism, Mimamsaka scholars considered ego and Atman as the same.

Both Samkhya and Advaita consider the ego ([[Yoga (philosophy)#Epistemology|asmita]], [[ahamkara]]) rather than the \u0100tman to be the cause of pleasure and pain.<ref>Paranjpe, A. C.

P. 263-264. {{ISBN|978-0-306-45844-6}}.</ref> They both consider \u0100tman as self, soul that is innermost essence of any individual being. Further, they both consider self-knowledge as the means of liberation, freedom and bliss. The difference between Samkhya and Advaita is that Samkhya holds there are as many ''Atmans'' as there are beings, each distinct reality unto itself, and self-knowledge a state of Ipseity. In contrast, the monism theme of Advaita holds that there is one soul, and that the self of all beings are connected and unified with Brahman.<ref name=johnplott/> The essence and spirit of everything is related to each self, asserts Advaita Vedanta, and each Atman is related to the essence and spirit of everything; all is one; self is Brahman and Brahman is self.

It is the self that is discovered and realized in the Kaivalya state, in both schools. Like Samkhya, this is not a single universal \u0100tman.

Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

The album was then mixed by O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in [[Atlanta]].<ref>(1996) Album notes for ''No Code'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet]. New York: Sony Music.</ref>\n\nThe sessions for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist [[Jeff Ament]] wasn't made aware that the band was recording until three days into the sessions, and said that he \"wasn't super involved with that record on any level.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\".

We'd all just get pissed off at each other.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions,<ref name=\"Garbarini\">Garbarini, Vic. \"All For One: Pearl Jam Yield to the Notion That United They Stand and Divided They Fall\".

''ACE Weekly''. 2003.</ref> Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was \"more on-the-fly during the making of ''No Code'', and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\">Peiken, Matt. \"Jack Irons: This Inner Life\". ''[[Modern Drummer]]''. June 1998.</ref>\n\nMcCready said that a lot of the songs were developed out of [[jam session]]s, and said \"I think we kind of rushed it a little bit.\"<ref>Engleheart, Murray. \"Interview with Mike McCready\". ''Massive!''. February/March 1998.</ref> Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals.<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> He added that \"Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of ''No Code'', he was so burnt, it was so much work for him.\"<ref name=\"philadelphia\">Moon, Tom. \"Calling Off the Crusades\". ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. February 8, 1998.</ref> The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that \"everybody was on their best musical behavior around him.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him \"a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest.\"<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> Vedder said, \"Making ''No Code'' was all about gaining perspective.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

The song is heavily influenced by [[garage rock]].\n}}\nWhile ''Vitalogy'' had shifted away from the earlier albums' accessible compositions and polished production, ''No Code'' represented a deliberate break from ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'''s [[Arena rock|stadium]] sound, favoring [[Experimental rock|experimental]] ballads and noisy [[garage rock]] songs. It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony (\"[[Off He Goes]]\"), [[Music of Asia|Eastern]] influences (\"[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]\"), and [[spoken word]] (\"I'm Open\"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs \"Who You Are\" and \"In My Tree\". Irons stated, \"To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some things into a few songs.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\"/> Vedder said, \"We realized that we had an opportunity to experiment.\"<ref name=\"spin\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that \"''No Code'' displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\"<ref name=\"entertainmentweekly\"/>\n\nThe lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\".

From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the [[municipalities in Sudetenland]].  A suitable position in the middle of the [[Jesen\u00edky Mountains]] provides ample tourism opportunities to the town, which offers sites of cultural interest that include a Baroque castle and many historical buildings.\n\n== Geography ==\nBrunt\u00e1l is situated between the Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains and the rolling hills of the N\u00edzk\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains. The town lies in a valley surrounded by several hills (''Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch'', {{convert|672|m|abbr=on}}; ''Vod\u00e1rensk\u00fd vrch'', {{convert|599|m|abbr=on}}; ''Zadn\u00ed Zelen\u00fd vrch'', {{convert|563|m|abbr=on}}; ''Kozinec'', {{convert|639|m|abbr=on}}). The Black Creek (''\u010cern\u00fd potok'') with its tributaries, the Oak Creek (''Bukov\u00fd potok''), the Mare Creek (''Kobyl\u00ed potok''), and the Waterworks Creek (''Vod\u00e1rensk\u00fd potok''), run through Brunt\u00e1l. The Mare Pond (''Kobyl\u00ed rybn\u00edk'') is located in the middle of the town. The Oak Pond (''Bukov\u00fd rybn\u00edk''), with a surface area of 5 ha,<ref>Czech Fishing Union. 2006.

Retrieved June 28, 2009.</ref> is located approximately {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of the town. There are many signs of ancient volcanic activity from the [[Quaternary]] period. Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch ({{convert|672|m|abbr=on}}), Venu\u0161ina sopka ({{convert|655|m|abbr=on}}), Velk\u00fd Roudn\u00fd ({{convert|780|m|abbr=on}}), Mal\u00fd Roudn\u00fd ({{convert|770|m|abbr=on}}) are among these extinct volcanos. These volcanoes are a part of the Slune\u010dn\u00e1 Highlands (''Slune\u010dn\u00e1 vrchovina'') which is {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} long lying southwards from Brunt\u00e1l to Moravsk\u00fd Beroun, and includes the highest peak of the N\u00edzk\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains, Mount Slune\u010dn\u00e1 ({{convert|800|m|abbr=on}}).\n\n== Geology ==\nBrunt\u00e1l belongs to the [[Bohemian Massif]] which is the salient geological feature in the Czech Republic. Brunt\u00e1l lies in the Moravian-Silesian Unit, which is a preplatform unit formed at the end of the [[Variscan orogeny]] (''Hercynian orogeny''). Brunt\u00e1l is a part of the region that consists mainly of sedimentary rocks formed during the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian Epoch]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period. In terms of Czech geology, this geologic period is called ''kulm''. The mentioned region stretches from [[Brno]] to [[Krnov]].\n\nThe main geological formations distributed across the town and its surroundings are [[turbidite]]s. The most common rock in the area is [[slate]]. In the west of the town slate enriched by [[apatite]] and [[zircon]] can be found. In the east of the town lighter forms of slate occur. [[Fluvial]] [[sand]]s and [[rubble]] together with [[deluvial]] sediments of [[clay]] and sand origin lie along the rivers and creeks. [[Eluvial]] sediments prevail in the west part of the town.\n\nThe most remarkable geological site in the vicinity of the town is Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch. Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch is a [[Volcano|stratovolcano]] (''compositive volcano'') formed by both explosive and effusive eruptions, and is thus composed of [[pyroclastic|pyroclastic rocks]], of which 40\u201380% consist of [[lapilli]], 10\u201350% consist of [[volcanic bombs]] and the rest, [[volcanic ash]].<ref name=\"Zapletal\">Zapletal, Jan. 1995.

The colors of the pyroclastic rocks vary from brown to yellow. The older effusive eruptions resulted in the creation of [[nephelinite|nepheline basalt]] and [[nephelinite]]. The effusive phase is approximately 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 million years old<ref name=\"Zapletal\"/> and therefore it dates back to the [[Pliocene]] (also called ''Pleiocene'') and [[Pleistocene]] [[Geologic time scale|Epochs]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding and Lords of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l (1213\u20131614) ===\n\nAccording to the [[Uni\u010dov]] Charter issued by [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Czech king]] Ottokar I of Bohemia in 1223, Brunt\u00e1l was founded by [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravian Margrave]], [[Vladislaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus Henry]] in 1213, and granted [[Magdeburg rights]]. Being the first city in [[Czech lands]] to be granted Magdeburg rights, Brunt\u00e1l was an [[appellate court]] for all cities endowed with Magdeburg rights in Northern Moravia (including [[Olomouc]] and [[Opava]]) until 1352.<ref>Niesner 2012, part 1.</ref><ref>Wihoda 1998, p. 23, 25, and 27.</ref> The reasons behind the founding of the city probably included utilising mineral [[ore]] deposits in the region, as well as thwarting colonization by the [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw|Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw (''Breslau'')]].<ref>Wihoda 1998, p. 24</ref>\n\nBrunt\u00e1l was [[Land tenure|owned]] by various branches of the [[P\u0159emyslid Dynasty]] (namely, the [[Margraviate of Moravia|Margraves of Moravia]], the [[Duchy of Troppau|Dukes of Opava (''Troppau'')]], and the [[Duchy of Krnov|Dukes of Krnov (''J\u00e4gerndorf'')]]) almost continuously from 1213 to 1474. During the [[Bohemian War (1468\u201378)|war between the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Kingdom of Hungary]] Brunt\u00e1l was [[Military occupation|occupied]] by the armed forces of [[Matthias Corvinus]] who, as a [[Pledge (law)|''pledgor'']], gave  the town as a pledge to his supporter, Johann von W\u00fcrben (Jan of Vrbno). Despite being only a [[Possession (law)|possessor]] of the town, Johann von W\u00fcrben started to style himself ''von W\u00fcrben und Freudenthal'' (''of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l'') from 1476 onwards.<ref name=\"Niesner 2012, part 2\">Niesner 2012, part 2.</ref>\n\nSons of Jan of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l (Bernard, Hynek, and Mikul\u00e1\u0161) managed to secure an [[allodial title]] (ownership) to the town together with neighbouring villages and [[Mining|mines]] from the Dukes of Krnov in 1506. These Lords of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l were steadily stripping the town of its [[Town privileges|privileges]] and forced local inhabitants into [[corv\u00e9e|corv\u00e9e labour]] and [[Forced conversion|religious conversion]] to [[Lutheranism]]. These encroachments upon town privileges and the liberties of its citizens resulted in an unsuccessful [[rebellion]] against Jan the Elder of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l (''Johann der \u00c4ltere von W\u00fcrben und Freudenthal'') in 1556.\n\nDespite political decline Brunt\u00e1l's economy flourished under the reigns of the Lords of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l. The [[Market town]] status of Brunt\u00e1l was strengthened by the emergence of new [[guilds]], together with entitlements granted by [[Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria]] in 1535 and 1558, and by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1577 to host several [[market (place)|markets]] each year.<ref name=\"Niesner 2012, part 2\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Additionally, many other kinds of [[industry]] intensified at this time, like the smitheries built at [[Such\u00e1 Rudn\u00e1]] (1405) and [[Mezina]] (1567), and seven timber mills in 1579. In May 1617 Brunt\u00e1l was bought by the last Lord of Vrbno, John IV of Vrbno, who joined the [[Thirty Years' War|Uprising of the Estates]] and was awarded the rank of Director in 1619. His close ties to the \"Winter King\" [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], who was John's guest in February 1620, left him in very dangerous circumstances at the outcome of the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, when he was forced to leave his Freudenthal property and escape from the country. The emperor Ferdinand II (1619\u20131637) confiscated the Brunt\u00e1l domain and gave it to his brother, Karl I of Austria (1619\u20131624) who was the Grand Master (Hochmeister) of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]].\n\n=== [[Teutonic Order]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] (1625\u20131918) ===\n\nThe Freudenthal domain, together with other properties of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]], was under the direct administration of the Grand Master, and a lieutenancy was established in 1625. The [[Thirty Years' War]] damaged the town considerably, and after that conflict Freudenthal never returned to its former importance. During the 18th century several disasters befell the town, such as the plagues of 1714 and 1739, and the great fires of 1748 and 1764. Nevertheless, many new baroque buildings were built during this period and a new [[post office]] was established in 1748. Signs of [[Industrial Revolution|intensified industry]] could be seen in Freudenthal during the 19th century: in textiles, Brunt\u00e1l was among the most important towns in [[Silesia]]. In 1885, a public [[hospital]] was opened, the first in [[Czech Silesia]], and many new high schools were established during the second half of the 19th century. During the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, Freudenthal was occupied by the [[Prussia#Imperial Prussia|Prussian]] Army, and Freudenthal Castle served as a hospital for soldiers.\n\nAccording to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] census of 1910 the town had 8,066 inhabitants, 7,965 of whom had permanent residence there. The census asked people for their native language: 7,939 (99.7%) were German-speaking. [[Jews]] were not allowed to declare [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as their native language, thus most of them professed the German language. The most populous religious group was the [[Roman Catholics]] with 7,725 (95.8%), followed by the [[Protestants]] with 229 (2.8%), and the [[Jews]] with 97 (1.2%).<ref>Ludwig Patryn (ed): ''[http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=11734 Die Ergebnisse der Volksz\u00e4hlung vom 31.

Between 1919 and 1924, the land-possessions of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] in Brunt\u00e1l were put under state administration. In the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]], Brunt\u00e1l had a significant number of German inhabitants and only a very small Czech population. Not surprisingly, German [[nationalism]] gained many sympathizers among German inhabitants of Brunt\u00e1l, which was reflected in an attempted uprising in September 1938. After signing the [[Munich Agreement]] on September 29, 1938, Brunt\u00e1l was occupied by German troops. It was liberated by the Soviet army ([[Red army|Red Army]]) on May 7, 1945. In 1946 the lands of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] were confiscated in accordance with the Decree of the President, [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], and transferred to the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1945\u20131948)|Czechoslovak Republic]]. As was the case in most of the former Czechoslovakia, the German population was forcibly expelled.\n\n== Symbols of Brunt\u00e1l ==\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:Coat of arms of Brunt\u00e1l.jpg|right|120px|Bruntal Coat of Arms]]\nAn [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] (name used for blue colour in [[heraldry]]) shield is a background of the [[coat of arms]]. It consists of a valley surrounded by two rocks (coloured [[argent]]) wooded by [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (name used for green colour in heraldry) trees. There is an adit located in the rock on the right. A miner wearing a [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] (name used for black colour in heraldry) coat, sable cap and argent trousers stands on a vert grass in the middle of the valley. He represents a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] of the coat of arms. We can see him holding a gad in his left hand lying over his left shoulder, he is also holding a moil in his right hand. Both the gad and the moil are coloured [[Tincture (heraldry)|proper]] (name used for natural colour in heraldry).\n\nThe first appearance of Bruntal coat of arms is dated back to 1287 when the coat of arms containing a charge of a miner was published as a part of a document. The charge depicts a miner to commemorate mining in surroundings of Bruntal. Also the adit placed in the rock follows the same purpose. This mining took a place from the 13th to the 17th century. Gold, silver and iron [[ores]] were mined in surroundings of Bruntal. The valley is a result of an original [[Germans|German]] name of Bruntal which is Freudenthal and where the second part of the name \u201cthal\u201d means \u201ca valley\u201d in German.\n\n===Bruntal flag===\n[[File:Flag of Bruntal.svg|right|120px|Bruntal Flag]]\nIt consists of a black triangle, white [[Flag terminology|chevron]], and blue field. The black triangle is placed in the [[Flag terminology|hoist]] (adjacent to a flagpole) and it reaches to the middle of the field. The blue field is placed in the [[Flag terminology|fly]]. The blue field and the black triangle are divided by the white chevron, which has its top in \u00be of length of the flag. The width of the chevron is \u00bc of the flag width. Flag ratio is 2:3.\n\n===Bruntal colours===\n[[File:BRUNTAL TRICOLOR.svg|right|120px|Bruntal Flag]]\nThe official colours of Bruntal are black, white, and blue. The official tricolor of Bruntal consists of colours mentioned earlier. The order of colours in the tricolor is as follows black at the top, white in the middle, and blue at the bottom.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Education in the Czech Republic]] comprises four basic levels or degrees of  [[schools]], each of them presented in Brunt\u00e1l. The first level (degree) of education is represented by [[preschool]]s offering a care for children, who has turn at least 2 years, throughout a day. The second level (degree) of education includes [[primary education]], which is [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] for all children from the age of 6 or 7 years until completion of the [[Ninth grade|9th grade]]. The third level of education is represented by [[secondary education]] offered by variety of [[high schools]] ranging from secondary schools providing [[vocational education]] to [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]] preparing students for a [[college]] or [[university]] education. The fourth level (degree) of the [[education in the Czech Republic]] is represented by [[higher education]].\n\nAccording to the mentioned scheme, it is possible to distinguish schools located in Brunt\u00e1l as follows. There are 5 [[preschools]], 6 [[primary schools]], and 6 [[high schools]] and a consultation centre of the Business School Ostrava (which is a private college). In addition, children with [[intellectual disability]] are provided their [[compulsory education]] in a special primary school (in Czech terminology called ''Special Elementary School'' and ''Practical Elementary School'').\n\nArt education in Brunt\u00e1l is addressed by Art Elementary School offering both [[Music education|music]] and [[visual arts education]]. However this kind of school does not substitute for [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] [[primary school]] or [[high school]] and therefore children interested in [[arts]] are offered education apart of their [[Primary school|primary]] and [[high school]] attendance.\n\nAnother educational facility is the Leisure Time Centre. This facility is aimed at providing various [[leisure|leisure activities]] for [[children]] (6\u201315 years), [[Adolescence|young people]] (15\u201318), and [[adults]] of all ages. Understandably, attendance to this type of educational facility is entirely optional. The current sorts of activities offered by the Leisure Time Centre vary from [[sports]] ([[belly dancing]], [[volleyball]], [[gymnastics]], etc.) to [[fine arts]] ([[pottery]], playing various musical instruments).\n\n=== Primary schools ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the [[municipalities in Sudetenland]].  A suitable position in the middle of the [[Jesen\u00edky Mountains]] provides ample tourism opportunities to the town, which offers sites of cultural interest that include a Baroque castle and many historical buildings.\n\n== Geography ==\nBrunt\u00e1l is situated between the Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains and the rolling hills of the N\u00edzk\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains. The town lies in a valley surrounded by several hills (''Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch'', {{convert|672|m|abbr=on}}; ''Vod\u00e1rensk\u00fd vrch'', {{convert|599|m|abbr=on}}; ''Zadn\u00ed Zelen\u00fd vrch'', {{convert|563|m|abbr=on}}; ''Kozinec'', {{convert|639|m|abbr=on}}). The Black Creek (''\u010cern\u00fd potok'') with its tributaries, the Oak Creek (''Bukov\u00fd potok''), the Mare Creek (''Kobyl\u00ed potok''), and the Waterworks Creek (''Vod\u00e1rensk\u00fd potok''), run through Brunt\u00e1l. The Mare Pond (''Kobyl\u00ed rybn\u00edk'') is located in the middle of the town. The Oak Pond (''Bukov\u00fd rybn\u00edk''), with a surface area of 5 ha,<ref>Czech Fishing Union. 2006.

Retrieved June 28, 2009.</ref> is located approximately {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of the town. There are many signs of ancient volcanic activity from the [[Quaternary]] period. Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch ({{convert|672|m|abbr=on}}), Venu\u0161ina sopka ({{convert|655|m|abbr=on}}), Velk\u00fd Roudn\u00fd ({{convert|780|m|abbr=on}}), Mal\u00fd Roudn\u00fd ({{convert|770|m|abbr=on}}) are among these extinct volcanos. These volcanoes are a part of the Slune\u010dn\u00e1 Highlands (''Slune\u010dn\u00e1 vrchovina'') which is {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} long lying southwards from Brunt\u00e1l to Moravsk\u00fd Beroun, and includes the highest peak of the N\u00edzk\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains, Mount Slune\u010dn\u00e1 ({{convert|800|m|abbr=on}}).\n\n== Geology ==\nBrunt\u00e1l belongs to the [[Bohemian Massif]] which is the salient geological feature in the Czech Republic. Brunt\u00e1l lies in the Moravian-Silesian Unit, which is a preplatform unit formed at the end of the [[Variscan orogeny]] (''Hercynian orogeny''). Brunt\u00e1l is a part of the region that consists mainly of sedimentary rocks formed during the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian Epoch]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period. In terms of Czech geology, this geologic period is called ''kulm''. The mentioned region stretches from [[Brno]] to [[Krnov]].\n\nThe main geological formations distributed across the town and its surroundings are [[turbidite]]s. The most common rock in the area is [[slate]]. In the west of the town slate enriched by [[apatite]] and [[zircon]] can be found. In the east of the town lighter forms of slate occur. [[Fluvial]] [[sand]]s and [[rubble]] together with [[deluvial]] sediments of [[clay]] and sand origin lie along the rivers and creeks. [[Eluvial]] sediments prevail in the west part of the town.\n\nThe most remarkable geological site in the vicinity of the town is Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch. Uhl\u00ed\u0159sk\u00fd vrch is a [[Volcano|stratovolcano]] (''compositive volcano'') formed by both explosive and effusive eruptions, and is thus composed of [[pyroclastic|pyroclastic rocks]], of which 40\u201380% consist of [[lapilli]], 10\u201350% consist of [[volcanic bombs]] and the rest, [[volcanic ash]].<ref name=\"Zapletal\">Zapletal, Jan. 1995.

The colors of the pyroclastic rocks vary from brown to yellow. The older effusive eruptions resulted in the creation of [[nephelinite|nepheline basalt]] and [[nephelinite]]. The effusive phase is approximately 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 million years old<ref name=\"Zapletal\"/> and therefore it dates back to the [[Pliocene]] (also called ''Pleiocene'') and [[Pleistocene]] [[Geologic time scale|Epochs]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding and Lords of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l (1213\u20131614) ===\n\nAccording to the [[Uni\u010dov]] Charter issued by [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Czech king]] Ottokar I of Bohemia in 1223, Brunt\u00e1l was founded by [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravian Margrave]], [[Vladislaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus Henry]] in 1213, and granted [[Magdeburg rights]]. Being the first city in [[Czech lands]] to be granted Magdeburg rights, Brunt\u00e1l was an [[appellate court]] for all cities endowed with Magdeburg rights in Northern Moravia (including [[Olomouc]] and [[Opava]]) until 1352.<ref>Niesner 2012, part 1.</ref><ref>Wihoda 1998, p. 23, 25, and 27.</ref> The reasons behind the founding of the city probably included utilising mineral [[ore]] deposits in the region, as well as thwarting colonization by the [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw|Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw (''Breslau'')]].<ref>Wihoda 1998, p. 24</ref>\n\nBrunt\u00e1l was [[Land tenure|owned]] by various branches of the [[P\u0159emyslid Dynasty]] (namely, the [[Margraviate of Moravia|Margraves of Moravia]], the [[Duchy of Troppau|Dukes of Opava (''Troppau'')]], and the [[Duchy of Krnov|Dukes of Krnov (''J\u00e4gerndorf'')]]) almost continuously from 1213 to 1474. During the [[Bohemian War (1468\u201378)|war between the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Kingdom of Hungary]] Brunt\u00e1l was [[Military occupation|occupied]] by the armed forces of [[Matthias Corvinus]] who, as a [[Pledge (law)|''pledgor'']], gave  the town as a pledge to his supporter, Johann von W\u00fcrben (Jan of Vrbno). Despite being only a [[Possession (law)|possessor]] of the town, Johann von W\u00fcrben started to style himself ''von W\u00fcrben und Freudenthal'' (''of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l'') from 1476 onwards.<ref name=\"Niesner 2012, part 2\">Niesner 2012, part 2.</ref>\n\nSons of Jan of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l (Bernard, Hynek, and Mikul\u00e1\u0161) managed to secure an [[allodial title]] (ownership) to the town together with neighbouring villages and [[Mining|mines]] from the Dukes of Krnov in 1506. These Lords of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l were steadily stripping the town of its [[Town privileges|privileges]] and forced local inhabitants into [[corv\u00e9e|corv\u00e9e labour]] and [[Forced conversion|religious conversion]] to [[Lutheranism]]. These encroachments upon town privileges and the liberties of its citizens resulted in an unsuccessful [[rebellion]] against Jan the Elder of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l (''Johann der \u00c4ltere von W\u00fcrben und Freudenthal'') in 1556.\n\nDespite political decline Brunt\u00e1l's economy flourished under the reigns of the Lords of Vrbno and Brunt\u00e1l. The [[Market town]] status of Brunt\u00e1l was strengthened by the emergence of new [[guilds]], together with entitlements granted by [[Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria]] in 1535 and 1558, and by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1577 to host several [[market (place)|markets]] each year.<ref name=\"Niesner 2012, part 2\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Additionally, many other kinds of [[industry]] intensified at this time, like the smitheries built at [[Such\u00e1 Rudn\u00e1]] (1405) and [[Mezina]] (1567), and seven timber mills in 1579. In May 1617 Brunt\u00e1l was bought by the last Lord of Vrbno, John IV of Vrbno, who joined the [[Thirty Years' War|Uprising of the Estates]] and was awarded the rank of Director in 1619. His close ties to the \"Winter King\" [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], who was John's guest in February 1620, left him in very dangerous circumstances at the outcome of the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, when he was forced to leave his Freudenthal property and escape from the country. The emperor Ferdinand II (1619\u20131637) confiscated the Brunt\u00e1l domain and gave it to his brother, Karl I of Austria (1619\u20131624) who was the Grand Master (Hochmeister) of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]].\n\n=== [[Teutonic Order]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] (1625\u20131918) ===\n\nThe Freudenthal domain, together with other properties of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]], was under the direct administration of the Grand Master, and a lieutenancy was established in 1625. The [[Thirty Years' War]] damaged the town considerably, and after that conflict Freudenthal never returned to its former importance. During the 18th century several disasters befell the town, such as the plagues of 1714 and 1739, and the great fires of 1748 and 1764. Nevertheless, many new baroque buildings were built during this period and a new [[post office]] was established in 1748. Signs of [[Industrial Revolution|intensified industry]] could be seen in Freudenthal during the 19th century: in textiles, Brunt\u00e1l was among the most important towns in [[Silesia]]. In 1885, a public [[hospital]] was opened, the first in [[Czech Silesia]], and many new high schools were established during the second half of the 19th century. During the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, Freudenthal was occupied by the [[Prussia#Imperial Prussia|Prussian]] Army, and Freudenthal Castle served as a hospital for soldiers.\n\nAccording to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] census of 1910 the town had 8,066 inhabitants, 7,965 of whom had permanent residence there. The census asked people for their native language: 7,939 (99.7%) were German-speaking. [[Jews]] were not allowed to declare [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as their native language, thus most of them professed the German language. The most populous religious group was the [[Roman Catholics]] with 7,725 (95.8%), followed by the [[Protestants]] with 229 (2.8%), and the [[Jews]] with 97 (1.2%).<ref>Ludwig Patryn (ed): ''[http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=11734 Die Ergebnisse der Volksz\u00e4hlung vom 31.

Between 1919 and 1924, the land-possessions of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] in Brunt\u00e1l were put under state administration. In the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]], Brunt\u00e1l had a significant number of German inhabitants and only a very small Czech population. Not surprisingly, German [[nationalism]] gained many sympathizers among German inhabitants of Brunt\u00e1l, which was reflected in an attempted uprising in September 1938. After signing the [[Munich Agreement]] on September 29, 1938, Brunt\u00e1l was occupied by German troops. It was liberated by the Soviet army ([[Red army|Red Army]]) on May 7, 1945. In 1946 the lands of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] were confiscated in accordance with the Decree of the President, [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], and transferred to the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1945\u20131948)|Czechoslovak Republic]]. As was the case in most of the former Czechoslovakia, the German population was forcibly expelled.\n\n== Symbols of Brunt\u00e1l ==\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:Coat of arms of Brunt\u00e1l.jpg|right|120px|Bruntal Coat of Arms]]\nAn [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] (name used for blue colour in [[heraldry]]) shield is a background of the [[coat of arms]]. It consists of a valley surrounded by two rocks (coloured [[argent]]) wooded by [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (name used for green colour in heraldry) trees. There is an adit located in the rock on the right. A miner wearing a [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] (name used for black colour in heraldry) coat, sable cap and argent trousers stands on a vert grass in the middle of the valley. He represents a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] of the coat of arms. We can see him holding a gad in his left hand lying over his left shoulder, he is also holding a moil in his right hand. Both the gad and the moil are coloured [[Tincture (heraldry)|proper]] (name used for natural colour in heraldry).\n\nThe first appearance of Bruntal coat of arms is dated back to 1287 when the coat of arms containing a charge of a miner was published as a part of a document. The charge depicts a miner to commemorate mining in surroundings of Bruntal. Also the adit placed in the rock follows the same purpose. This mining took a place from the 13th to the 17th century. Gold, silver and iron [[ores]] were mined in surroundings of Bruntal. The valley is a result of an original [[Germans|German]] name of Bruntal which is Freudenthal and where the second part of the name \u201cthal\u201d means \u201ca valley\u201d in German.\n\n===Bruntal flag===\n[[File:Flag of Bruntal.svg|right|120px|Bruntal Flag]]\nIt consists of a black triangle, white [[Flag terminology|chevron]], and blue field. The black triangle is placed in the [[Flag terminology|hoist]] (adjacent to a flagpole) and it reaches to the middle of the field. The blue field is placed in the [[Flag terminology|fly]]. The blue field and the black triangle are divided by the white chevron, which has its top in \u00be of length of the flag. The width of the chevron is \u00bc of the flag width. Flag ratio is 2:3.\n\n===Bruntal colours===\n[[File:BRUNTAL TRICOLOR.svg|right|120px|Bruntal Flag]]\nThe official colours of Bruntal are black, white, and blue. The official tricolor of Bruntal consists of colours mentioned earlier. The order of colours in the tricolor is as follows black at the top, white in the middle, and blue at the bottom.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Education in the Czech Republic]] comprises four basic levels or degrees of  [[schools]], each of them presented in Brunt\u00e1l. The first level (degree) of education is represented by [[preschool]]s offering a care for children, who has turn at least 2 years, throughout a day. The second level (degree) of education includes [[primary education]], which is [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] for all children from the age of 6 or 7 years until completion of the [[Ninth grade|9th grade]]. The third level of education is represented by [[secondary education]] offered by variety of [[high schools]] ranging from secondary schools providing [[vocational education]] to [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]] preparing students for a [[college]] or [[university]] education. The fourth level (degree) of the [[education in the Czech Republic]] is represented by [[higher education]].\n\nAccording to the mentioned scheme, it is possible to distinguish schools located in Brunt\u00e1l as follows. There are 5 [[preschools]], 6 [[primary schools]], and 6 [[high schools]] and a consultation centre of the Business School Ostrava (which is a private college). In addition, children with [[intellectual disability]] are provided their [[compulsory education]] in a special primary school (in Czech terminology called ''Special Elementary School'' and ''Practical Elementary School'').\n\nArt education in Brunt\u00e1l is addressed by Art Elementary School offering both [[Music education|music]] and [[visual arts education]]. However this kind of school does not substitute for [[Compulsory education|compulsory]] [[primary school]] or [[high school]] and therefore children interested in [[arts]] are offered education apart of their [[Primary school|primary]] and [[high school]] attendance.\n\nAnother educational facility is the Leisure Time Centre. This facility is aimed at providing various [[leisure|leisure activities]] for [[children]] (6\u201315 years), [[Adolescence|young people]] (15\u201318), and [[adults]] of all ages. Understandably, attendance to this type of educational facility is entirely optional.

Unlike the ''Traction Avant'' predecessor, there was no top-of-range model with a powerful [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] engine. Citro\u00ebn had planned an air-cooled [[flat-6]] engine for the car, but did not have the funds to put the prototype engine into production.\n\nThe DS placed third in the 1999 [[Car of the Century]] competition, and fifth on ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'''s \"100 Coolest Cars\" listing in 2005.<ref name=\"automobilemag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/0410_coolest_cars/stingray.html|title=Automobile Magazine&nbsp;\u2013 100 Coolest Cars|accessdate=29 July 2008|work=}}</ref> It was also named the most beautiful car of all time by ''[[Classic & Sports Car]]'' magazine after a poll of 20 world-renowned car designers, including [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]], [[Ian Callum]], [[Roy Axe]], [[Paul Bracq]], and [[Leonardo Fioravanti (engineer)|Leonardo Fioravanti]].<ref name=\"motorcities.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcities.com/vehicle/09B4E032327279.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908041613/http://www.motorcities.com/vehicle/09B4E032327279.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2009|title=1955 Citroen DS&nbsp;\u2013 The Most Beautiful Car of All Time|publisher=Motorcities.com|accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Name ==\n\nBoth the DS and its simpler sibling, the ID, used a punning name. \"DS\" is pronounced in French as \"D\u00e9esse\" (goddess); \"ID\" is pronounced as \"Id\u00e9e\" (idea).

It combined a small {{cvt|55|HP|kW|disp=flip}} flat-4 air-cooled engine with [[Hydropneumatic suspension]].

Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted [[gearstick]], and separate [[Fender (automobile)|fender]]s began to seem a little old-fashioned in the 1970s.\n\nCitro\u00ebn invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]], which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width.<ref name=\"Fall\">{{cite web | url=http://boitierrouge.com/2015/05/16/citroen-sm-la-chute-de-sa-majeste/| title= Citroen SM: the fall of \"Her Majesty\"| publisher=Boitier Rouge| language=French|date=16 May 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2017 | author=}}</ref> The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit.

Axles, wheel bearings, steering knuckles, and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.<ref>Citro\u00ebn SM parts and repair manuals</ref>\n\nThe SM had a different purpose than replacing the 15-year-old DS design, however - it was meant to launch Citro\u00ebn into a completely new [[grand tourer|luxury grand touring]] [[market segment]]. Only fitted with a costly, exotic [[Maserati]] engine, the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS. The SM was not designed to be a practical 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] suitable as a large [[family car]], the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe. Typically, manufacturers would introduce low-volume [[coup\u00e9]]s based on parts shared with an existing saloon, not as unique models, a contemporary example being the [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class]].<ref>Mercedes-Benz Buyer's Guide, Fred Larimer, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0760318119}} Page 81</ref> BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid size sedan (5 series), large coupe (6 series), and large sedan (7 series) sharing common underpinnings.<ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe SM's high price and limited utility of the [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS. While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars, a 'modern DS' and the smaller [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], it was left to the CX alone to provide Citro\u00ebn's large family or executive car in the model range.<ref name=Automobilia1974/><ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe last DS came off the production line on 24 April 1975 - the manufacturer had taken the elementary precaution of building up approximately eight months of inventory of the \"break\" (estate/station wagon) version of the DS, to cover the period till the autumn of 1975, when the estate/station wagon version of the CX would be introduced.<ref name=Automobilia1974/>\n\n==Development==\nThe DS always maintained its size and shape, with easily removable, unstressed body panels, but certain design changes did occur.\nDuring the 20-year production life improvements were made on an ongoing basis.\n\n===ID 19 submodel to extend brand downwards (1957\u201369)===\nThe 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]].<ref>Bobbitt, p. 64.</ref> This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II, so a cheaper submodel, the Citro\u00ebn ID, was introduced in 1957. \n[[File:1967 Citroen ID19B pic3.JPG|right|thumb|1967 Citro\u00ebn ID19B]]\nThe ID shared the DS's body but was less powerful and luxurious.

This version had a more streamlined [[Headlamp#History of automotive headlamps|headlamp]] design, giving the car a notably shark-like appearance. This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy, and the inner set [[Headlamp#Directional headlamps|swivelled]] with the steering wheel. This allowed the driver to see \"around\" turns, especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night. The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable.<ref>{{cite book | title=Popular Science | date=July 1933 | publisher=Bonnier Corporation | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ | access-date=2020-03-15 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ/page/n60 59]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Kingston | first=Lewis | title=PH Origins: Directional headlights | website=PistonHeads | date=2018-11-19 | url=https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-origins/ph-origins-directional-headlights/39160 | access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\nBehind each glass cover lens, the inboard high-beam headlamp swivels by up to 80\u00b0 as the driver steers, throwing the beam along the driver's intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road.

The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid. With every \"inhalation\" of fresh moisture- (and dust-) laden air, the fluid absorbed more water.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nFor the 1967 model year, Citro\u00ebn introduced a new [[mineral oil]]-based fluid [[Hydropneumatic suspension#LHM|LHM]] (''Liquide Hydraulique Min\u00e9ral'').

It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack. 'Familiales' had a rear seat mounted further back in the cabin, with three folding seats between the front and rear squabs. The standard Break had two side-facing seats in the main load area at the back.\n\nThe Ambulance configuration was similar to that of the Break, but with a 60/30 split in the rear folding seat to accommodate a stretcher.

Note the \"mushroom\" brake pedal. (The pedal on the left is the parking brake)\n}}\n\n===Suspension===\nIn a [[hydropneumatic suspension]] system, each wheel is connected, not to a spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a [[hydraulic accumulator]] sphere of about 12&nbsp;cm in diameter containing pressurised [[nitrogen]], a cylinder containing [[hydraulic fluid]] screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a [[dashpot|damper valve]] between the piston and the sphere.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mycitroen.dk/library/ds/Red/Hydraulics/Chas'%20Hydraulic%20Course.pdf |title=The hydraulic system of the Citro\u00ebn DS explained |first=Charles |last=Vyse |date=April 2003 |website=mycitroen.dk |accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref> A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a ''height corrector'', a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five [[height adjustable suspension|heights]]: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, ''oleopneumatic'' (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. ''Hydropneumatic'' (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.)\n\nThe DS did not have a jack for lifting the car off the ground. Instead, the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand. To change a flat tyre, one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting, insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre, then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting. The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above ground, ready to be changed.<ref name=\"hemmings2\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2013/07/25/cars-of-futures-past-citroen-ds/|title=Cars of Futures Past &#8211; Citroen DS - Hemmings Daily|author=Hemmings.com|publisher=blog.hemmings.com|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> This system, used on the SM also, was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that, after the suspension was raised to the high position, lifted the tire clear of the ground. The DS system, while impressive to use, sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly, especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel.\n\n===Source and reserve of pressure===\nThe central part of the hydraulic system was the high-pressure pump, which maintained a pressure of between 130 and 150&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] in two ''accumulators''. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front [[brake]]s, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail.\n\nTwo different hydraulic pumps were used. The DS used a seven-cylinder [[axial piston pump]] driven off two belts and delivering 175 bar (2,540&nbsp;psi) of pressure. The ID19, with its simpler hydraulic system, had a single-cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the [[camshaft]].\n\n===Gearbox and clutch===\n\n====''Hydraulique'' or ''Citromatic''====\nThe DS was initially offered only with the \"hydraulique\" four-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission#Citro\u00ebn|semi-automatic]] (bvh\u2014\"bo\u00eete de vitesses hydraulique\") gearbox.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\"/>\n\nThis was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, operated by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the [[clutch]], engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the [[camshaft]] by a belt, the position of the [[butterfly valve]] in the carburetor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill.\n\nUnlike an automatic transmission, there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked.  In addition, the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped, so the car could not be left in gear when parked.  The only way to prevent the car from rolling (for example, if parked on a slope) is to use the parking brake.\n\n==== Manual\u2014four-speed and five-speed ====\nThe later and simpler ID19 had the same gearbox and clutch, manually operated. This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in 1963. The mechanical aspects of the [[gearbox]] and [[clutch]] were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID 19. In September 1970, Citro\u00ebn introduced a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, in addition to the original four-speed unit.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1996\">{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=John |title=Original Citro\u00ebn DS |year=1996 |publisher=Bay View Books |isbn=1-870979-71-0}}</ref>  All manual transmissions used a steering column mounted shifter.\n\n==== Fully automatic ====\nIn September 1971 Citro\u00ebn introduced a 3-speed fully [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] [[Borg-Warner 35 transmission]] gearbox, on the DS 21 and later DS 23 models.<ref>{{cite web |title=la DS \u00e0 boite automatique Borg Warner |url=http://www.nuancierds.fr/Citroen%20DS%20boite%20Borg%20Warner.htm |website=Le Nuancier DS |accessdate=18 July 2018 |language=French}}</ref> The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time. Many automatic DSs, fuel-injected DS 23 sedans with air conditioning, were sold in [[Australia]].\n\n===Engines===\n[[File:Citro\u00ebn Schnitt-DS Motor.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model shows engine set far back from front wheels (\"[[MF layout]]\"), and partially reveals configuration of the oleopneumatic suspension]]\nThe DS was originally designed around an [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] [[flat-6|flat-six]] based on the design of the [[Flat-twin|2-cylinder]] engine of the 2CV, similar to the motor in the [[Porsche 911]]. Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped.\n\nThus, for such a modern car, the engine of the original DS 19 was also old-fashioned. It was derived from the engine of the 11CV [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]] (models 11B and 11C).<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/michelin/ds/03.html|title=Citro\u00ebn DS the birth of the goddess 3|publisher=citroenet.org.uk|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> It was an [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of {{convert|78|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and a stroke of {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, giving a volumetric displacement of 1911&nbsp;cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} at 3800&nbsp;rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated {{convert|75|hp|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm.\n\nLike the Traction Avant, the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine, with the differential in between. Thus some consider the DS to be a [[MF layout|mid engine front-wheel drive]] car.<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\"/>\n\nThe DS and ID powerplants evolved throughout its 20-year production life. The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four-cylinder engine. The initial [[engine displacement|1911&nbsp;cc]] three main [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] engine (carried forward from the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]]) of the DS 19 was replaced in 1965 with the 1985&nbsp;cc five-bearing wet-cylinder motor, becoming the DS 19a (called DS 20 from September 1969).\n\n[[File:Citroen-DS-capot-ouvert.jpg|thumb|right|Spare tire, mounted under the hood]]\n\nThe DS 21 was also introduced for model year 1965. This was a 2175&nbsp;cc, five main bearing engine; power was 109&nbsp;hp<ref name=\"willson1995\">{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|year=1995|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref> This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] electronic [[fuel injection]] for 1970, making the DS one of the first mass-market cars to use electronic fuel injection. Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time, owing to the employment of larger inlet valves.\n\nLastly, 1973 saw the introduction of the 2347&nbsp;cc engine of the DS 23 in both carbureted and fuel-injected forms. The DS 23 with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model, producing {{convert|141|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Bobbitt, p. 131.</ref>\n\nIDs and their variants went through a similar evolution, generally lagging the DS by about one year. ID saloon models never received the DS 23 engine or fuel injection, although the Break/Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS 23 engine when it was introduced, supplemented the DS20 Break/Familiale.\n\nThe top of the range ID model, The DSuper5 (DP) gained the DS21 engine (the only model that this engine was retained in) for the 1973 model year and it was mated to a five-speed gearbox. This should not be confused with the 1985&nbsp;cc DSuper fitted with an optional \"low ratio\" five-speed gearbox, or with the previous DS21M (DJ) five-speed.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPresident [[Charles de Gaulle]] survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit-Clamart near [[Paris]] on August 22, 1962, planned by [[Algerian War]] veteran [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]]. The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns, disable the vehicles, and then close in for the kill.

It combined a small {{cvt|55|HP|kW|disp=flip}} flat-4 air-cooled engine with [[Hydropneumatic suspension]].

Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted [[gearstick]], and separate [[Fender (automobile)|fender]]s began to seem a little old-fashioned in the 1970s.\n\nCitro\u00ebn invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]], which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width.<ref name=\"Fall\">{{cite web | url=http://boitierrouge.com/2015/05/16/citroen-sm-la-chute-de-sa-majeste/| title= Citroen SM: the fall of \"Her Majesty\"| publisher=Boitier Rouge| language=French|date=16 May 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2017 | author=}}</ref> The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit.

Axles, wheel bearings, steering knuckles, and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.<ref>Citro\u00ebn SM parts and repair manuals</ref>\n\nThe SM had a different purpose than replacing the 15-year-old DS design, however - it was meant to launch Citro\u00ebn into a completely new [[grand tourer|luxury grand touring]] [[market segment]]. Only fitted with a costly, exotic [[Maserati]] engine, the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS. The SM was not designed to be a practical 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] suitable as a large [[family car]], the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe. Typically, manufacturers would introduce low-volume [[coup\u00e9]]s based on parts shared with an existing saloon, not as unique models, a contemporary example being the [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class]].<ref>Mercedes-Benz Buyer's Guide, Fred Larimer, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0760318119}} Page 81</ref> BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid size sedan (5 series), large coupe (6 series), and large sedan (7 series) sharing common underpinnings.<ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe SM's high price and limited utility of the [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS. While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars, a 'modern DS' and the smaller [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], it was left to the CX alone to provide Citro\u00ebn's large family or executive car in the model range.<ref name=Automobilia1974/><ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe last DS came off the production line on 24 April 1975 - the manufacturer had taken the elementary precaution of building up approximately eight months of inventory of the \"break\" (estate/station wagon) version of the DS, to cover the period till the autumn of 1975, when the estate/station wagon version of the CX would be introduced.<ref name=Automobilia1974/>\n\n==Development==\nThe DS always maintained its size and shape, with easily removable, unstressed body panels, but certain design changes did occur.\nDuring the 20-year production life improvements were made on an ongoing basis.\n\n===ID 19 submodel to extend brand downwards (1957\u201369)===\nThe 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]].<ref>Bobbitt, p. 64.</ref> This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II, so a cheaper submodel, the Citro\u00ebn ID, was introduced in 1957. \n[[File:1967 Citroen ID19B pic3.JPG|right|thumb|1967 Citro\u00ebn ID19B]]\nThe ID shared the DS's body but was less powerful and luxurious.

This version had a more streamlined [[Headlamp#History of automotive headlamps|headlamp]] design, giving the car a notably shark-like appearance. This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy, and the inner set [[Headlamp#Directional headlamps|swivelled]] with the steering wheel. This allowed the driver to see \"around\" turns, especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night. The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable.<ref>{{cite book | title=Popular Science | date=July 1933 | publisher=Bonnier Corporation | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ | access-date=2020-03-15 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ/page/n60 59]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Kingston | first=Lewis | title=PH Origins: Directional headlights | website=PistonHeads | date=2018-11-19 | url=https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-origins/ph-origins-directional-headlights/39160 | access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\nBehind each glass cover lens, the inboard high-beam headlamp swivels by up to 80\u00b0 as the driver steers, throwing the beam along the driver's intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road.

The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid. With every \"inhalation\" of fresh moisture- (and dust-) laden air, the fluid absorbed more water.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nFor the 1967 model year, Citro\u00ebn introduced a new [[mineral oil]]-based fluid [[Hydropneumatic suspension#LHM|LHM]] (''Liquide Hydraulique Min\u00e9ral'').

It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack. 'Familiales' had a rear seat mounted further back in the cabin, with three folding seats between the front and rear squabs. The standard Break had two side-facing seats in the main load area at the back.\n\nThe Ambulance configuration was similar to that of the Break, but with a 60/30 split in the rear folding seat to accommodate a stretcher.

Note the \"mushroom\" brake pedal. (The pedal on the left is the parking brake)\n}}\n\n===Suspension===\nIn a [[hydropneumatic suspension]] system, each wheel is connected, not to a spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a [[hydraulic accumulator]] sphere of about 12&nbsp;cm in diameter containing pressurised [[nitrogen]], a cylinder containing [[hydraulic fluid]] screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a [[dashpot|damper valve]] between the piston and the sphere.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mycitroen.dk/library/ds/Red/Hydraulics/Chas'%20Hydraulic%20Course.pdf |title=The hydraulic system of the Citro\u00ebn DS explained |first=Charles |last=Vyse |date=April 2003 |website=mycitroen.dk |accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref> A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a ''height corrector'', a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five [[height adjustable suspension|heights]]: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, ''oleopneumatic'' (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. ''Hydropneumatic'' (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.)\n\nThe DS did not have a jack for lifting the car off the ground. Instead, the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand. To change a flat tyre, one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting, insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre, then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting. The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above ground, ready to be changed.<ref name=\"hemmings2\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2013/07/25/cars-of-futures-past-citroen-ds/|title=Cars of Futures Past &#8211; Citroen DS - Hemmings Daily|author=Hemmings.com|publisher=blog.hemmings.com|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> This system, used on the SM also, was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that, after the suspension was raised to the high position, lifted the tire clear of the ground. The DS system, while impressive to use, sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly, especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel.\n\n===Source and reserve of pressure===\nThe central part of the hydraulic system was the high-pressure pump, which maintained a pressure of between 130 and 150&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] in two ''accumulators''. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front [[brake]]s, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail.\n\nTwo different hydraulic pumps were used. The DS used a seven-cylinder [[axial piston pump]] driven off two belts and delivering 175 bar (2,540&nbsp;psi) of pressure. The ID19, with its simpler hydraulic system, had a single-cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the [[camshaft]].\n\n===Gearbox and clutch===\n\n====''Hydraulique'' or ''Citromatic''====\nThe DS was initially offered only with the \"hydraulique\" four-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission#Citro\u00ebn|semi-automatic]] (bvh\u2014\"bo\u00eete de vitesses hydraulique\") gearbox.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\"/>\n\nThis was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, operated by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the [[clutch]], engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the [[camshaft]] by a belt, the position of the [[butterfly valve]] in the carburetor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill.\n\nUnlike an automatic transmission, there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked.  In addition, the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped, so the car could not be left in gear when parked.  The only way to prevent the car from rolling (for example, if parked on a slope) is to use the parking brake.\n\n==== Manual\u2014four-speed and five-speed ====\nThe later and simpler ID19 had the same gearbox and clutch, manually operated. This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in 1963. The mechanical aspects of the [[gearbox]] and [[clutch]] were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID 19. In September 1970, Citro\u00ebn introduced a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, in addition to the original four-speed unit.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1996\">{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=John |title=Original Citro\u00ebn DS |year=1996 |publisher=Bay View Books |isbn=1-870979-71-0}}</ref>  All manual transmissions used a steering column mounted shifter.\n\n==== Fully automatic ====\nIn September 1971 Citro\u00ebn introduced a 3-speed fully [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] [[Borg-Warner 35 transmission]] gearbox, on the DS 21 and later DS 23 models.<ref>{{cite web |title=la DS \u00e0 boite automatique Borg Warner |url=http://www.nuancierds.fr/Citroen%20DS%20boite%20Borg%20Warner.htm |website=Le Nuancier DS |accessdate=18 July 2018 |language=French}}</ref> The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time. Many automatic DSs, fuel-injected DS 23 sedans with air conditioning, were sold in [[Australia]].\n\n===Engines===\n[[File:Citro\u00ebn Schnitt-DS Motor.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model shows engine set far back from front wheels (\"[[MF layout]]\"), and partially reveals configuration of the oleopneumatic suspension]]\nThe DS was originally designed around an [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] [[flat-6|flat-six]] based on the design of the [[Flat-twin|2-cylinder]] engine of the 2CV, similar to the motor in the [[Porsche 911]]. Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped.\n\nThus, for such a modern car, the engine of the original DS 19 was also old-fashioned. It was derived from the engine of the 11CV [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]] (models 11B and 11C).<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/michelin/ds/03.html|title=Citro\u00ebn DS the birth of the goddess 3|publisher=citroenet.org.uk|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> It was an [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of {{convert|78|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and a stroke of {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, giving a volumetric displacement of 1911&nbsp;cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} at 3800&nbsp;rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated {{convert|75|hp|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm.\n\nLike the Traction Avant, the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine, with the differential in between. Thus some consider the DS to be a [[MF layout|mid engine front-wheel drive]] car.<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\"/>\n\nThe DS and ID powerplants evolved throughout its 20-year production life. The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four-cylinder engine. The initial [[engine displacement|1911&nbsp;cc]] three main [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] engine (carried forward from the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]]) of the DS 19 was replaced in 1965 with the 1985&nbsp;cc five-bearing wet-cylinder motor, becoming the DS 19a (called DS 20 from September 1969).\n\n[[File:Citroen-DS-capot-ouvert.jpg|thumb|right|Spare tire, mounted under the hood]]\n\nThe DS 21 was also introduced for model year 1965. This was a 2175&nbsp;cc, five main bearing engine; power was 109&nbsp;hp<ref name=\"willson1995\">{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|year=1995|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref> This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] electronic [[fuel injection]] for 1970, making the DS one of the first mass-market cars to use electronic fuel injection. Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time, owing to the employment of larger inlet valves.\n\nLastly, 1973 saw the introduction of the 2347&nbsp;cc engine of the DS 23 in both carbureted and fuel-injected forms. The DS 23 with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model, producing {{convert|141|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Bobbitt, p. 131.</ref>\n\nIDs and their variants went through a similar evolution, generally lagging the DS by about one year. ID saloon models never received the DS 23 engine or fuel injection, although the Break/Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS 23 engine when it was introduced, supplemented the DS20 Break/Familiale.\n\nThe top of the range ID model, The DSuper5 (DP) gained the DS21 engine (the only model that this engine was retained in) for the 1973 model year and it was mated to a five-speed gearbox. This should not be confused with the 1985&nbsp;cc DSuper fitted with an optional \"low ratio\" five-speed gearbox, or with the previous DS21M (DJ) five-speed.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPresident [[Charles de Gaulle]] survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit-Clamart near [[Paris]] on August 22, 1962, planned by [[Algerian War]] veteran [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]]. The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns, disable the vehicles, and then close in for the kill.
