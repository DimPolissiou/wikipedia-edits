In the fall of his senior year at the university, Miller began writing for the South Hills Record, mixing humor into his sports reporting. When the paper changed its payment structure to pay around an eighth of a penny per column inch, Miller quit.<ref name=Finder/> Miller graduated from Point Park in 1976 with a degree in journalism.<ref name=\"TVG bio\">{{cite web|title=Dennis Miller Biography|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/dennis-miller/bio/147096|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Finder/> Miller would later reflect on why he did not continue to pursue journalism, saying \"I'm just not that interested in other people's business and that's a tragic flaw in a journalist.\"<ref name=Tulsa/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter college, Miller was unable to find work in journalism. Instead, he moved through several occupations, including a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and an ice cream scooper at the Village Dairy.<ref name=Finder/> Reflecting on his pre-comedy job history in a later discussion with [[Tom Snyder]], Miller recalled leaving college and attending a real estate seminar at a \"bad hotel,\" which consisted of a five-hour lecture without bathroom breaks. Near the end of the lecture, he was told that he would only be paid by commission, which made Miller say \"I'm in Hell, I don't even know what I am going to do for a living here. I'm a nut case.\" Miller then worked as a delivery man for what he describes as \"an all-gay florist.\" Leaving that job, he worked as an ice cream scooper. Miller recalled that he was twenty-one\u2014five years out of high school and wearing a paper hat while working alongside teens excited about getting their driver's licenses. A spur to quit the ice cream scooping job was when the prettiest girl he had attended high school with came in and he was the one who had to take her order, which filled him with embarrassment.<ref name=Tom>{{cite video|title=1995-Dennis Miller|publisher=The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWAyOAz2xkU|date=July 28, 1995}}</ref> Miller later stated that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs, his life would become a [[Franz Kafka]] novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.<ref name=Joke/>\n\nLeaving the ice cream parlor, Miller joined the staff at Point Park's Recreation Room, where he was in charge of the bowling alley, video games, and running the air-hockey league.<ref name=Finder/> Air-hockey regulars nicknamed him \"Clarence\" after NHL Commissioner [[Clarence Campbell]], or called him \"Commish.\" When Miller's brother Jimmy was around, they referred to him as \"Commush\".<ref name=Finder/> A patron from that time recalled that Miller sat on pool tables telling jokes and honing his comedy to those in the rec room, which was the only place the commuters gathered. Miller and the other patrons closely followed the NFL at the time as it was the \"[[Pittsburgh Steelers#The Chuck Noll era|era of the Super Steelers]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\n===Stand-up===\nIn 1979 after seeing a [[Robin Williams]] comedy special on HBO, Miller decided that he had to pursue his dream of being a stand-up comedian.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Miller began pursuing a comedy career by performing at open-mic nights. He backed out of his first two attempts to perform at an open mic due to stage fright and anger with himself over the question of whether the drive to perform was a need for approval from others.<ref name=Duncan>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 11, 1989|first=Duncan|last=Strauss|title=He's Brainy, Funny--and Frightened?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-11/entertainment/ca-3378_1_stand-up-fresh-air-real-life}}</ref> When he finally made his d\u00e9but at the Oak's Lounge on Sleepy Hollow Road in Castle Shannon, most of Miller's family was in the audience to cheer him on.<ref name=Julina>{{cite news|title=Comic Killing' Em With Gags|first=Mike|last=Julina|date=February 23, 1980|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=12|url=\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/newspage/88936157/}}</ref>\n\nIn a later interview, Miller spoke of the stage presence he developed for his stand-up act to address his fears. (He emphasized that the comedy business will always be frightening as any error could spiral into the end of a career.) To compensate for his early fears, Miller said, \"I got up there and acted like the guy I always wanted to be to get through it. ...It's a part of me, but it's not the real me.\" He would keep his hands in his pockets to appear unfazed, or adjust his cuffs during an audience laugh to give the appearance of indifference to approval. Miller pointed out that part of his act is to show a \"hipper-than-thou\" persona, but then purposely undermine it at regular intervals for comedic effect.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nHe began appearing onstage at the Oak's Lounge in Castle Shannon while working at the Giant Eagle deli in [[Kennedy Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Kennedy]].<ref name=Finder/> Miller lived without a car and without much money in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh]], hitching rides or taking buses.<ref name=Finder/> He continued to do stand-ups in Oakland and at places like Brandy's in the Strip District and the Portfolio on Craig Street, eventually saving up $1,000 which he used to try to fast-track his comedy career by moving to New York City.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Julina/> Arriving there, Miller had to bribe a landlord $200 to give him a room, then had to pay the security deposit of $250 and the first month's rent of $250, resulting in his having spent $700 of his $1,000 savings the first day for a sparse, bunker-like room.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York he submitted a joke for a ''Playboy'' magazine contest for humor writing that was judged by an all-star panel including [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[David Brenner]], [[Martin Mull]], [[Art Buchwald]], and [[Buck Henry]].<ref name=Julina/> Of around 15,000 entries, Miller tied for second and his joke and picture appeared in the June 1979 issue of the magazine.<ref name=Duncan/><ref name=Julina/> Miller won $500 in ''Playboy''{{'}}s first annual humor competition with the following joke:\n{{quote|The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyone's problems, and in group sex you see them.|Dennis Miller|''Playboy'', June 1979<ref>{{cite news|date=June 1979|title=Funny Money|magazine=Playboy|volume=26|number=6|issn=0032-1478}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the first year and a half of his comedy career, Miller had heavily relied on props during his act, but he felt this limited him and switched to using purely language.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nMiller gained more exposure when he tried out for the New York Laff-Off Contest. The contest had 40 slots but 32 of them had already been filled by the top regulars who appeared at the three comedy venues sponsoring the competition. 350 people tried out for the remaining eight slots, some of whom had appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', or ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. Many of the comedians Miller was up against had hours of crafted material, while he had fine-tuned around ten minutes. To his surprise and delight, Miller earned one of the remaining slots. For the competition itself he appeared at the Improv and received a standing ovation, moving him onto the finals. While he did not win the Laff-Off, he was seen by dozens of talent agents, resulting in bookings at colleges and other clubs.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile he was working in New York City, ''[[Hustler Magazine]]'' listed Miller in a piece called \"The 10 Funniest People in America You'll Never See on TV\".<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York City, Miller supported himself by working rather mundane jobs during the day, such as bartender and payroll clerk, and by night made the rounds of New York clubs The Comic Strip, The Improvisation, and Catch a Rising Star.<ref name=Julina/> After about a year, unable to make a go of it, he returned to Pittsburgh.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\n==Television==\nHaving honed his stand-up comedy act, Miller was able to transition to television, increasing his audience base.\n\n===KDKA-TV===\nHaving gone through the comedy-club circuit, Miller returned to do his sight-gag routine back in Pittsburgh at Brandy's in August 1980. It was there that local television station [[KDKA-TV]] was shooting a piece for its ''Evening Magazine'' and offered him a job at the station. By the end of 1980 Miller acted as a warm-up in the afternoons for KDKA's ''Pittsburgh 2Day''. He then began starring in humorous segments for the syndicated ''[[Evening Magazine]]''. By 1983 he had become the host of ''Punchline,'' a Saturday-morning [[newsmagazine]] aimed at teenagers. In one episode he interviewed fellow comedian [[Pat Paulsen]]. Miller later reflected on this time, saying that \"you have to start somewhere,\" and that he was \"just pleased to be in front of a camera.\"<ref name=Finder/><ref>{{cite web|author=The Comedy Zone Humor Network |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |title=Dennis Miller : Comedian Profile |publisher=Comedy-zone.net |accessdate=2010-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030529/http://comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this time Miller also performed stand-up in New York City comedy clubs such as [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch A Rising Star]] and The Comic Strip. While in New York, Miller saw a show by [[Richard Belzer]] and noted how he barked at the crowd rather than embraced it, was cutting rather than cute. Miller adopted this comedic philosophy.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nDuring performances at comedy clubs in Pittsburgh, Miller befriended [[Jay Leno]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. In 1984 Leno found Miller an apartment in Los Angeles and he and Seinfeld arranged a d\u00e9but for Miller at [[The Improv]].<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Joke/> Miller resigned from KDKA and moved to Los Angeles to try to further his comedy career.\n\nMiller's brothers Rich and Jimmy joined him in Los Angeles, taking up varied jobs around The Improv such as booking shows, acting as bouncer, and selling tickets. Jimmy would go on to become a power talent agent with Gold Miller, and Rich would run RCM Entertainment, booking comedians across the country.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Los Angeles, Leno was a big influence on Miller as he was to many upcoming comedians in the area at the time. Young comedians would gather at Leno's home late at night and he would offer critiques with humorous, biting wit. Leno would also tape television appearances of his group and show them during such sessions while offering more humorous critiques. Miller would later fondly recall the time, saying it was like \"sitting at his knee, querying [[Yoda]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\nMiller appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'', where he lost out to fellow comedian [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]] after the two tied on judges' scores; Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating. Miller made his first appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on June 24, 1985 (other guests were [[Phil Collins]] and [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]]).<ref name=Joke/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=epguides.com|url=http://epguides.com/LateNightwithDavidLetterman/|title=Late Night with David Letterman (a Guest Stars & Air Dates Guide)}}</ref>\n\n===''Saturday Night Live''===\nMiller's big break came in 1985 when he was discovered by [[Lorne Michaels]] at [[The Comedy Store]]. Michaels had him come in for an audition. Miller did an audition in L.A. for SNL and that went well enough for him to be brought to New York for a second audition in a room in Times Square. About 70 people watched this second audition\u2014this was most of the show's staff along with Lorne Michaels, Paul Simon, and Dan Aykroyd. Miller walked into a well-lit room and was told \"Go ahead, you have eight minutes, Dennis.\"<ref name=Roe/> After the New York audition he went to dinner with Michaels and Jack Nicholson. Miller felt that this was just another aspect of his audition, to see if he could handle himself around famous people, so he \"just sat there quietly\".<ref name=Roe/>\n\nMiller later recalled the conclusion of the meeting with Michaels: \"He looked at me and goes, 'Would you like to do my newscast?'. And I said, 'Yeah, I would', and he said, 'Well, I'll see you tomorrow'. And then I walked out. And I remember thinking, 'My life has just changed'.\"<ref name=Joke/> Miller had landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he succeeded [[Christopher Guest]] as the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic [[Jon Lovitz]], but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the ''Update'' segment to do costume changes, so Miller was drafted to read the news.<ref name=\"penn\">{{cite episode|title=Penn Jillette Radio Show.

That's the news, and I am outta here!\" Fans of ''SNL'' became accustomed to his snarky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair\u2014idiosyncrasies that would be spoofed by [[Dana Carvey]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Jimmy Fallon]], all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left ''SNL'' in 1991, the anchor's chair was turned over to [[Kevin Nealon]].\n\nIn 1988, Miller released a stand-up comedy CD, ''The Off-White Album'', derived from an [[HBO]] special titled ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0249466|Mr. Miller Goes to Washington Starring Dennis Miller (1988) }}</ref> which drew heavily from the [[Observational comedy|observational]] and [[metaphor]]-driven style he was known for on ''Saturday Night Live'', and showed glimpses of the political humor that would influence his later work. A well-received HBO special, ''Dennis Miller: Black and White'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0317340|Dennis Miller: Black and White, (1990)}}</ref> aired shortly after the release of the CD.\n\nAlthough Miller spent much of his time on ''SNL'' behind the ''Weekend Update'' desk, he was included in some sketches and did a few recurring characters and celebrity impersonations.<ref name=\"snl archives\">[http://snl.jt.org/cast.php?i=DeMi Dennis Miller], SNL Archives</ref>\n\n====Recurring characters====\n* Koko, one of the pixies in the recurring sketch \"Miss Connie's Fable Nook\"\n* Steve, one of The Stand-Ups (others include [[Jon Lovitz]] as Bob, [[Damon Wayans]] as Keith, and [[Tom Hanks]] as Paul)\n\n====Celebrity impersonations====\n* [[Gary Hart]]\n* [[George Harrison]]\n* [[Nathaniel Crosby]]\n\nIt was thought that he would renew his contract with NBC until at least 1993. It was believed that fans of Letterman would naturally be interested in Miller's show and prefer that over Leno's in that time slot.<ref name=Phil/>\n\n====Leaving SNL====\nMiller decided he was going to leave SNL after the 1990\u201391 season despite being happy with his role on the show and despite loving writing political gags for it, because he had turned 38 and his 18-month-old son Holden had made him want to strive for things to \"make the boy proud.\"<ref name=Allan/><ref name=Adams/> He told an interviewer, \"I had a great gig and this came up. It seemed like an opportunity that doesn't present itself too frequently in your life, so I opted to take it. ...I wanted to see what other talents I had, so I decided this was the shot.\"<ref name=Adams/> Miller thought that his outspokenness behind the SNL desk on political topics and even on jokes not working out made the transition to talk show host a good idea. He also felt that the SNL studio audience never fully accepted him in skits as other characters, making him question his acting ability.<ref name=Allan/>\n\nAfter it was announced that Miller would be starting his own show, he was a guest on ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', who offered him some advice while reflecting on his own 30-year career from which he was retiring in May 1992. He told Miller to compete only with himself, not to focus on the competition. Miller appreciated the advice, noting that \"there's no class for this\" and that he would have to learn on the job in front of an audience.<ref name=Allan/> In preparation, Miller sharpened his interviewing skills by practicing on the show's stage hands.

The number received around 150,000 calls and the charge for calling it made between $40-$50,000, which was donated to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Miller said he was touched by the outpouring and said he had only expected at most 20,000 calls.<ref name=Hastings/> Also during the final week, he took on a sharper edge that, to some reviewers, such as Phil Rosenthal, showed \"just how much unfulfilled promise the show held for the same viewers who love NBC's ''Late Night With David Letterman'' or even [[Comedy Central]]'s cult favorite ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]''.\" He jokingly looked into the camera and begged CBS Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky for a job; he had [[Julia Sweeney]] appear as her androgynous SNL character Pat and serenade him mimicking [[Bette Midler]]'s song for the retiring Johnny Carson. When a skit began to fail he moved the man with the cue-cards on camera.<ref name=Rosenthal/>\n\nMiller also openly complained that getting guests had become increasingly difficult after Leno took over from Carson.

Guests included fellow comedians and ''SNL'' alumni (such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]]), pundits and authors such as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Aaron Klein]] and [[Mark Steyn]] (while the show's guest list leaned [[right-wing|right of center]], there were several liberals who appeared on the show, such as [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]]), Presidential candidates, several sports commentators, and some \"regulars\" like columnists and conservatives [[Debra Saunders]], [[Charles Krauthammer]], [[Victor Davis Hanson]], [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], [[William Kristol|Bill Kristol]], and [[Jerome Corsi]] along with entertainers such as singer [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]] and actor [[Orson Bean]]. Miller generally took calls every hour, and in addition to comments about culture and politics, Miller encouraged humorous callers and often commented on their comedic delivery. A segment on Fridays was set aside for \"Dennis [[Deus Ex Machina|Ex Machina]]\", his term for a segment without a guest, where he allowed phone calls on any topic.\n\nIn a 2007 interview Miller said he felt that his radio show of all his work best represented his actual unvarnished views, saying \"This time, if I'm fired, they will be firing the real Dennis Miller.\"<ref name=IR>{{cite web|work=Illinois Review|date=July 31, 2007|title=After 30 Years, the Real Dennis Miller|url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2007/07/after-30-years-.html}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'', as of spring 2011, Miller's show had an estimated 2,250,000 weekly listeners.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences |year=2011 |work=[[Talkers Magazine]] |url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209101821/http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref> Miller and [[Dial Global]] signed an agreement in early 2012 to continue his show for three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbr.com/dennis-miller-re-ups-with-dial-global/|title=Dennis Miller re-ups with Dial-Global|work=Radio & Television Business Report|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> Miller ended the radio show after his contract expired on March 27, 2015.<ref name=radioinsight>[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92131/dennis-miller-to-end-syndicated-show/ \"Dennis Miller To End Syndicated Show\"] from Radio Insight (February 27, 2015)</ref>\n\n===Other endeavors===\nMiller periodically performs stand-up at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In recent appearances, he has done a mix of his old and new material, with some political jokes as well.\n\nHe has authored four books based on his stand-up comedy and television monologues: ''The Rants'' (1996), ''Ranting Again'' (1999), ''I Rant, Therefore I Am'' (2000), and ''The Rant Zone'' (2001).\n\nMiller has appeared in several films, in both comedic and non-comedic roles. His movie credits include ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|Madhouse]]'', ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''[[Never Talk to Strangers]]'', ''[[Bordello of Blood]]'', ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'' and ''[[Murder at 1600]]''. He played the [[Howard Stern]]-like talk-radio host Zander Kelly in ''[[Joe Dirt]]'' (2001) and appeared as himself in ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' (2006).\n\nMiller guest hosted the [[Slammy Award]]s episode of [[WWE Raw]] on December 14, 2009.\n\n==Comedic style==\nMiller has a laid-back style (for example, calling people \"babe\" or \"cat\") and an acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant, which typically begin with \"Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but...\" and end with \"...of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.\"\n\nMiller listed his comedic influences for ''The New York Times'' as including \"[[Jonathan Miller]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Richard Belzer]] and Mr. [Jay] Leno.\"<ref name=Joke/> When the ''Times'' asked him about the comedians [[Mort Sahl]] and [[Lenny Bruce]], to whom he is often compared, Miller stated that he had been impressed with transcripts of Sahl's early work but that as Sahl's career continued he became too tied to the [[Kennedy family]] and became a \"savage name-dropper,\" which diminished him in Miller's eyes, and served as an example for him to avoid. Miller had no respect for Bruce, telling the ''Times'', \"Lenny was a heroin addict, and I couldn't care less about heroin addicts. Once I hear a guy is a heroin addict, and they tell me he's a genius, I think, 'Really?' I'm not trying to be judgmental. But anybody whose last vision is of a tile pattern on a bathroom floor, I don't know what kind of genius they are.\"<ref name=Joke/>\n\nDescribing his career Miller stated, \"It's all been built on arcane references, precision of language, and a reasonably imperturbable nature on TV. The basics are there, but I've been getting paid, making a living and having fun with it for next to 25 years, and you know that blows my mind that I've stuck with it. That's my favorite part of showbiz, hangin' in, knowing that something good is coming along. ... When I was starting, I thought I'd have to have a sword-in-the-stone moment of inspiration where I'd have to lay around for it to be visited on me. ''SNL'' was just a machine, and if you screwed two or three 'Updates' up, guess what, they have someone new and ready to go. So I learned how to pick up any newspaper and have five usable jokes in five minutes. \"I don't ever wanna get self-important. I'm a comedian, and I want everyone in my life to know it. The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. I sit there, I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid.\"<ref name=Carl/>\n\nMiller has referred to his casual stage-style as \"quasi-[[Dean Martin]] insouciance.\"<ref name=SI/> When asked if he's accepted others' title of him as \"the 'intelligent' comedian,\" he replied, \"The smartest thing I ever did was not buying into the fact that people thought I was smart. I was telling jokes about where I named the robot maid for [[The Jetsons]]. It's just a joke. I just did jokes. I never had my head up my ass that I mattered. I\u2019m trying to get laughs. ... I'm OK [intelligence-wise]. I remember I had a writer once who told me\u2014and we disagreed about everything, so I know he didn't think I was smart\u2014but he said, 'I'll give you this. You have a deep drawer and a nice retrieval system.' I always thought that was a good appraisal of whatever limited comedy gift I had. I have a pretty good memory for pop arcana and a pretty quick retrieval system.\"<ref name=Tulsa/>\n\n==Personal life==\nMiller married Carolyn \"Ali\" Espley,<ref>Reliable sources spell her name variously as \"Espley\" or \"Epsley.\" In the closing credits of ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'', she is listed as \"Ali Espley\".</ref> a former model from [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, on April 24, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in [[Kajagoogoo]]'s 1983 \"[[Too Shy]]\" music video. The couple live in [[Santa Barbara, California]], and have two sons, Holden (born 1990) and Marlon (born 1993). His younger brother Jimmy Miller is a partner in the Hollywood management company Gold/Miller representing comedians such as [[Jim Carrey]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].<ref name=Joke/>\n\n==Political views==\nAlthough in his early years of fame he was perceived to be a staunch [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and an outspoken critic of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], in recent years, Miller has become known for his [[Conservatism in the United States|neoconservative]] political opinions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Currie, Duncan|date=June 27, 2003|title=Dennis the Right-Wing Menace? | work=National Review|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp|accessdate=February 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nHe was a regular political commentator on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' in a segment called \"Miller Time\", and previously appeared on the network's ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' in a segment called \"Real Free Speech.\"\n\n===Early outlook===\nWhen asked if his political outlook was a result of early influence by his parents, Miller told a reporter \"I didn't know my dad\u2014he moved out early. And my mom's politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn't think about [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. She thought about who made sense. I've been both in my life. Somebody can say they don't understand why somebody drifts. But I've always found people who drift interesting, 'cause it shows me the game's not stagnant in their own head. They're thinking.\"<ref name=Winters/>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, Miller was generally perceived as a cynic on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], eager to bash conservative Republicans.\n\nMiller has said that he privately began to change his politics in 1992 when liberals made jokes about the poor performance [[Ross Perot]]'s running mate [[James Stockdale]] displayed during a televised debate. Stockdale was a decorated Vietnam prisoner of war, and Miller saw jokes about him as mockery. Miller would later comment, \"You know, Stockdale, we would have been blessed to have him as a President. I don't care if he's bad on TV. He was a hero and an icon. I saw people on the left go, 'Who's this old guy who's bad on TV?'... If he's the problem, that's too hip a room for me. That's when I got out.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Richter|title=Dennis Miller: Liberal Mockery of Stockdale Made Me Conservative|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dennis-Miller-James-Stockdale-Ross-Perot-conservative/2014/06/04/id/575254/|website=[[Newsmax]]|publisher=[[Newsmax Media]]|location=Palm Beach, Florida|date=June 4, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that Miller was a member of the political left did not change much, even when Miller told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 1995: \"I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings.

Even before 9/11, I'd travel to New York and say, 'Wow, this city certainly seems to be running better. Giuliani is the kind of leader I admire.

I must say that I never considered myself a secular progressive. ... I didn't consider myself that then, and I don't consider myself to be [[Curtis LeMay]] now. I have always thought of myself as a pragmatist. And I began to see a degree of certitude on the left that I found unsettling. I don't like lockstep, even if it's lockstep about being open-minded. And after 9/11, I remember thinking we might have to get into some preemptive measures here. And that seemed to put me\u2014I don't know\u2014off to the kids' table.\" He said that his more open conservatism may have cost him some passing acquaintances, but it has not affected \"my dear friends.

If two gay guys want to get married, it's none of my business. I could care less. More power to them. I'm happy when people fall in love. But if some idiot foreign terrorist wants to blow up their wedding to make a political statement, I would rather kill him before he can do it, or have my country kill him before he can do it, instead of having him do it and punishing him after the fact. If that makes me a right-wing fanatic, I will bask in that assignation. ... I think abortion's wrong, but it's none of my business to tell somebody what's wrong. So I'm pro-choice. I want to keep my nose out of other people's personal business. I guess I fall into conservative when it comes to protecting the United States in a world where a lot of people hate the United States. ... [After 9/11] everybody should be in the protection business now. I can't imagine anybody not saying that. Well, I guess on the farthest end of the left they'd say, 'That's our fault.' And on the middle end they'd say, 'Well, there's another way to deal with it other than flat-out protecting ourselves.' I just don't believe that. People say we're the ones who make them hate us because of what we do. That's garbage to me. I think they're nuts.

'Dennis has never contacted us,' said George M.

In the fall of his senior year at the university, Miller began writing for the South Hills Record, mixing humor into his sports reporting.

Instead, he moved through several occupations, including a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and an ice cream scooper at the Village Dairy.<ref name=Finder/> Reflecting on his pre-comedy job history in a later discussion with [[Tom Snyder]], Miller recalled leaving college and attending a real estate seminar at a \"bad hotel,\" which consisted of a five-hour lecture without bathroom breaks. Near the end of the lecture, he was told that he would only be paid by commission, which made Miller say \"I'm in Hell, I don't even know what I am going to do for a living here. I'm a nut case.\" Miller then worked as a delivery man for what he describes as \"an all-gay florist.\" Leaving that job, he worked as an ice cream scooper. Miller recalled that he was twenty-one\u2014five years out of high school and wearing a paper hat while working alongside teens excited about getting their driver's licenses. A spur to quit the ice cream scooping job was when the prettiest girl he had attended high school with came in and he was the one who had to take her order, which filled him with embarrassment.<ref name=Tom>{{cite video|title=1995-Dennis Miller|publisher=The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWAyOAz2xkU|date=July 28, 1995}}</ref> Miller later stated that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs, his life would become a [[Franz Kafka]] novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.<ref name=Joke/>\n\nLeaving the ice cream parlor, Miller joined the staff at Point Park's Recreation Room, where he was in charge of the bowling alley, video games, and running the air-hockey league.<ref name=Finder/> Air-hockey regulars nicknamed him \"Clarence\" after NHL Commissioner [[Clarence Campbell]], or called him \"Commish.\" When Miller's brother Jimmy was around, they referred to him as \"Commush\".<ref name=Finder/> A patron from that time recalled that Miller sat on pool tables telling jokes and honing his comedy to those in the rec room, which was the only place the commuters gathered. Miller and the other patrons closely followed the NFL at the time as it was the \"[[Pittsburgh Steelers#The Chuck Noll era|era of the Super Steelers]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\n===Stand-up===\nIn 1979 after seeing a [[Robin Williams]] comedy special on HBO, Miller decided that he had to pursue his dream of being a stand-up comedian.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Miller began pursuing a comedy career by performing at open-mic nights. He backed out of his first two attempts to perform at an open mic due to stage fright and anger with himself over the question of whether the drive to perform was a need for approval from others.<ref name=Duncan>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 11, 1989|author=Duncan Strauss|title=He's Brainy, Funny--and Frightened?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-11/entertainment/ca-3378_1_stand-up-fresh-air-real-life}}</ref> When he finally made his d\u00e9but at the Oak's Lounge on Sleepy Hollow Road in Castle Shannon, most of Miller's family was in the audience to cheer him on.<ref name=Julina>{{cite news|title=Comic Killing' Em With Gags|author=Mike Julina|date=February 23, 1980|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=12|url=\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/newspage/88936157/}}</ref>\n\nIn a later interview, Miller spoke of the stage presence he developed for his stand-up act to address his fears. (He emphasized that the comedy business will always be frightening as any error could spiral into the end of a career.) To compensate for his early fears, Miller said, \"I got up there and acted like the guy I always wanted to be to get through it. ...It's a part of me, but it's not the real me.\" He would keep his hands in his pockets to appear unfazed, or adjust his cuffs during an audience laugh to give the appearance of indifference to approval. Miller pointed out that part of his act is to show a \"hipper-than-thou\" persona, but then purposely undermine it at regular intervals for comedic effect.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nHe began appearing onstage at the Oak's Lounge in Castle Shannon while working at the Giant Eagle deli in [[Kennedy Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Kennedy]].<ref name=Finder/> Miller lived without a car and without much money in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh]], hitching rides or taking buses.<ref name=Finder/> He continued to do stand-ups in Oakland and at places like Brandy's in the Strip District and the Portfolio on Craig Street, eventually saving up $1,000 which he used to try to fast-track his comedy career by moving to New York City.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Julina/> Arriving there, Miller had to bribe a landlord $200 to give him a room, then had to pay the security deposit of $250 and the first month's rent of $250, resulting in his having spent $700 of his $1,000 savings the first day for a sparse, bunker-like room.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York he submitted a joke for a ''Playboy'' magazine contest for humor writing that was judged by an all-star panel including [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[David Brenner]], [[Martin Mull]], [[Art Buchwald]], and [[Buck Henry]].<ref name=Julina/> Of around 15,000 entries, Miller tied for second and his joke and picture appeared in the June 1979 issue of the magazine.<ref name=Duncan/><ref name=Julina/> Miller won $500 in ''Playboy''{{'}}s first annual humor competition with the following joke:\n{{quote|The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyone's problems, and in group sex you see them.|Dennis Miller|''Playboy'', June 1979<ref>{{cite news|date=June 1979|title=Funny Money|magazine=Playboy|volume=26|number=6|issn=0032-1478}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the first year and a half of his comedy career, Miller had heavily relied on props during his act, but he felt this limited him and switched to using purely language.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nMiller gained more exposure when he tried out for the New York Laff-Off Contest. The contest had 40 slots but 32 of them had already been filled by the top regulars who appeared at the three comedy venues sponsoring the competition. 350 people tried out for the remaining eight slots, some of whom had appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', or ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. Many of the comedians Miller was up against had hours of crafted material, while he had fine-tuned around ten minutes. To his surprise and delight, Miller earned one of the remaining slots. For the competition itself he appeared at the Improv and received a standing ovation, moving him onto the finals. While he did not win the Laff-Off, he was seen by dozens of talent agents, resulting in bookings at colleges and other clubs.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile he was working in New York City, ''[[Hustler Magazine]]'' listed Miller in a piece called \"The 10 Funniest People in America You'll Never See on TV\".<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York City, Miller supported himself by working rather mundane jobs during the day, such as bartender and payroll clerk, and by night made the rounds of New York clubs The Comic Strip, The Improvisation, and Catch a Rising Star.<ref name=Julina/> After about a year, unable to make a go of it, he returned to Pittsburgh.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\n==Television==\nHaving honed his stand-up comedy act, Miller was able to transition to television, increasing his audience base.\n\n===KDKA-TV===\nHaving gone through the comedy-club circuit, Miller returned to do his sight-gag routine back in Pittsburgh at Brandy's in August 1980. It was there that local television station [[KDKA-TV]] was shooting a piece for its ''Evening Magazine'' and offered him a job at the station. By the end of 1980 Miller acted as a warm-up in the afternoons for KDKA's ''Pittsburgh 2Day''. He then began starring in humorous segments for the syndicated ''[[Evening Magazine]]''. By 1983 he had become the host of ''Punchline,'' a Saturday-morning [[newsmagazine]] aimed at teenagers. In one episode he interviewed fellow comedian [[Pat Paulsen]]. Miller later reflected on this time, saying that \"you have to start somewhere,\" and that he was \"just pleased to be in front of a camera.\"<ref name=Finder/><ref>{{cite web|author=The Comedy Zone Humor Network |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |title=Dennis Miller : Comedian Profile |publisher=Comedy-zone.net |accessdate=2010-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030529/http://comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this time Miller also performed stand-up in New York City comedy clubs such as [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch A Rising Star]] and The Comic Strip. While in New York, Miller saw a show by [[Richard Belzer]] and noted how he barked at the crowd rather than embraced it, was cutting rather than cute. Miller adopted this comedic philosophy.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nDuring performances at comedy clubs in Pittsburgh, Miller befriended [[Jay Leno]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. In 1984 Leno found Miller an apartment in Los Angeles and he and Seinfeld arranged a d\u00e9but for Miller at [[The Improv]].<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Joke/> Miller resigned from KDKA and moved to Los Angeles to try to further his comedy career.\n\nMiller's brothers Rich and Jimmy joined him in Los Angeles, taking up varied jobs around The Improv such as booking shows, acting as bouncer, and selling tickets. Jimmy would go on to become a power talent agent with Gold Miller, and Rich would run RCM Entertainment, booking comedians across the country.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Los Angeles, Leno was a big influence on Miller as he was to many upcoming comedians in the area at the time. Young comedians would gather at Leno's home late at night and he would offer critiques with humorous, biting wit. Leno would also tape television appearances of his group and show them during such sessions while offering more humorous critiques. Miller would later fondly recall the time, saying it was like \"sitting at his knee, querying [[Yoda]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\nMiller appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'', where he lost out to fellow comedian [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]] after the two tied on judges' scores; Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating. Miller made his first appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on June 24, 1985 (other guests were [[Phil Collins]] and [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]]).<ref name=Joke/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=epguides.com|url=http://epguides.com/LateNightwithDavidLetterman/|title=Late Night with David Letterman (a Guest Stars & Air Dates Guide)}}</ref>\n\n===''Saturday Night Live''===\nMiller's big break came in 1985 when he was discovered by [[Lorne Michaels]] at [[The Comedy Store]]. Michaels had him come in for an audition. Miller did an audition in L.A. for SNL and that went well enough for him to be brought to New York for a second audition in a room in Times Square. About 70 people watched this second audition\u2014this was most of the show's staff along with Lorne Michaels, Paul Simon, and Dan Aykroyd. Miller walked into a well-lit room and was told \"Go ahead, you have eight minutes, Dennis.\"<ref name=Roe/> After the New York audition he went to dinner with Michaels and Jack Nicholson. Miller felt that this was just another aspect of his audition, to see if he could handle himself around famous people, so he \"just sat there quietly\".<ref name=Roe/>\n\nMiller later recalled the conclusion of the meeting with Michaels: \"He looked at me and goes, 'Would you like to do my newscast?'. And I said, 'Yeah, I would', and he said, 'Well, I'll see you tomorrow'. And then I walked out. And I remember thinking, 'My life has just changed'.\"<ref name=Joke/> Miller had landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he succeeded [[Christopher Guest]] as the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic [[Jon Lovitz]], but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the ''Update'' segment to do costume changes, so Miller was drafted to read the news.<ref name=\"penn\">{{cite episode|title=Penn Jillette Radio Show.

That's the news, and I am outta here!\" Fans of ''SNL'' became accustomed to his snarky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair\u2014idiosyncrasies that would be spoofed by [[Dana Carvey]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Jimmy Fallon]], all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left ''SNL'' in 1991, the anchor's chair was turned over to [[Kevin Nealon]].\n\nIn 1988, Miller released a stand-up comedy CD, ''The Off-White Album'', derived from an [[HBO]] special titled ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0249466|Mr. Miller Goes to Washington Starring Dennis Miller (1988) }}</ref> which drew heavily from the [[Observational comedy|observational]] and [[metaphor]]-driven style he was known for on ''Saturday Night Live'', and showed glimpses of the political humor that would influence his later work. A well-received HBO special, ''Dennis Miller: Black and White'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0317340|Dennis Miller: Black and White, (1990)}}</ref> aired shortly after the release of the CD.\n\nAlthough Miller spent much of his time on ''SNL'' behind the ''Weekend Update'' desk, he was included in some sketches and did a few recurring characters and celebrity impersonations.<ref name=\"snl archives\">[http://snl.jt.org/cast.php?i=DeMi Dennis Miller], SNL Archives</ref>\n\n====Recurring characters====\n* Koko, one of the pixies in the recurring sketch \"Miss Connie's Fable Nook\"\n* Steve, one of The Stand-Ups (others include [[Jon Lovitz]] as Bob, [[Damon Wayans]] as Keith, and [[Tom Hanks]] as Paul)\n\n====Celebrity impersonations====\n* [[Gary Hart]]\n* [[George Harrison]]\n* [[Nathaniel Crosby]]\n\nIt was thought that he would renew his contract with NBC until at least 1993. It was believed that fans of Letterman would naturally be interested in Miller's show and prefer that over Leno's in that time slot.<ref name=Phil/>\n\n====Leaving SNL====\nMiller decided he was going to leave SNL after the 1990\u201391 season despite being happy with his role on the show and despite loving writing political gags for it, because he had turned 38 and his 18-month-old son Holden had made him want to strive for things to \"make the boy proud.\"<ref name=Allan/><ref name=Adams/> He told an interviewer, \"I had a great gig and this came up. It seemed like an opportunity that doesn't present itself too frequently in your life, so I opted to take it. ...I wanted to see what other talents I had, so I decided this was the shot.\"<ref name=Adams/> Miller thought that his outspokenness behind the SNL desk on political topics and even on jokes not working out made the transition to talk show host a good idea. He also felt that the SNL studio audience never fully accepted him in skits as other characters, making him question his acting ability.<ref name=Allan/>\n\nAfter it was announced that Miller would be starting his own show, he was a guest on ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', who offered him some advice while reflecting on his own 30-year career from which he was retiring in May 1992. He told Miller to compete only with himself, not to focus on the competition. Miller appreciated the advice, noting that \"there's no class for this\" and that he would have to learn on the job in front of an audience.<ref name=Allan/> In preparation, Miller sharpened his interviewing skills by practicing on the show's stage hands. He felt that the secret to interviewing well was listening to the guest rather than trying to set up jokes while the guest is talking.<ref name=Allan/>\n\nAs the date for the show's opening approached, Miller told an interviewer that he was both thrilled and \"scared shitless\" by the opportunity. He hoped to eventually be able to relax enough to be entirely himself. He saw Johnny Carson's approach as the standard but hoped not to be too influenced by anyone.<ref name=Adams/> Between SNL and his new show, Miller did stand-up dates with [[Howie Mandel]] and then with [[Steven Wright]].<ref name=Adams/>\n\n===''The Dennis Miller Show''===\nIn 1992, after leaving SNL, Miller hosted an eponymous late-night talk show in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] that lasted seven months.\n\n====Late-night landscape====\n''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' was launched in 1989, and after Tribune Entertainment saw how that show brought in new and younger viewers to late night, they wanted to make their own show in an attempt to match its success.<ref name=Phil>{{cite news|title=Talk With A 'tude|date=January 20, 1992|author=Phil Rosenthal|work=Los Angeles Daily News|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-01-20/lifestyle/9201181129_1_dennis-miller-miller-show-miller-brings}}</ref> In 1990 Tribune Entertainment pursued [[Garry Shandling]] to create a syndicated late-night talk show, reaching out to him through the talent agency that represented him [[Brillstein Entertainment Partners|Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]].

''The Dennis Miller Show'' continued in the tradition of \"[[Alternative culture|alternative]]\" talk shows, starting with the ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' show, which debuted on [[NBC]] in 1982. [[Nick Bakay]] was the announcer, and [[Andy Summers]], formerly of the band [[The Police]], led the house band.\n\nGuests included [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] (with [[Leslie West]] and [[Corky Laing]]), [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] (who made their national television debut on the show), [[Henry Rollins]] (who appeared repeatedly to chat with Miller and perform [[spoken word]]), [[Primus (band)|Primus]] (who while performing \"[[Tommy the Cat]]\", had to deal with a member of the audience who jumped onstage\u2014whom Miller playfully tried to \"tackle\"), [[King's X]] (who performed two songs, \"[[Black Flag (song)|Black Flag]]\" and \"[[It's Love]]\" to empty seats in the studio due to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]), and comedian [[Bill Hicks]].\n\nThe show remained faithful to the classic talk-show format with a desk and three or four guests a night, while Miller carried forward the spirit of his SNL ''Weekend Update'' with a newscast segment that aired on Fridays.<ref name=Adams/><ref name=Allan/>\n\nThe show's staff boasted a mix of past and future performers, writers, and producers of note including [[Mark Brazill]] (''[[That '70s Show]]''), Eddie Feldmann, [[David Kohan]] and [[Max Mutchnick]] (creators of ''[[Will & Grace]]''), [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Bob Odenkirk]] (''[[Mr. Show]]''), [[John Riggi]], [[Kevin Rooney]], [[Herb Sargent]] (''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), [[Drake Sather]], and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (''[[Second City TV]]'').\n\nMiller thought there would be room for his show as its main competitors for the time slot would be ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' and ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and he felt they all attracted different audiences.<ref name=Allan/> At the time [[Arsenio Hall]] was not worried about Jay Leno's hold on late night, but told the Los Angeles Times, \"Dennis Miller is the only one who scares me, because I have tremendous respect for him and think he's one of the brightest comics on the scene.\"<ref name=Phil/><ref>{{cite news|title=The Arsenio Way : No Carson Copycat, Hall Woofs Up His Audience By Making His Own Rules|date=January 5, 1992|author=Dabuek Cerone|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-05/news/tv-2136_1_arsenio-hall}}</ref>\n\nThe show opened to mixed reviews, with some being \"blisteringly negative\", but Tribune remained optimistic, saying that a 2 rating nationally would be acceptable due to the late hour of the show and pointed out that in some places Miller was doing better than Hall.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reporter's Notebook|author=Bill Carter|date=February 4, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/04/arts/reporter-s-notebook-rather-pulls-cbs-news-back-to-the-assassination.html|work=New York Times}}</ref> As the show progressed, national ratings were still behind Hall (whose show was also syndicated).

The number received around 150,000 calls and the charge for calling it made between $40-$50,000, which was donated to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Miller said he was touched by the outpouring and said he had only expected at most 20,000 calls.<ref name=Hastings/> Also during the final week, he took on a sharper edge that, to some reviewers, such as Phil Rosenthal, showed \"just how much unfulfilled promise the show held for the same viewers who love NBC's ''Late Night With David Letterman'' or even [[Comedy Central]]'s cult favorite ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]''.\" He jokingly looked into the camera and begged CBS Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky for a job; he had [[Julia Sweeney]] appear as her androgynous SNL character Pat and serenade him mimicking [[Bette Midler]]'s song for the retiring Johnny Carson.

The show's theme song was the [[Tears for Fears]] hit \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]\", and included a snippet of the song \"Civilized\" by the [[Rollins Band]].\nThe show was taped at [[CBS Television City]] on the same stage where ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' is taped. It utilized a small set and sparse lighting, and there was no band. It comprised mainly Miller, speaking to the largely-unseen studio audience, on a darkened stage.\n\nMiller hosted one guest per show, with whom he would discuss the topic of the day. Early on, guests were all interviewed live via satellite, but soon most appeared live in the studio. There was also a call-in segment. The number was originally given as 1-800-LACTOSE. Later, he referred to it only by its numeric equivalent (1-800-522-8673). Within the time available, Miller typically could accommodate only two or three calls. He gradually eliminated call-ins in the last few seasons of the show.\n\nMiller and his writing staff won five [[Emmy Award]]s during the show's run, which aired 215 episodes over nine years.

By the close of the 1999 season, they were looking to make the fourth change in as many years.<ref name=SI/> By the end of the 1999 NFL season, ''Monday Night Football'' had its ratings decline for the fifth season in a row. In an effort to turn things around, ABC fired [[Boomer Esiason]] who had been on the show for two years.

He had grown up watching the 1970s championship Steelers and was an avid watcher of the NFL draft. He had even inquired about an announcing job with Fox after they had acquired rights to show [[Fox NFL|NFL games in 1994]].<ref name=SI/> Michaels later told an interviewer, \"It was way beyond what we expected. I had no idea that he knew as much about football as he did. He made points that other analysts we brought in never made, and his points were more salient, more interesting, and better stated. He was giving his riff, analyzing the plays and providing the humor. Amazing would not be an overstatement. Then I thought, Maybe he's shooting his wad here, and that's all we're going to get. But he kept going. Hell, it was almost perfect. Don and I looked at each other and said, 'Wow. Where did this come from?'.\"<ref name=SI/>\n\nABC told Sports Illustrated about the three-month process Ohlmeyer went through, including going through hundreds of tapes, slimming down to 40 candidates, and conducting 20 auditions (which included Jimmy Johnson, Bill Parcells, Steve Young, and John Elway).<ref name=SI/> ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that ESPN's [[Sterling Sharpe]] appeared to have been ABC's first choice but he had refused to return phone calls to ABC.<ref name=Edge/> Ohlmeyer had considered Miller early in the process, more as offering a rant segment within the broadcast, but he began to think of him in an expanded role.<ref name=SI/>\n\nBy late June 2000, it was announced that Miller had beaten out [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Tony Kornheiser]] (among others) for a job as [[color commentator]] on ABC's ''Monday Night Football''.<ref name=eonline>{{cite web |last=Armstrong |first=Mark |url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html |title=Dennis Miller Takes 'Monday Night' Pigskin|publisher=[[E!]]|date=June 22, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030221060805/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html|archivedate=February 21, 2003}}</ref><ref name=Edge/> The L.A.

Guests included fellow comedians and ''SNL'' alumni (such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]]), pundits and authors such as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Aaron Klein]] and [[Mark Steyn]] (while the show's guest list leaned [[right-wing|right of center]], there were several liberals who appeared on the show, such as [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]]), Presidential candidates, several sports commentators, and some \"regulars\" like columnists and conservatives [[Debra Saunders]], [[Charles Krauthammer]], [[Victor Davis Hanson]], [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], [[William Kristol|Bill Kristol]], and [[Jerome Corsi]] along with entertainers such as singer [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]] and actor [[Orson Bean]]. Miller generally took calls every hour, and in addition to comments about culture and politics, Miller encouraged humorous callers and often commented on their comedic delivery. A segment on Fridays was set aside for \"Dennis [[Deus Ex Machina|Ex Machina]]\", his term for a segment without a guest, where he allowed phone calls on any topic.\n\nIn a 2007 interview Miller said he felt that his radio show of all his work best represented his actual unvarnished views, saying \"This time, if I'm fired, they will be firing the real Dennis Miller.\"<ref name=IR>{{cite web|work=Illinois Review|date=July 31, 2007|title=After 30 Years, the Real Dennis Miller|url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2007/07/after-30-years-.html}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'', as of spring 2011, Miller's show had an estimated 2,250,000 weekly listeners.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences |year=2011 |work=[[Talkers Magazine]] |url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209101821/http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref> Miller and [[Dial Global]] signed an agreement in early 2012 to continue his show for three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbr.com/dennis-miller-re-ups-with-dial-global/|title=Dennis Miller re-ups with Dial-Global|work=Radio & Television Business Report|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> Miller ended the radio show after his contract expired on March 27, 2015.<ref name=radioinsight>[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92131/dennis-miller-to-end-syndicated-show/ \"Dennis Miller To End Syndicated Show\"] from Radio Insight (February 27, 2015)</ref>\n\n===Other endeavors===\nMiller periodically performs stand-up at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In recent appearances, he has done a mix of his old and new material, with some political jokes as well.\n\nHe has authored four books based on his stand-up comedy and television monologues: ''The Rants'' (1996), ''Ranting Again'' (1999), ''I Rant, Therefore I Am'' (2000), and ''The Rant Zone'' (2001).\n\nMiller has appeared in several films, in both comedic and non-comedic roles. His movie credits include ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|Madhouse]]'', ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''[[Never Talk to Strangers]]'', ''[[Bordello of Blood]]'', ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'' and ''[[Murder at 1600]]''. He played the [[Howard Stern]]-like talk-radio host Zander Kelly in ''[[Joe Dirt]]'' (2001) and appeared as himself in ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' (2006).\n\nMiller guest hosted the [[Slammy Award]]s episode of [[WWE Raw]] on December 14, 2009.\n\n==Comedic style==\nMiller has a laid-back style (for example, calling people \"babe\" or \"cat\") and an acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant, which typically begin with \"Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but...\" and end with \"...of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.\"\n\nMiller listed his comedic influences for ''The New York Times'' as including \"[[Jonathan Miller]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Richard Belzer]] and Mr. [Jay] Leno.\"<ref name=Joke/> When the ''Times'' asked him about the comedians [[Mort Sahl]] and [[Lenny Bruce]], to whom he is often compared, Miller stated that he had been impressed with transcripts of Sahl's early work but that as Sahl's career continued he became too tied to the [[Kennedy family]] and became a \"savage name-dropper,\" which diminished him in Miller's eyes, and served as an example for him to avoid. Miller had no respect for Bruce, telling the ''Times'', \"Lenny was a heroin addict, and I couldn't care less about heroin addicts. Once I hear a guy is a heroin addict, and they tell me he's a genius, I think, 'Really?' I'm not trying to be judgmental. But anybody whose last vision is of a tile pattern on a bathroom floor, I don't know what kind of genius they are.\"<ref name=Joke/>\n\nDescribing his career Miller stated, \"It's all been built on arcane references, precision of language, and a reasonably imperturbable nature on TV. The basics are there, but I've been getting paid, making a living and having fun with it for next to 25 years, and you know that blows my mind that I've stuck with it. That's my favorite part of showbiz, hangin' in, knowing that something good is coming along. ... When I was starting, I thought I'd have to have a sword-in-the-stone moment of inspiration where I'd have to lay around for it to be visited on me. ''SNL'' was just a machine, and if you screwed two or three 'Updates' up, guess what, they have someone new and ready to go. So I learned how to pick up any newspaper and have five usable jokes in five minutes. \"I don't ever wanna get self-important. I'm a comedian, and I want everyone in my life to know it. The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. I sit there, I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid.\"<ref name=Carl/>\n\nMiller has referred to his casual stage-style as \"quasi-[[Dean Martin]] insouciance.\"<ref name=SI/> When asked if he's accepted others' title of him as \"the 'intelligent' comedian,\" he replied, \"The smartest thing I ever did was not buying into the fact that people thought I was smart. I was telling jokes about where I named the robot maid for [[The Jetsons]]. It's just a joke. I just did jokes. I never had my head up my ass that I mattered. I\u2019m trying to get laughs. ... I'm OK [intelligence-wise]. I remember I had a writer once who told me\u2014and we disagreed about everything, so I know he didn't think I was smart\u2014but he said, 'I'll give you this. You have a deep drawer and a nice retrieval system.' I always thought that was a good appraisal of whatever limited comedy gift I had. I have a pretty good memory for pop arcana and a pretty quick retrieval system.\"<ref name=Tulsa/>\n\n==Personal life==\nMiller married Carolyn \"Ali\" Espley,<ref>Reliable sources spell her name variously as \"Espley\" or \"Epsley.\" In the closing credits of ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'', she is listed as \"Ali Espley\".</ref> a former model from [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, on April 24, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in [[Kajagoogoo]]'s 1983 \"[[Too Shy]]\" music video. The couple live in [[Santa Barbara, California]], and have two sons, Holden (born 1990) and Marlon (born 1993). His younger brother Jimmy Miller is a partner in the Hollywood management company Gold/Miller representing comedians such as [[Jim Carrey]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].<ref name=Joke/>\n\n==Political views==\nAlthough in his early years of fame he was perceived to be a staunch [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and an outspoken critic of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], in recent years, Miller has become known for his [[Conservatism in the United States|neoconservative]] political opinions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Currie, Duncan|date=June 27, 2003|title=Dennis the Right-Wing Menace? | work=National Review|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp|accessdate=February 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nHe was a regular political commentator on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' in a segment called \"Miller Time\", and previously appeared on the network's ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' in a segment called \"Real Free Speech.\"\n\n===Early outlook===\nWhen asked if his political outlook was a result of early influence by his parents, Miller told a reporter \"I didn't know my dad\u2014he moved out early. And my mom's politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn't think about [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. She thought about who made sense. I've been both in my life. Somebody can say they don't understand why somebody drifts. But I've always found people who drift interesting, 'cause it shows me the game's not stagnant in their own head. They're thinking.\"<ref name=Winters/>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, Miller was generally perceived as a cynic on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], eager to bash conservative Republicans.\n\nMiller has said that he privately began to change his politics in 1992 when liberals made jokes about the poor performance [[Ross Perot]]'s running mate [[James Stockdale]] displayed during a televised debate. Stockdale was a decorated Vietnam prisoner of war, and Miller saw jokes about him as mockery. Miller would later comment, \"You know, Stockdale, we would have been blessed to have him as a President. I don't care if he's bad on TV. He was a hero and an icon. I saw people on the left go, 'Who's this old guy who's bad on TV?'... If he's the problem, that's too hip a room for me. That's when I got out.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Richter|title=Dennis Miller: Liberal Mockery of Stockdale Made Me Conservative|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dennis-Miller-James-Stockdale-Ross-Perot-conservative/2014/06/04/id/575254/|website=[[Newsmax]]|publisher=[[Newsmax Media]]|location=Palm Beach, Florida|date=June 4, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that Miller was a member of the political left did not change much, even when Miller told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 1995: \"I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings.

I have always thought of myself as a pragmatist. And I began to see a degree of certitude on the left that I found unsettling. I don't like lockstep, even if it's lockstep about being open-minded. And after 9/11, I remember thinking we might have to get into some preemptive measures here.

If two gay guys want to get married, it's none of my business. I could care less. More power to them. I'm happy when people fall in love. But if some idiot foreign terrorist wants to blow up their wedding to make a political statement, I would rather kill him before he can do it, or have my country kill him before he can do it, instead of having him do it and punishing him after the fact. If that makes me a right-wing fanatic, I will bask in that assignation. ... I think abortion's wrong, but it's none of my business to tell somebody what's wrong. So I'm pro-choice. I want to keep my nose out of other people's personal business. I guess I fall into conservative when it comes to protecting the United States in a world where a lot of people hate the United States. ... [After 9/11] everybody should be in the protection business now. I can't imagine anybody not saying that. Well, I guess on the farthest end of the left they'd say, 'That's our fault.' And on the middle end they'd say, 'Well, there's another way to deal with it other than flat-out protecting ourselves.' I just don't believe that. People say we're the ones who make them hate us because of what we do. That's garbage to me. I think they're nuts.

I'm for gay marriage. I don't believe in abortion but I'm pro-choice 'cause it's none of my business.

I don't think about any of that. I go on ''O\u2019Reilly'' once a week, I do my radio show and I go on the road about 20 dates a year. I've winnowed my crowd down to a select few who can support me.

In 2003 Miller told an interviewer that he was impressed by Bush for pursuing \"the liquidation of terrorism,\" even though \"that's not gonna be finished in his lifetime... But to take the first step? Ballsy.\"<ref name=Winters/> He felt it was likely that \"the secular state of Iraq and Islamic fundamentalists cohabitate,\" as \"they both think we're Satan.\"<ref name=Winters/> He concluded with, \"I will say this, I feel more politically engaged than I've ever felt in my life because I do think we live in dangerous times, and anybody who looks at the world and says this is the time to be a wuss\u2014I can't buy that anymore.\"<ref name=Winters/> Miller showed his commitment to Bush by speaking at the President's fund-raisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco.<ref name=Eyeing/><ref name=Collins/> During this time, he jokingly referred to himself as \"a [[Rat Pack]] of one for the president in Hollywood.\"<ref name=Krassner/>''The Los Angeles Times'' noted that he was \"raising his political profile\" at this time, and that he \"spoke out passionately in favor of the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]]. He has made frequent appearances on conservative talk radio; he does weekly political commentary for ''Hannity & Colmes'', a Fox News Channel talk show.\"<ref name=Eyeing/>\n\nIn 2003, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' called Miller \"the loudest pro-Bush/pro-war voice in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]\",<ref name=WS/> and quoted his comment on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' from February of that year. Miller advocated invading Iraq, and vented his displeasure at France's lack of support for the idea, saying, \"I say we invade Iraq and then invade [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac]]. You run a pipe\u2014you run a pipe from the oil field right over this [[Eiffel Tower]], shoot it up and have the world's biggest oil derrick. ... Listen, I would call the French scum bags, but that, of course, would be a disservice to bags filled with scum.\"<ref name=WS/> That same year, ''[[The National Review]]'' wrote, \"Conservatives ... have welcomed and even cheered the comedian's unabashed patriotism and endorsement of President Bush's foreign\u2014and, in certain cases, domestic\u2014policy.\"<ref name=Currie/> They noted that \"During appearances on ''The Tonight Show'', he has also advocated profiling at airports and oil-drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\"<ref name=Currie>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/207356/dennis-right-wing-menace-duncan-currie|title=Comedian Miller gets a FNC gig|author=Duncan Currie|date=June 27, 2003|work=National Review}}</ref>\n\nOn March 23, 2003 [[Michael Moore]] delivered an antiwar speech at the Academy Awards while accepting an Oscar for ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]''.

The [[United States Army Services of Supply|Services of Supply]] (SOS) was formed in May 1942 under the command of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[John C. H. Lee]] to provide logistical support. From February 1944 on, SOS was increasingly referred to as the Communications Zone (COMZ). Between May 1942 and May 1944, [[Operation Bolero]], the buildup of American troops and supplies in the UK, proceeded fitfully, and by June 1944 1,526,965 US troops were in the UK, of whom 459,511 were part of the COMZ.   \n\nThe [[First United States Army]] was supported over the [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]] and [[Utah Beach]]es, and through the [[Operation Mulberry|Mulberry artificial port]] specially constructed for the purpose, but the American Mulberry was abandoned after it was damaged by a storm on 19 June. During the first seven weeks after D-Day, the advance was much slower than the Operation Overlord plan had anticipated, and the [[lodgement|lodgment]] area much smaller. The nature of the fighting in the Normandy hedgerows created shortages of certain items, particularly artillery and mortar ammunition, and there was unexpectedly high rates of loss of [[bazooka]]s, [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifles]] (BARs), and [[M7 grenade launcher]]s.\n\nOn 25 July, the [[First United States Army|US First Army]] began [[Operation Cobra]], the break-out from Normandy. The advance was much faster than expected and the rapid increase in the length of the [[line of communications]] threw up unanticipated logistical challenges. The logistical plan lacked the flexibility needed to cope with the rapidly changing operational situation, and the rehabilitation of railways and construction of pipelines could not keep up with the pace of the advance. Major shortages developed, particularly of petrol, oil and lubricants (POL). Motor transport was used as a stopgap, and the Advance Section ([[ADSEC]]) organized the [[Red Ball Express]], which delivered supplies from the Normandy lodgment area, but at great cost in wear and tear, and accidental damage.   \n\nSenior commanders subordinated logistical imperatives to operational opportunities. The decision to abandon plans to develop the ports of Brittany left the American forces with only the port of Cherbourg and the Normandy beaches for their maintenance; that to continue the pursuit beyond the [[Seine]] had long-term and far-reaching effects. The attrition of equipment, failure to establish a proper supply depot system, neglect of the development of ports, inadequate stockpiles in forward areas, the shortage of POL, and increased German resistance stalled the American advance. The difficulties were exacerbated by the poor supply discipline of the American soldier. While the logistical system had facilitated a great victory, these factors would be keenly felt.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Headquarters, ETO, at 20 Grosvenor Square, London.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters, ETO, at 20 Grosvenor Square, London]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the United States had developed and periodically updated [[War Plan Black]] for the possibility of a war with Germany. Planning began in earnest at the [[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1 Conference]] in [[Washington, DC]], in January to March 1941, where agreement was reached with the UK and Canada on a [[Europe first]] strategy in the event of the US being forced into a war with both Germany and Japan.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=1}} A US military mission to the UK called the Special Observer Group (SPOBS) was formed under the command of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[James E. Chaney]], a [[United States Army Air Corps]] officer who had been stationed in the UK since October 1940 to observe air operations. Chaney opened SPOBS headquarters at the [[Embassy of the United States, London|US Embassy]] at [[1 Grosvenor Square]], London, on 19 May 1941, and moved it across the street to 20 [[Grosvenor Square]] two days later. Henceforth, Grosvenor Square would be the hub of American activity in the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nIn the wake of the American entry into [[World War II]] in December 1941, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] activated the [[United States Army Forces in the British Isles]] (USAFBI) under Chaney's command on 8 January 1942.{{sfn|Pogue|1954|p=99}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=21\u201322}} Under the ABC-1 and [[Rainbow 5]] war plans, the United States would participate in the defense of the UK,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=32\u201333}} but the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[George C. Marshall]] had a larger role in mind. In April 1942, Marshall and [[Harry L. Hopkins]], the advisor to the [[President of the United States|president]], visited the UK, and obtained the approval of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] for [[Operation Bolero]], the buildup of US forces in the UK with the aim of eventually mounting a cross-channel attack. With this prospect in mind, Chaney asked the War Department for personnel to form a Services of Supply (SOS) command.{{sfn|Osmanski|1949a|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Regional Organization of SOS in the United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|left|Regional Organization of SOS in the United Kingdom]]\nChaney's proposed SOS organizational structure did not meet with the approval of the War Department. On 9 March 1942, Marshall had conducted a sweeping reorganization that had consolidated logistical functions in the US under the [[United States Army Services of Supply]] (USASOS), headed by Major General [[Brehon B. Somervell]]. Chaos had resulted during [[World War I]] because the organization of the SOS in France was different from that of the War Department, and an important lesson of that war was the need for the theater SOS organization to parallel that in the United States.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=4}} Marshall and Somervell wanted it led by someone familiar with the new organization, and selected Major General [[John C. H. Lee]]. Each branch head in Somervell's headquarters was asked to nominate its best two men, one of whom was selected by Somervell and Lee for Lee's SOS headquarters, while the other remained in Washington. Lee held the first meeting of his new staff on 16 May, before departing for the UK on 23 May, and Chaney formally activated SOS the following day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=33\u201337}}\n\nOn 8 June 1942, the War Department upgraded USAFBI to the status of a [[theater of war]], becoming the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army]] (ETOUSA). Chaney was recalled to the US, and replaced by the chief of the Operations Division at the War Department, Major General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=4}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=42\u201343}} Accommodation for the SOS headquarters was initially provided in an apartment building at No 1 [[Great Cumberland Place]] in London, but something larger was required. Brigadier General Claude N. Thiele, the SOS Chief of Administrative Services, found {{convert|500000|sqft}} of office space in [[Cheltenham]], a [[spa town]] {{convert|90|mi}} northwest of London. Intended as an evacuation point for the British [[War Office]] in the event that London had to be evacuated, the staff stationed there were in the process of moving back to London. The site had adequate road, rail and signal communications, but the distance from London was a disadvantage. Lee opened SOS headquarters in Cheltenham on 25 July.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nLee announced a regional organization of SOS on 20 July. It was divided into base commands corresponding to the British Army's territorial commands. The Northern Island Base Section, under Brigadier General Leroy P. Collins, with its headquarters at [[Belfast]], included all of [[Northern Ireland]]; the Western Base Section, under Davison, had its headquarters at [[Chester]], and corresponded to the British Army's [[Scottish Command|Scottish]] and [[Western Command (United Kingdom)|Western Command]]s; the Eastern Base Section, under Colonel Cecil R. Moore, with its headquarters at [[Watford]], corresponded to the British [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern]] and [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Commands]]; and the Southern Base Section, under Colonel Charles O. Thrasher, with its headquarters at [[Wilton, Wiltshire]], corresponded to the British [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern]] and [[South Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|South Eastern Command]]s.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=83\u201386}} A London Base Command was created under the command of Brigadier General Pleas B. Rogers on 21 March 1943.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=162}} Over time each of the base sections acquired its own character, with the Western Base Section principally concerned with the reception of troops and supplies, the Eastern with supporting the Air Force, and the Southern with hosting marshalling and training areas.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=6}} The doctrinal concept behind the base section concept was of \"centralized control and decentralized operation\", but reconciling the two proved difficult in practice.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n==Planning and preparations==\n[[File:General Depot at Ashchurch.jpg|thumb|right|General Depot at [[Ashchurch]], north of Cheltenham. Originally developed as a British automotive depot, this was handed over to SOS in 1942. It consisted of 158 buildings, including 10 hangers and three warehouses. About 5,000 US personnel worked there.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=155\u2013156}}]]\n===Bolero===\n{{main|Operation Bolero}}\nBolero was derailed by the decision taken at the Second Claridge Conference in July 1942 to abandon the proposed 1942 cross-channel attack ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]) in favor of an invasion of French Northwest Africa ([[Operation Torch]]). This made the prospective 1943 cross-channel attack ([[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]]) unlikely,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=89}} but it died hard in the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=104}} Doubtful that sufficient shipping was available to support both Bolero and Torch, Somervell ordered all construction work in the UK to cease, except on airfields, {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=104}} but the British government went ahead with the construction plan anyway, using materials and labor supplied under [[Reverse Lend-Lease]]. After the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943, American resources became available again. Eventually, the works completed included {{convert|6,489,335|sqft|0}} of covered storage, {{convert|37,915,645|sqft|0}} of open storage and hard standings, and facilities for storage of {{convert|169,320|LT}} of petrol, oil and lubricants (POL).{{sfn|Albrecht|1950|p=119}}\n\nRoundup was not carried out, but Bolero survived, strengthened by the decision at the [[Trident Conference]] to mount the cross-channel attack with a target date of 1 May 1944. The planners at Trident envisioned shipping 1.3 million US troops to the UK by that date. Effecting this depended on the ability of the ports in the UK handling up to 150 ships per month.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=120\u2013121}} Progress was disappointing, but record shipments of men in the last quarter of the year boosted the strength of ETOUSA to 773,753 by the end of 1943, of whom 220,200 were in the SOS.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=132}}\n\nTo take advantage of the longer daylight hours of summer, a system of preshipment was instituted, whereby unit equipment was shipped to the UK in advance of the units. Rather than lose training time packing all its equipment, personnel could sail to the UK, and draw a new set of equipment there. The major obstacle to the idea was that not all commodities were available in surplus in the US. Indeed the [[Army Service Forces]] (ASF), as USASOS had been renamed on 12 March 1943,{{sfn|Millett|1954||p=1}} had difficulty filling the available shipping. Of {{convert|1012000|MTON|abbr=off}} of cargo space available in July, only {{convert|780000|MTON|abbr=off}} were used; of {{convert|1122000|MTON|abbr=off}} available in August, only {{convert|730000|MTON|abbr=off}}. Of the {{convert|2304000|MTON|abbr=off}} shipped in May through August, 39 percent was preshipped cargo. This rose to {{convert|457868|MTON|abbr=off}} or 54 percent of the {{convert|850000|MTON|abbr=off}} shipped in November, but most of this was consumed re-equipping three of the four divisions transferred from NATOUSA.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=132\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:US built locomotives stockpiled in Wales for Operation Overlord.jpg|thumb|left|US built locomotives stockpiled in Wales for Operation Overlord]]\nThe main points of entry for US cargo were the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey River]] ports, and those of the [[Bristol Channel]]; ports on the south and east coasts of the UK were subject to attack by German aircraft and submarines, and were avoided until late 1943, when shipments began to exceed the capacity of the other ports. The Clyde ports of [[Glasgow]], [[Greenock]] and [[Gourock]] were remote from the main supply depots, but were used as the main debarkation points for US troops, accounting for 873,163 (52 percent) of the 1,671,010 US personnel arrivals, but only {{convert|1138000|MTON|abbr=off}} (8 percent) of cargo.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=146\u2013149}} The majority of troops travelled across the Atlantic on [[ocean liner]]s like the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth||6}} and {{RMS|Queen Mary||2}}. Marking three round-trip voyages per month carrying up to 15,000 passengers each time, these two liners alone carried 24 percent of troops arrivals. They were supplemented by other liners, including the {{RMS|Aquitania||6}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1938|2}}, and the {{SS|\u00cele de France||6}}, {{SS|Nieuw Amsterdam|1937|2}} and {{SS|Bergensfjord||2}}, which accounted for another 36 percent.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=235}} The troops debarked into [[ship's tender]]s, and boarded quayside trains to their destinations.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=146\u2013149}}\n\nThe Bristol Channel ports of [[Swansea]], [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Avonmouth]], and the Mersey ports of [[Liverpool]], [[Garston, Liverpool|Garston]], [[Manchester]] and [[Birkenhead]] handled {{convert|9750000|MTON|abbr=off}} (70 percent) of the cargo brought to the UK, including most of the heavy items like tanks, artillery pieces and ammunition. This was not accomplished without difficulty; most of the cargo handling eq1uipment was old and outdated, and it was not possible to follow the standard US practice of moving goods from the quayside on [[pallet]]s with [[forklift]]s. [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom]] opposed the use of military labor except when civilian labor was unavailable, but this ban was lifted when the volume of cargo became too great, and by May 1944 fifteen US port battalions were working the UK ports {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=146\u2013149}}\n\n[[File:Tenders alongside the RMS Queen Elizabeth.jpg|thumb|right|Tenders alongside the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth||6}} at [[Gourock]], Scotland.]]\nSOS found the textbook concept of shipping cargo from the port to distribution centers, sorting it there, and despatching it to branch depots too extravagant in its use of scarce depot space and the overburdened British railway system. Moreover shipping [[manifest (transportation)|manifests]] were often found to be incomplete, inaccurate or illegible, and despite being sent by air mail somehow still frequently failed to arrive in advance of the cargo. SOS ultimately persuaded a reluctant ASF to accept a system whereby every item shipped was individually labelled with a requisition number that provided a complete UK destination address.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=139\u2013141}}\n\nThe railways were used to move cargo wherever possible, as the narrow rural roads and village streets of rural England were not conducive to use by large trucks, but as cargo volumes increased, road transport had to be resorted to, and in the eight months from October 1943 to May 1944, trucks carried {{convert|1000000|LT|t}}, or about a third of the cargo from the ports. The railways had challenges of their own, with limited head room and tunnel clearances that impeded the carriage of bulky items like tanks. Locomotives were in short supply and in 1942 the British railways arranged for 400 [[2-8-0]] locomotives to be shipped from the US under Lend-Lease. The order was later increased to 900, and in 1943 they arrived at a rate of fifty per month.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=149\u2013152}}\n\nThe US buildup in the UK was largely accomplished in first five months of 1944. In this period, an additional 752,663 troops arrived, bringing the total theater strength to 1,526,965. Of these, 459,511 were in the SOS.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=231\u2013233}} Some {{convert|6,106,500|MTON|abbr=off}} of cargo arrived in the same period. Clearing it involved running 100 special freight trains with up to 20,000 loaded cars each week. The limit on ship arrivals was raised from 109 to 120 in March, then to 140. Shipments in excess of the previously agreed limits were possible only because of the postponement of the invasion date from May to June.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=235\u2013238}} This postponement, primary to gain extra month's production of landing craft to effect the enlarged landing plan,{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=43}} cost a month in which the weather over the English Channel was the best it had been in forty years. May was also the month when the Germans sowed [[Cherbourg Harbor]] with [[Parachute mine|oyster mines]].{{sfn|Osmanski|1950|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nThe pressure on the UK transportation system became acute in May as Overlord commenced and the troops began moving to their staging areas. By 18 May SOS was forced to inform the [[New York Port of Embarkation]] that no more than 120 ships could be accepted. By this time the New York Port of Embarkation had a backlog of {{convert|540000|MTON|abbr=off}} of cargo and a deficit of 61 ships that were required to move it. This left the [[Third US Army]] with only 60 percent of its wheeled vehicles.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=235\u2013238}}\n\n===Organization===\nA separate [[North African Theater of Operations]] (NATOUSA) was created under Eisenhower on 6 February 1943, and Lieutenant General [[Frank M. Andrews]] succeeded him at ETOUSA. Andrews had SOS headquarters moved back to London, but his tenure in command was brief, as he was killed in an air crash on 3 May 1943. He was replaced by Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]].{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=7\u20139}} The British had already activated the [[21st Army Group]] in July 1943, and Devers prevailed on the War Department to authorize American counterparts.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=89}} The [[First United States Army Group]] was activated on 16 October 1943,{{sfn|Harrison|1951|p=115}} with its headquarters at [[Bryanston Square]] in London. Devers had Lieutenant General [[Omar N. Bradley]] reassigned to ETOUSA to command it. Bradley commanded both the First Army Group and the [[First United States Army]] (FUSA), which opened its headquarters in [[Bristol]] on 20 October,{{sfn|Hogan|2000|p=26}} and assumed control of all US ground forces in the UK three days later.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=191}}\n\nAn outcome of the 1943 [[Casablanca Conference]] was that in April 1943 the British Chiefs of Staff designated British [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Frederick E. Morgan]] as the Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander, with the immediate mission of planning the cross-channel operation, codenamed [[Operation Overlord]]. The staff he gathered around him became known by his own abbreviation, COSSAC.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=175\u2013177}} Eisenhower returned to the UK on 16 January 1944, and became the Supreme Allied Commander. COSSAC was absorbed into his new headquarters, known as the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF). Eisenhower also took over ETOUSA, but tended to rely on his SHAEF staff.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=13}} With the formation of SHAEF and FUSAG, ETOUSA lost most of its roles, and was consolidated with SOS.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=195\u2013202}}\n\nFrom February 1944 on, SOS was increasingly referred to as the Communications Zone (COMZ),{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=206}} although this did not become official until 7 June.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=457}} On 9 February SHAEF ordered FUSAG and COMZ to supply American liaison elements to 21st Army Group, which would control the First Army in the opening stages of Operation Overlord. ETOUSA had already activated its element two days before as the Forward Echelon, Communications Zone (FECOMZ). Brigadier General Harry B. Vaughan, the Western Base Section commander, was appointed to command it, with Colonel Frank M. Albrecht as his chief of staff.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=15}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=207\u2013208}}\n\nAnother organization activated on 7 February, far more important as it turned out, was the Advance Section ([[ADSEC]]), under the command of Colonel Ewart G. Plank. Experience in Italy had demonstrated the value of a logistical agency that worked closely with the army it was supporting. ADSEC would take over the operation of base areas, supply dumps and communications from FUSA as it moved forward. In the initial stages of Overlord, ADSEC would be attached to FUSA.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=211\u2013213}} COMZ also began organizing base sections for service in France. In March the five districts of the Eastern Base Section were consolidated into one, which became the VIII District of the Western Base Section in April. On 1 May, Base Section No. 1 was activated under the command of Colonel Roy W. Growler. The new section was held in readiness for service in Brittany. On 1 June Base Section No. 2, under the command of Brigadier General Leroy P. Collins, was activated.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=216\u2013218}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe logistical planners saw the campaign unfolding in three stages. In the first, an automatic supply system would be used, with materiel despatched on a predetermined schedule. In the second stage, which would occur after a lodgment was secured and supply depots began functioning, the system would become semi-automatic, with items like ammunition shipped on the basis of status reports. In the third stage, which would occur when the major ports were opened and the supply system was functioning smoothly, all items would be sent on requisition. In the event, the war ended before the third stage was achieved.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=29}}\n\n[[File:The Chastity Plan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Chastity plan]]\nSince the first three months of supply shipments were determined in advance, and the first two weeks already loaded on ships, three expedients were prepared to cover unanticipated shortfalls. The first was codenamed the \"Red Ball Express\". Starting on D plus 3, {{convert|100|MTON|abbr=off}} per day was set aside for emergency requests. Such shipments would be expedited. The second, codenamed \"Greenlight\", provided for {{convert|600|MTON|abbr=off}} of ammunition and engineer equipment to be substituted for scheduled shipments of engineer supplies. This would become available from D plus 14 onwards, and Greenlight supplies would take up to six days for delivery. Finally, supplies were packed with parachutes for aerial delivery to isolated units, and plans were made for the delivery of{{convert|6000|lb|abbr=off}} of supplies per day by air once airfields had been secured, with 48 hours warning.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nLogistical support of the armies on the continent depended on the capture and repair of ports. Plans were drawn up for the rehabilitation of eighteen ports in Normandy and Brittany. The task was assigned to port construction and repair (PC & R) groups. Each had a headquarters and headquarters company with specialists trained in port reconstruction, and a pool of heavy construction equipment with operators, which were supplemented by engineer troops and civilians, dump truck companies, port repair ships and dredges. Seven ports were expected to be captured and opened in the first four weeks: [[Isigny-sur-Mer]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Grandcamp-Maisy|Grandcamp]], [[Saint-Vaast-sur-Seulles]], [[Barfleur]], [[Granville, Manche|Granville]] and [[Saint-Malo]]. Except for Cherbourg, all were small and tidal, and unable to berth vessels drawing more than {{convert|14|to|15|ft}} at high water, which ruled out larger vessels. Much therefore depended on the early opening of Cherbourg, which was expected to occur by D plus 11, and was expected to handle {{convert|6000|MTON|abbr=off}} per day by D plus 30, and {{convert|8000|MTON|abbr=off}} per day by D plus 90, more than the other six ports combined.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=286\u2013290}}\n\nIn the longer term, the US forces would rely on the ports of Brittany, principally [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]] and [[Quiberon Bay]]. Along with Saint-Malo, they were expected to have a capacity of {{convert|17500|MTON|abbr=off}} per day. Of this, {{convert|10000|MTON|abbr=off}} per day were expected to come through Quiberon Bay, as it was anticipated that the ports would suffer considerable damage in the fighting, or through German demolitions. Studies indicated that Quiberon Bay had an anchorage sufficient for 200 ships, {{convert|3000|yd}} of beaches with the required slope for landing craft, and four minor ports close by where deep water piers could be constructed. A detailed plan known as [[Operation Chastity]] was drawn up to develop the area.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=294\u2013296}}\n\nThe Overlord plan called for the early capture of Cherbourg, and a rapid American advance to secure the Brittany ports and Quiberon Bay. Crucially, the logistical plan called for a one-month pause at the [[Seine River]], which was expected to be reached by D plus 90, before advancing further.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=189}} The expectation of an advance a proscribed rate, while necessary for planning purposes, built inflexibility into a logistics plan that already had little margin for error. Staff studies confirmed that Overlord could be supported if everything went according to plan. No one expected that it would.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=25, 47\u201348}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=326\u2013327}}\n\n==Assault==\n[[File:Utah Beach and Beach Maintenance Area.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Utah Beach and Beach Maintenance Area]]\n{{main|Omaha Beach|Utah Beach}}\nThe Southern Base Section consisted of four districts, numbered XVI, XVII, XVIII and XIX. The XVIII District, under the command of Colonel Paschal N. Strong, was responsible for mounting Force O, the assault force for [[Omaha Beach]], while the XIX district, under the command of Colonel Theodore Wyman Jr., handled Force U, the assault force for [[Utah Beach]]. The South Base Section coast was divided into nine areas, lettered A to D in the XVIII District and K to O in the XIX District. Together they contained 95 marshalling camps with a capacity for 187,000 troops and 28,000 vehicles. The other two districts, the XVI and XVII were responsible for mounting glider-borne elements of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division]]s.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=359\u2013360}}\n\nIn the opening phase of Overlord, supplies would arrive over the beaches. Operation of the beachheads assigned to the [[Engineer Special Brigade (United States)|engineer special brigades]]. Their name was misleading, for in addition to three engineer battalions, each contained amphibious truck and port companies, and quartermaster, ordnance, medical, military police, signals and chemical warfare units. Along with bomb disposal squads, naval beach parties, maintenance and repair parties and other troops attached for the mission, each had a strength of 15,000 to 20,000 men.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=284\u2013285}}\n\nUtah Beach would be operated by the 1st Engineer Special Brigade, under the command of Brigadier General James E. Wharton; Omaha by the Provisional Special Brigade Group, consisting of the 5th and 6th Engineer Special Brigades and the 11th Port, commanded by Brigadier General [[William M. Hoge]].{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=53}} The 11th Port had a strength of over 7,600 men; it included four port battalions, five amphibious truck companies, three quartermaster service companies, and three quartermaster truck companies.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=344}}\n\nThe engineers landing on Omaha Beach on [[D-Day]], 6 June, found the beach swept by artillery and automatic weapons fire that the infantry was unable to suppress, and the beach littered with disabled vehicles and landing craft. Only five of the sixteen engineer teams arrived at their assigned locations, and they had only six of their sixteen tank dozers, five of which were soon knocked out. They were only able to clear five narrow lanes through the obstacles instead of the planned sixteen {{convert|50|yd|adj=on}} gaps.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=379\u2013380}} As the infantry advanced, the engineers filled in [[anti-tank ditch]]es, cleared minefields, demolished obstacles, opened three exits, and established the first supply dumps.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=383}}\n\n[[File:Omaha Beach and Beach Maintenance Area.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Omaha Beach and Beach Maintenance Area]]\nThe first waves came ashore on Utah Beach about {{convert|2000|yd}} south of the intended landing beaches. The beach fortifications were much weaker than the intended beaches, but the distance between the low and high watermarks was much greater. Because the beach obstacles were fewer than expected, the engineers were able to clear the entire beach of obstacles rather than just {{convert|50|yd|adj=on}} gaps. However, beach dumps could not be established as planned because the areas had not been captured..{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=384\u2013389}}\n\nIndividual riflemen arriving on the beaches were overburdened, carrying at least {{convert|68|lb}} of equipment and often more. The overburdening had been noted during landing exercises, but instead of reducing the load, another {{convert|15|lb}} had been added. The inability of the troops to move quickly had lethal consequences, especially on the deadly Omaha beach.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=380\u2013381}} Unneeded equipment was often discarded. The demonstration of the Army's prodigality inculcated a culture of wastefulness that had undesirable longer term consequences.{{sfn|Goodfriend|1946|p=33}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Build-up==\n===Shipping===\nBuild up priority lists had been drawn up months in advance that specified in what order units were to embark for Normandy during the first ninety days. To regulate the movement of ships and landing craft with maximum economy, a special organization was established called Build Up Control (BUCO). This operated under the tactical commanders, FUSA in the US case, on the British committee system, with representatives of the Allied Naval Commander, [[Ministry of War Transport]] and [[War Shipping Administration]]. BUCO was chaired by British Brigadier G. C. Blacker, with Lieutenant Colonel Eli Stevens as the head of the US Zone Staff. {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=363\u2013364}} It had three subordinate agencies: Movement Control (MOVCO), which issued orders for unit movements; Turnaround Control (TURCO), which liaised with the Navy and engineer special brigades; and Embarkation Control (EMBARCO), which handled the location of units and the availability of space in the marshaling areas.{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=41}} \n\n[[File:Rhino ferry RHF-3 approaches Normandy beaches 6 June 1944.jpg|thumb|right|A US Navy Rhino ferry (left) approaches the Normandy beaches, towed by a Rhino tug (right)]]\nThe detailed shipping plan soon fell apart. Very little cargo was landed on the first day, putting Overlord behind schedule from the start. By midnight on 8 June, only {{convert|6614|MTON}} of the planned {{convert|24850|LT|t}} had been discharged, just 26.6 percent of the planned total. This rose to {{convert|28100|LT|t}} of the planned {{convert|60250|LT|t}}, or 46 percent of the planned total by midnight on 10 June.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} Emergency beach dumps were established by the engineer special brigades on 7 and 8 June, and the planned inland dumps were opened over the next few days. The dumps were under sniper fire, and on 10 June artillery ammunition was taken from its boxes and carried by hand to the batteries. A consolidated Class V (ammunition) dump was established at [[Formigny]] on 12 June, and FUSA immediate took change of it. The following day it assumed control of all dumps from the engineer special brigades.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=396}} \n\nThe standard cargo vessel, the [[Liberty ship]], carried up to {{convert|11000|LT|t}} of cargo.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=280}} It had five hatches; two had {{convert|50|LT|t|adj=on}} [[crane (machine)|booms]], and three with smaller {{convert|6|to|9|LT|t|adj=on}} booms. In their haste to unload the ships, the crews overloaded the booms, occasionally resulting in breakages. Cargo was not containerized, but transported in bulk in bags, boxes, crates and barrels. [[Cargo net]]s were spread out on the deck, and cargo piled on them. The cargo net with cargo inside was then lifted over the side on the ship's boom, and deposited in a waiting craft.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nOne of the most useful unloading craft was the Rhino ferry, a powered barge constructed from pontons.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} The other mainstay of the unloading effort was the {{convert|2.5|MTON|adj=on}} amphibious truck, known as the [[DUKW]] (and pronounced \"duck\"). DUKWs were supposed to land on D-Day, but most were held offshore and arrived the following day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=394}} The Omaha and Utah beaches remained under sporadic artillery and sniper fire for several days, and as a result the naval officer in charge would not permit ships to anchor close to shore on the first two days.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} Some were as much as {{convert|12|to|15|mi}} offshore. This increased turnaround time for the unloading craft, especially the DUKWs, which were slow in the water. In some cases, DUKWs ran out of fuel. When this happened, their pumps failed, and they sank.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=394}}\n\n[[File:Crane transferring cargo from a DUKW.jpg|thumb|left|Crane transferring cargo from a DUKW]]\nThe unloading craft were frequently overloaded, increasing wear and tear, and occasionally causing one to capsize. Ideally, a DUKW reaching the shore would be met by a mobile crane that could transfer the load to a waiting truck that could take it to the dump, but there were shortages of both trucks and cranes in the early weeks, and DUKWs had to take cargo to the dumps themselves. Insufficient personnel at the dumps for unloading further slowed turnaround, as did the practice of crews whose priority was getting the ship unloaded, of unloading more than one category of supply at once, resulting in a trip to more than one dump. This was resolved only when started being loaded with one category of supply only. Cargo deposited on the beach at low tide and if not swiftly cleared was likely to be swamped by the rising tide.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nThe movement of troops into the marshaling areas had been pre-scheduled, and was already under way when D-Day was postponed for 24 hours. Troops continued to pour into the marshaling areas even though embarkation had halted, and they became overcrowded. This was exacerbated by the slow turnaround of shipping. The stowage and loading plans could not be adhered to when the designated ships failed to arrive as scheduled, and troops and cargo in the marshaling areas could not be sorted into ship loads. The situation became so bad that the flow of troops to the ports became insufficient to load the available ships, and on 12 June Stevens diverted idle shipping to the British so it was not wasted. Thereafter, troops and cargo moved to the ports and were loaded on the next available ship or landing craft. Loading plans were worked out on the spot. Had the Germans sank a ship it would have been highly embarrassing to the War Department, as no proper embarkation records were kept for a time. Some units became lost in the confusion. Major General [[Leonard T. Gerow]], the commander of [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]], personally returned the UK to locate a missing unit that the Southern Base Section had claimed had been shipped, but which was found still in its assembly area.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=422\u2013424}}\n\n[[File:Dried out LST discharges at Omaha Beach.jpg|thumb|{{USS|LST-332||6}} discharges at Omaha Beach while dried out]]\nA major problem was ships arriving without manifests, which were supposed to have been shipped in advance by air or naval courier, but aircraft could not get through and the courier launches were often delayed. Navy and Transportation Corps officers went from one ship to the next searching for items that were desperately required. FUSA would then declare what it wanted discharged.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=392\u2013393}} Selective unloading left half-empty ships with supplies not immediately required standing offshore, further exacerbating the problem of ship turnaround. Desperate measures were taken. The most controversial was ordering the \"drying out\" LSTs.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} This involved beaching the LST on a falling tide, discharging at low tide, and then re-floating the LST on the rising tide.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=392}} The procedure had been performed successfully in the Mediterranean and the Pacific, but with the high tidal range and uneven beaches of Normandy, naval officials feared that the LSTs might break their backs. Drying out commenced tentatively on 8 June and soon became a standard practice.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nOn 10 June, FUSA ordered the selective discharging of LSTs and LCTs to cease; this was extended to all vessels the following day. Discharge at night under lights began on 12 June despite the obvious risk of German air attack. The backlog of ships was eventually cleared by 15 June. Nonetheless, the manifest problem persisted. When a critical shortage of [[M1 mortar]] ammunition developed in July, all available ammunition was shipped from the UK, but FUSA did not know where the ammunition was or when it arrived. Ordnance personnel were forced to conduct searches of ships looking for it. Thus, a critical shortage continued even though {{convert|145000|LT|MT}} of ammunition lay offshore.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Mulberry harbor===\n[[File:Plan of Mulberry A at Omaha Beach.jpg|thumb|right|Plan of Mulberry A at Omaha Beach]]\n{{main|Mulberry harbor}}\nThe decision to land in Normandy meant that ports would not be captured quickly; the Brittany ports were not expected to be in operation until D plus 60. Until then, the Allied armies would have to rely on the beaches, but the weather forecast was not promising. Meteorological records showed that only 25 days of good weather could be expected in June, and there were normally only two quiet spells of good weather four days running between May and September. The tidal range in Normandy was about {{convert|12|ft}}; low tide uncovered about {{convert|1/4|mi|km|spell=in|adj=pre|of a}} of beach, and you had to go out another {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=in|adj=pre|a}} to reach water deep enough for [[coastal trading vessel|coasters]], which drew {{convert|12|to|18|ft}} of water.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=269\u2013275}}\n\nThe solution the COSSAC planners adopted was innovative and audacious: to build a prefabricated harbor. While ports like [[Dover]] and Cherbourg were artificial in the sense that their sheltered harbors had been created through the construction of [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], there was a significant difference between building Dover in seven years in peacetime, and prefabricating an artificial port in a matter of months, and erecting it in two weeks in wartime.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=269\u2013275}} Originally, there was to be one artificial port, at [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]] in the British sector, but by October 1943 COSSAC was planning for two, with a second one at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer|Saint-Laurent]] in the American sector. At this time the project acquired a codename: Mulberry, with the American port becoming Mulberry A and the British one Mulberry B. British [[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] Sir [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]] was in charge of the operation, with the American [[Captain (United States Navy)|Captain]] [[Augustus Dayton Clark|A. Dayton Clark]] in charge of Mulberry A.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=277\u2013278}}{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=46}}\n\nThe Mulberry harbor had three breakwaters. The outermost was made up of bombardons, {{convert|200|ft|adj=on}} long cruciform floating steel structures. These were laid out in a straight line. Then came the phoenixes, {{convert|60|by|60|by|200|ft|adj=on}} concrete [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]] that weighed between {{convert|2000|and|6000|LT|t|-1}}. These were sunk in about {{convert|5+1/2|fathom|m}} of water to form an inner breakwater. Finally, there was the gooseberry, an inner breakwater formed by sinking obsolete vessels known as corncobs in about {{convert|2+1/2|fathom|m}} of water. Plans called for Mulberry A to have three piers, two of {{convert|25|LT|t}} capacity, and one of {{convert|40|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=46}} Towing the mulberries' components was estimated to require 164 [[tug]]s, but only 125 were available, and 24 of these were temporarily diverted to tow barges. The target date for completion of the mulberries was therefore pushed back from D plus 14 to D plus 21.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=281}}\n\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|left|Vehicles come ashore over one of the floating causeways]]\nClark arrived off Omaha beach with his staff on 7 June, and the first three corncobs were scuttled under fire that day. The gooseberry was completed by 10 June, and by 17 June all 24 of the bombardons, 32 of the 51 phoenixes were in place, and the central LST pier was in use. On its first day of operation, a vehicle unloaded over the pier every 1.16 minutes. [[Seabee]]s completed the first of the {{convert|2450|ft|adj=on}} ponton causeways 10 June, and the second on 15 June. The planned harbor installation at Utah Beach was much smaller, consisting of just two ponton causeways and a gooseberry with ten corncobs. The corncobs began arriving on 8 June, and came under fire from German artillery. Two were hit, and sank, but in approximately the intended position, albeit spaced too far apart. A third also sank slightly out of position when the tug towing it cut it loose to avoid the shelling. The remainder were scuttled in the correct locations, and the gooseberry was completed on 13 June. The first pontoon cause was opened that day, followed by the second three days later.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=402\u2013404}}\n\nBy 18 June, {{convert|116065|LT|t}} of supplies had been landed, 72.9 percent of the planned {{convert|159530|LT|t}}, although only 40,541 (66 percent) of the planned 61,367 vehicles had arrived. FUSA estimated that it had accumulated 9 days' reserves of rations, and five days' of POL. On the other hand, 314,504 (88 percent) of the planned 358,139 American troops had reached the beaches, representing eleven of the intended twelve divisions. In addition, 14,500 casualties had been evacuated by sea and 1,300 by air, and 10,000 prisoners had been shipped back to the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\nBut on 19 June, the Normandy beaches were hit by a storm that lasted for four days. Although the worst June storm in forty years, it was not a severe one; wind gusts reached {{convert|25|to|32|kn|kph}}, and therefore never reached [[Gale|gale force]]. Waves reached {{convert|8+1/2|ft}}.{{sfn|Morison|1957|p=176}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=413}} Nonetheless, the damage was considerable. Nearly a hundred landing craft were lost, and only one of the twenty Rhino ferries remained operational. Damaged craft were strewn over the beach, partially blocking every exit. The storm interrupted unloading for four days, resulting in the discharge of only {{convert|12253|LT|t}} of stores instead of the planned {{convert|64100|LT|t}} , and 23,460 troops instead of the77,081 scheduled.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=406\u2013410}}\n\n[[File:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|right|Wrecked ponton causeway after the storm]]\nThe American Western Naval Task Force commander, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Alan G. Kirk]], surveyed the damage. The bombardons had failed completely, while the piers and phoenixes had been unable to withstand the pounding of the waves, and had been heavily damaged. Kirk decided that Mulberry A was a total loss, and should not be rebuilt, although the gooseberry should be reinforced with a dozen additional blockships. Many American officials had been skeptical about the value of the artificial port concept from the very beginning, but had held their tongues, knowing that it had high-level official support. The British Mulberry B had not been as badly damaged, as the Calvados Rocks had given it some additional protection, and the British still were still determined to complete their artificial port to a standard that could withstand the autumn gales. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[Winston Churchill]], assured Eisenhower that the project still had his full support. Mulberry B was repaired and reinforced, in some cases using components salvaged from Mulberry A. Expected to handle {{convert|6000|LT|t}} per day, Mulberry B actually averaged {{convert|6765|LT|t}} per day over three months, accounting for 48 percent of the tonnage unloaded in the British sector.{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=178\u2013179}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=413\u2013415}}\n\nThis left the American forces dependent on some small ports and unloading over the beaches. By 30 June, 70,910 of the planned 109,921 vehicles (64.5 percent) had been landed, and 452,460 (78 percent) of the planned 578,971 troops. The deficit in personnel consisted entirely of service and support troops; all eleven divisions planned for had arrived, along with the two airborne divisions which were to have been withdrawn to the UK but had been retained in France.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=418\u2013422}}\n\n===Ordnance===\nThe nature of the fighting in the Normandy hedgerows created shortages of certain items. A heavy reliance on M1 mortars not only led to a shortage of ammunition, but a shortage of the mortars themselves as the Germans targeted them. On 3 July, FUSA ordered tank, armored field artillery, and tank destroyer battalions to turn in their mortars for reallocation to infantry units.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=73\u201375}} A shortage of [[bazooka]]s was similarly addressed by taking them from service units and redistributing them to the infantry. The Germans also made a special effort to eliminate the man with the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]] (BAR), as the BAR represented most of an infantry squad's firepower. Another item with a higher than expected loss rate was the [[M7 grenade launcher]]. When this device was attached to the [[M1 Garand]] rifle, it disabled the rifle's semi-automatic function, so the rifle could not be fired normally when it was in place. Accordingly, they were quickly discarded after use in combat, resulting in a high loss rate. By mid-July, FUSA reported a shortage of 2,300 M7 grenade launchers.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=442\u2013443}}\n\nAlthough ammunition expenditure did not exceed expected usage, it did not arrive at the planned rate either, resulting in shortages. FUSA gave high priority to the unloading of ammunition. The hedgerow fighting soon generated shortages of small arms ammunition and [[Mk 2 grenade|hand grenades]]. These were alleviated in the short term by emergency shipments by air, and in the medium term by allotting ammunition the highest priority for shipment instead of POL. On 15 June FUSA imposed restrictions on the number of rounds per gun per day that could be fired. In part this was because deliveries consistently fell short of targets, but the main problem that FUSA sought to address was excessive and unreported stocks held by artillery units, which reduced the reserves held at Army level. The storm prompted emergency action. FUSA limited expenditure to a third of a unit of fire per day, arranged for {{convert|500|LT|t}} per day to be delivered by air for three days, ordered coasters carrying ammunition to be beached, and called forward five Liberty ships in UK waters that had been prestowed with ammunition.\n{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=445\u2013448}}\n\n[[File:Bocagesoldier1944.jpg|thumb|left|American soldiers near a hedgerow. The one in the foreground has an [[M7 grenade launcher]].]]\nA unit of fire was a somewhat arbitrary measurement for accounting purposes, and was different for each type of ammunition.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=306\u2013307}} It was 133 rounds for the [[M101 howitzer|105 mm howitzer]], 75 rounds for the [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm howitzer]], 50 rounds for the [[155 mm gun M1|155 mm gun]], and 50 rounds for the [[M115 howitzer|8 inch howitzer]].{{sfn|Balmer|Compton|Daley|Williams|1945|p=13}} The divisions responded to the restrictions on the use of field artillery by employing tank destroyers and anti-aircraft guns as field artillery, as their ammunition was not rationed. On 2 July, FUSA imposed a new set of restrictions: expenditure was not to exceed one unit of fire of the first day of an attack, half a unit of fire on the second and subsequent days of an attack, and a third of a unit of fire on other days. Consumption in excess of the limits had to be reported to FUSA, with an appropriate justification. In practice, ammunition usage continued to be heavy, exacerbated by wasteful practices like unobserved firing and firing for morale effect by inexperienced units. By 16 July, FUSA stocks of 105 mm ammunition were down to 3.5 units of fire, and 81 mm mortar ammunition was at a critically low 0.3 units of fire. Ammunition was being unloaded at a rate of {{convert|500|LT|t}} per day, which was insufficient, resulting in FUSA stocks being depleted at a rate of 0.2 units of fire per day. FUSA once again imposed strict rationing on 16 July, but expenditure was well below the limits owing to most of the tubes going silent as they moved into new gun positions for the upcoming [[Operation Cobra]] attack on 25 July.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=445\u2013448}}  \n\nThe limitations of the [[M4 Sherman]] tank's [[75mm gun M2\u2013M6|75 mm gun]] had already been recognized to some extent, and the theater had received 150 Shermans armed with the high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1|76 mm gun]]. A few weeks of combat in Normandy laid plain that the Sherman, even when equipped with the 76 mm gun, was outclassed by the German [[Tiger I]], [[Tiger II]] and [[Panther tank]]s. The chief of the ETOUSA Armored Fighting Vehicles and Weapons Section, Brigadier General Joseph A. Holly, met with commanders in the field on 25 June, and then went to the United States in July to urge the expedited delivery of Shermans armed with the 105 mm howitzer, and of the new [[M36 tank destroyer]], which was armed with a [[90 mm gun M1/M2/M3|90 mm gun]].{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=442\u2013443}}{{sfn|Mayo|1968|p=331}} In the meantime, 57 recently-received Shermans armed with the 105 mm howitzer were shipped to Normandy from the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=442\u2013443}} Consideration was given to obtaining the British [[Sherman Firefly]], which mounted the powerful [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17-pounder]] anti-tank gun, but the British were overwhelmed with orders for them from the British Army.{{sfn|Mayo|1968|p=331}}{{sfn|Bradley|1951|pp=322\u2013323}} It was useless arguing that American equipment was adequate; American propaganda declared that the American fighting man was the best equipped in the world, and when confronted with evidence to the contrary, everyone from Eisenhower down felt short changed.{{sfn|Goodfriend|1946|p=33}}{{sfn|Bradley|1951|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\n===Subsistence===\nAmerican soldiers were also skeptical of the claim that they were the best-fed soldiers of all time. The US Army's standard garrison ration was called the [[A-ration]]. The [[B-ration]] was A-ration without its perishable components. The [[C-ration]] consisted of six {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} cans, three of which contained meat combinations (meat and vegetable hash, meat and beans, or meat and vegetable stew), and the other three biscuits, hard candy, cigarettes, and a beverage in the form of [[instant coffee]], lemon powder or cocoa.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=439\u2013441}}\n\n[[File:Military Rations, World War II and Korean War - Fort Devens Museum - DSC07076.JPG|thumb|right|C, D and K rations]]\nThe better-packaged [[K-ration]] was designed to be an emergency ration. It contained three meals: a breakfast unit with canned ham and eggs and a dried fruit bar; a supper unit with luncheon meat; and a dinner unit with biscuits and cheese. It also contained [[Halazone]] water purification tablets, a four-pack of cigarettes, chewing gum, instant coffee, and sugar. The [[D-ration]] was chocolate bar. The compactness of the K-ration made it the preferred choice of the foot soldiers, but troops with access to transport and heating preferred the C-ration. Finally, there was the [[10-in-1 food parcel|10-in-1]], an American version of the British 12-in-1, which was intended to feed ten men. It could be used by field kitchens, and offered the variety of five different menus. The lemon powder in the C and K rations was particularly unpopular with the troops, who frequently discarded it, or used it for things like scrubbing floors, which was unfortunate as it was those rations' primary sources of [[vitamin C]].{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=439\u2013441}}{{sfn|Risch|1953|pp=184\u2013188}}\n\nThe troops landing on D-Day each carried one D-ration and one K-ration; another three rations per man in the form of C- and K-rations were carried with their units. For the first few days all rations landed were C- or K-rations. During the four weeks of Overlord, 60,000,000 rations were delivered to Normandy in vessels pre-stowed in three to eight {{convert|500|LT|t|adj=on}} blocks at the New York Port of Embarkation. This facilitated the shift to 10-in-1 packs over the less popular C- and K-rations; 77 percent of rations in the first four weeks were in the form of 10-in-1s. By 1 July, a static bakery was in operation at Cherbourg, and there were seven mobile bakeries in operation, permitting the issue of freshly-baked white bread to commence. By mid-July, 70 percent of the troops were eating B-rations.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=439\u2013441}}   \n===POL===\nInitially fuel arrived packaged in {{convert|5|USgal|l|-1|adj=on}} [[jerrican]]s. This was a German invention copied by the British; in the US Army it supplanted the {{convert|10|USgal|l|adj=on}} container used in the 1930s. The jerrican had convenient carrying handles, stacked easily and did not shift or roll in storage,\nand floated in water when filled with [[gasoline|MT80]]. The British version was an exact copy of the German model; the American version, called an Ameri-can by the British, was slightly smaller, with a screw cap onto which a nozzle could be fitted to deal with American vehicles with flush or countersunk fuel tank openings. If a nozzle was not available, the original can with its short spout was much preferred. A US jerrican weighed {{convert|10|lb}} empty, and {{convert|40|lb}} when filled with MT80, so 56 filled cans weighed {{convert|1|LT|t|spell=in}}.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=162\u2013163}} For Overlord, 11,500,000 jerricans were provided. Of these, 10,500,000 were manufactured in the UK and supplied to the US Army under [[Reverse Lend-Lease]].{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=342}} Jeeps arrived at the beachhead with full tanks and two jerricans of fuel; weapons carriers and small trucks carried five; 2\u00bd-ton trucks carried ten; and DUKWs carried twenty.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=648}}\n\n[[File:Soldiers on their way to the front.jpg|thumb|left|American soldiers and jeeps on their way to the front at [[Saint Lo]] in June 1944]]The standard operating procedure (SOP) with respect to fuel containers was that empties should be returned and swapped for full ones, but the engineer special brigades had no refilling facilities, and did not wish to have the beach supply dumps cluttered with empties, so FUSA issued an order that empties not be returned. Instead, they went to divisional or corps collection points. The relaxation of the full-for-empty SOP was to have undesirable effects later on in the campaign. Bulk POL started to arrive at Isigny on 22 June, and at [[Port-en-Bessin]] and [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] the following day.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=61\u201362}} It had been expected that only the east [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] at the Port-en-Bessin terminal could be used, and only by small tankers with a capacity of up to {{convert|150|LT|t}}, but it was found that both east and west moles could be used, and for tankers up to {{convert|1500|LT|t}}. This allowed one mole to be allocated to the British and one to the Americans.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=443\u2013445}}\n\nThe POL supply situation was satisfactory throughout June and July, mainly because the rate of advance was much slower than anticipated, resulting in shorter supply lines and lower fuel consumption. FUSA's daily MT80 consumption in July was around {{convert|9500|USbbl|l}}. Steady progress was made on construction of the Minor System pipeline, and the tank farm at Mont Cauvin received its first bulk MT80 on 25 June. The delay in the capture of Cherbourg led to the extension of the Minor System beyond what had originally been planned, and eventually {{convert|70|mi}} of pipeline were laid instead of the planned {{convert|27|mi}}. The pipeline carried both MT80 and avgas to [[Saint-L\u00f4]], and later to [[Carentan]]. Intended to deliver {{convert|6000|USbbl|l}} per day, it was delivering twice that by the end of July. Storage was similarly greater than planned, {{convert|142000|USbbl|l}} instead of the planned {{convert|54000|USbbl|l}}.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=443\u2013445}} Decanting of bulk fuel into jerricans began on 26 June, and by July {{convert|600000|USgal}} was being decanted each day.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=62\u201363}}\n\nBy the time Operation Cobra was launched on 25 July, no part of the planned Major System pipeline was in operation. As it was expected to have received {{convert|85000|LT|t}} of POL products by then, receipts lagged considerably. Nonetheless, stocks were roughly what had been intended, because consumption had been much lower. In June, FUSA consumed around {{convert|3,700,000|USgal|l}}, an average of about {{convert|148,000|USgal|l}} per day, or {{convert|55|LT|t}} per division slice. This rose to {{convert|11,500,000|USgal|l}}, an average of about {{convert|372,000|USgal|l}} per day, or {{convert|75|LT|t}} per division slice in July, but still remained far below the expected figure of {{convert|121|LT|t}} per division slice.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=501\u2013502}}\n\n==Breakout and pursuit==\n[[File:Development of the lodgement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|21st Army Group's forecast of Operation Overlord]]\nBy the time [[Operation Cobra]] was launched on 25 July, Overlord was running nearly forty days behind schedule. The Allies considered an alternative to the Overlord plan called Lucky Strike. This involved defeating the German forces west of the Seine, forcing a crossing of the river, and seizing the Seine ports of [[Le Havre]] and [[Rouen]] as an alternative to those in Brittany, neither of which had yet been captured. The SHAEF and COMZ staffs considered Lucky Strike a terrible idea, as the Seine ports did not have the capacity to compensate for those in Brittany.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=407, 481\u2013482}}\n\nOperation Cobra effected a remarkable turnaround in the operational situation, and by 3 August, Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton Jr.]]'s Third Army was advancing into Brittany.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=483}} For some reason, Bradley fixated on Brest, which was only intended to be a port of reception for troops, and Saint-Malo, a minor port, whereas Patton focused on Lorient and Quiberon Bay. There were significant differences in the way Patton, a cavalryman, and Bradley and [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] commander [[Troy H. Middleton]], who were both infantrymen, conceived [[operational art]]. When the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]]'s commander, Major General [[John Shirley Wood|John S. Wood]] incorrectly reported that Lorient was too strongly defended to rush, Middleton accepted this assessment.{{sfn|Mack|1981|p=8}}{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=364}}\n\n[[File:Allied forces pursuit of German forces to the German border 26 August - 10 September 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Pursuit to the German border]]\nBradley then ordered Patton to move east, leaving only minimal forces in Brittany.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=483}} This did not immediately change the plan;{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=483}} Eisenhower informed Marshall that \"the rapid occupation of Brittany is placed as a primary task, the difference being that in one case we believe that it would rather easily be done and in the other we would have to fight through the defensive line and commit more forces to the job\"{{sfn|Rawson|2012|p=117}} But it was the first in a series of critical decisions that subordinated logistical considerations to short-term operational advantage.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=483}} In the event, Lorient was not captured, and as a result Quiberon Bay could not be developed because the approaches were not cleared. Saint-Malo was secured on 2 September,{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|pp=414\u2013415}} and Brest on 19 September, but the port facilities were destroyed,{{sfn|Mack|1981|p=8}}{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=653}} and SHAEF had abandoned plans to develop Quiberon Bay on 3 September.{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=655}}\n\nBy 24 August, the left bank of the Seine had been cleared, and Operation Overlord was completed. In just 30 days, the Allied forces had conducted an advance that had been expected to take 70. Reaching the D plus 90 line on D plus 79 was not a grave concern, as the Overlord plan had sufficient flexibility to allow for a discrepancy of eleven days.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1951|p=4}} The plan called for a pause on the Seine of at least 30 days, but in mid-August the decision was taken to continue the pursuit beyond the Seine. This had even more far-reaching effects than Bradley's 3 August decision.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=484\u2013485}} Between 25 August and 12 September, the Allied armies advanced from the D plus 90 phase line to the D plus 350 one, moving through 260 phase lines in just 19 days. Although the planners had estimated that no more than 12 divisions could be maintained beyond the Seine, 16 were by mid-September, albeit on reduced scales.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1951|p=5}}  \n\n===Base organization===\nADSEC headquarters opened in Normandy on 16 June. FECOMZ, now under Albrecht's command, opened its headquarters at Ch\u00e2teau Servigny and Ch\u00e2teau Pont Rilly near [[Valognes]] on 15 July, but ADSEC remained subordinated to First Army until 30 July. Indeed, First Army controlled all US forces in France until 1 August, when [[Twelfth United States Army Group]] and Third Army became active.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=434\u2013436}} The facilities at Valognes were greatly expanded, with tents to accommodation 11,000 personnel and {{convert|560,000|sqft}} of hutted office space,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=31}} and special signal facilities installed to enable it to communicate with the UK and US.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=434\u2013436}} COMZ headquarters opened at Valognes on 7 August,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=34}} a month earlier than originally planned, and FECOMZ therefore never operated in its intended role.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=436\u2013437}}\n\n[[File:COMZ boundaries November 1944 - January 1945.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|COMZ boundaries November 1944 \u2013 January 1945]]\nCOMZ headquarters was not destined to remain at Valognes for long, for on 1 September it began moving to Paris. The move took two weeks to accomplish,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=31}} with some of the 29,000 staff moving directly from the UK, and consumed motor and air transport at a time when transportation assets were scarce.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=286}} In Paris, COMZ headquarters occupied 167 hotels. Eisenhower was not impressed; the move had been conducted without his knowledge, and contrary to his orders that no Allied headquarters be located in Paris without his specific approval.{{sfn|Pogue|1954|pp=322\u2013323}} As Paris was the hub of road, rail, cable and inland waterway systems, it soon hosted a concentration of supply depots, hospitals, airfields, railway stations and marshaling yards, and inland waterway offloading points, and as such was the logical and perhaps the only suitable location for COMZ headquarters.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=31}} \n\nOn 11 July, ADSEC organized the port of Cherbourg as Area No. 1 under the command of Colonel Cleland C. Sibley, the commander if the 4th Major Port. Ten days later it was redesignated that Cherbourg Command, with Wyyman in charge. Over the following week, his headquarters was reinforced with personnel from Base Section No. 3 in England. It was redesignated the Cherbourg Base Section on 7 August, and began taking over the beach area dumps from ADSEC. Finally, on 16 August, it became the Normandy Base Section. Meanwhile, Grower's Base Section No. 1 had arrived at Utah Beach on 3 August, and proceeded to [[Rennes]], where it opened as the Brittany Base Section on 16 August. Base Collins's Section No. 1 moved to [[Le Mans]], where it became the Loire Base Section on 5 September. After Paris was captured, COMZ sent for Rogers's Base Section No. 5, which had been specifically created for the role. It became the Seine Base Section on 24 August,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=33\u201335}} and occupied another 129 Paris hotels.{{sfn|Pogue|1954|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\nBase Section No. 4, under the command of Colonel Fenton S. Jacobs, opened at [[Fontainebleau]] on 3 September as the Oise Section, and a Channel Base Section was formed under Thrasher. Before either became operational, it was realized that each was better suited to the other's mission, so the two swapped names and roles on 15 September. At the same time the engineering section of the Brittany Base Section, which had been organized with the mission of rehabilitating ports, was transferred to the Channel Base Section. With the departure of the sections and most of the personnel from the UK, the sections there became districts, and were consolidated into the UK Base Section, under Vaughan's command.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=33\u201335}}\n\nA key element of a functional logistics system was the establishment of a series of depots. ADSEC was only authorized to maintain stocks sufficient to supply the daily needs of the armies, with its depots replenished by automatic shipment or requisitions from COMZ. The restricted size of the Normandy lodgment area necessarily resulted in a crowding of the installations, and this problem was compounded by First Army's reluctance to release dumps under its control until the end of July. First Army then became the main sufferer from the consequent logistical problems that it caused.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=493}}\n\nOnce the breakout began in earnest, the distances soon became prohibitive for the armies' own transport resources. Third Army's line of communication ran from the beaches to Laval, a {{convert|135|mi}} distant, and then to Le Mans, another {{convert|175|mi}} away. ADSEC opened a transfer point at [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] on 13 August, and then a Le Mans a week later. ADSEC hoped to develop Le Mans as a major supply area, but soon it was too far from the front. The transfer point was moved to [[Ablis]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of [[Chartres]], where another attempt was made to establish a major depot area. The transfer point remained at Ablis until 7 September, by which time Third Army was operating beyond the [[Moselle]], {{convert|200|mi}} away, although ADSEC had opened a MT80 supply point at Fontainebleau.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=494\u2013496}}\n\n===POL===\n\n[[File:POL pipelines in mid-September 1944.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|POL pipelines in mid-September 1944]]\nThe MT80 supply was adequate for the first month of Operation Cobra, although Third Army had only meager reserves and depended on daily deliveries. On 3 August it had {{convert|515000|USgal|l}} on hand, representing 1.3 days of supply. In contrast, First Army held 10.5 days of supply. In view of this disparity, action was taken to reduce First Army's excess stocks. During the week of 20\u201326 August, with both armies engaged in pursuit of the retreating Germans, consumption soared, with First Army burning {{convert|501,000|USgal|l}} per day ({{convert|282,000|USgal|l}} on 24 August alone), compared to Third Army's {{convert|350,000|USgal|l}}. Meanwhile, as the distances increased the difficulty involved in delivering POL steadily mounted. Third Army began rationing MT80. On 28 August, Third Army reported that receipts had fallen {{convert|97,510|USgal|l}} short of its {{convert|450,000|USgal|l}} requirements. Deliveries fell to {{convert|31,975|USgal|l}} on 30 August, and {{convert|25,390|USgal|l}} on 2 September. One additional source was captured fuel; {{convert|115,000|USgal|l}} was captured at [[Ch\u00e2lons-du-Maine]] on 29 and 30 August, and Third Army made use of {{convert|500,000|USgal|l}} during the pursuit. It also commandeered the fuel that Red Ball trucks needed for their return journeys, leaving convoys stranded. Yet at no stage was fuel actually in short supply; on 19 August the depots in Normandy held {{convert|27,000,000|USgal|l}} of gasoline, equivalent to twelve days of supply. The problem was one of distribution.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=504\u2013509}}\n\n[[File:Supplying Allied Forces After D Day, July 1944 B7186.jpg|thumb|left|Trucks taken on fuel]]\nThe preferred method of moving bulk POL was through pipelines. Although Cherbourg's cargo-handling facilities had been damaged or destroyed, its POL-handling facilities were largely intact. The {{convert|5000000|USbbl|l|adj=on}} of storage tanks were cleaned and put to allow them to hold MT80 instead of [[fuel oil]]. It took four weeks for the Navy to clear away the underwater obstacles and put the Digue de Quequerville, which had been the largest POL offloading point in the continent before the war, back into operation. The first elements of the Major System were installed in the form of {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on}} and {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on}} pipelines from the Digue de Quequerville to the storage tanks.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=501\u2013502}} Cherbourg handled its first POL on 26 July, and the Major System pipeline commenced operation six weeks behind schedule.

Units involved included the 358th, 359th and 368th Engineer General Service Regiments and a battalion of the 364th Engineer General Service Regiment, and nine petroleum distribution companies. Through lack of experience, the engineers were sometimes careless with the couplings or left gaps that permitted the entry or animals or into which troops threw C-ration cans. In the attempt to push the pipeline ahead as quickly as possible, the engineers did not always take the time to break through hedgerows or clear minefields, and lines were often laid along road shoulders, where they were subject to damage by motor vehicles. The line was also subject to acts of sabotage, and [[black market]]eers sometimes punched holes in it in order to steal fuel. Breaks in the line on 29 August forced truck units to draw MT80 from Saint-L\u00f4, {{convert|80|mi}} further away. Up to this point the pipeline had overriding priority, but its construction required the railway system to deliver {{convert|500|to|1500|LT|t}} of pipes, tank, pumps and fittings each day. By the end of August, one Major System MT80 pipeline had reached [[Alen\u00e7on]], another was at [[Domfront, Orne|Domfront]], and an [[avgas|MT100]] pipeline had nearly reached Domfront. By mid-September, the pipeline's priority was downgraded, and it had to rely on motor transport, limiting progress to {{convert|7|to|8|mi}} per day. The pipeline reached [[Coubert]] on 6 October, and there it remained until January 1945.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=511\u2013515}}{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=411\u2013413}}\n\nThe COMZ salvage effort was concentrated under the 202nd Quartermaster Battalion, which had three collecting and three repair companies. Combat units collected their own salvage, which was picked up at the truckheads and hauled to the salvage depots in returning ration trucks. The repair companies were static, but had mobile equipment maintenance units that visited the forward areas. The collecting companies combed the rear areas looking for abandoned equipment.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=462}} By August, a shortage of jerricans had become a critical supply problem.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=664}} Over 2 million jerricans had been discarded in Normandy.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=651\u2013652}} Major General [[Robert McGowan Littlejohn|Robert McG. Littlejohn]], the Chief Quartermaster, noted that the salvage companies and gasoline supply companies were ignoring the thousands of jerricans that littered the roads in the Le Mans area until he specifically ordered them to collect them. An even greater problem was the huge stockpiles of empty jerricans that had been abandoned at dumps when the units manning them had displaced forward.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=664}}\n\n[[File:Red Ball Express - Jerricans depot.jpg|thumb|left|Red Ball jerrican depot]]\nLittlejohn appointed Colonel Lyman R. Talbot, the chief the COMZ Petroleum and Fuel Division, as his special POL liaison officer at ADSEC,{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=651\u2013652}} with special responsibility for collecting jerricans. Since it was easier to move bulk POL to the jerrican dumps than to move the empty jerricans to the bulk POL, Littlejohn and Talbot established temporary filling points at the disused dumps.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=664}} Editorials urging that discarded cans be handed in were run in ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', the [[United States Information Service]] ran appeals in the news media, and French civilians, including children, were employed in the search for discarded jerricans. By the end of December, over one million discarded or abandoned jerricans had been recovered.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=665\u2013666}}\n\nEfforts were made to procure more jerricans. The War Office agreed to supply 221,000 per month, about half what Littlejohn estimated was required. Orders were placed in the United States, but production there had ceased, and efforts to restart it were hampered by a shortage of manpower. Shipping was also a problem, as the tonnage allocated to quartermaster items had been reduced, and Littlejohn needed shipping space for winter clothing. Jerricans had to be sent as filler or deck cargo. The number of decanting sites was reduced to minimise the reserves of cans. Finally, due to the shortage of jerricans, each army was forced to accept part of its POL allocation in bulk, or in {{convert|55|USgal|l|adj=on}} [[Drum (container)|drums]]. These weighed {{convert|412|lb}} when filled with gasoline, and were disliked by the combat troops, who had little access to handling equipment at their forward dumps, and the regarded them as inconvenient and dangerous.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=665\u2013666}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Railways in use in mid-September 1944.jpg|thumb|right||upright=1.1|Railway lines in use in mid-September 1944]]\nThe Overlord planners intended to use rail transport for most long-distance haulage. France had a good rail network, with nearly {{convert|36500|mi}} of single- and double-track lines. Like most European railway systems, the [[rolling stock]] was lightweight and loading and unloading facilities were limited, so rolling stock coming from the United States had to be specifically designed and built for the purpose of operating on the continent. Railway units were scheduled to arrive at Cherbourg, but the delay in capturing and then opening the port meant that the first units arrived over the beaches. The first rolling stock, two {{convert|150|hp|adj=on}} diesel [[locomotive]]s and some [[flatcar]]s, arrived on LCTs that were unloaded over Utah Beach on 10 July. Later that month the [[Seatrain Lines|seatrains]] USAT ''Seatrain Texas'' and USAT ''Seatrain Lakehurst'' began delivering rolling stock to Cherbourg. The port was still too badly damaged for them to be berthed, so they were unloaded in the stream, with rolling stock transferred to barges that were unloaded on the shore with the aid of mobile cranes. While the seatrains brought in the heavier equipment like locomotives and [[tank car]]s, most rolling stock arrived on LSTs fitted with rails. By 31 July, 1944, 48 diesel and steam locomotives and 184 railway cars had arrived from the United Kingdom, and another 100 steam locomotives, 1,641 freight cars, and 76 passenger cars had been captured. {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=544\u2013546}}{{sfn|Bykofsky|Larson|1957|pp=285\u2013287}}\n[[File:USAT Seatrain Texas army report.jpg|thumb|left|The transport USAT ''Seatrain Texas'']]\n\nThe commander of the 2nd Military Railway Service, Brigadier General Clarence L. Burpee, arrived in Normandy on 17 June, and by the end of July the 707th Railway Grand Division had the 720th, 728th and 729th Railway Operating Battalions and the 757th Shop Battalion operational.{{sfn|DeNevi|Hall|1992|pp=83\u201384}} French civilians were employed whenever possible. Railway operations commenced in early July. Major General Frank S. Ross, the ETO Chief of Transportation, rode the line from Cherbourg to Carentan in a jeep equipped with flanged wheels.{{sfn|Bykofsky|Larson|1957|pp=285\u2013287}} Immediately after Operation Cobra began, the 347th Engineer General Service Regiment was withdrawn from its work on the port of Cherbourg and set to work rehabilitating the railway lines, which had been badly damaged by the Allied Air Forces. It started by repairing the masonry bridge over the [[Vire River]] on the Saint-L\u00f4 line, constructing a timber trestle bridge to replace a missing span. At [[Coutances]], it replaced a missing span of a viaduct bridge. Reconstruction of the marshalling yards at Saint-L\u00f4 was a major task, as they had been almost completely destroyed.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|p=399}}\n\nOn 12 August, Third Army asked for the line to Le Mans to be opened, with {{convert|12000|LT|t}} of ammunition and POL to be delivered over the next three days. The main line eastward from Vire to Argentan was still in German hands, and the one southward to Rennes and then eastward to Le Mans could not be restored quickly because major bridge reconstruction tasks were required at Pontaubault and Laval. Instead, a temporary route was found using a series of secondary line while the main line was being repaired. Even this required some major bridge reconstruction work, notably an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} single-track bridge at [[Saint-Hilaire-du-Harcou\u00ebt]]. Elements of no less than eleven engineer general service regiments worked on the lines simultaneously. When Major General Cecil R. Moore, the ETO Chief Engineer flew over the Saint-Hilaire bridge site at 1800 on 15 August, he saw a sign on the ground in white cement that read: \"Will finish at 2000.\" The first train loaded with POL left [[Folligny]] at 1900, crossed the bridge at around midnight, and, after many delays, rolled into Le Mans on 17 August. Thirty more trains followed at half-hour intervals. {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=547}}{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=400\u2013401}}    \n\n[[File:Unloading packaged POL.jpg|thumb|right|Loading packaged POL onto a train]]\nWith only single-track lines in use, the lines between Avranches and Le Mans soon became congested, and a shortage of empty freight cars developed. The rail yards at Folligny and Le Mans were badly damaged, and considerable reconstruction work was required. Getting the main line east of Rennes in use required the repair of the bridge at Laval, which was completed by the end of the month. By mid-August, the main line to Argentan was in Allied hands, and reconstruction of that line was given a high priority, and it was in use by the end of the month. Beyond Chartres, the lines were badly damaged, as the Allied Air Forces had given particular attention to interdicting German lines of communications across the Seine. By the end of August, 18,000 men, including 5,000 prisoners of war, were working on railway reconstruction. An American train reached the rail yards at [[Batignolles]] in Paris on 30 August by using a circuitous route, but its use was initially restricted to hospital trains, and engineer supplies, and civil affairs relief. Nearly all the Seine bridges had been destroyed, and from 4 September only two or three trains per day navigated the Paris bottleneck to points beyond. Dreux and Chartres remained the forward railheads of the First and Third Armies respectively.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=547\u2013550}}\n\nBeyond the Seine, the railway network was more extensive, and damage was much lighter, as in had not been the target of air attack nearly as much as the railways in the Normandy lodgement area, and the Germans had not had time to destroy them. The main problem was shortage of rolling stock. Transfer points were established in the Paris area where Red Ball supplies were transferred to railway cars, taking some of the burden off the hard-pressed motor transport resources. By mid-September, {{convert|3400|mi}} of track had been rehabilitated and over forty bridges had been rebuilt. Lines had been opened north of Paris to [[Namur]] and [[Liege]] in Belgium to support First Army, and eastward to [[Verdun]] and [[Conflans-en-Jarnisy]] to support Third Army. By mid-September, the railways were hauling 2,000,000 ton-miles per day, and rail tonnages north of the Seine averaged only {{convert|5000|LT|t}} per day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=550\u2013553}}\n\n===Motor transport===\n[[File:G.M.C. CCKW 352.jpg|thumb|right|A [[2\u00bd-ton 6x6 truck]] ]]\n{{main|Red Ball Express}}\nWith the railways and pipelines unable to keep up with the pace of the advance, the breakout and pursuit from Normandy placed a heavy burden on ADSEC's Motor Transport Brigade. Yet even before Operation Cobra began, COMZ estimated that there would be a shortage 127 truck companies by D plus 90.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=481\u2013482}} This was a consequence of decisions made in the planning stages of Overlord. COMZ had estimated that 240 truck companies would be required, but only 160 were approved in November 1943.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=553\u2013554}} The theater was only partly responsible for this. In peacetime, the vaunted American motor vehicle industry had only produced about 600 heavy-duty trucks (defined as 4-ton vehicles or greater) a month. In July 1943, the ASF ordered 67,000 to be produced in 1944. The [[Truman Committee]] considered this wasteful and unnecessarily reducing the number of civilian trucks that could be built. Despite the political pressure, the Army pressed on with the production program, but in January 1944, only 2,788 heavy-duty trucks came off the assembly lines.{{sfn|Thomson|Mayo|1960|pp=287\u2013289}}\n\nRoss wanted two-thirds of the ETO's requested 160 companies equipped with the 10-ton semi-trailer, which was especially suitable for long-distance haulage, with the rest equipped with [[2\u00bd-ton 6x6 truck]]s for shorter inter-depot movements and clearance of railheads, but by the end of March 1944, ETO had only 66 10-ton semi-trailers instead of the 7,194 it had requested, and none of the 4,167 4- or 5-ton truck tractors. In April, the War Department attempted to meet the requirements by taking hundreds of trucks of miscellaneous types from the ASF, [[Army Ground Forces]] and [[Army Air Forces]] in the United States, and ASF diverted 1,750 4- and 5-ton truck tractors and 3,500 5-ton semi-trailers earmarked for the [[Ledo Road]] project in Burma to the ETO.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=553\u2013555}}\n\n[[File:Red Ball 1944 september 20-fr.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Red Ball and Red Lion express routes, 20 September]]\nThe tardy delivery of vehicles affected the training of the personnel of motor transport units. As with many other service units, the ETO had been compelled to accept partially trained units in the hope of their being able to complete their training in the UK. The late arrival of vehicles meant that this training could not get under way until May 1944. In August 1943 the [[Transportation Corps]] requested that each truck company be allocated an additional 36 drivers, bringing them up to 96 per company, so there would be two per vehicle, allowing the trucks to be operated around the clock. ETOUSA has disapproved this, which it regarded as unnecessary, but nonetheless the Transportation Corps had persisted, and in early 1944 Lee had approved the proposal.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=556\u2013557}}\n\nBut by this time the War Department had established a troop ceiling for the ETO, and would not provide the additional personnel without corresponding cuts elsewhere, so the 5,600 men to provide an additional 40 drivers for 140 companies had to be obtained from other SOS units. Lee sternly warned that he would not countenance this being used as an excuse to rid units of undesirables. Whether this admonition worked is debatable, but insufficient numbers of personnel were provided, so in May 1944, fourteen African-American truck companies had their personnel transferred to other African-American units. The intention was to replace them with Caucasian personnel, but the numbers were not made available. Instead, two engineer general service regiments were temporarily converted to truck units. The cost of inadequate training of truck drivers would be paid in avoidable damage to vehicles through accidents and poor maintenance.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=556\u2013557}}\n\n[[File:Convoy Red Ball Express.jpg|thumb|right|Red Ball Express Convoy passes a broken-down vehicle]]\nOn 10 August, two companies of 45-ton tank transporters were converted to cargo carriers. A few days later, the 55 truck companies equipped with 2\u00bd-ton 6x6 trucks were each given ten additional trucks, and three British truck companies were borrowed from the 21st Army Group. The situation became acute with the decision to continue the pursuit across the Seine. COMZ estimated that this require {{convert|100000|LT|t}} of supplies (excluding POL) to be delivered to the Chartres-Dreux area by 1 September. Of this, the railways could deliver only {{convert|18000|LT|t}}, leaving {{convert|82000|LT|t}} to be hauled by the Motor Transport Brigade. It was immediately realized that this would require an extraordinary effort.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=558\u2013564}}\n\nThe solution adopted was the [[Red Ball Express]], a term appropriated from the railways. The plan called for a one-way highway loop running around the clock. This expedient had never been attempted before and the procedures for operating it were untried. Routes were marked with Red Ball markers. Convoys moved at a maximum speed of {{convert|25|mph}} with {{convert|60|yd}} between each vehicle and no overtaking was permitted. An hourly ten-minute break was taken at ten minutes before the hour. Opposition from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was absent, permitting the use of lights at night. In practice, convoy discipline, especially with regard to speed limits, was not always followed, and a shortage of it proved impossible to reserve the routes for the exclusive use of the Red Ball Express, resulting in their also being used by the First and Third Armies and the [[United States Air Forces Central Command|Ninth Air Force]], with military and civilian vehicles sometimes attempting to move against the Red Ball traffic. Red Ball convoys commenced on 25 August, and reached their peak on 29 August when 132 companies with 5,958 vehicles delivered {{convert|12342|LT|t}} of supplies. The deadline was not met, but by 5 September {{convert|89000|LT|t}} had been delivered to the Dreux-Chartres area.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=558\u2013564}}\n\n[[File:Red Ball Express Regulating Point.jpg|thumb|left|A Red Ball Express convoy moves through a regulating point]]\nAlthough this ended its original mission, the Red Ball Express continued to operate until the end of September, with deliveries further afield to [[Soissons]] and [[Hirson]] in support of First Army and Fontainebleu and [[Sommesous]] in support of Third Army.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=567}} From 16 September to 12 October, eight companies, six of which were equipped with 2\u00bd-ton 6x6 trucks and two with 10-ton semi-trailers, were withdrawn from the Red Ball Express to run a series of Red Lion convoys. These delivered {{convert|18000|LT|t}} to the 21st Army Group, half of which went to the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The eight companies were replaced by provisional companies formed from the personnel and vehicles of the newly-arrived [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[95th Infantry Division (United States)|95th]], and [[104th Infantry Division (United States)|104th Infantry Divisions]].{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=139\u2013140}}  \n\nThe achievements of the Red Ball Express came at a high price. It consumed {{convert|300000|USgal|l}} of MT80 a day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=509}} Drivers drove their vehicles at twice the {{convert|25|mi}} speed limit, and trucks carried double their nominal loads. The practice of overloading vehicles had the official sanction of the War Department, but testing of this had been carried out at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and conditions in France were more grueling. Consumption of the most common type of tire, the 750 x 20 8-ply, rose from an average of 29,142 per month from June to August to 55,059 in September. By 9 October, there were only 2,000 spares on the continent and 46,596 left in the UK. Nearly two thirds of the loss of tires was attributable to running over carelessly discarded C-ration cans that littered the roads. Vehicles were run without proper maintenance, and dry batteries, lack of oil and loose nuts and bolts caused breakdowns. Driver fatigue was also a factor; round trips sometimes went for 48 to 65 hours. In one convoy, eight semi-trailers hauling gasoline went over an embankment. The following day, eight 2\u00bd-ton trucks repeated this feat at the same location. Ordnance personnel noted instances of vehicles that had been sabotaged. By the end of September, 5,750 vehicles required major repairs.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=571}}{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=131}}\n\n===Air supply===\nAlthough fast and flexible, air supply had many disadvantages, the main one being low tonnage capacity, but the variable availability of transport aircraft, their vulnerability to enemy fighters, and their susceptibility to bad weather were also limiting factors. [[Airdrop]]ping was seldom used in the early stages of the Normandy campaign. Airdrops were made in support of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions in the first days, to a field hospital on 8 June, and to an anti-aircraft unit isolated by the June storm.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=572\u2013573}} On 10 and 11 August the 2nd Battalion, [[120th Infantry Regiment (United States)|120th Infantry]], isolated by the [[Operation L\u00fcttich|German counterattack at Mortain]], received supplies by air drop.{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=489}} Only one administrative airfield was available by the end of July, at [[Colleville-sur-Mer]] near Omaha Beach.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=575}} Cross-Channel air flights commenced on 10 June.{{sfn|Cosmas|Cowdrey|1992|pp=256\u2013257}} Air supply was heavily used during the week after the storm, with {{convert|1400|LT|t}} of supplies, mostly ammunition, landed.

On 15 August, SHAEF made available an allocation of air transport capable of delivering up to {{convert|2000|LT|t}} per day to the Le Mans area. Deliveries to a newly-opened air field there began on 19 August. Due to bad weather and problems with the airfield, an average of {{convert|600|LT|t}} per day was delivered over the following week. By 22 August, there were 383 fully-loaded [[C-47]] transport aircraft in the UK awaiting despatch. The problem was a lack of suitable landing fields. Rehabilitating captured German airfields or building new one required the movement of engineer stores using scarce motor transport. 12th Army Group allocated {{convert|2100|LT|t}} per day to such stores during the pursuit, but the Ninth Air Force gave priority to forward fighter airfields.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=575\u2013576}} The early capture of Paris on 25 August forced Eisenhower to allocate {{convert|500|LT|t}} per day to civil relief supplies, mainly food, medical supplies and soap.{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=626}}\n\nDeliveries by air peaked at {{convert|2900|LT|t}} (including {{convert|500|LT|t}} to Paris) on 26 and 27 August, but then tailed off as the C-47s were withdrawn for airborne operations on 29 August. To make up for them, the [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] made 100 B-24 aircraft available, which had to be modified to carry cargo, but these required longer air fields and increased intervals between landings. During the week of 27 August to 2 September, {{convert|4470|LT|t}} was delivered by air, of which {{convert|443|LT|t}} was carried by B-24s, but only {{convert|1877|LT|t}} was delivered to the 12th Army Group; {{convert|917|LT|t}} went to 21st Army Group and {{convert|1676|LT|t}} to Paris. On 3 September, SHAEF ordered the [[First Allied Airborne Army]] to release 600 C-47s for air supply duties. On 14 September they were again withdrawn, for [[Operation Market Garden]].

Many of the mines were of a delayed action kind that only became active after a set number of days. Eight acoustic and eight magnetic sweeps were conducted every morning for 85 days. By 13 July, 133 mines had been swept, of which 86 were magnetic or acoustic. This did not include the small concrete-encased \"Katie mines\" sown in shallow waters that had to be removed by divers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Melia|first=Tamara Moser|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=lg3KpfzC2BoC&dq=damn%20the%20torpedoes&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q=katie&f=false|title=Damn the Torpedoes: A Short History of U.S. Naval Mine Countermeasures, 1777-1991|date=1991|publisher=Naval Historical Center, Department of the Navy|year=|isbn=978-0-945274-07-0|location=|pages=58|language=en}}</ref> Three minesweepers were lost to mines, as were some small craft and barges.{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=70}}{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=216\u2013218}} The first four Liberty ships entered the Grande Rade in 16 July, and were unloaded at anchor into DUKWS.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=352\u2013353}}  \n\n[[File:Cherbourg 1944-Gare Maritime-2.jpg|thumb|left|Destruction at the Gare Maritime at Cherbourg]]\nThe 332nd Engineer General Service Regiment filled in the craters in the Digue du Homet, and repaired the road and railway lines leading to it. Two berths were prepared for Twickenham ferries, British vessels built to carry locomotives and rolling stock. The first arrived on 29 July with several {{convert|65|LT|t|adj=on}} diesel electric locomotives and rolling stock. The first Liberty ship docked there on 9 August. Getting the naval base working to accommodate Liberty ships involved repairing demolished bridges. It ultimately provided eleven berths for Liberty ships. The wreckage of the Gare Maritime was found to contain twenty-four freight cars loaded with mines that the German had apparently not had time to detonate. These were carefully deactivated and removed. On 10 August, the [[U.S. Army Engineer Port Repair ship|port repair ship]] ''[[Junior N. Van Noy (ship)|Junior N. Van Noy]]'', a converted [[Great Lakes]] steamer named after [[Junior Van Noy]], an engineer posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] in the [[Battle of Finschhafen]], arrived with specialized salvage equipment. An access channel to the Darse Transatlantique was cleared of debris and mines by 18 September, and the first Liberty ship docked there on 8 October.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=352\u2013353}} By September, Cherbourg was the second largest port supporting the US forces after [[Marseilles]]. Between 16 July and the end of the war, it handled 2,137 ships, which discharged {{convert|2816740|LT|t}} of cargo and 130,210 passengers. In addition, 307,939 passengers were embarked, including 124,206 German prisoners of war and 148,753 wounded Allied soldiers.{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=216\u2013218}}\n\n[[File:Cherbourg1944-Pont.jpg|thumb|right|Partially demolished bridge in Cherbourg]]\nThe first port captured in the breakout was [[Granville]] on 31 July. Like Cherbourg, it had been subject to systematic demolition, with quays cratered, cranes tipped into the water, and the harbor blocked with sunken craft. Rehabilitation was undertaken by the 1055th and 1058th Port Construction and Repair Groups. It was operated solely as a coal port, and averaged {{convert|1244|LT|t}} per day from when it was opened on 18 September until it closed on 21 April 1945. [[Rouen]] on the tidal [[Seine]] was captured on 30 August, but was not usable until downstream [[Le Havre]] was taken on 12 September. Le Havre, the second largest port on France, was heavily damaged not just by German demolitions but by Allied land, sea and aerial bombardment. Moreover, an American line of communications from Le Havre would cross that of the British. Accordingly, it was decided not to attempt its complete rehabilitation. The first vessels entered Le Havre on 2 October, but mines and obstructions limited it to landing craft and coasters until 13 October, when the first Liberty ship was able to dock. Coasters carrying POL began discharging at Rouen on 15 October. [[Antwerp]], one of the world's largest ports, was captured largely intact on 4 September, but could not be used until the [[Scheldt]] estuary was cleared and the sluice gates were repaired. The first American Liberty ship did not dock there until 28 November.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=359\u2013364}}\n\n==Outcome==\nOn 4 September, the commander of the 21st Army Group, British [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], put a proposal to Eisenhower. He contended that a simultaneous advance on both the [[Ruhr]] and the [[Saarland|Saar]] regions, as contemplated in the original Overlord plan, was not logistically feasible. He therefore recommended that the maximum resources be concentrated on the advance on the Ruhr, and then towards Berlin, which could best be supported, and was most likely to produce results. In his response the following day, Eisenhower rejected this. Contending that the bulk of the German army in the West had been destroyed, and that an advance on Berlin was logistically infeasible, he decided to continue with the original plan and advance on a broad front, capturing both the Ruhr and the Saar. Eisenhower suggested that the ports of Le Havre and Antwerp would be opened during the advance,{{sfn|Rawson|2012|pp=138\u2013139}} but the former was not yet in Allied hands, and while the latter had been captured on 4 September,{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=686}} it was not expected to be opened before 1 November.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1951|p=8}} This became known as the broad front controversy, and was the subject of much debate in the post-war years.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1960|p=420}}\n\n[[File:Ardennes Allied Commanders, Maastricht meeting, 7 Dec 1944 (02).jpg|thumb|left|Senior Allied commanders.

Simpson|Simpson]] ]]\nSubsequent events demonstrated that Eisenhower's decision was the wrong one; the German army in the West was not destroyed and neither the Ruhr nor the Saar was reached in 1944. It is possible that the Ruhr would have been reached had Montgomery's proposal been adopted. The British axis in the north involved an advance of {{convert|105|to|115|mi}}. It could be supported by ports that were captured such as [[Dieppe]], [[Boulogne]] and [[Ostend]], and there were good rail links that supplied much of 21st Army Group's needs.{{sfn|Dick|2016|pp=296\u2013297}} Bradley and Patton advocated an advance on the Saar that ignored logistical considerations. They contended that this southern axis was less well defended than the northern one, and there was good reason for that. It would have captured no ports, and its support would have depended almost entirely on an extended version of the Red Ball Express. Given the strain on personnel and the wear and tear on vehicles, this would have been difficult to sustain. Acts of sabotage were likely as the advance entered Germany, as was interference by the ''Luftwaffe'' once it was beyond the range of fighter cover.{{sfn|Dick|2016|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nLieutenant Colonel Harold L. Mack, who served on the COMZ staff, described the failure to implement Operation Chastity as the \"Critical Error of World War II\",{{sfn|Mack|1981|pp=1\u20133}} but historian [[Russell Weigley]] regarded the commitment to Brittany as wasteful of resources that would have been better spent supporting the drive to the east. Although Bradley's decision entailed grave risk, the US Army's logistical difficulties in the pursuit were not a result of inadequate port resources\u2014in November there were still some {{convert|600000|LT|t}} of supplies stockpiled in the Normandy lodgment area. Rather, the problem was the inability to deliver them.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=292}} Nor was the pursuit halted solely by a shortage of POL. The pursuit resulted in large quantities of equipment being damaged, worn out, and written off. In November, SHAEF reported to the War Department that each month, 700 mortars, 375 medium and 125 light tanks, 900 2\u00bd-ton trucks, 1,500 jeeps, and 100 artillery pieces had been written off. Tank losses in August and September respectively had been 25.3 percent and 16.5 percent of establishment, and the reserves were exhausted. Over 15,000 vehicles were deadlined, awaiting repairs or parts.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=292}}\n\nWhen the army commanders and their staffs ran into foreseeable logistical difficulties, they blamed each other, they blamed COMZ, and they blamed the British.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=292}} In December 1944, Somervell sent Lieutenant General [[LeRoy Lutes]], the ASF director of operations, to study the ETO's difficulties. He found that the army commanders had little confidence in COMZ, and that they had little logistical acumen. Lutes credited the commander of the [[Ninth United States Army|Ninth Army]], Lieutenant General [[William H. Simpson]], with the best understanding of logistics.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=348\u2013349}} Lutes noted that the First Army commander, Lieutenant General [[Courtney Hodges]], was \"a man intolerant of supply shortcomings, who has not studied supply and does not intend to\".{{sfn|Hogan|2000|p=165}} Given that Bradley, Hodges, Patton and Simpson had all attended the [[Command and General Staff College]] and [[United States Army War College|Army War College]],{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|pp=30, 153, 252, 297}} this pointed to a deficiency in the Army's training of senior officers.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=348\u2013349}}\n\nA great victory had been won, but there remained a lingering impression that even more could have been accomplished, given the resources available. The supply shortages that occurred were not invariably the fault of COMZ; many had their origins back in the United States. Nonetheless, the logistical plan lacked the flexibility needed to cope with a rapidly changing operational situation. This was exacerbated by senior commanders subordinating logistical imperatives to operational opportunities. This was exacerbated by the poor supply discipline of the American soldier.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=164\u2013165}} The decision to continue the pursuit beyond the Seine had long-term and far-reaching effects in the form of the attrition of equipment, failure to establish a proper supply depot system, neglect of the development of ports, and inadequate stockpiles in forward areas. These factors would be keenly felt over the months to come.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=509}} Historian Roland Ruppenthal concluded that in the end, \"operations, to paraphrase an old maxim, had definitely become the art of the logistically feasible.\"{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1960|p=428}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Albrecht |first=Frank M. |title=Engineer Aspects of Operation Bolero |journal=The Military Engineer |volume=42 |issue=286 |date=March\u2013April 1950 |pages=116\u2013120 |jstor=44561081 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last = Ancell |first = R.

The [[United States Army Services of Supply|Services of Supply]] (SOS) was formed in May 1942 under the command of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[John C. H. Lee]] to provide logistical support. From February 1944 on, SOS was increasingly referred to as the Communications Zone (COMZ). Between May 1942 and May 1944, [[Operation Bolero]], the buildup of American troops and supplies in the UK, proceeded fitfully, and by June 1944 1,526,965 US troops were in the UK, of whom 459,511 were part of the COMZ.   \n\nThe [[First United States Army]] was supported over the [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]] and [[Utah Beach]]es, and through the [[Operation Mulberry|Mulberry artificial port]] specially constructed for the purpose, but the American Mulberry was abandoned after it was damaged by a storm on 19 June. During the first seven weeks after D-Day, the advance was much slower than the Operation Overlord plan had anticipated, and the [[lodgement|lodgment]] area much smaller. The nature of the fighting in the Normandy hedgerows created shortages of certain items, particularly artillery and mortar ammunition, and there was unexpectedly high rates of loss of [[bazooka]]s, [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifles]] (BARs), and [[M7 grenade launcher]]s.\n\nOn 25 July, the [[First United States Army|US First Army]] began [[Operation Cobra]], the break-out from Normandy. The advance was much faster than expected and the rapid increase in the length of the [[line of communications]] threw up unanticipated logistical challenges. The logistical plan lacked the flexibility needed to cope with the rapidly changing operational situation, and the rehabilitation of railways and construction of pipelines could not keep up with the pace of the advance. Major shortages developed, particularly of petrol, oil and lubricants (POL). Motor transport was used as a stopgap, and the Advance Section ([[ADSEC]]) organized the [[Red Ball Express]], which delivered supplies from the Normandy lodgment area, but at great cost in wear and tear, and accidental damage.   \n\nSenior commanders subordinated logistical imperatives to operational opportunities. The decision to abandon plans to develop the ports of Brittany left the American forces with only the port of Cherbourg and the Normandy beaches for their maintenance; that to continue the pursuit beyond the [[Seine]] had long-term and far-reaching effects. The attrition of equipment, failure to establish a proper supply depot system, neglect of the development of ports, inadequate stockpiles in forward areas, the shortage of POL, and increased German resistance stalled the American advance. The difficulties were exacerbated by the poor supply discipline of the American soldier. While the logistical system had facilitated a great victory, these factors would be keenly felt.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Headquarters, ETO, at 20 Grosvenor Square, London.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters, ETO, at 20 Grosvenor Square, London]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the United States had developed and periodically updated [[War Plan Black]] for the possibility of a war with Germany. Planning began in earnest at the [[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1 Conference]] in [[Washington, DC]], in January to March 1941, where agreement was reached with the UK and Canada on a [[Europe first]] strategy in the event of the US being forced into a war with both Germany and Japan.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=1}} A US military mission to the UK called the Special Observer Group (SPOBS) was formed under the command of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[James E. Chaney]], a [[United States Army Air Corps]] officer who had been stationed in the UK since October 1940 to observe air operations. Chaney opened SPOBS headquarters at the [[Embassy of the United States, London|US Embassy]] at [[1 Grosvenor Square]], London, on 19 May 1941, and moved it across the street to 20 [[Grosvenor Square]] two days later. Henceforth, Grosvenor Square would be the hub of American activity in the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nIn the wake of the American entry into [[World War II]] in December 1941, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] activated the [[United States Army Forces in the British Isles]] (USAFBI) under Chaney's command on 8 January 1942.{{sfn|Pogue|1954|p=99}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=21\u201322}} Under the ABC-1 and [[Rainbow 5]] war plans, the United States would participate in the defense of the UK,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=32\u201333}} but the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[George C. Marshall]] had a larger role in mind. In April 1942, Marshall and [[Harry L. Hopkins]], the advisor to the [[President of the United States|president]], visited the UK, and obtained the approval of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] for [[Operation Bolero]], the buildup of US forces in the UK with the aim of eventually mounting a cross-channel attack. With this prospect in mind, Chaney asked the War Department for personnel to form a Services of Supply (SOS) command.{{sfn|Osmanski|1949a|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Regional Organization of SOS in the United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|left|Regional Organization of SOS in the United Kingdom]]\nChaney's proposed SOS organizational structure did not meet with the approval of the War Department. On 9 March 1942, Marshall had conducted a sweeping reorganization that had consolidated logistical functions in the US under the [[United States Army Services of Supply]] (USASOS), headed by Major General [[Brehon B. Somervell]]. Chaos had resulted during [[World War I]] because the organization of the SOS in France was different from that of the War Department, and an important lesson of that war was the need for the theater SOS organization to parallel that in the United States.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=4}} Marshall and Somervell wanted it led by someone familiar with the new organization, and selected Major General [[John C. H. Lee]]. Each branch head in Somervell's headquarters was asked to nominate its best two men, one of whom was selected by Somervell and Lee for Lee's SOS headquarters, while the other remained in Washington. Lee held the first meeting of his new staff on 16 May, before departing for the UK on 23 May, and Chaney formally activated SOS the following day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=33\u201337}}\n\nOn 8 June 1942, the War Department upgraded USAFBI to the status of a [[theater of war]], becoming the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army]] (ETOUSA). Chaney was recalled to the US, and replaced by the chief of the Operations Division at the War Department, Major General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=4}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=42\u201343}} Accommodation for the SOS headquarters was initially provided in an apartment building at No 1 [[Great Cumberland Place]] in London, but something larger was required. Brigadier General Claude N. Thiele, the SOS Chief of Administrative Services, found {{convert|500000|sqft}} of office space in [[Cheltenham]], a [[spa town]] {{convert|90|mi}} northwest of London. Intended as an evacuation point for the British [[War Office]] in the event that London had to be evacuated, the staff stationed there were in the process of moving back to London. The site had adequate road, rail and signal communications, but the distance from London was a disadvantage. Lee opened SOS headquarters in Cheltenham on 25 July.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=81\u201383}}\n\nLee announced a regional organization of SOS on 20 July. It was divided into base commands corresponding to the British Army's territorial commands. The Northern Island Base Section, under Brigadier General Leroy P. Collins, with its headquarters at [[Belfast]], included all of [[Northern Ireland]]; the Western Base Section, under Davison, had its headquarters at [[Chester]], and corresponded to the British Army's [[Scottish Command|Scottish]] and [[Western Command (United Kingdom)|Western Command]]s; the Eastern Base Section, under Colonel Cecil R. Moore, with its headquarters at [[Watford]], corresponded to the British [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern]] and [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Commands]]; and the Southern Base Section, under Colonel Charles O. Thrasher, with its headquarters at [[Wilton, Wiltshire]], corresponded to the British [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern]] and [[South Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|South Eastern Command]]s.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=83\u201386}} A London Base Command was created under the command of Brigadier General Pleas B. Rogers on 21 March 1943.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=162}} Over time each of the base sections acquired its own character, with the Western Base Section principally concerned with the reception of troops and supplies, the Eastern with supporting the Air Force, and the Southern with hosting marshalling and training areas.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=6}} The doctrinal concept behind the base section concept was of \"centralized control and decentralized operation\", but reconciling the two proved difficult in practice.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n==Planning and preparations==\n[[File:General Depot at Ashchurch.jpg|thumb|right|General Depot at [[Ashchurch]], north of Cheltenham. Originally developed as a British automotive depot, this was handed over to SOS in 1942. It consisted of 158 buildings, including 10 hangers and three warehouses. About 5,000 US personnel worked there.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=155\u2013156}}]]\n===Bolero===\n{{main|Operation Bolero}}\nBolero was derailed by the decision taken at the Second Claridge Conference in July 1942 to abandon the proposed 1942 cross-channel attack ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]) in favor of an invasion of French Northwest Africa ([[Operation Torch]]). This made the prospective 1943 cross-channel attack ([[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]]) unlikely,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=89}} but it died hard in the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=104}} Doubtful that sufficient shipping was available to support both Bolero and Torch, Somervell ordered all construction work in the UK to cease, except on airfields, {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=104}} but the British government went ahead with the construction plan anyway, using materials and labor supplied under [[Reverse Lend-Lease]]. After the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943, American resources became available again. Eventually, the works completed included {{convert|6,489,335|sqft|0}} of covered storage, {{convert|37,915,645|sqft|0}} of open storage and hard standings, and facilities for storage of {{convert|169,320|LT}} of petrol, oil and lubricants (POL).{{sfn|Albrecht|1950|p=119}}\n\nRoundup was not carried out, but Bolero survived, strengthened by the decision at the [[Trident Conference]] to mount the cross-channel attack with a target date of 1 May 1944. The planners at Trident envisioned shipping 1.3 million US troops to the UK by that date. Effecting this depended on the ability of the ports in the UK handling up to 150 ships per month.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=120\u2013121}} Progress was disappointing, but record shipments of men in the last quarter of the year boosted the strength of ETOUSA to 773,753 by the end of 1943, of whom 220,200 were in the SOS.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=132}}\n\nTo take advantage of the longer daylight hours of summer, a system of preshipment was instituted, whereby unit equipment was shipped to the UK in advance of the units. Rather than lose training time packing all its equipment, personnel could sail to the UK, and draw a new set of equipment there. The major obstacle to the idea was that not all commodities were available in surplus in the US. Indeed the [[Army Service Forces]] (ASF), as USASOS had been renamed on 12 March 1943,{{sfn|Millett|1954||p=1}} had difficulty filling the available shipping. Of {{convert|1012000|MTON|abbr=off}} of cargo space available in July, only {{convert|780000|MTON|abbr=off}} were used; of {{convert|1122000|MTON|abbr=off}} available in August, only {{convert|730000|MTON|abbr=off}}. Of the {{convert|2304000|MTON|abbr=off}} shipped in May through August, 39 percent was preshipped cargo. This rose to {{convert|457868|MTON|abbr=off}} or 54 percent of the {{convert|850000|MTON|abbr=off}} shipped in November, but most of this was consumed re-equipping three of the four divisions transferred from NATOUSA.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=132\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:US built locomotives stockpiled in Wales for Operation Overlord.jpg|thumb|left|US built locomotives stockpiled in Wales for Operation Overlord]]\nThe main points of entry for US cargo were the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey River]] ports, and those of the [[Bristol Channel]]; ports on the south and east coasts of the UK were subject to attack by German aircraft and submarines, and were avoided until late 1943, when shipments began to exceed the capacity of the other ports. The Clyde ports of [[Glasgow]], [[Greenock]] and [[Gourock]] were remote from the main supply depots, but were used as the main debarkation points for US troops, accounting for 873,163 (52 percent) of the 1,671,010 US personnel arrivals, but only {{convert|1138000|MTON|abbr=off}} (8 percent) of cargo.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=146\u2013149}} The majority of troops travelled across the Atlantic on [[ocean liner]]s like the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth||6}} and {{RMS|Queen Mary||2}}. Marking three round-trip voyages per month carrying up to 15,000 passengers each time, these two liners alone carried 24 percent of troops arrivals. They were supplemented by other liners, including the {{RMS|Aquitania||6}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1938|2}}, and the {{SS|\u00cele de France||6}}, {{SS|Nieuw Amsterdam|1937|2}} and {{SS|Bergensfjord||2}}, which accounted for another 36 percent.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=235}} The troops debarked into [[ship's tender]]s, and boarded quayside trains to their destinations.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=146\u2013149}}\n\nThe Bristol Channel ports of [[Swansea]], [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Avonmouth]], and the Mersey ports of [[Liverpool]], [[Garston, Liverpool|Garston]], [[Manchester]] and [[Birkenhead]] handled {{convert|9750000|MTON|abbr=off}} (70 percent) of the cargo brought to the UK, including most of the heavy items like tanks, artillery pieces and ammunition. This was not accomplished without difficulty; most of the cargo handling eq1uipment was old and outdated, and it was not possible to follow the standard US practice of moving goods from the quayside on [[pallet]]s with [[forklift]]s. [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom]] opposed the use of military labor except when civilian labor was unavailable, but this ban was lifted when the volume of cargo became too great, and by May 1944 fifteen US port battalions were working the UK ports {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=146\u2013149}}\n\n[[File:Tenders alongside the RMS Queen Elizabeth.jpg|thumb|right|Tenders alongside the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth||6}} at [[Gourock]], Scotland.]]\nSOS found the textbook concept of shipping cargo from the port to distribution centers, sorting it there, and despatching it to branch depots too extravagant in its use of scarce depot space and the overburdened British railway system. Moreover shipping [[manifest (transportation)|manifests]] were often found to be incomplete, inaccurate or illegible, and despite being sent by air mail somehow still frequently failed to arrive in advance of the cargo. SOS ultimately persuaded a reluctant ASF to accept a system whereby every item shipped was individually labelled with a requisition number that provided a complete UK destination address.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=139\u2013141}}\n\nThe railways were used to move cargo wherever possible, as the narrow rural roads and village streets of rural England were not conducive to use by large trucks, but as cargo volumes increased, road transport had to be resorted to, and in the eight months from October 1943 to May 1944, trucks carried {{convert|1000000|LT|t}}, or about a third of the cargo from the ports. The railways had challenges of their own, with limited head room and tunnel clearances that impeded the carriage of bulky items like tanks. Locomotives were in short supply and in 1942 the British railways arranged for 400 [[2-8-0]] locomotives to be shipped from the US under Lend-Lease. The order was later increased to 900, and in 1943 they arrived at a rate of fifty per month.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=149\u2013152}}\n\nThe US buildup in the UK was largely accomplished in first five months of 1944. In this period, an additional 752,663 troops arrived, bringing the total theater strength to 1,526,965. Of these, 459,511 were in the SOS.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=231\u2013233}} Some {{convert|6,106,500|MTON|abbr=off}} of cargo arrived in the same period. Clearing it involved running 100 special freight trains with up to 20,000 loaded cars each week. The limit on ship arrivals was raised from 109 to 120 in March, then to 140. Shipments in excess of the previously agreed limits were possible only because of the postponement of the invasion date from May to June.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=235\u2013238}} This postponement, primary to gain extra month's production of landing craft to effect the enlarged landing plan,{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=43}} cost a month in which the weather over the English Channel was the best it had been in forty years. May was also the month when the Germans sowed [[Cherbourg Harbor]] with [[Parachute mine|oyster mines]].{{sfn|Osmanski|1950|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nThe pressure on the UK transportation system became acute in May as Overlord commenced and the troops began moving to their staging areas. By 18 May SOS was forced to inform the [[New York Port of Embarkation]] that no more than 120 ships could be accepted. By this time the New York Port of Embarkation had a backlog of {{convert|540000|MTON|abbr=off}} of cargo and a deficit of 61 ships that were required to move it. This left the [[Third US Army]] with only 60 percent of its wheeled vehicles.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=235\u2013238}}\n\n===Organization===\nA separate [[North African Theater of Operations]] (NATOUSA) was created under Eisenhower on 6 February 1943, and Lieutenant General [[Frank M. Andrews]] succeeded him at ETOUSA. Andrews had SOS headquarters moved back to London, but his tenure in command was brief, as he was killed in an air crash on 3 May 1943. He was replaced by Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]].{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=7\u20139}} The British had already activated the [[21st Army Group]] in July 1943, and Devers prevailed on the War Department to authorize American counterparts.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=89}} The [[First United States Army Group]] was activated on 16 October 1943,{{sfn|Harrison|1951|p=115}} with its headquarters at [[Bryanston Square]] in London. Devers had Lieutenant General [[Omar N. Bradley]] reassigned to ETOUSA to command it. Bradley commanded both the First Army Group and the [[First United States Army]] (FUSA), which opened its headquarters in [[Bristol]] on 20 October,{{sfn|Hogan|2000|p=26}} and assumed control of all US ground forces in the UK three days later.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=191}}\n\nAn outcome of the 1943 [[Casablanca Conference]] was that in April 1943 the British Chiefs of Staff designated British [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Frederick E. Morgan]] as the Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander, with the immediate mission of planning the cross-channel operation, codenamed [[Operation Overlord]]. The staff he gathered around him became known by his own abbreviation, COSSAC.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=175\u2013177}} Eisenhower returned to the UK on 16 January 1944, and became the Supreme Allied Commander. COSSAC was absorbed into his new headquarters, known as the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF). Eisenhower also took over ETOUSA, but tended to rely on his SHAEF staff.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=13}} With the formation of SHAEF and FUSAG, ETOUSA lost most of its roles, and was consolidated with SOS.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=195\u2013202}}\n\nFrom February 1944 on, SOS was increasingly referred to as the Communications Zone (COMZ),{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=206}} although this did not become official until 7 June.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=457}} On 9 February SHAEF ordered FUSAG and COMZ to supply American liaison elements to 21st Army Group, which would control the First Army in the opening stages of Operation Overlord. ETOUSA had already activated its element two days before as the Forward Echelon, Communications Zone (FECOMZ). Brigadier General Harry B. Vaughan, the Western Base Section commander, was appointed to command it, with Colonel Frank M. Albrecht as his chief of staff.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=15}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=207\u2013208}}\n\nAnother organization activated on 7 February, far more important as it turned out, was the Advance Section ([[ADSEC]]), under the command of Colonel Ewart G. Plank. Experience in Italy had demonstrated the value of a logistical agency that worked closely with the army it was supporting. ADSEC would take over the operation of base areas, supply dumps and communications from FUSA as it moved forward. In the initial stages of Overlord, ADSEC would be attached to FUSA.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=211\u2013213}} COMZ also began organizing base sections for service in France. In March the five districts of the Eastern Base Section were consolidated into one, which became the VIII District of the Western Base Section in April. On 1 May, Base Section No. 1 was activated under the command of Colonel Roy W. Growler. The new section was held in readiness for service in Brittany. On 1 June Base Section No. 2, under the command of Brigadier General Leroy P. Collins, was activated.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=216\u2013218}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe logistical planners saw the campaign unfolding in three stages. In the first, an automatic supply system would be used, with materiel despatched on a predetermined schedule. In the second stage, which would occur after a lodgment was secured and supply depots began functioning, the system would become semi-automatic, with items like ammunition shipped on the basis of status reports. In the third stage, which would occur when the major ports were opened and the supply system was functioning smoothly, all items would be sent on requisition. In the event, the war ended before the third stage was achieved.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=29}}\n\n[[File:The Chastity Plan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Chastity plan]]\nSince the first three months of supply shipments were determined in advance, and the first two weeks already loaded on ships, three expedients were prepared to cover unanticipated shortfalls. The first was codenamed the \"Red Ball Express\". Starting on D plus 3, {{convert|100|MTON|abbr=off}} per day was set aside for emergency requests. Such shipments would be expedited. The second, codenamed \"Greenlight\", provided for {{convert|600|MTON|abbr=off}} of ammunition and engineer equipment to be substituted for scheduled shipments of engineer supplies. This would become available from D plus 14 onwards, and Greenlight supplies would take up to six days for delivery. Finally, supplied were packed with parachutes for aerial delivery to isolated units, and plans were made for the delivery of{{convert|6000|lb|abbr=off}} of supplies per day by air once airfields had been secured, with 48 hours warning.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nLogistical support of the armies on the continent depended on the capture and repair of ports. Plans were drawn up for the rehabilitation of eighteen ports in Normandy and Brittany. The task was assigned to port construction and repair (PC & R) groups. Each had a headquarters and headquarters company with specialists trained in port reconstruction, and a pool of heavy construction equipment with operators, which were supplemented by engineer troops and civilians, dump truck companies, port repair ships and dredges. Seven ports were expected to be captured and opened in the first four weeks: [[Isigny-sur-Mer]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Grandcamp-Maisy|Grandcamp]], [[Saint-Vaast-sur-Seulles]], [[Barfleur]], [[Granville, Manche|Granville]] and [[Saint-Malo]]. Except for Cherbourg, all were small and tidal, and unable to berth vessels drawing more than {{convert|14|to|15|ft}} at high water, which ruled out larger vessels. Much therefore depended on the early opening of Cherbourg, which was expected to occur by D plus 11, and was expected to handle {{convert|6000|MTON|abbr=off}} per day by D plus 30, and {{convert|8000|MTON|abbr=off}} per day by D plus 90, more than the other six ports combined.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=286\u2013290}}\n\nIn the longer term, the US forces would rely on the ports of Brittany, principally [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]] and [[Quiberon Bay]]. Along with Saint-Malo, they were expected to have a capacity of {{convert|17500|MTON|abbr=off}} per day. Of this, {{convert|10000|MTON|abbr=off}} per day were expected to come through Quiberon Bay, as it was anticipated that the ports would suffer considerable damage in the fighting, or through German demolitions. Studies indicated that Quiberon Bay had an anchorage sufficient for 200 ships, {{convert|3000|yd}} of beaches with the required slope for landing craft, and four minor ports close by where deep water piers could be constructed. A detailed plan known as [[Operation Chastity]] was drawn up to develop the area.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=294\u2013296}}\n\nThe Overlord plan called for the early capture of Cherbourg, and a rapid American advance to secure the Brittany ports and Quiberon Bay. Crucially, the logistical plan called for a one-month pause at the [[Seine River]], which was expected to be reached by D plus 90, before advancing further.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=189}} The expectation of an advance a proscribed rate, while necessary for planning purposes, built inflexibility into a logistics plan that already had little margin for error. Staff studies confirmed that Overlord could be supported if everything went according to plan. No one expected that it would.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=25, 47\u201348}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=326\u2013327}}\n\n==Assault==\n[[File:Utah Beach and Beach Maintenance Area.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Utah Beach and Beach Maintenance Area]]\n{{main|Omaha Beach|Utah Beach}}\nThe Southern Base Section consisted of four districts, numbered XVI, XVII, XVIII and XIX. The XVIII District, under the command of Colonel Paschal N. Strong, was responsible for mounting Force O, the assault force for [[Omaha Beach]], while the XIX district, under the command of Colonel Theodore Wyman Jr., handled Force U, the assault force for [[Utah Beach]]. The South Base Section coast was divided into nine areas, lettered A to D in the XVIII District and K to O in the XIX District. Together they contained 95 marshalling camps with a capacity for 187,000 troops and 28,000 vehicles. The other two districts, the XVI and XVII were responsible for mounting glider-borne elements of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division]]s.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=359\u2013360}}\n\nIn the opening phase of Overlord, supplies would arrive over the beaches. Operation of the beachheads assigned to the [[Engineer Special Brigade (United States)|engineer special brigades]]. Their name was misleading, for in addition to three engineer battalions, each contained amphibious truck and port companies, and quartermaster, ordnance, medical, military police, signals and chemical warfare units. Along with bomb disposal squads, naval beach parties, maintenance and repair parties and other troops attached for the mission, each had a strength of 15,000 to 20,000 men.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=284\u2013285}}\n\nUtah Beach would be operated by the 1st Engineer Special Brigade, under the command of Brigadier General James E.

Hoge]].{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=53}} The 11th Port had a strength of over 7,600 men; it included four port battalions, five amphibious truck companies, three quartermaster service companies, and three quartermaster truck companies.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=344}}\n\nThe engineers landing on Omaha Beach on [[D-Day]], 6 June, found the beach swept by artillery and automatic weapons fire that the infantry was unable to suppress, and the beach littered with disabled vehicles and landing craft. Only five of the sixteen engineer teams arrived at their assigned locations, and they had only six of their sixteen tank dozers, five of which were soon knocked out. They were only able to clear five narrow lanes through the obstacles instead of the planned sixteen {{convert|50|yd|adj=on}} gaps.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=379\u2013380}} As the infantry advanced, the engineers filled in [[anti-tank ditch]]es, cleared minefields, demolished obstacles, opened three exits, and established the first supply dumps.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=383}}\n\n[[File:Omaha Beach and Beach Maintenance Area.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Omaha Beach and Beach Maintenance Area]]\nThe first waves came ashore on Utah Beach about {{convert|2000|yd}} south of the intended landing beaches. The beach fortifications were much weaker than the intended beaches, but the distance between the low and high watermarks was much greater. Because the beach obstacles were fewer than expected, the engineers were able to clear the entire beach of obstacles rather than just {{convert|50|yd|adj=on}} gaps. However, beach dumps could not be established as planned because the areas had not been captured..{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=384\u2013389}}\n\nIndividual riflemen arriving on the beaches were overburdened, carrying at least {{convert|68|lb}} of equipment and often more.

The inability of the troops to move quickly had lethal consequences, especially on the deadly Omaha beach.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=380\u2013381}} Unneeded equipment was often discarded.

To regulate the movement of ships and landing craft with maximum economy, a special organization was established called Build Up Control (BUCO). This operated under the tactical commanders, FUSA in the US case, on the British committee system, with representatives of the Allied Naval Commander, [[Ministry of War Transport]] and [[War Shipping Administration]]. BUCO was chaired by British Brigadier G. C. Blacker, with Lieutenant Colonel Eli Stevens as the head of the US Zone Staff. {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=363\u2013364}} It had three subordinate agencies: Movement Control (MOVCO), which issued orders for unit movements; Turnaround Control (TURCO), which liaised with the Navy and engineer special brigades; and Embarkation Control (EMBARCO), which handled the location of units and the availability of space in the marshaling areas.{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=41}} \n\n[[File:Rhino ferry RHF-3 approaches Normandy beaches 6 June 1944.jpg|thumb|right|A US Navy Rhino ferry (left) approaches the Normandy beaches, towed by a Rhino tug (right)]]\nThe detailed shipping plan soon fell apart.

By midnight on 8 June, only {{convert|6614|MTON}} of the planned {{convert|24850|LT|t}} had been discharged, just 26.6 percent of the planned total. This rose to {{convert|28100|LT|t}} of the planned {{convert|60250|LT|t}}, or 46 percent of the planned total by midnight on 10 June.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} Emergency beach dumps were established by the engineer special brigades on 7 and 8 June, and the planned inland dumps were opened over the next few days. The dumps were under sniper fire, and on 10 June artillery ammunition was taken from its boxes and carried by hand to the batteries. A consolidated Class V (ammunition) dump was established at [[Formigny]] on 12 June, and FUSA immediate took change of it. The following day it assumed control of all dumps from the engineer special brigades.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=396}} \n\nThe standard cargo vessel, the [[Liberty ship]], carried up to {{convert|11000|LT|t}} of cargo.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=280}} It had five hatches; two had {{convert|50|LT|t|adj=on}} [[crane (machine)|booms]], and three with smaller {{convert|6|to|9|LT|t|adj=on}} booms. In their haste to unload the ships, the crews overloaded the booms, occasionally resulting in breakages. Cargo was not containerized, but transported in bulk in bags, boxes, crates and barrels. [[Cargo net]]s were spread out on the deck, and cargo piled on them. The cargo net with cargo inside was then lifted over the side on the ship's boom, and deposited in a waiting craft.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nOne of the most useful unloading craft was the Rhino ferry, a powered barge constructed from pontons.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} The other mainstay of the unloading effort was the {{convert|2.5|MTON|adj=on}} amphibious truck, known as the [[DUKW]] (and pronounced \"duck\"). DUKWs were supposed to land on D-Day, but most were held offshore and arrived the following day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=394}} The Omaha and Utah beaches remained under sporadic artillery and sniper fire for several days, and as a result the naval officer in charge would not permit ships to anchor close to shore on the first two days.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} Some were as much as {{convert|12|to|15|mi}} offshore. This increased turnaround time for the unloading craft, especially the DUKWs, which were slow in the water. In some cases, DUKWs ran out of fuel. When this happened, their pumps failed, and they sank.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=394}}\n\n[[File:Crane transferring cargo from a DUKW.jpg|thumb|left|Crane transferring cargo from a DUKW]]\nThe unloading craft were frequently overloaded, increasing wear and tear, and occasionally causing one to capsize. Ideally, a DUKW reaching the shore would be met by a mobile crane that could transfer the load to a waiting truck that could take it to the dump, but there were shortages of both trucks and cranes in the early weeks, and DUKWs had to take cargo to the dumps themselves. Insufficient personnel at the dumps for unloading further slowed turnaround, as did the practice of crews whose priority was getting the ship unloaded, of unloading more than one category of supply at once, resulting in a trip to more than one dump. This was resolved only when started being loaded with one category of supply only. Cargo deposited on the beach at low tide and if not swiftly cleared was likely to be swamped by the rising tide.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nThe movement of troops into the marshaling areas had been pre-scheduled, and was already under way when D-Day was postponed for 24 hours. Troops continued to pour into the marshaling areas even though embarkation had halted, and they became overcrowded. This was exacerbated by the slow turnaround of shipping. The stowage and loading plans could not be adhered to when the designated ships failed to arrive as scheduled, and troops and cargo in the marshaling areas could not be sorted into ship loads. The situation became so bad that the flow of troops to the ports became insufficient to load the available ships, and on 12 June Stevens diverted idle shipping to the British so it was not wasted. Thereafter, troops and cargo moved to the ports and were loaded on the next available ship or landing craft. Loading plans were worked out on the spot. Had the Germans sank a ship it would have been highly embarrassing to the War Department, as no proper embarkation records were kept for a time. Some units became lost in the confusion. Major General [[Leonard T. Gerow]], the commander of [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]], personally returned the UK to locate a missing unit that the Southern Base Section had claimed had been shipped, but which was found still in its assembly area.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=422\u2013424}}\n\n[[File:Dried out LST discharges at Omaha Beach.jpg|thumb|{{USS|LST-332||6}} discharges at Omaha Beach while dried out]]\nA major problem was ships arriving without manifests, which were supposed to have been shipped in advance by air or naval courier, but aircraft could not get through and the courier launches were often delayed. Navy and Transportation Corps officers went from one ship to the next searching for items that were desperately required. FUSA would then declare what it wanted discharged.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=392\u2013393}} Selective unloading left half-empty ships with supplies not immediately required standing offshore, further exacerbating the problem of ship turnaround. Desperate measures were taken. The most controversial was ordering the \"drying out\" LSTs.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}} This involved beaching the LST on a falling tide, discharging at low tide, and then re-floating the LST on the rising tide.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=392}} The procedure had been performed successfully in the Mediterranean and the Pacific, but with the high tidal range and uneven beaches of Normandy, naval officials feared that the LSTs might break their backs. Drying out commenced tentatively on 8 June and soon became a standard practice.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nOn 10 June, FUSA ordered the selective discharging of LSTs and LCTs to cease; this was extended to all vessels the following day. Discharge at night under lights began on 12 June despite the obvious risk of German air attack. The backlog of ships was eventually cleared by 15 June. Nonetheless, the manifest problem persisted. When a critical shortage of [[M1 mortar]] ammunition developed in July, all available ammunition was shipped from the UK, but FUSA did not know where the ammunition was or when it arrived. Ordnance personnel were forced to conduct searches of ships looking for it. Thus, a critical shortage continued even though {{convert|145000|LT|MT}} of ammunition lay offshore.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=53\u201358}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Mulberry harbor===\n[[File:Plan of Mulberry A at Omaha Beach.jpg|thumb|right|Plan of Mulberry A at Omaha Beach]]\n{{main|Mulberry harbor}}\nThe decision to land in Normandy meant that ports would not be captured quickly; the Brittany ports were not expected to be in operation until D plus 60. Until then, the Allied armies would have to rely on the beaches, but the weather forecast was not promising. Meteorological records showed that only 25 days of good weather could be expected in June, and there were normally only two quiet spells of good weather four days running between May and September. The tidal range in Normandy was about {{convert|12|ft}}; low tide uncovered about {{convert|1/4|mi|km|spell=in|adj=pre|of a}} of beach, and you had to go out another {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=in|adj=pre|a}} to reach water deep enough for [[coastal trading vessel|coasters]], which drew {{convert|12|to|18|ft}} of water.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=269\u2013275}}\n\nThe solution the COSSAC planners adopted was innovative and audacious: to build a prefabricated harbor. While ports like [[Dover]] and Cherbourg were artificial in the sense that their sheltered harbors had been created through the construction of [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], there was a significant difference between building Dover in seven years in peacetime, and prefabricating an artificial port in a matter of months, and erecting it in two weeks in wartime.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=269\u2013275}} Originally, there was to be one artificial port, at [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]] in the British sector, but by October 1943 COSSAC was planning for two, with a second one at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer|Saint-Laurent]] in the American sector. At this time the project acquired a codename: Mulberry, with the American port becoming Mulberry A and the British one Mulberry B. British [[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] Sir [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]] was in charge of the operation, with the American [[Captain (United States Navy)|Captain]] [[Augustus Dayton Clark|A. Dayton Clark]] in charge of Mulberry A.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=277\u2013278}}{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=46}}\n\nThe Mulberry harbor had three breakwaters. The outermost was made up of bombardons, {{convert|200|ft|adj=on}} long cruciform floating steel structures. These were laid out in a straight line. Then came the phoenixes, {{convert|60|by|60|by|200|ft|adj=on}} concrete [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]] that weighed between {{convert|2000|and|6000|LT|t|-1}}. These were sunk in about {{convert|5+1/2|fathom|m}} of water to form an inner breakwater. Finally, there was the gooseberry, an inner breakwater formed by sinking obsolete vessels known as corncobs in about {{convert|2+1/2|fathom|m}} of water. Plans called for Mulberry A to have three piers, two of {{convert|25|LT|t}} capacity, and one of {{convert|40|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Osmanski|1949b|p=46}} Towing the mulberries' components was estimated to require 164 [[tug]]s, but only 125 were available, and 24 of these were temporarily diverted to tow barges. The target date for completion of the mulberries was therefore pushed back from D plus 14 to D plus 21.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=281}}\n\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|left|Vehicles come ashore over one of the floating causeways]]\nClark arrived off Omaha beach with his staff on 7 June, and the first three corncobs were scuttled under fire that day. The gooseberry was completed by 10 June, and by 17 June all 24 of the bombardons, 32 of the 51 phoenixes were in place, and the central LST pier was in use. On its first day of operation, a vehicle unloaded over the pier every 1.16 minutes. [[Seabee]]s completed the first of the {{convert|2450|ft|adj=on}} ponton causeways 10 June, and the second on 15 June. The planned harbor installation at Utah Beach was much smaller, consisting of just two ponton causeways and a gooseberry with ten corncobs. The corncobs began arriving on 8 June, and came under fire from German artillery. Two were hit, and sank, but in approximately the intended position, albeit spaced too far apart. A third also sank slightly out of position when the tug towing it cut it loose to avoid the shelling. The remainder were scuttled in the correct locations, and the gooseberry was completed on 13 June. The first pontoon cause was opened that day, followed by the second three days later.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=402\u2013404}}\n\nBy 18 June, {{convert|116065|LT|t}} of supplies had been landed, 72.9 percent of the planned {{convert|159530|LT|t}}, although only 40,541 (66 percent) of the planned 61,367 vehicles had arrived. FUSA estimated that it had accumulated 9 days' reserves of rations, and five days' of POL. On the other hand, 314,504 (88 percent) of the planned 358,139 American troops had reached the beaches, representing eleven of the intended twelve divisions. In addition, 14,500 casualties had been evacuated by sea and 1,300 by air, and 10,000 prisoners had been shipped back to the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\nBut on 19 June, the Normandy beaches were hit by a storm that lasted for four days. Although the worst June storm in forty years, it was not a severe one; wind gusts reached {{convert|25|to|32|kn|kph}}, and therefore never reached [[Gale|gale force]]. Waves reached {{convert|8+1/2|ft}}.{{sfn|Morison|1957|p=176}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=413}} Nonetheless, the damage was considerable. Nearly a hundred landing craft were lost, and only one of the twenty Rhino ferries remained operational. Damaged craft were strewn over the beach, partially blocking every exit. The storm interrupted unloading for four days, resulting in the discharge of only {{convert|12253|LT|t}} of stores instead of the planned {{convert|64100|LT|t}} , and 23,460 troops instead of the77,081 scheduled.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=406\u2013410}}\n\n[[File:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|right|Wrecked ponton causeway after the storm]]\nThe American Western Naval Task Force commander, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Alan G. Kirk]], surveyed the damage. The bombardons had failed completely, while the piers and phoenixes had been unable to withstand the pounding of the waves, and had been heavily damaged. Kirk decided that Mulberry A was a total loss, and should not be rebuilt, although the gooseberry should be reinforced with a dozen additional blockships. Many American officials had been skeptical about the value of the artificial port concept from the very beginning, but had held their tongues, knowing that it had high-level official support. The British Mulberry B had not been as badly damaged, as the Calvados Rocks had given it some additional protection, and the British still were still determined to complete their artificial port to a standard that could withstand the autumn gales. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[Winston Churchill]], assured Eisenhower that the project still had his full support. Mulberry B was repaired and reinforced, in some cases using components salvaged from Mulberry A. Expected to handle {{convert|6000|LT|t}} per day, Mulberry B actually averaged {{convert|6765|LT|t}} per day over three months, accounting for 48 percent of the tonnage unloaded in the British sector.{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=178\u2013179}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=413\u2013415}}\n\nThis left the American forces dependent on some small ports and unloading over the beaches. By 30 June, 70,910 of the planned 109,921 vehicles (64.5 percent) had been landed, and 452,460 (78 percent) of the planned 578,971 troops. The deficit in personnel consisted entirely of service and support troops; all eleven divisions planned for had arrived, along with the two airborne divisions which were to have been withdrawn to the UK but had been retained in France.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=418\u2013422}}\n\n===Ordnance===\nThe nature of the fighting in the Normandy hedgerows created shortages of certain items. A heavy reliance on M1 mortars not only led to a shortage of ammunition, but a shortage of the mortars themselves as the Germans targeted them. On 3 July, FUSA ordered tank, armored field artillery, and tank destroyer battalions to turn in their mortars for reallocation to infantry units.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=73\u201375}} A shortage of [[bazooka]]s was similarly addressed by taking them from service units and redistributing them to the infantry. The Germans also made a special effort to eliminate the man with the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]] (BAR), as the BAR represented most of an infantry squad's firepower. Another item with a higher than expected loss rate was the [[M7 grenade launcher]]. When this device was attached to the [[M1 Garand]] rifle, it disabled the rifle's semi-automatic function, so the rifle could not be fired normally when it was in place. Accordingly, they were quickly discarded after use in combat, resulting in a high loss rate. By mid-July, FUSA reported a shortage of 2,300 M7 grenade launchers.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=442\u2013443}}\n\nAlthough ammunition expenditure did not exceed expected usage, it did not arrive at the planned rate either, resulting in shortages. FUSA gave high priority to the unloading of ammunition. The hedgerow fighting soon generated shortages of small arms ammunition and [[Mk 2 grenade|hand grenades]]. These were alleviated in the short term by emergency shipments by air, and in the medium term by allotting ammunition the highest priority for shipment instead of POL. On 15 June FUSA imposed restrictions on the number of rounds per gun per day that could be fired. In part this was because deliveries consistently fell short of targets, but the main problem that FUSA sought to address was excessive and unreported stocks held by artillery units, which reduced the reserves held at Army level. The storm prompted emergency action. FUSA limited expenditure to a third of a unit of fire per day, arranged for {{convert|500|LT|t}} per day to be delivered by air for three days, ordered coasters carrying ammunition to be beached, and called forward five Liberty ships in UK waters that had been prestowed with ammunition.\n{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=445\u2013448}}\n\n[[File:Bocagesoldier1944.jpg|thumb|left|American soldiers near a hedgerow. The one in the foreground has an [[M7 grenade launcher]].]]\nA unit of fire was a somewhat arbitrary measurement for accounting purposes, and was different for each type of ammunition.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=306\u2013307}} It was 133 rounds for the [[M101 howitzer|105 mm howitzer]], 75 rounds for the [[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm howitzer]], 50 rounds for the [[155 mm gun M1|155 mm gun]], and 50 rounds for the [[M115 howitzer|8 inch howitzer]].{{sfn|Balmer|Compton|Daley|Williams|1945|p=13}} The divisions responded to the restrictions on the use of field artillery by employing tank destroyers and anti-aircraft guns as field artillery, as their ammunition was not rationed. On 2 July, FUSA imposed a new set of restrictions: expenditure was not to exceed one unit of fire of the first day of an attack, half a unit of fire on the second and subsequent days of an attack, and a third of a unit of fire on other days. Consumption in excess of the limits had to be reported to FUSA, with an appropriate justification. In practice, ammunition usage continued to be heavy, exacerbated by wasteful practices like unobserved firing and firing for morale effect by inexperienced units. By 16 July, FUSA stocks of 105 mm ammunition were down to 3.5 units of fire, and 81 mm mortar ammunition was at a critically low 0.3 units of fire. Ammunition was being unloaded at a rate of {{convert|500|LT|t}} per day, which was insufficient, resulting in FUSA stocks being depleted at a rate of 0.2 units of fire per day. FUSA once again imposed strict rationing on 16 July, but expenditure was well below the limits owing to most of the tubes going silent as they moved into new gun positions for the upcoming [[Operation Cobra]] attack on 25 July.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=445\u2013448}}  \n\nThe limitations of the [[M4 Sherman]] tank's [[75mm gun M2\u2013M6|75 mm gun]] had already been recognized to some extent, and the theater had received 150 Shermans armed with the high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1|76 mm gun]]. A few weeks of combat in Normandy laid plain that the Sherman, even when equipped with the 76 mm gun, was outclassed by the German [[Tiger I]], [[Tiger II]] and [[Panther tank]]s. The chief of the ETOUSA Armored Fighting Vehicles and Weapons Section, Brigadier General Joseph A. Holly, met with commanders in the field on 25 June, and then went to the United States in July to urge the expedited delivery of Shermans armed with the 105 mm howitzer, and of the new [[M36 tank destroyer]], which was armed with a [[90 mm gun M1/M2/M3|90 mm gun]].{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=442\u2013443}}{{sfn|Mayo|1968|p=331}} In the meantime, 57 recently-received Shermans armed with the 105 mm howitzer were shipped to Normandy from the UK.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=442\u2013443}} Consideration was given to obtaining the British [[Sherman Firefly]], which mounted the powerful [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17-pounder]] anti-tank gun, but the British were overwhelmed with orders for them from the British Army.{{sfn|Mayo|1968|p=331}}{{sfn|Bradley|1951|pp=322\u2013323}} It was useless arguing that American equipment was adequate; American propaganda declared that the American fighting man was the best equipped in the world, and when confronted with evidence to the contrary, everyone from Eisenhower down felt short changed.{{sfn|Goodfriend|1946|p=33}}{{sfn|Bradley|1951|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\n===Subsistence===\nAmerican soldiers were also skeptical of the claim that they were the best-fed soldiers of all time. The US Army's standard garrison ration was called the [[A-ration]]. The [[B-ration]] was A-ration without its perishable components. The [[C-ration]] consisted of six {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} cans, three of which contained meat combinations (meat and vegetable hash, meat and beans, or meat and vegetable stew), and the other three biscuits, hard candy, cigarettes, and a beverage in the form of [[instant coffee]], lemon powder or cocoa.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=439\u2013441}}\n\n[[File:Military Rations, World War II and Korean War - Fort Devens Museum - DSC07076.JPG|thumb|right|C, D and K rations]]\nThe better-packaged [[K-ration]] was designed to be an emergency ration. It contained three meals: a breakfast unit with canned ham and eggs and a dried fruit bar; a supper unit with luncheon meat; and a dinner unit with biscuits and cheese. It also contained [[Halazone]] water purification tablets, a four-pack of cigarettes, chewing gum, instant coffee, and sugar. The [[D-ration]] was chocolate bar. The compactness of the K-ration made it the preferred choice of the foot soldiers, but troops with access to transport and heating preferred the C-ration. Finally, there was the [[10-in-1 food parcel|10-in-1]], an American version of the British 12-in-1, which was intended to feed ten men. It could be used by field kitchens, and offered the variety of five different menus. The lemon powder in the C and K rations was particularly unpopular with the troops, who frequently discarded it, or used it for things like scrubbing floors, which was unfortunate as it was those rations' primary sources of [[vitamin C]].{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=439\u2013441}}{{sfn|Risch|1953|pp=184\u2013188}}\n\nThe troops landing on D-Day each carried one D-ration and one K-ration; another three rations per man in the form of C- and K-rations were carried with their units. For the first few days all rations landed were C- or K-rations. During the four weeks of Overlord, 60,000,000 rations were delivered to Normandy in vessels pre-stowed in three to eight {{convert|500|LT|t|adj=on}} blocks at the New York Port of Embarkation. This facilitated the shift to 10-in-1 packs over the less popular C- and K-rations; 77 percent of rations in the first four weeks were in the form of 10-in-1s. By 1 July, a static bakery was in operation at Cherbourg, and there were seven mobile bakeries in operation, permitting the issue of freshly-baked white bread to commence. By mid-July, 70 percent of the troops were eating B-rations.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=439\u2013441}}   \n===POL===\nInitially fuel arrived packaged in {{convert|5|USgal|l|-1|adj=on}} [[jerrican]]s. This was a German invention copied by the British; in the US Army it supplanted the {{convert|10|USgal|l|adj=on}} container used in the 1930s. The jerrican had convenient carrying handles, stacked easily and did not shift or roll in storage,\nand floated in water when filled with [[gasoline|MT80]]. The British version was an exact copy of the German model; the American version, called an Ameri-can by the British, was slightly smaller, with a screw cap onto which a nozzle could be fitted to deal with American vehicles with flush or countersunk fuel tank openings. If a nozzle was not available, the original can with its short spout was much preferred. A US jerrican weighed {{convert|10|lb}} empty, and {{convert|40|lb}} when filled with MT80, so 56 filled cans weighed {{convert|1|LT|t|spell=in}}.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=162\u2013163}} For Overlord, 11,500,000 jerricans were provided. Of these, 10,500,000 were manufactured in the UK and supplied to the US Army under [[Reverse Lend-Lease]].{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=342}} Jeeps arrived at the beachhead with full tanks and two jerricans of fuel; weapons carriers and small trucks carried five; 2\u00bd-ton trucks carried ten; and DUKWs carried twenty.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=648}}\n\n[[File:Soldiers on their way to the front.jpg|thumb|left|American soldiers and jeeps on their way to the front at [[Saint Lo]] in June 1944]]The standard operating procedure (SOP) with respect to fuel containers was that empties should be returned and swapped for full ones, but the engineer special brigades had no refilling facilities, and did not wish to have the beach supply dumps cluttered with empties, so FUSA issued an order that empties not be returned. Instead, they went to divisional or corps collection points. The relaxation of the full-for-empty SOP was to have undesirable effects later on in the campaign. Bulk POL started to arrive at Isigny on 22 June, and at [[Port-en-Bessin]] and [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] the following day.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=61\u201362}} It had been expected that only the east [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] at the Port-en-Bessin terminal could be used, and only by small tankers with a capacity of up to {{convert|150|LT|t}}, but it was found that both east and west moles could be used, and for tankers up to {{convert|1500|LT|t}}. This allowed one mole to be allocated to the British and one to the Americans.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=443\u2013445}}\n\nThe POL supply situation was satisfactory throughout June and July, mainly because the rate of advance was much slower than anticipated, resulting in shorter supply lines and lower fuel consumption. FUSA's daily MT80 consumption in July was around {{convert|9500|USbbl|l}}. Steady progress was made on construction of the Minor System pipeline, and the tank farm at Mont Cauvin received its first bulk MT80 on 25 June. The delay in the capture of Cherbourg led to the extension of the Minor System beyond what had originally been planned, and eventually {{convert|70|mi}} of pipeline were laid instead of the planned {{convert|27|mi}}. The pipeline carried both MT80 and avgas to [[Saint-L\u00f4]], and later to [[Carentan]]. Intended to deliver {{convert|6000|USbbl|l}} per day, it was delivering twice that by the end of July. Storage was similarly greater than planned, {{convert|142000|USbbl|l}} instead of the planned {{convert|54000|USbbl|l}}.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=443\u2013445}} Decanting of bulk fuel into jerricans began on 26 June, and by July {{convert|600000|USgal}} was being decanted each day.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=62\u201363}}\n\nBy the time Operation Cobra was launched on 25 July, no part of the planned Major System pipeline was in operation. As it was expected to have received {{convert|85000|LT|t}} of POL products by then, receipts lagged considerably. Nonetheless, stocks were roughly what had been intended, because consumption had been much lower. In June, FUSA consumed around {{convert|3,700,000|USgal|l}}, an average of about {{convert|148,000|USgal|l}} per day, or {{convert|55|LT|t}} per division slice. This rose to {{convert|11,500,000|USgal|l}}, an average of about {{convert|372,000|USgal|l}} per day, or {{convert|75|LT|t}} per division slice in July, but still remained far below the expected figure of {{convert|121|LT|t}} per division slice.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=501\u2013502}}\n\n==Breakout and pursuit==\n[[File:Development of the lodgement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|21st Army Group's forecast of Operation Overlord]]\nBy the time [[Operation Cobra]] was launched on 25 July, Overlord was running nearly forty days behind schedule. The Allies considered an alternative to the Overlord plan called Lucky Strike. This involved defeating the German forces west of the Seine, forcing a crossing of the river, and seizing the Seine ports of [[Le Havre]] and [[Rouen]] as an alternative to those in Brittany, neither of which had yet been captured. The SHAEF and COMZ staffs considered Lucky Strike a terrible idea, as the Seine ports did not have the capacity to compensate for those in Brittany.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=407, 481\u2013482}}\n\nOperation Cobra effected a remarkable turnaround in the operational situation, and by 3 August, Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton Jr.]]'s Third Army was advancing into Brittany.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=483}} For some reason, Bradley fixated on Brest, which was only intended to be a port of reception for troops, and Saint-Malo, a minor port, whereas Patton focused on Lorient and Quiberon Bay. There were significant differences in the way Patton, a cavalryman, and Bradley and [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] commander [[Troy H. Middleton]], who were both infantrymen, conceived [[operational art]]. When the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]]'s commander, Major General [[John Shirley Wood|John S.

Saint-Malo was secured on 2 September,{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|pp=414\u2013415}} and Brest on 19 September, but the port facilities were destroyed,{{sfn|Mack|1981|p=8}}{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=653}} and SHAEF had abandoned plans to develop Quiberon Bay on 3 September.{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=655}}\n\nBy 24 August, the left bank of the Seine had been cleared, and Operation Overlord was completed. In just 30 days, the Allied forces had conducted an advance that had been expected to take 70. Reaching the D plus 90 line on D plus 79 was not a grave concern, as the Overlord plan had sufficient flexibility to allow for a discrepancy of eleven days.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1951|p=4}} The plan called for a pause on the Seine of at least 30 days, but in mid-August the decision was taken to continue the pursuit beyond the Seine. This had even more far-reaching effects than Bradley's 3 August decision.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=484\u2013485}} Between 25 August and 12 September, the Allied armies advanced from the D plus 90 phase line to the D plus 350 one, moving through 260 phase lines in just 19 days. Although the planners had estimated that no more than 12 divisions could be maintained beyond the Seine, 16 were by mid-September, albeit on reduced scales.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1951|p=5}}  \n\n===Base organization===\nADSEC headquarters opened in Normandy on 16 June. FECOMZ, now under Albrecht's command, opened its headquarters at Ch\u00e2teau Servigny and Ch\u00e2teau Pont Rilly near [[Valognes]] on 15 July, but ADSEC remained subordinated to First Army until 30 July. Indeed, First Army controlled all US forces in France until 1 August, when [[Twelfth United States Army Group]] and Third Army became active.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=434\u2013436}} The facilities at Valognes were greatly expanded, with tents to accommodation 11,000 personnel and {{convert|560,000|sqft}} of hutted office space,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=31}} and special signal facilities installed to enable it to communicate with the UK and US.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=434\u2013436}} COMZ headquarters opened at Valognes on 7 August,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=34}} a month earlier than originally planned, and FECOMZ therefore never operated in its intended role.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=436\u2013437}}\n\n[[File:COMZ boundaries November 1944 - January 1945.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|COMZ boundaries November 1944 \u2013 January 1945]]\nCOMZ headquarters was not destined to remain at Valognes for long, for on 1 September it began moving to Paris. The move took two weeks to accomplish,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=31}} with some of the 29,000 staff moving directly from the UK, and consumed motor and air transport at a time when transportation assets were scarce.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=286}} In Paris, COMZ headquarters occupied 167 hotels. Eisenhower was not impressed; the move had been conducted without his knowledge, and contrary to his orders that no Allied headquarters be located in Paris without his specific approval.{{sfn|Pogue|1954|pp=322\u2013323}} As Paris was the hub of road, rail, cable and inland waterway systems, it soon hosted a concentration of supply depots, hospitals, airfields, railway stations and marshaling yards, and inland waterway offloading points, and as such was the logical and perhaps the only suitable location for COMZ headquarters.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=31}} \n\nOn 11 July, ADSEC organized the port of Cherbourg as Area No. 1 under the command of Colonel Cleland C. Sibley, the commander if the 4th Major Port. Ten days later it was redesignated that Cherbourg Command, with Wyyman in charge. Over the following week, his headquarters was reinforced with personnel from Base Section No. 3 in England. It was redesignated the Cherbourg Base Section on 7 August, and began taking over the beach area dumps from ADSEC. Finally, on 16 August, it became the Normandy Base Section. Meanwhile, Grower's Base Section No. 1 had arrived at Utah Beach on 3 August, and proceeded to [[Rennes]], where it opened as the Brittany Base Section on 16 August. Base Collins's Section No. 1 moved to [[Le Mans]], where it became the Loire Base Section on 5 September. After Paris was captured, COMZ sent for Rogers's Base Section No. 5, which had been specifically created for the role. It became the Seine Base Section on 24 August,{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=33\u201335}} and occupied another 129 Paris hotels.{{sfn|Pogue|1954|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\nBase Section No. 4, under the command of Colonel Fenton S. Jacobs, opened at [[Fontainebleau]] on 3 September as the Oise Section, and a Channel Base Section was formed under Thrasher. Before either became operational, it was realized that each was better suited to the other's mission, so the two swapped names and roles on 15 September. At the same time the engineering section of the Brittany Base Section, which had been organized with the mission of rehabilitating ports, was transferred to the Channel Base Section. With the departure of the sections and most of the personnel from the UK, the sections there became districts, and were consolidated into the UK Base Section, under Vaughan's command.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=33\u201335}}\n\nA key element of a functional logistics system was the establishment of a series of depots. ADSEC was only authorized to maintain stocks sufficient to supply the daily needs of the armies, with its depots replenished by automatic shipment or requisitions from COMZ. The restricted size of the Normandy lodgment area necessarily resulted in a crowding of the installations, and this problem was compounded by First Army's reluctance to release dumps under its control until the end of July. First Army then became the main sufferer from the consequent logistical problems that it caused.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=493}}\n\nOnce the breakout began in earnest, the distances soon became prohibitive for the armies' own transport resources. Third Army's line of communication ran from the beaches to Laval, a {{convert|135|mi}} distant, and then to Le Mans, another {{convert|175|mi}} away. ADSEC opened a transfer point at [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] on 13 August, and then a Le Mans a week later. ADSEC hoped to develop Le Mans as a major supply area, but soon it was too far from the front. The transfer point was moved to [[Ablis]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of [[Chartres]], where another attempt was made to establish a major depot area. The transfer point remained at Ablis until 7 September, by which time Third Army was operating beyond the [[Moselle]], {{convert|200|mi}} away, although ADSEC had opened a MT80 supply point at Fontainebleau.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=494\u2013496}}\n\n===POL===\n\n[[File:POL pipelines in mid-September 1944.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|POL pipelines in mid-September 1944]]\nThe MT80 supply was adequate for the first month of Operation Cobra, although Third Army had only meager reserves and depended on daily deliveries. On 3 August it had {{convert|515000|USgal|l}} on hand, representing 1.3 days of supply. In contrast, First Army held 10.5 days of supply. In view of this disparity, action was taken to reduce First Army's excess stocks. During the week of 20\u201326 August, with both armies engaged in pursuit of the retreating Germans, consumption soared, with First Army burning {{convert|501,000|USgal|l}} per day ({{convert|282,000|USgal|l}} on 24 August alone), compared to Third Army's {{convert|350,000|USgal|l}}. Meanwhile, as the distances increased the difficulty involved in delivering POL steadily mounted. Third Army began rationing MT80. On 28 August, Third Army reported that receipts had fallen {{convert|97,510|USgal|l}} short of its {{convert|450,000|USgal|l}} requirements. Deliveries fell to {{convert|31,975|USgal|l}} on 30 August, and {{convert|25,390|USgal|l}} on 2 September. One additional source was captured fuel; {{convert|115,000|USgal|l}} was captured at [[Ch\u00e2lons-du-Maine]] on 29 and 30 August, and Third Army made use of {{convert|500,000|USgal|l}} during the pursuit. It also commandeered the fuel that Red Ball trucks needed for their return journeys, leaving convoys stranded. Yet at no stage was fuel actually in short supply; on 19 August the depots in Normandy held {{convert|27,000,000|USgal|l}} of gasoline, equivalent to twelve days of supply. The problem was one of distribution.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=504\u2013509}}\n\n[[File:Supplying Allied Forces After D Day, July 1944 B7186.jpg|thumb|left|Trucks taken on fuel]]\nThe preferred method of moving bulk POL was through pipelines. Although Cherbourg's cargo-handling facilities had been damaged or destroyed, its POL-handling facilities were largely intact. The {{convert|5000000|USbbl|l|adj=on}} of storage tanks were cleaned and put to allow them to hold MT80 instead of [[fuel oil]]. It took four weeks for the Navy to clear away the underwater obstacles and put the Digue de Quequerville, which had been the largest POL offloading point in the continent before the war, back into operation. The first elements of the Major System were installed in the form of {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on}} and {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on}} pipelines from the Digue de Quequerville to the storage tanks.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=501\u2013502}} Cherbourg handled its first POL on 26 July, and the Major System pipeline commenced operation six weeks behind schedule. On 31 July it reached [[La Haye-du-Puits]], where two {{convert|15000|USbbl|l|adj=on}} storage tanks were erected.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=62\u201363}}{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=501\u2013502}} Originally, it was supposed to head south to [[Avranches]] and then to Rennes in support of operations in Brittany, but as a result of Bradley's 3 August decision, the pipeline was directed southeastward to Saint-L\u00f4, which was reached on 11 August.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=510}}{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|p=409}} A decanting point was opened at La Haye-du-Puits on 1 August that was manned by three gasoline supply companies and a service company that decanted {{convert|250,000|USgal|l}} per day.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=651}} On 19 August, when ADSEC turned them over to the Normandy Base Section, there were ten POL dumps and five decanting points.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=651\u2013652}}\n\n[[File:Welding a section of POL pipeline.jpg|thumb|right|Welding a section of POL pipeline]]\nA workforce of over 7,200 troops and 1,500 [[prisoners of war]] was engaged in the construction of the Major System pipeline. Units involved included the 358th, 359th and 368th Engineer General Service Regiments and a battalion of the 364th Engineer General Service Regiment, and nine petroleum distribution companies. Through lack of experience, the engineers were sometimes careless with the couplings or left gaps that permitted the entry or animals or into which troops threw C-ration cans. In the attempt to push the pipeline ahead as quickly as possible, the engineers did not always take the time to break through hedgerows or clear minefields, and lines were often laid along road shoulders, where they were subject to damage by motor vehicles. The line was also subject to acts of sabotage, and [[black market]]eers sometimes punched holes in it in order to steal fuel. Breaks in the line on 29 August forced truck units to draw MT80 from Saint-L\u00f4, {{convert|80|mi}} further away. Up to this point the pipeline had overriding priority, but its construction required the railway system to deliver {{convert|500|to|1500|LT|t}} of pipes, tank, pumps and fittings each day. By the end of August, one Major System MT80 pipeline had reached [[Alen\u00e7on]], another was at [[Domfront, Orne|Domfront]], and an [[avgas|MT100]] pipeline had nearly reached Domfront. By mid-September, the pipeline's priority was downgraded, and it had to rely on motor transport, limiting progress to {{convert|7|to|8|mi}} per day. The pipeline reached [[Coubert]] on 6 October, and there it remained until January 1945.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=511\u2013515}}{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=411\u2013413}}\n\nThe COMZ salvage effort was concentrated under the 202nd Quartermaster Battalion, which had three collecting and three repair companies. Combat units collected their own salvage, which was picked up at the truckheads and hauled to the salvage depots in returning ration trucks. The repair companies were static, but had mobile equipment maintenance units that visited the forward areas. The collecting companies combed the rear areas looking for abandoned equipment.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=462}} By August, a shortage of jerricans had become a critical supply problem.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=664}} Over 2 million jerricans had been discarded in Normandy.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=651\u2013652}} Major General [[Robert McGowan Littlejohn|Robert McG. Littlejohn]], the Chief Quartermaster, noted that the salvage companies and gasoline supply companies were ignoring the thousands of jerricans that littered the roads in the Le Mans area until he specifically ordered them to collect them. An even greater problem was the huge stockpiles of empty jerricans that had been abandoned at dumps when the units manning them had displaced forward.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=664}}\n\n[[File:Red Ball Express - Jerricans depot.jpg|thumb|left|Red Ball jerrican depot]]\nLittlejohn appointed Colonel Lyman R. Talbot, the chief the COMZ Petroleum and Fuel Division, as his special POL liaison officer at ADSEC,{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=651\u2013652}} with special responsibility for collecting jerricans. Since it was easier to move bulk POL to the jerrican dumps than to move the empty jerricans to the bulk POL, Littlejohn and Talbot established temporary filling points at the disused dumps.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=664}} Editorials urging that discarded cans be handed in were run in ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', the [[United States Information Service]] ran appeals in the news media, and French civilians, including children, were employed in the search for discarded jerricans. By the end of December, over one million discarded or abandoned jerricans had been recovered.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=665\u2013666}}\n\nEfforts were made to procure more jerricans. The War Office agreed to supply 221,000 per month, about half what Littlejohn estimated was required. Orders were placed in the United States, but production there had ceased, and efforts to restart it were hampered by a shortage of manpower. Shipping was also a problem, as the tonnage allocated to quartermaster items had been reduced, and Littlejohn needed shipping space for winter clothing. Jerricans had to be sent as filler or deck cargo. The number of decanting sites was reduced to minimise the reserves of cans. Finally, due to the shortage of jerricans, each army was forced to accept part of its POL allocation in bulk, or in {{convert|55|USgal|l|adj=on}} [[Drum (container)|drums]]. These weighed {{convert|412|lb}} when filled with gasoline, and were disliked by the combat troops, who had little access to handling equipment at their forward dumps, and the regarded them as inconvenient and dangerous.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|pp=665\u2013666}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Railways in use in mid-September 1944.jpg|thumb|right||upright=1.1|Railway lines in use in mid-September 1944]]\nThe Overlord planners intended to use rail transport for most long-distance haulage. France had a good rail network, with nearly {{convert|36500|mi}} of single- and double-track lines. Like most European railway systems, the [[rolling stock]] was lightweight and loading and unloading facilities were limited, so rolling stock coming from the United States had to be specifically designed and built for the purpose of operating on the continent. Railway units were scheduled to arrive at Cherbourg, but the delay in capturing and then opening the port meant that the first units arrived over the beaches. The first rolling stock, two {{convert|150|hp|adj=on}} diesel [[locomotive]]s and some [[flatcar]]s, arrived on LCTs that were unloaded over Utah Beach on 10 July. Later that month the [[Seatrain Lines|seatrains]] USAT ''Seatrain Texas'' and USAT ''Seatrain Lakehurst'' began delivering rolling stock to Cherbourg. The port was still too badly damaged for them to be berthed, so they were unloaded in the stream, with rolling stock transferred to barges that were unloaded on the shore with the aid of mobile cranes. While the seatrains brought in the heavier equipment like locomotives and [[tank car]]s, most rolling stock arrived on LSTs fitted with rails. By 31 July, 1944, 48 diesel and steam locomotives and 184 railway cars had arrived from the United Kingdom, and another 100 steam locomotives, 1,641 freight cars, and 76 passenger cars had been captured. {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=544\u2013546}}{{sfn|Bykofsky|Larson|1957|pp=285\u2013287}}\n[[File:USAT Seatrain Texas army report.jpg|thumb|left|The transport USAT ''Seatrain Texas'']]\n\nThe commander of the 2nd Military Railway Service, Brigadier General Clarence L. Burpee, arrived in Normandy on 17 June, and by the end of July the 707th Railway Grand Division had the 720th, 728th and 729th Railway Operating Battalions and the 757th Shop Battalion operational.{{sfn|DeNevi|Hall|1992|pp=83\u201384}} French civilians were employed whenever possible. Railway operations commenced in early July. Major General Frank S. Ross, the ETO Chief of Transportation, rode the line from Cherbourg to Carentan in a jeep equipped with flanged wheels.{{sfn|Bykofsky|Larson|1957|pp=285\u2013287}} Immediately after Operation Cobra began, the 347th Engineer General Service Regiment was withdrawn from its work on the port of Cherbourg and set to work rehabilitating the railway lines, which had been badly damaged by the Allied Air Forces. It started by repairing the masonry bridge over the [[Vire River]] on the Saint-L\u00f4 line, constructing a timber trestle bridge to replace a missing span. At [[Coutances]], it replaced a missing span of a viaduct bridge. Reconstruction of the marshalling yards at Saint-L\u00f4 was a major task, as they had been almost completely destroyed.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|p=399}}\n\nOn 12 August, Third Army asked for the line to Le Mans to be opened, with {{convert|12000|LT|t}} of ammunition and POL to be delivered over the next three days. The main line eastward from Vire to Argentan was still in German hands, and the one southward to Rennes and then eastward to Le Mans could not be restored quickly because major bridge reconstruction tasks were required at Pontaubault and Laval. Instead, a temporary route was found using a series of secondary line while the main line was being repaired. Even this required some major bridge reconstruction work, notably an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} single-track bridge at [[Saint-Hilaire-du-Harcou\u00ebt]]. Elements of no less than eleven engineer general service regiments worked on the lines simultaneously. When Major General Cecil R. Moore, the ETO Chief Engineer flew over the Saint-Hilaire bridge site at 1800 on 15 August, he saw a sign on the ground in white cement that read: \"Will finish at 2000.\" The first train loaded with POL left [[Folligny]] at 1900, crossed the bridge at around midnight, and, after many delays, rolled into Le Mans on 17 August. Thirty more trains followed at half-hour intervals. {{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=547}}{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=400\u2013401}}    \n\n[[File:Unloading packaged POL.jpg|thumb|right|Loading packaged POL onto a train]]\nWith only single-track lines in use, the lines between Avranches and Le Mans soon became congested, and a shortage of empty freight cars developed. The rail yards at Folligny and Le Mans were badly damaged, and considerable reconstruction work was required. Getting the main line east of Rennes in use required the repair of the bridge at Laval, which was completed by the end of the month. By mid-August, the main line to Argentan was in Allied hands, and reconstruction of that line was given a high priority, and it was in use by the end of the month. Beyond Chartres, the lines were badly damaged, as the Allied Air Forces had given particular attention to interdicting German lines of communications across the Seine. By the end of August, 18,000 men, including 5,000 prisoners of war, were working on railway reconstruction. An American train reached the rail yards at [[Batignolles]] in Paris on 30 August by using a circuitous route, but its use was initially restricted to hospital trains, and engineer supplies, and civil affairs relief. Nearly all the Seine bridges had been destroyed, and from 4 September only two or three trains per day navigated the Paris bottleneck to points beyond. Dreux and Chartres remained the forward railheads of the First and Third Armies respectively.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=547\u2013550}}\n\nBeyond the Seine, the railway network was more extensive, and damage was much lighter, as in had not been the target of air attack nearly as much as the railways in the Normandy lodgement area, and the Germans had not had time to destroy them. The main problem was shortage of rolling stock. Transfer points were established in the Paris area where Red Ball supplies were transferred to railway cars, taking some of the burden off the hard-pressed motor transport resources. By mid-September, {{convert|3400|mi}} of track had been rehabilitated and over forty bridges had been rebuilt. Lines had been opened north of Paris to [[Namur]] and [[Liege]] in Belgium to support First Army, and eastward to [[Verdun]] and [[Conflans-en-Jarnisy]] to support Third Army. By mid-September, the railways were hauling 2,000,000 ton-miles per day, and rail tonnages north of the Seine averaged only {{convert|5000|LT|t}} per day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=550\u2013553}}\n\n===Motor transport===\n[[File:G.M.C. CCKW 352.jpg|thumb|right|A [[2\u00bd-ton 6x6 truck]] ]]\n{{main|Red Ball Express}}\nWith the railways and pipelines unable to keep up with the pace of the advance, the breakout and pursuit from Normandy placed a heavy burden on ADSEC's Motor Transport Brigade. Yet even before Operation Cobra began, COMZ estimated that there would be a shortage 127 truck companies by D plus 90.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=481\u2013482}} This was a consequence of decisions made in the planning stages of Overlord. COMZ had estimated that 240 truck companies would be required, but only 160 were approved in November 1943.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=553\u2013554}} The theater was only partly responsible for this. In peacetime, the vaunted American motor vehicle industry had only produced about 600 heavy-duty trucks (defined as 4-ton vehicles or greater) a month. In July 1943, the ASF ordered 67,000 to be produced in 1944. The [[Truman Committee]] considered this wasteful and unnecessarily reducing the number of civilian trucks that could be built. Despite the political pressure, the Army pressed on with the production program, but in January 1944, only 2,788 heavy-duty trucks came off the assembly lines.{{sfn|Thomson|Mayo|1960|pp=287\u2013289}}\n\nRoss wanted two-thirds of the ETO's requested 160 companies equipped with the 10-ton semi-trailer, which was especially suitable for long-distance haulage, with the rest equipped with [[2\u00bd-ton 6x6 truck]]s for shorter inter-depot movements and clearance of railheads, but by the end of March 1944, ETO had only 66 10-ton semi-trailers instead of the 7,194 it had requested, and none of the 4,167 4- or 5-ton truck tractors. In April, the War Department attempted to meet the requirements by taking hundreds of trucks of miscellaneous types from the ASF, [[Army Ground Forces]] and [[Army Air Forces]] in the United States, and ASF diverted 1,750 4- and 5-ton truck tractors and 3,500 5-ton semi-trailers earmarked for the [[Ledo Road]] project in Burma to the ETO.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=553\u2013555}}\n\n[[File:Red Ball 1944 september 20-fr.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Red Ball and Red Lion express routes, 20 September]]\nThe tardy delivery of vehicles affected the training of the personnel of motor transport units. As with many other service units, the ETO had been compelled to accept partially trained units in the hope of their being able to complete their training in the UK. The late arrival of vehicles meant that this training could not get under way until May 1944. In August 1943 the [[Transportation Corps]] requested that each truck company be allocated an additional 36 drivers, bringing them up to 96 per company, so there would be two per vehicle, allowing the trucks to be operated around the clock. ETOUSA has disapproved this, which it regarded as unnecessary, but nonetheless the Transportation Corps had persisted, and in early 1944 Lee had approved the proposal.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=556\u2013557}}\n\nBut by this time the War Department had established a troop ceiling for the ETO, and would not provide the additional personnel without corresponding cuts elsewhere, so the 5,600 men to provide an additional 40 drivers for 140 companies had to be obtained from other SOS units. Lee sternly warned that he would not countenance this being used as an excuse to rid units of undesirables. Whether this admonition worked is debatable, but insufficient numbers of personnel were provided, so in May 1944, fourteen African-American truck companies had their personnel transferred to other African-American units. The intention was to replace them with Caucasian personnel, but the numbers were not made available. Instead, two engineer general service regiments were temporarily converted to truck units. The cost of inadequate training of truck drivers would be paid in avoidable damage to vehicles through accidents and poor maintenance.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=556\u2013557}}\n\n[[File:Convoy Red Ball Express.jpg|thumb|right|Red Ball Express Convoy passes a broken-down vehicle]]\nOn 10 August, two companies of 45-ton tank transporters were converted to cargo carriers. A few days later, the 55 truck companies equipped with 2\u00bd-ton 6x6 trucks were each given ten additional trucks, and three British truck companies were borrowed from the 21st Army Group. The situation became acute with the decision to continue the pursuit across the Seine. COMZ estimated that this require {{convert|100000|LT|t}} of supplies (excluding POL) to be delivered to the Chartres-Dreux area by 1 September. Of this, the railways could deliver only {{convert|18000|LT|t}}, leaving {{convert|82000|LT|t}} to be hauled by the Motor Transport Brigade. It was immediately realized that this would require an extraordinary effort.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=558\u2013564}}\n\nThe solution adopted was the [[Red Ball Express]], a term appropriated from the railways. The plan called for a one-way highway loop running around the clock. This expedient had never been attempted before and the procedures for operating it were untried. Routes were marked with Red Ball markers. Convoys moved at a maximum speed of {{convert|25|mph}} with {{convert|60|yd}} between each vehicle and no overtaking was permitted. An hourly ten-minute break was taken at ten minutes before the hour. Opposition from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was absent, permitting the use of lights at night. In practice, convoy discipline, especially with regard to speed limits, was not always followed, and a shortage of it proved impossible to reserve the routes for the exclusive use of the Red Ball Express, resulting in their also being used by the First and Third Armies and the [[United States Air Forces Central Command|Ninth Air Force]], with military and civilian vehicles sometimes attempting to move against the Red Ball traffic. Red Ball convoys commenced on 25 August, and reached their peak on 29 August when 132 companies with 5,958 vehicles delivered {{convert|12342|LT|t}} of supplies. The deadline was not met, but by 5 September {{convert|89000|LT|t}} had been delivered to the Dreux-Chartres area.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=558\u2013564}}\n\n[[File:Red Ball Express Regulating Point.jpg|thumb|left|A Red Ball Express convoy moves through a regulating point]]\nAlthough this ended its original mission, the Red Ball Express continued to operate until the end of September, with deliveries further afield to [[Soissons]] and [[Hirson]] in support of First Army and Fontainebleu and [[Sommesous]] in support of Third Army.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=567}} From 16 September to 12 October, eight companies, six of which were equipped with 2\u00bd-ton 6x6 trucks and two with 10-ton semi-trailers, were withdrawn from the Red Ball Express to run a series of Red Lion convoys. These delivered {{convert|18000|LT|t}} to the 21st Army Group, half of which went to the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The eight companies were replaced by provisional companies formed from the personnel and vehicles of the newly-arrived [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[95th Infantry Division (United States)|95th]], and [[104th Infantry Division (United States)|104th Infantry Divisions]].{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=139\u2013140}}  \n\nThe achievements of the Red Ball Express came at a high price. It consumed {{convert|300000|USgal|l}} of MT80 a day.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=509}} Drivers drove their vehicles at twice the {{convert|25|mi}} speed limit, and trucks carried double their nominal loads. The practice of overloading vehicles had the official sanction of the War Department, but testing of this had been carried out at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and conditions in France were more grueling. Consumption of the most common type of tire, the 750 x 20 8-ply, rose from an average of 29,142 per month from June to August to 55,059 in September. By 9 October, there were only 2,000 spares on the continent and 46,596 left in the UK. Nearly two thirds of the loss of tires was attributable to running over carelessly discarded C-ration cans that littered the roads. Vehicles were run without proper maintenance, and dry batteries, lack of oil and loose nuts and bolts caused breakdowns. Driver fatigue was also a factor; round trips sometimes went for 48 to 65 hours. In one convoy, eight semi-trailers hauling gasoline went over an embankment. The following day, eight 2\u00bd-ton trucks repeated this feat at the same location. Ordnance personnel noted instances of vehicles that had been sabotaged. By the end of September, 5,750 vehicles required major repairs.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=571}}{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=131}}\n\n===Air supply===\nAlthough fast and flexible, air supply had many disadvantages, the main one being low tonnage capacity, but the variable availability of transport aircraft, their vulnerability to enemy fighters, and their susceptibility to bad weather were also limiting factors. [[Airdrop]]ping was seldom used in the early stages of the Normandy campaign. Airdrops were made in support of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions in the first days, to a field hospital on 8 June, and to an anti-aircraft unit isolated by the June storm.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=572\u2013573}} On 10 and 11 August the 2nd Battalion, [[120th Infantry Regiment (United States)|120th Infantry]], isolated by the [[Operation L\u00fcttich|German counterattack at Mortain]], received supplies by air drop.{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=489}} Only one administrative airfield was available by the end of July, at [[Colleville-sur-Mer]] near Omaha Beach.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=575}} Cross-Channel air flights commenced on 10 June.{{sfn|Cosmas|Cowdrey|1992|pp=256\u2013257}} Air supply was heavily used during the week after the storm, with {{convert|1400|LT|t}} of supplies, mostly ammunition, landed. By the end of July, {{convert|7000|LT|t}} had been delivered by air.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=572\u2013573}} In addition, 25,959 casualties were evacuated by air in June and July, compared to 39,118 by sea.{{sfn|Cosmas|Cowdrey|1992|pp=256\u2013257}}\n\n[[File:Douglas c47-a skytrain n1944a cotswoldairshow 2010 arp.jpg|thumb|right|A C-47 transport]]\nTo relieve pressure on the over-burdened Motor Transport Brigade, recourse was made to air supply. On 15 August, SHAEF made available an allocation of air transport capable of delivering up to {{convert|2000|LT|t}} per day to the Le Mans area. Deliveries to a newly-opened air field there began on 19 August. Due to bad weather and problems with the airfield, an average of {{convert|600|LT|t}} per day was delivered over the following week. By 22 August, there were 383 fully-loaded [[C-47]] transport aircraft in the UK awaiting despatch. The problem was a lack of suitable landing fields. Rehabilitating captured German airfields or building new one required the movement of engineer stores using scarce motor transport. 12th Army Group allocated {{convert|2100|LT|t}} per day to such stores during the pursuit, but the Ninth Air Force gave priority to forward fighter airfields.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=575\u2013576}} The early capture of Paris on 25 August forced Eisenhower to allocate {{convert|500|LT|t}} per day to civil relief supplies, mainly food, medical supplies and soap.{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=626}}\n\nDeliveries by air peaked at {{convert|2900|LT|t}} (including {{convert|500|LT|t}} to Paris) on 26 and 27 August, but then tailed off as the C-47s were withdrawn for airborne operations on 29 August. To make up for them, the [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] made 100 B-24 aircraft available, which had to be modified to carry cargo, but these required longer air fields and increased intervals between landings. During the week of 27 August to 2 September, {{convert|4470|LT|t}} was delivered by air, of which {{convert|443|LT|t}} was carried by B-24s, but only {{convert|1877|LT|t}} was delivered to the 12th Army Group; {{convert|917|LT|t}} went to 21st Army Group and {{convert|1676|LT|t}} to Paris. On 3 September, SHAEF ordered the [[First Allied Airborne Army]] to release 600 C-47s for air supply duties. On 14 September they were again withdrawn, for [[Operation Market Garden]]. Between 20 August and 16 September, {{convert|23216|LT|t}} of supplies were delivered by air, of which {{convert|12799|LT|t}} went to the 12th Army Group, {{convert|7766|LT|t}} to the 21st Army Group, and {{convert|2651|LT|t}} to Paris.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=578\u2013582}} From 18 September, B-24s began shipping POL in bulk because the stock of jerricans in the UK had nearly been exhausted. By the end of the month, over {{convert|2500000|USgal|l}} had been delivered this way.{{sfn|Ross|Romanus|1965|p=656}}\n\n===Ports===\n{{multiple image\n | width = 300\n | image1 = Cherbourg - demolitions and underwater obstacles-1.jpg\n | image2 = Cherbourg - demolitions and underwater obstacles-2.jpg\n | footer = Cherbourg demolitions and underwater obstacles\n}}\n\nThe first deep water port captured by the Allies was Cherbourg, which fell on 26 June. An advance party surveyed the port the following day. The main railway station, the Gare Maritime, was badly damaged, as were the two main quays, the Quai Normandie and the Quai de France.{{sfn|Crist |1945|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=352\u2013353}} The Digue du Homet, a {{convert|3300|by|70|ft|adj=on}} mole, had two {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} wide craters in it. The western breakwater of the inner port, the Petite Rade, was severed by two large craters, and the berth for coal coaters, the Quai Homet, had nine {{convert|40|to|50|ft|adj=on}} craters.{{sfn|Crist |1945|pp=23\u201324}} The entrances to the three basins were obstructed by sunken ships and barges, and the basins themselves were filled with sunken barges, tugs, coasters and trawlers. The German naval commander in Cherbourg, [[Konteradmiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Walter Hennecke]], now a prisoner of war, was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] for the demolition of the port, but the damage was not as extensive as the Germans believed. The demolitions had been prepared well in advance, but the final phase had not been carried out, presumably because the personnel responsible were killed or captured when the city fell.{{sfn|Crist |1945|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=352\u2013353}}\n\nRehabilitation work was undertaken by the 1056th Port Construction and Repair Group, with the [[332nd Engineer General Service Regiment|332nd]] and 342nd Engineer Regiments and the 333rd Engineer Special Service Regiment assigned. The first priority was creating a landing site for [[DUKW]]s on the Nouvelle Plage, a bathing beach. This was ready on 6 July, but the DUKWs could not come ashore because the Grande and Petite Rades had been sown with mines.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=353\u2013354}} Twenty US Navy [[coastal minesweeper]]s and the British 9th and 159th Minesweeping Flotillas were engaged in mine clearance. Many of the mines were of a delayed action kind that only became active after a set number of days. Eight acoustic and eight magnetic sweeps were conducted every morning for 85 days. By 13 July, 133 mines had been swept, of which 86 were magnetic or acoustic. This did not include the small concrete-encased \"Katie mines\" sown in shallow waters that had to be removed by divers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Melia|first=Tamara Moser|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=lg3KpfzC2BoC&dq=damn%20the%20torpedoes&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q=katie&f=false|title=Damn the Torpedoes: A Short History of U.S. Naval Mine Countermeasures, 1777-1991|date=1991|publisher=Naval Historical Center, Department of the Navy|year=|isbn=978-0-945274-07-0|location=|pages=58|language=en}}</ref> Three minesweepers were lost to mines, as were some small craft and barges.{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=70}}{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=216\u2013218}} The first four Liberty ships entered the Grande Rade in 16 July, and were unloaded at anchor into DUKWS.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=352\u2013353}}  \n\n[[File:Cherbourg 1944-Gare Maritime-2.jpg|thumb|left|Destruction at the Gare Maritime at Cherbourg]]\nThe 332nd Engineer General Service Regiment filled in the craters in the Digue du Homet, and repaired the road and railway lines leading to it. Two berths were prepared for Twickenham ferries, British vessels built to carry locomotives and rolling stock. The first arrived on 29 July with several {{convert|65|LT|t|adj=on}} diesel electric locomotives and rolling stock. The first Liberty ship docked there on 9 August. Getting the naval base working to accommodate Liberty ships involved repairing demolished bridges. It ultimately provided eleven berths for Liberty ships. The wreckage of the Gare Maritime was found to contain twenty-four freight cars loaded with mines that the German had apparently not had time to detonate. These were carefully deactivated and removed. On 10 August, the [[U.S. Army Engineer Port Repair ship|port repair ship]] ''[[Junior N. Van Noy (ship)|Junior N. Van Noy]]'', a converted [[Great Lakes]] steamer named after [[Junior Van Noy]], an engineer posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] in the [[Battle of Finschhafen]], arrived with specialized salvage equipment. An access channel to the Darse Transatlantique was cleared of debris and mines by 18 September, and the first Liberty ship docked there on 8 October.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=352\u2013353}} By September, Cherbourg was the second largest port supporting the US forces after [[Marseilles]]. Between 16 July and the end of the war, it handled 2,137 ships, which discharged {{convert|2816740|LT|t}} of cargo and 130,210 passengers. In addition, 307,939 passengers were embarked, including 124,206 German prisoners of war and 148,753 wounded Allied soldiers.{{sfn|Morison|1957|pp=216\u2013218}}\n\n[[File:Cherbourg1944-Pont.jpg|thumb|right|Partially demolished bridge in Cherbourg]]\nThe first port captured in the breakout was [[Granville]] on 31 July. Like Cherbourg, it had been subject to systematic demolition, with quays cratered, cranes tipped into the water, and the harbor blocked with sunken craft. Rehabilitation was undertaken by the 1055th and 1058th Port Construction and Repair Groups. It was operated solely as a coal port, and averaged {{convert|1244|LT|t}} per day from when it was opened on 18 September until it closed on 21 April 1945. [[Rouen]] on the tidal [[Seine]] was captured on 30 August, but was not usable until downstream [[Le Havre]] was taken on 12 September. Le Havre, the second largest port on France, was heavily damaged not just by German demolitions but by Allied land, sea and aerial bombardment. Moreover, an American line of communications from Le Havre would cross that of the British. Accordingly, it was decided not to attempt its complete rehabilitation. The first vessels entered Le Havre on 2 October, but mines and obstructions limited it to landing craft and coasters until 13 October, when the first Liberty ship was able to dock. Coasters carrying POL began discharging at Rouen on 15 October. [[Antwerp]], one of the world's largest ports, was captured largely intact on 4 September, but could not be used until the [[Scheldt]] estuary was cleared and the sluice gates were repaired. The first American Liberty ship did not dock there until 28 November.{{sfn|Beck|Bortz|Lynch|Mayo|1985|pp=359\u2013364}}\n\n==Outcome==\nOn 4 September, the commander of the 21st Army Group, British [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], put a proposal to Eisenhower. He contended that a simultaneous advance on both the [[Ruhr]] and the [[Saarland|Saar]] regions, as contemplated in the original Overlord plan, was not logistically feasible. He therefore recommended that the maximum resources be concentrated on the advance on the Ruhr, and then towards Berlin, which could best be supported, and was most likely to produce results. In his response the following day, Eisenhower rejected this. Contending that the bulk of the German army in the West had been destroyed, and that an advance on Berlin was logistically infeasible, he decided to continue with the original plan and advance on a broad front, capturing both the Ruhr and the Saar. Eisenhower suggested that the ports of Le Havre and Antwerp would be opened during the advance,{{sfn|Rawson|2012|pp=138\u2013139}} but the former was not yet in Allied hands, and while the latter had been captured on 4 September,{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=686}} it was not expected to be opened before 1 November.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1951|p=8}} This became known as the broad front controversy, and was the subject of much debate in the post-war years.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1960|p=420}}\n\n[[File:Ardennes Allied Commanders, Maastricht meeting, 7 Dec 1944 (02).jpg|thumb|left|Senior Allied commanders. Left to right: [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]], [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Tedder]], [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] and [[William H. Simpson|Simpson]] ]]\nSubsequent events demonstrated that Eisenhower's decision was the wrong one; the German army in the West was not destroyed and neither the Ruhr nor the Saar was reached in 1944. It is possible that the Ruhr would have been reached had Montgomery's proposal been adopted. The British axis in the north involved an advance of {{convert|105|to|115|mi}}. It could be supported by ports that were captured such as [[Dieppe]], [[Boulogne]] and [[Ostend]], and there were good rail links that supplied much of 21st Army Group's needs.{{sfn|Dick|2016|pp=296\u2013297}} Bradley and Patton advocated an advance on the Saar that ignored logistical considerations. They contended that this southern axis was less well defended than the northern one, and there was good reason for that. It would have captured no ports, and its support would have depended almost entirely on an extended version of the Red Ball Express. Given the strain on personnel and the wear and tear on vehicles, this would have been difficult to sustain. Acts of sabotage were likely as the advance entered Germany, as was interference by the ''Luftwaffe'' once it was beyond the range of fighter cover.{{sfn|Dick|2016|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nLieutenant Colonel Harold L. Mack, who served on the COMZ staff, described the failure to implement Operation Chastity as the \"Critical Error of World War II\",{{sfn|Mack|1981|pp=1\u20133}} but historian [[Russell Weigley]] regarded the commitment to Brittany as wasteful of resources that would have been better spent supporting the drive to the east. Although Bradley's decision entailed grave risk, the US Army's logistical difficulties in the pursuit were not a result of inadequate port resources\u2014in November there were still some {{convert|600000|LT|t}} of supplies stockpiled in the Normandy lodgment area. Rather, the problem was the inability to deliver them.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|p=133}}{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=292}} Nor was the pursuit halted solely by a shortage of POL. The pursuit resulted in large quantities of equipment being damaged, worn out, and written off. In November, SHAEF reported to the War Department that each month, 700 mortars, 375 medium and 125 light tanks, 900 2\u00bd-ton trucks, 1,500 jeeps, and 100 artillery pieces had been written off. Tank losses in August and September respectively had been 25.3 percent and 16.5 percent of establishment, and the reserves were exhausted. Over 15,000 vehicles were deadlined, awaiting repairs or parts.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=292}}\n\nWhen the army commanders and their staffs ran into foreseeable logistical difficulties, they blamed each other, they blamed COMZ, and they blamed the British.{{sfn|Dick|2016|p=292}} In December 1944, Somervell sent Lieutenant General [[LeRoy Lutes]], the ASF director of operations, to study the ETO's difficulties. He found that the army commanders had little confidence in COMZ, and that they had little logistical acumen. Lutes credited the commander of the [[Ninth United States Army|Ninth Army]], Lieutenant General [[William H. Simpson]], with the best understanding of logistics.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=348\u2013349}} Lutes noted that the First Army commander, Lieutenant General [[Courtney Hodges]], was \"a man intolerant of supply shortcomings, who has not studied supply and does not intend to\".{{sfn|Hogan|2000|p=165}} Given that Bradley, Hodges, Patton and Simpson had all attended the [[Command and General Staff College]] and [[United States Army War College|Army War College]],{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|pp=30, 153, 252, 297}} this pointed to a deficiency in the Army's training of senior officers.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|pp=348\u2013349}}\n\nA great victory had been won, but there remained a lingering impression that even more could have been accomplished, given the resources available. The supply shortages that occurred were not invariably the fault of COMZ; many had their origins back in the United States. Nonetheless, the logistical plan lacked the flexibility needed to cope with a rapidly changing operational situation. This was exacerbated by senior commanders subordinating logistical imperatives to operational opportunities. This was exacerbated by the poor supply discipline of the American soldier.{{sfn|Waddell|1994|pp=164\u2013165}} The decision to continue the pursuit beyond the Seine had long-term and far-reaching effects in the form of the attrition of equipment, failure to establish a proper supply depot system, neglect of the development of ports, and inadequate stockpiles in forward areas. These factors would be keenly felt over the months to come.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1959|p=509}} Historian Roland Ruppenthal concluded that in the end, \"operations, to paraphrase an old maxim, had definitely become the art of the logistically feasible.\"{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1960|p=428}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Albrecht |first=Frank M. |title=Engineer Aspects of Operation Bolero |journal=The Military Engineer |volume=42 |issue=286 |date=March\u2013April 1950 |pages=116\u2013120 |jstor=44561081 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last = Ancell |first = R.

According to the New York Times, NATO forces would most likely have a minimal battlefield role, with the exception of some special operations advisers.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nAn important question for the NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed it would make the Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nA major challenge was that Afghanistan would not have an effective air force before 2017, if then.  As a consequence American officials said that NATO airpower would remain in Afghanistan after 2014 but will likely only be used on behalf of NATO and American troops and perhaps Afghan units that are accompanied by NATO advisers. NATO forces relied heavily on airpower for airstrikes, supply and medical evacuation since Afghanistan's roads are in poor condition and often seeded with bombs. To compensate for Afghanistan's limited airpower, the United States was working on a number of fixes, including providing Afghan forces with armored vehicles that would be equipped with mortars and assault guns. The United States was looking into expanding the purchase of turboprop planes for the Afghans. In addition the U.S. was also trying to help Afghan pilots learn to fly at night.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" /> Equally troubling was according to the New York Times the problem of medical evacuations. Because after 2014 the Afghans would almost certainly need to rely on a system that depended more on ground transportation than helicopters the United States wanted to help Afghanistan forces develop more field hospitals.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nPlans for the follow-on military presence are being formulated in the Pentagon, where the largest of several preliminary options calls for about 10,000 troops, with several other NATO governments penciled in for several hundred each. According to these preliminary plans, ISAF's successor would be based in Kabul, with most U.S. training and counterterrorism troops probably stationed in Kandahar and at the air base at Bagram. Both locations are to be converted to Afghan ownership. Smaller counterterrorism units of the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] would be positioned primarily in the eastern part of the country, where most of their activities take place. Italy, in charge of the ISAF mission in Herat in western Afghanistan, would remain there to train Afghans. Germany would do the same in Mazar-e Sharif in the north. It is unclear what would happen at Camp Bastion, the British headquarters in Helmand province.<ref name=\"WP20121205\">{{cite news|last=DeYoung|first=Karen|title=U.S. reducing plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-reducing-plans-for-large-civilian-force-in-post-2014-afghanistan/2012/12/05/67c7d9a8-380f-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_story.html|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe size of the American military presence after 2014 will help determine the size of the American civilian footprint.

According to the New York Times, NATO forces would most likely have a minimal battlefield role, with the exception of some special operations advisers.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nAn important question for the NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed it would make the Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nA major challenge was that Afghanistan would not have an effective air force before 2017, if then.  As a consequence American officials said that NATO airpower would remain in Afghanistan after 2014 but will likely only be used on behalf of NATO and American troops and perhaps Afghan units that are accompanied by NATO advisers. NATO forces relied heavily on airpower for airstrikes, supply and medical evacuation since Afghanistan's roads are in poor condition and often seeded with bombs. To compensate for Afghanistan's limited airpower, the United States was working on a number of fixes, including providing Afghan forces with armored vehicles that would be equipped with mortars and assault guns. The United States was looking into expanding the purchase of turboprop planes for the Afghans. In addition the U.S. was also trying to help Afghan pilots learn to fly at night.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" /> Equally troubling was according to the New York Times the problem of medical evacuations. Because after 2014 the Afghans would almost certainly need to rely on a system that depended more on ground transportation than helicopters the United States wanted to help Afghanistan forces develop more field hospitals.<ref name=\"NYT20121126\" />\n\nPlans for the follow-on military presence are being formulated in the Pentagon, where the largest of several preliminary options calls for about 10,000 troops, with several other NATO governments penciled in for several hundred each. According to these preliminary plans, ISAF's successor would be based in Kabul, with most U.S. training and counterterrorism troops probably stationed in Kandahar and at the air base at Bagram. Both locations are to be converted to Afghan ownership. Smaller counterterrorism units of the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] would be positioned primarily in the eastern part of the country, where most of their activities take place. Italy, in charge of the ISAF mission in Herat in western Afghanistan, would remain there to train Afghans. Germany would do the same in Mazar-e Sharif in the north. It is unclear what would happen at Camp Bastion, the British headquarters in Helmand province.<ref name=\"WP20121205\">{{cite news|last=DeYoung|first=Karen|title=U.S. reducing plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-reducing-plans-for-large-civilian-force-in-post-2014-afghanistan/2012/12/05/67c7d9a8-380f-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_story.html|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe size of the American military presence after 2014 will help determine the size of the American civilian footprint.

In the first phase the U.S. will initially reduce its forces in Afghanistan by about 5,000 troops to 8,600 within 135 days of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. During the gradual withdrawal, the Taliban and the Afghan government would have to work out a more concrete power-sharing settlement.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

Binnya Thau yielded up the throne to her son-in-law [[Dhammazedi]] in 1472, retiring to [[Dagon Township|Dagon]]. During her last illness she had her bed placed so that she could look upon the gilded dome of the stupa. The Mon face of the Shwedagon inscription catalogues a list of repairs beginning in 1436 and finishing during Dhammazedi's reign. By the beginning of the 16th century, Shwedagon Pagoda had become the most famous [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site in Burma.<ref name=Hall1960/>\n\n[[File:Shwedagon Pagoda 1900.JPG|thumb|left|Shwedagon Pagoda in the 1890s]]\nA series of earthquakes during the following centuries caused damage. The worst damage was caused by a 1768 earthquake that brought down the top of the stupa, but King [[Hsinbyushin]] later raised it to its current height of {{Convert|99|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. A new [[hti|crown umbrella]] was donated by King [[Mindon Min]] in 1871 after the annexation of [[Lower Burma]] by the British. An earthquake of moderate intensity in October 1970 put the shaft of the crown umbrella visibly out of alignment. A scaffold was erected and extensive repairs were made.\n\nFrom 22 February 2012 to 7 March 2012, devotees celebrated the annual Shwedagon Pagoda Festival for the first time since 1988, when it was banned by the governing [[State Peace and Development Council|State Law and Order Restoration Council]].<ref name=yahoo/><ref name=mizz/> Celebrations began at the Rahu corner of the pagoda's ''yinbyin'' platform, at the Maha Pahtan and Aung Myay central platforms, at 9 am. on 22 February.<ref name=weeklyeleven/> The Shwedagon Pagoda Festival, which is the largest [[pagoda festival]] in the country, begins during the new moon of the month of [[Tabaung]] in the traditional [[Burmese calendar]] and continues until the full moon.<ref name=mizz/>\n\nThe pagoda is listed on the [[Yangon City Heritage List]].\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Shwedagon-Pagoda-anatomy.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing the various architectural features that comprise the design of the Shwedagon Pagoda]]\nThe stupa's [[pedestal|plinth]] is made of bricks covered with [[gold]] plates. Above the base are terraces that only [[Bhikkhu|monks]] and other males can access. Next is the bell-shaped part of the stupa. Above that is the turban, then the inverted almsbowl, inverted and upright lotus petals, the banana bud and then the [[Hti|umbrella crown]]. The crown is tipped with 5,448 diamonds and 2,317 rubies. Immediately before the diamond bud is a flag-shaped vane. The very top\u2014the diamond bud\u2014is tipped with a 76 carat (15 g) diamond.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe gold seen on the stupa is made of genuine gold plates, covering the brick structure and attached by traditional rivets.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} People all over the country, as well as monarchs in its history, have donated gold to the pagoda to maintain it. The practice continues to this day after being started in the 15th century by the Queen [[Shin Sawbu]] (Binnya Thau), who gave her weight in gold.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n[[File:South Stairways.JPG|thumb|left|Southern entrance in 1890s]]\n[[File:Chinthe.JPG|thumb|A pair of [[Chinthe|leogryphs]] guarding the entrance to the walkway leading up Singuttara Hill to Shwedagon Pagoda]]\nThere are four entrances, each leading up a flight of steps to the platform on Singuttara Hill. A pair of giant [[Chinthe|leogryphs]] guards each entrance. The eastern and southern approaches have vendors selling books, good luck charms, images of the Buddha, candles, gold leaf, incense sticks, prayer flags, streamers, miniature umbrellas and flowers.\n\nIt is customary to circumnavigate Buddhist stupas in a clockwise direction. In accordance with this principle, one may begin at the eastern directional shrine, which houses a statue of [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], the first Buddha of the present [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]. Next, at the southern directional shrine, is a statue of the second Buddha, [[Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana Buddha|Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana]]. Next, at the western directional shrine, is that of the third Buddha, [[Kassapa Buddha|Kassapa]]. Finally, at the northern directional shrine, is that of the fourth Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]].<ref name=Billinge2014/>\n\n== Rituals ==\n[[File:Barack Obama pours water over Friday Buddha.jpg|thumb|left|US President [[Barack Obama]] pours water over the Buddha statue at the Friday planetary post; Obama was born on a Friday.]]\nMost Burmese people are [[Theravada]] Buddhists, and many also follow practices which originated in [[Hindu astrology]]. Burmese astrology recognizes the [[Planets in astrology|seven planets of astrology]] \u2014 the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In addition, it recognizes two other planets, [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. All the Burmese names of the planets are borrowed from Hindu astrology, but the Burmese Rahu and Ketu are different from the Hindu Rahu and Ketu. The Burmese consider them to be distinct and separate planets, whereas Hindu astrology considers them to be either the Dragon's Head and Tails, or Ascending and Descending Nodes. To the Burmese people, Ketu is the king of all planets. As in many other languages, the Burmese name the seven days of their week after the seven planets, but Burmese astrology recognizes an eight-day week, with Wednesday being divided into two days; until 6 p.m. it is Wednesday, but after 6.pm. until midnight it is Rahu's day.<ref name=\"skidmore\">Skidmore, Monique. ''Burma At The Turn Of The Twenty-first Century''. University of Hawaii Press, 2005, p. 162.</ref>\n\nIt is important for Burmese Buddhists to know on which day of the week they were born, as this determines their [[Burmese zodiac#Weekdays|planetary post]]. There are eight planetary posts, as Wednesday is split in two ([[12-hour clock|a.m. and p.m.]]). They are marked by animals that represent the day \u2014 [[garuda]] for Sunday, tiger for Monday, lion for Tuesday, tusked elephant for Wednesday morning, tuskless elephant for Wednesday afternoon, mouse for Thursday, guinea pig for Friday and [[n\u0101ga]] for Saturday. Each planetary post has a Buddha image and devotees offer flowers and prayer flags and pour water on the image with a prayer and a wish. At the base of the post behind the image is a guardian angel, and underneath the image is the animal representing that particular day. The plinth of the stupa is octagonal and also surrounded by eight small shrines (one for each planetary post). It is customary to circumnavigate Buddhist stupas in a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pilgrim, on his way up the steps of the pagoda, buys flowers, candles, coloured flags and streamers. These are to be placed at the stupa in a [[d\u0101na|symbolic act of giving]], which is an important aspect of Buddhist teaching. There are donation boxes located in various places around the pagoda to receive voluntary offerings which may be given to the pagoda for general purposes. As of December 2017 foreigners are charged a 10,000 [[Kyat]]s (approx. US$7) entrance fee.\n\n== Shwedagon in literature ==\n[[Rudyard Kipling]] described his 1889 visit to Shwedagon Pagoda ten years later in ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]''<ref name=seatosea/>\n\n{{cquote|Then, a golden mystery upheaved itself on the horizon, a beautiful winking wonder that blazed in the sun, of a shape that was neither Muslim dome nor Hindu temple-spire.

But it was not a thing to be sworn at. It explained in the first place why we took Rangoon, and in the second why we pushed on to see what more of rich or rare the land held. Up till that sight my uninstructed eyes could not see that the land differed much in appearance from the [[Sundarbans|Sunderbuns]], but the golden dome said: 'This is Burma, and it will be quite unlike any land you know about.' 'It's a famous old shrine o' sorts,' said my companion, 'and now the Tounghoo-Mandalay line is open, pilgrims are flocking down by the thousand to see it. It lost its big gold top\u2014'thing that they call a 'htee\u2014in an earthquake: that's why it's all hidden by bamboo-work for a third of its height. You should see it when it's all uncovered. They're regilding it now.'}}\n\n== War and invasion ==\n[[File:The British Army in Burma 1945 SE4108.jpg|thumb|British soldiers remove their shoes while visiting Shwedagon Pagoda during World War II]]\nIn 1608 the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] adventurer [[Filipe de Brito e Nicote]], known as ''Nga Zinka'' to the Burmese, plundered the Shwedagon Pagoda. His men took the 300-ton [[Great Bell of Dhammazedi]], donated in 1485 by King Dhammazedi. De Brito's intention was to melt the bell down to make cannons, but it fell into the [[Bago River]] when he was carrying it across. To this date, it has not been recovered.\n\nTwo centuries later, the [[United Kingdom|British]] landed on May 11, 1824 during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. They immediately seized and occupied the Shwedagon Pagoda and used it as a fortress until they left two years later. There was pillaging and vandalism, and one officer's excuse for digging a tunnel into the depths of the stupa was to find out if it could be used as a gunpowder magazine. The Maha Gandha (lit. great sweet sound) Bell, a 23-ton bronze bell cast in 1779 and donated by King Singu and popularly known as the [[Singu Min Bell]], was carried off with the intention to ship it to [[Kolkata]]. It met the same fate as the Dhammazedi Bell and fell into the river. When the British failed in their attempts to recover it, the people offered to help provided it could be restored to the stupa. The British, thinking it would be in vain, agreed, upon which divers went in to tie hundreds of bamboo poles underneath the bell and floated it to the surface. There has been much confusion over this bell and the 42-ton [[Tharrawaddy Min Bell]] donated in 1841 by [[Tharrawaddy Min]] along with 20&nbsp;kg of gold plating; this massive ornate bell hangs in its pavilion in the northeast corner of the stupa. A different but less plausible version of the account of the Singu Min Bell was given by Lt. J.E. Alexander in 1827.<ref name=Bird1897/> This bell can be seen hung in another pavilion in the northwest of the pagoda platform.\n\nThe [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] saw the British re-occupation of the Shwedagon in April 1852, only this time the stupa was to remain under their military control for 77 years, until 1929, although the people were given access to the Paya.\n\nDuring the British occupation and fortification of the Pagoda, Lord Maung [[Htaw Lay]], the most prominent Mon-Burmese in British Burma, successfully prevented the British Army from looting of the treasures; he eventually restored the Pagoda to its former glory and status with the financial help from the British rulers. This extract is from the book \u201cA Twentieth Century Burmese Matriarch\u201d written by his great-great-great grand daughter Khin Thida.\n\n{{cquote|After retirement he moved back to Rangoon area still in Burmese hands but very soon destined for the next annexation. He was again caught up in war but this time he had a great fortune of supporting religious ventures and gaining tremendous merit. His good karma and leadership abilities led him to the task of saving the great Shwedagon Pagoda from imminent destruction and sacking of its treasures by British troops in the second Anglo-Burmese War.\n\nThe great Buddhist shrine had been fortified by the British troops in the 1824 war and was again used as a fort in 1852. When he heard of the fortification and sacking of the shrine, he sent a letter of appeal directly to the British India Office in London stopping the desecration. He then obtained compensation from the British Commissioner of Burma Mr. Phayre and began the renovations of the Pagoda in 1855 with public support and donations.\n\nHe became the founding trustee of the Shwedagon Pagoda Trust and he was awarded the title of KSM by the [[British Raj]] for his public service. He died at the age of 95, bequeathing his prestige and high repute to his large family and descendants.}}\n\n== Political area ==\n[[File:2007 Myanmar protests 4.jpg|thumb|Protesters at Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon]]\nIn 1920, students from Burma's only university met at a pavilion on the southwest corner of the Shwedagon pagoda and planned a protest strike against the new University Act which they believed would only benefit the elite and perpetuate colonial rule. This place is now commemorated by a memorial. The result of the ensuing University Boycott was the establishment of \"national schools\" financed and run by the Burmese people; this day has been commemorated as the Burmese [[National Day]] since. During the second university students strike in history of 1936, the terraces of the Shwedagon were again where the student strikers camped out.\n\nIn 1938, oilfield workers on strike hiked all the way from the oilfields of [[Chauk]] and [[Yenangyaung]] in central Burma to Rangoon to establish a strike camp at the Shwedagon Pagoda. This strike, supported by the public as well as students and came to be known as the '1300 Revolution' after the Burmese calendar year, was broken up by the police who, in their boots whereas Burmese would remove their shoes in pagoda precincts, raided the strike camps on the pagoda.\n\nThe \"shoe question\" on the pagoda has always been a sensitive issue to the Burmese people since colonial times. The Burmese people had always removed shoes at all Buddhist pagodas. Hiram Cox, the British envoy to the Burmese Court, in 1796, observed the tradition by not visiting the pagoda rather than take off his shoes. However, after the annexation of lower Burma, European visitors as well as troops posted at the pagoda openly flouted the tradition. [[U Dhammaloka]] publicly confronted a police officer over wearing shoes at the pagoda in 1902. It was not until 1919 that the British authorities finally issued a regulation prohibiting footwear in the precincts of the pagoda. However, they put in an exception that employees of the government on official business were allowed footwear. The regulation and its exception clause moved to stir up the people and played a role in the beginnings of the nationalist movement. Today, no footwear or socks are allowed on the pagoda.\n\nIn January 1946, General [[Aung San]] addressed a mass meeting at the stupa, demanding \"independence now\" from the British with a thinly veiled threat of a general strike and uprising. Forty-two years later, on August 26, 1988, his daughter, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] addressed another mass meeting of 500,000 people at the stupa, demanding democracy from the military regime and calling the [[8888 Uprising]] the second struggle for independence.\n\n=== September 2007 protests ===\nIn September 2007, during nationwide demonstrations against the military regime and its recently enacted price increases, protesting monks were denied access to the pagoda for several days before the government finally relented and permitted them in.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, 20,000 [[bhikkhu]]s and [[thilashin]]s (the largest protest in 20 years) marched at the Shwedagon Pagoda, [[Yangon]]. On Monday, 30,000 people led by 15,000 monks marched from Shwedagon Pagoda and past the offices of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s opposition [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) party. Comedian [[Zarganar]] and star [[Kyaw Thu]] brought food and water to the monks. On Saturday, monks marched to greet Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under [[house arrest]]. On Sunday, about 150 nuns joined the marchers.<ref name=google/><ref name=radionz/> On September 25, 2007, 2,000 monks and supporters defied threats from Myanmar's junta. They marched to Yangon streets at Shwedagon Pagoda amid army trucks and the warning of [[Brigadier-General]] [[Myint Maung]] not to violate Buddhist \"''rules and regulations''.\"<ref name=guardian/>\n\nOn September 26, 2007, clashes between security forces and thousands of protesters led by Buddhist monks in Myanmar have left at least five protesters dead by Myanmar security forces, according to opposition reports,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} in an anticipated crackdown. Earlier in the day security authorities used tear gas, warning shots and force to break up a peaceful demonstration by scores of monks gathered around the Shwedagon Pagoda.\n\nThe web site reports that protesting \"monks were beaten and bundled into waiting army trucks,\" adding about 50 monks were arrested and taken to undisclosed locations.\nIn addition, the opposition said \"soldiers with assault rifles have sealed off sacred Buddhist monasteries ... as well as other flashpoints of anti-government protests.\"\nIt reports that the violent crackdown came as about 100 monks defied a ban by venturing into a cordoned-off area around the Shwedagon Pagoda, Myanmar's holiest Buddhist shrine.\n\nIt says that authorities ordered the crowd to disperse, but witnesses said the monks sat down and began praying, defying the military government's ban on public assembly.\nSecurity forces at the pagoda \"struck out at demonstrators\" and attacked \"several hundred other monks and supporters,\" the opposition web site detailed.\nMonks were ushered away by authorities and loaded into waiting trucks while several hundred onlookers watched, witnesses said.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Some managed to escape and headed towards the Sule Pagoda, a Buddhist monument and landmark located in Yangon's city centre.\n\n== Replicas ==\n[[File:Uppatasanti Pagoda-02.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Uppatasanti Pagoda]], a replica of Shwedagon Pagoda, in Naypyidaw, Myanmar]]\n[[Uppatasanti Pagoda]]\u2014located in [[Naypyidaw]], the capital of Myanmar\u2014is a replica of Shwedagon Pagoda.

The eastern and southern approaches have vendors selling books, good luck charms, images of the Buddha, candles, gold leaf, incense sticks, prayer flags, streamers, miniature umbrellas and flowers.\n\nIt is customary to circumnavigate Buddhist stupas in a clockwise direction. In accordance with this principle, one may begin at the eastern directional shrine, which houses a statue of [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], the first Buddha of the present [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]. Next, at the southern directional shrine, is a statue of the second Buddha, [[Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana Buddha|Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana]]. Next, at the western directional shrine, is that of the third Buddha, [[Kassapa Buddha|Kassapa]]. Finally, at the northern directional shrine, is that of the fourth Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]].<ref name=Billinge2014/>\n\n== Rituals ==\n[[File:Barack Obama pours water over Friday Buddha.jpg|thumb|left|US President [[Barack Obama]] pours water over the Buddha statue at the Friday planetary post; Obama was born on a Friday.]]\nMost Burmese people are [[Theravada]] Buddhists, and many also follow practices which originated in [[Hindu astrology]]. Burmese astrology recognizes the [[Planets in astrology|seven planets of astrology]] \u2014 the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In addition, it recognizes two other planets, [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. All the Burmese names of the planets are borrowed from Hindu astrology, but the Burmese Rahu and Ketu are different from the Hindu Rahu and Ketu. The Burmese consider them to be distinct and separate planets, whereas Hindu astrology considers them to be either the Dragon's Head and Tails, or Ascending and Descending Nodes. To the Burmese people, Ketu is the king of all planets. As in many other languages, the Burmese name the seven days of their week after the seven planets, but Burmese astrology recognizes an eight-day week, with Wednesday being divided into two days; until 6 p.m. it is Wednesday, but after 6.pm. until midnight it is Rahu's day.<ref name=\"skidmore\">Skidmore, Monique. ''Burma At The Turn Of The Twenty-first Century''. University of Hawaii Press, 2005, p. 162.</ref>\n\nIt is important for Burmese Buddhists to know on which day of the week they were born, as this determines their [[Burmese zodiac#Weekdays|planetary post]]. There are eight planetary posts, as Wednesday is split in two ([[12-hour clock|a.m. and p.m.]]). They are marked by animals that represent the day \u2014 [[garuda]] for Sunday, tiger for Monday, lion for Tuesday, tusked elephant for Wednesday morning, tuskless elephant for Wednesday afternoon, mouse for Thursday, guinea pig for Friday and [[n\u0101ga]] for Saturday. Each planetary post has a Buddha image and devotees offer flowers and prayer flags and pour water on the image with a prayer and a wish. At the base of the post behind the image is a guardian angel, and underneath the image is the animal representing that particular day. The plinth of the stupa is octagonal and also surrounded by eight small shrines (one for each planetary post). It is customary to circumnavigate Buddhist stupas in a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pilgrim, on his way up the steps of the pagoda, buys flowers, candles, coloured flags and streamers. These are to be placed at the stupa in a [[d\u0101na|symbolic act of giving]], which is an important aspect of Buddhist teaching. There are donation boxes located in various places around the pagoda to receive voluntary offerings which may be given to the pagoda for general purposes. As of December 2017 foreigners are charged a 10,000 [[Kyat]]s (approx. US$7) entrance fee.\n\n== Shwedagon in literature ==\n[[Rudyard Kipling]] described his 1889 visit to Shwedagon Pagoda ten years later in ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]''<ref name=seatosea/>\n\n{{cquote|Then, a golden mystery upheaved itself on the horizon, a beautiful winking wonder that blazed in the sun, of a shape that was neither Muslim dome nor Hindu temple-spire. It stood upon a green knoll, and below it were lines of warehouses, sheds, and mills. Under what new god, thought I, are we irrepressible English sitting now?}}\n\n{{cquote|'There's the old Shway Dagon' (pronounced Dagone), said my companion. 'Confound it!' But it was not a thing to be sworn at. It explained in the first place why we took Rangoon, and in the second why we pushed on to see what more of rich or rare the land held. Up till that sight my uninstructed eyes could not see that the land differed much in appearance from the [[Sundarbans|Sunderbuns]], but the golden dome said: 'This is Burma, and it will be quite unlike any land you know about.' 'It's a famous old shrine o' sorts,' said my companion, 'and now the Tounghoo-Mandalay line is open, pilgrims are flocking down by the thousand to see it. It lost its big gold top\u2014'thing that they call a 'htee\u2014in an earthquake: that's why it's all hidden by bamboo-work for a third of its height. You should see it when it's all uncovered. They're regilding it now.'}}\n\n== War and invasion ==\n[[File:The British Army in Burma 1945 SE4108.jpg|thumb|British soldiers remove their shoes while visiting Shwedagon Pagoda during World War II]]\nIn 1608 the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] adventurer [[Filipe de Brito e Nicote]], known as ''Nga Zinka'' to the Burmese, plundered the Shwedagon Pagoda. His men took the 300-ton [[Great Bell of Dhammazedi]], donated in 1485 by King Dhammazedi. De Brito's intention was to melt the bell down to make cannons, but it fell into the [[Bago River]] when he was carrying it across. To this date, it has not been recovered.\n\nTwo centuries later, the [[United Kingdom|British]] landed on May 11, 1824 during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. They immediately seized and occupied the Shwedagon Pagoda and used it as a fortress until they left two years later. There was pillaging and vandalism, and one officer's excuse for digging a tunnel into the depths of the stupa was to find out if it could be used as a gunpowder magazine. The Maha Gandha (lit. great sweet sound) Bell, a 23-ton bronze bell cast in 1779 and donated by King Singu and popularly known as the [[Singu Min Bell]], was carried off with the intention to ship it to [[Kolkata]]. It met the same fate as the Dhammazedi Bell and fell into the river. When the British failed in their attempts to recover it, the people offered to help provided it could be restored to the stupa. The British, thinking it would be in vain, agreed, upon which divers went in to tie hundreds of bamboo poles underneath the bell and floated it to the surface. There has been much confusion over this bell and the 42-ton [[Tharrawaddy Min Bell]] donated in 1841 by [[Tharrawaddy Min]] along with 20&nbsp;kg of gold plating; this massive ornate bell hangs in its pavilion in the northeast corner of the stupa. A different but less plausible version of the account of the Singu Min Bell was given by Lt. J.E. Alexander in 1827.<ref name=Bird1897/> This bell can be seen hung in another pavilion in the northwest of the pagoda platform.\n\nThe [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] saw the British re-occupation of the Shwedagon in April 1852, only this time the stupa was to remain under their military control for 77 years, until 1929, although the people were given access to the Paya.\n\nDuring the British occupation and fortification of the Pagoda, Lord Maung [[Htaw Lay]], the most prominent Mon-Burmese in British Burma, successfully prevented the British Army from looting of the treasures; he eventually restored the Pagoda its former glory and status with the financial help from the British rulers. This extract is from the book \u201cA Twentieth Century Burmese Matriarch\u201d written by his great-great-great grand daughter Khin Thida.\n\n{{cquote|After retirement he moved back to Rangoon area still in Burmese hands but very soon destined for the next annexation. He was again caught up in war but this time he had a great fortune of supporting religious ventures and gaining tremendous merit. His good karma and leadership abilities led him to the task of saving the great Shwedagon Pagoda from imminent destruction and sacking of its treasures by British troops in the second Anglo-Burmese War.\n\nThe great Buddhist shrine had been fortified by the British troops in the 1824 war and was again used as a fort in 1852. When he heard of the fortification and sacking of the shrine, he sent a letter of appeal directly to the British India Office in London stopping the desecration. He then obtained compensation from the British Commissioner of Burma Mr. Phayre and began the renovations of the Pagoda in 1855 with public support and donations.\n\nHe became the founding trustee of the Shwedagon Pagoda Trust and he was awarded the title of KSM by the [[British Raj]] for his public service. He died at the age of 95, bequeathing his prestige and high repute to his large family and descendants.}}\n\n== Political area ==\n[[File:2007 Myanmar protests 4.jpg|thumb|Protesters at Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon]]\nIn 1920, students from Burma's only university met at a pavilion on the southwest corner of the Shwedagon pagoda and planned a protest strike against the new University Act which they believed would only benefit the elite and perpetuate colonial rule. This place is now commemorated by a memorial. The result of the ensuing University Boycott was the establishment of \"national schools\" financed and run by the Burmese people; this day has been commemorated as the Burmese [[National Day]] since. During the second university students strike in history of 1936, the terraces of the Shwedagon were again where the student strikers camped out.\n\nIn 1938, oilfield workers on strike hiked all the way from the oilfields of [[Chauk]] and [[Yenangyaung]] in central Burma to Rangoon to establish a strike camp at the Shwedagon Pagoda. This strike, supported by the public as well as students and came to be known as the '1300 Revolution' after the Burmese calendar year, was broken up by the police who, in their boots whereas Burmese would remove their shoes in pagoda precincts, raided the strike camps on the pagoda.\n\nThe \"shoe question\" on the pagoda has always been a sensitive issue to the Burmese people since colonial times. The Burmese people had always removed shoes at all Buddhist pagodas. Hiram Cox, the British envoy to the Burmese Court, in 1796, observed the tradition by not visiting the pagoda rather than take off his shoes. However, after the annexation of lower Burma, European visitors as well as troops posted at the pagoda openly flouted the tradition. [[U Dhammaloka]] publicly confronted a police officer over wearing shoes at the pagoda in 1902. It was not until 1919 that the British authorities finally issued a regulation prohibiting footwear in the precincts of the pagoda. However, they put in an exception that employees of the government on official business were allowed footwear. The regulation and its exception clause moved to stir up the people and played a role in the beginnings of the nationalist movement. Today, no footwear or socks are allowed on the pagoda.\n\nIn January 1946, General [[Aung San]] addressed a mass meeting at the stupa, demanding \"independence now\" from the British with a thinly veiled threat of a general strike and uprising. Forty-two years later, on August 26, 1988, his daughter, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] addressed another mass meeting of 500,000 people at the stupa, demanding democracy from the military regime and calling the [[8888 Uprising]] the second struggle for independence.\n\n=== September 2007 protests ===\nIn September 2007, during nationwide demonstrations against the military regime and its recently enacted price increases, protesting monks were denied access to the pagoda for several days before the government finally relented and permitted them in.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, 20,000 [[bhikkhu]]s and [[thilashin]]s (the largest protest in 20 years) marched at the Shwedagon Pagoda, [[Yangon]]. On Monday, 30,000 people led by 15,000 monks marched from Shwedagon Pagoda and past the offices of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s opposition [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) party. Comedian [[Zarganar]] and star [[Kyaw Thu]] brought food and water to the monks. On Saturday, monks marched to greet Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under [[house arrest]]. On Sunday, about 150 nuns joined the marchers.<ref name=google/><ref name=radionz/> On September 25, 2007, 2,000 monks and supporters defied threats from Myanmar's junta. They marched to Yangon streets at Shwedagon Pagoda amid army trucks and the warning of [[Brigadier-General]] [[Myint Maung]] not to violate Buddhist \"''rules and regulations''.\"<ref name=guardian/>\n\nOn September 26, 2007, clashes between security forces and thousands of protesters led by Buddhist monks in Myanmar have left at least five protesters dead by Myanmar security forces, according to opposition reports,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} in an anticipated crackdown. Earlier in the day security authorities used tear gas, warning shots and force to break up a peaceful demonstration by scores of monks gathered around the Shwedagon Pagoda.\n\nThe web site reports that protesting \"monks were beaten and bundled into waiting army trucks,\" adding about 50 monks were arrested and taken to undisclosed locations.\nIn addition, the opposition said \"soldiers with assault rifles have sealed off sacred Buddhist monasteries ... as well as other flashpoints of anti-government protests.\"\nIt reports that the violent crackdown came as about 100 monks defied a ban by venturing into a cordoned-off area around the Shwedagon Pagoda, Myanmar's holiest Buddhist shrine.\n\nIt says that authorities ordered the crowd to disperse, but witnesses said the monks sat down and began praying, defying the military government's ban on public assembly.\nSecurity forces at the pagoda \"struck out at demonstrators\" and attacked \"several hundred other monks and supporters,\" the opposition web site detailed.\nMonks were ushered away by authorities and loaded into waiting trucks while several hundred onlookers watched, witnesses said.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Some managed to escape and headed towards the Sule Pagoda, a Buddhist monument and landmark located in Yangon's city centre.\n\n== Replicas ==\n[[File:Uppatasanti Pagoda-02.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Uppatasanti Pagoda]], a replica of Shwedagon Pagoda, in Naypyidaw, Myanmar]]\n[[Uppatasanti Pagoda]]\u2014located in [[Naypyidaw]], the capital of Myanmar\u2014is a replica of Shwedagon Pagoda.
