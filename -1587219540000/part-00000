The city's population grew above 200,000 prior to the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|1988 Spitak earthquake]], when it was devastated. As of the 2011 census, the city had a population of 121,976, down from 150,917 reported at the 2001 census.\n\nGyumri is the seat of the [[Diocese of Shirak]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe area of modern-day Gyumri was known as Armenian '''Kumayri''' during the period of the Kingdom of [[Urartu]]. It is likely that the name was derived from the [[Cimmerians]] who conquered the region and probably founded the settlement. Under the domination of Turkic tribes, ''Kumayri'' was Turkified as ''G\u00fcmr\u00fc''. In 1837, Kumayri was renamed '''Alexandropol''' after Czar Nicholas I's wife, Princess [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Fyodorovna]]. Between 1924 and 1990, the city was known as '''Leninakan''' in honor of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Following independence, the original name '''Kumayri''' was used until 1992, when '''Gyumri''' was chosen as the name of the city.\n\n==History==\n===Classical antiquity and the ancient Armenian Kingdom===\n[[File:Beniamin 11.JPG|thumb|left|The Orontid settlement of Kumayri, 5th\u20132nd centuries BC]]\nArchaeological excavations conducted throughout the Soviet period have shown that the area of modern-day Gyumri has been populated since at least the third millennium BC. The area was mentioned as '''Kumayri''' in the historic [[Urartu|Urartian]] inscriptions dating back to the 8th century BC. This name is probably phonetically associated with [[Cimmerians]], who migrated to the western banks of the Black Sea region from European Lowlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyumri.am/eng/history.html|publisher=Cimmerian|accessdate=14 June 2015|title=Kumayri infosite|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106210024/http://www.gyumri.am/eng/history.html|archivedate=6 November 2012}}</ref> Historians believe that [[Xenophon]] passed through Kumayri during his return to the [[Black Sea]], a journey immortalized in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyumritown.com|title=#1 Internet Site for Gyumri Armenia|publisher=Gyumritown.com|accessdate=15 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217045539/http://gyumritown.com/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the decline of the [[Urartu]] Kingdom by the second half of the 6th century BC, Kumayri became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The remains of a royal settlement found just to the south of Gyumri near the village of [[Beniamin]] dating back to the 5th to 2nd centuries BC, are a great example of the Achemenid influence in the region. However, at the beginning of the 5th century BC, Kumayri became part of the [[Satrapy of Armenia]] under the rule of the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]].

During the first half of the 18th century, Kumayri became part of the [[Erivan Khanate]] under the rule of the [[Afsharid dynasty]] and later under the [[Qajar dynasty]] of Persia.\n\n[[File:Old Gyumri 03.PNG|thumb|left|[[Diorama]] of old Alexandropol with the [[Holy Saviour's Church, Gyumri|Holy Saviour's Church]] (1859\u20131873)]]\nIn June 1804, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] forces controlled over Shirak region at the beginning of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804 and 1813]]. Kumayri became officially part of the Russian Empire at the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] signed on 1 January 1813 between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia.\n\nDuring the period of the Russian rule, Gyumri became one of the developing cities in the [[Transcaucasus]]. In 1829, in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War]], there was a big influx of Armenian population, as around 3,000 families who had migrated from territories in the Ottoman Empire -in particular from the towns of [[Kars]], [[Erzurum]], and [[Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t]]- settled in and around Gyumri. The Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] visited Gyumri during his journey to [[Erzurum]] in 1829.\n[[File:Surb Nshan1.jpg|thumb|Surp Nshan Church of 1870]]\nIn 1837 Russian [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] arrived in Gyumri and changed the name into '''Alexandropol'''. The name was chosen in honour of Tsar Nicholas I's wife, Princess [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte of Prussia]], who had changed her name to ''Alexandra Fyodorovna'' after converting to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]].\n\nA major [[Russia]]n fortress was built on the site in 1837. Alexandropol was finally formed as a town in 1840 to become the centre of the newly established [[Aleksandropolsky Uyezd|Alexandropol Uyezd]], experiencing rapid growth during its first decade. In 1849, the Alexandropol Uyezd became part of the [[Erivan Governorate]]. The town was an important outpost for the Imperial Russian armed forces in the [[Transcaucasus]] where their military barracks were established (e.g., at Poligons, Severski, Kazachi Post). The Russians built the [[Sev Berd]] fortress at the western edge of the city during the 1830s in response to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u20131829]].\n\nAlexandropol had been quickly transformed to become one of the major centres of the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]. After the establishment of the railway station in 1899, Alexandropol witnessed a significant growth and became the largest city in Eastern Armenia. By the end of the 19th century, Alexandropol was home to 430 shopping stores as well as several workshops and cultural institutions.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Alexandropol 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandropol in 1901]]\nIn 1902, the first bank in the city was opened. Until the sovietization of Armenia in 1920, Alexandropol had 31 manufacturing centres including beer, soap, textile, etc. After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 and the Russian withdrawal from the [[South Caucasus]], the Ottoman forces launched a new offensive capturing the city of Alexandropol on 11 May 1918, during the [[Caucasus Campaign]] in [[World War I]]. However, the Ottomans withdrew from the city on 24 December 1918, as a result of the [[Armistice of Mudros]].\n\nThe newly established [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] proclaimed on 28 May 1918, included the city of Alexandropol. On 10 May 1920, the local Bolshevik Armenians aided by the Muslim population, attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in Alexandropol against the Dashnak government of Armenia. The [[May Uprising|uprising]] was suppressed by the Armenian government on May 14 and its leaders were executed. However, during [[Turkish-Armenian War|another Turkish invasion]], Turkish troops attacked Alexandropol and occupied the city on 7 November 1920. Armenia was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on December 3 to stop the Turkish advance towards Yerevan, however a concurrent Soviet invasion led to the fall of the Armenian government on December 2. The Turkish forces withdrew from Alexandropol after the [[Treaty of Kars]] was signed in October 1921 by the unrecognized Soviet and Turkish governments.<ref>Hovannisian.

It was inaugurated in 1961 and is the second largest airport in Armenia. At the beginning of 2006, the government of Armenia felt the importance of having a second international airport, when adverse weather conditions meant that many flights had to be diverted from Yerevan's [[Zvartnots International Airport]] into Gyumri's Shirak Airport. New air traffic control equipment allowed airport workers to identify planes in a {{convert|400|km|adj=on|abbr=off}} radius.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armats.com/eng/activity/services/ta.htm|title=armats|publisher=Armats.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nFollowing moderate use in 2005 and 2006 during which annual passenger traffic was at about 46,000 and several hundred aircraft movements took place each year, the airport's activity quickly declined again to the point where in 2016 passenger traffic amounted to only 12,421 and a mere 54 aircraft movements took place. However, in the beginning of 2017, as part of new efforts to develop Gyumri and its tourism industry, the government focused on revitalizing the airport. Multiple new airlines began operating flights to the airport, including [[Taron Avia]], a new Armenian airline based in Gyumri.

It is likely that the name was derived from the [[Cimmerians]] who conquered the region and probably founded the settlement. Under the domination of Turkic tribes, ''Kumayri'' was Turkified as ''G\u00fcmr\u00fc''. In 1837, Kumayri was renamed '''Alexandropol''' after Czar Nicholas I's wife, Princess [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Fyodorovna]]. Between 1924 and 1990, the city was known as '''Leninakan''' in honor of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Following independence, the original name '''Kumayri''' was used until 1992, when '''Gyumri''' was chosen as the name of the city.\n\n==History==\n===Classical antiquity and the ancient Armenian Kingdom===\n[[File:Beniamin 11.JPG|thumb|left|The Orontid settlement of Kumayri, 5th\u20132nd centuries BC]]\nArchaeological excavations conducted throughout the Soviet period have shown that the area of modern-day Gyumri has been populated since at least the third millennium BC. The area was mentioned as '''Kumayri''' in the historic [[Urartu|Urartian]] inscriptions dating back to the 8th century BC. This name is probably phonetically associated with [[Cimmerians]], who migrated to the western banks of the Black Sea region from European Lowlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyumri.am/eng/history.html|publisher=Cimmerian|accessdate=14 June 2015|title=Kumayri infosite|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106210024/http://www.gyumri.am/eng/history.html|archivedate=6 November 2012}}</ref> Historians believe that [[Xenophon]] passed through Kumayri during his return to the [[Black Sea]], a journey immortalized in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyumritown.com|title=#1 Internet Site for Gyumri Armenia|publisher=Gyumritown.com|accessdate=15 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217045539/http://gyumritown.com/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the decline of the [[Urartu]] Kingdom by the second half of the 6th century BC, Kumayri became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The remains of a royal settlement found just to the south of Gyumri near the village of [[Beniamin]] dating back to the 5th to 2nd centuries BC, are a great example of the Achemenid influence in the region. However, at the beginning of the 5th century BC, Kumayri became part of the [[Satrapy of Armenia]] under the rule of the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]]. An alternative theory suggests that Kumayri has been formed as an urban settlement in the late 5th century BC, ca. 401&nbsp;BC, by [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046406?tocId=9046406|title=Gyumri  Armenia  Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nLater in 331 BC, the entire territory was included in the [[Ayrarat]] province of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Ancient Armenian Kingdom]] as part of the Shirak canton. Between 190 BC and 1 AD Kumayri was under the rule of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]] of Armenia. During the 1st century AD, Shirak was granted to the [[Kamsarakan]] family, who ruled over Kumayri during the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia]].<ref>[http://www.shirakmuseum.am/main.php?menu_id=1&sub_menu_id=0&lang=1 Shiral Regional Museum]</ref>\n\n===Medieval period===\nFollowing the partition of Armenia in 387 between the Byzantines and the Persians, and as a result of the fall of the Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia in 428, Shirak including Kumayri became part of the [[Sasanian Empire]] of Persia. In 658 AD, at the height of the Arab Islamic invasions, Kumayri was conquered during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] to become part of the [[Arminiya|Emirate of Armenia]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].<ref>[Book: The Arab Campaign of Armenia, Author: Ghevond the Historian (8th century), published in 1857, Paris (\u0542\u0587\u0578\u0576\u0564 \u057a\u0561\u057f\u0574\u0561\u0563\u056b\u0580, \u0531\u0580\u0577\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576\u0584 \u0561\u0580\u0561\u0562\u0561\u0581 \u056b \u0540\u0561\u0575\u057d, \u0553\u0561\u0580\u056b\u0566, 1857)]</ref>\n\nKumayri was a significant and quite-developed urban settlement during the [[Middle Ages]]. According to the Armenian scholar ''Ghevond the Historian'', the town was a centre of the Armenian rebellion led by ''Artavazd Mamikonian'' against the Islamic Arab [[Caliphate]], between 733 and 755. After 2 centuries of Islamic rule over Armenia, the [[Bagratid dynasty of Armenia|Bagratids]] declared independence in 885 establishing the [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]].<ref>Bournoutian.

By the second half of the 10th century, Kumayri was under the influence of the Armenian [[Pahlavuni]] family, who were descendants of the Kamsarakans. The Pahlavunis had a great contribution in the progress of Shirak with the foundation of many fortresses, monastic complexes, educational institutions, etc.<ref>{{in lang|hy}} Arakelyan, Babken N. \"\u0532\u0561\u0563\u0580\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0581 \u0569\u0561\u0563\u0561\u057e\u0578\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0576 \u0562\u0561\u0580\u0563\u0561\u057e\u0561\u0573\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0568\" (\"The Flourishing of the Bagratuni Kingdom\").

During the Zakarid rule, the Eastern Armenian territories, mainly Lori and Shirak, entered into a new period of growth and stability, becoming a trade centre between the east and the west. After the Mongols captured [[Ani]] in 1236, Armenia turned into a [[Mongol Armenia|Mongol protectorate]] as part of the [[Ilkhanate]], and the Zakarids became vassals to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]].

During the first half of the 18th century, Kumayri became part of the [[Erivan Khanate]] under the rule of the [[Afsharid dynasty]] and later under the [[Qajar dynasty]] of Persia.\n\n[[File:Old Gyumri 03.PNG|thumb|left|[[Diorama]] of old Alexandropol with the [[Holy Saviour's Church, Gyumri|Holy Saviour's Church]] (1859\u20131873)]]\nIn June 1804, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] forces controlled over Shirak region at the beginning of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804 and 1813]]. Kumayri became officially part of the Russian Empire at the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] signed on 1 January 1813 between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia.\n\nDuring the period of the Russian rule, Gyumri became one of the developing cities in the [[Transcaucasus]]. In 1829, in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War]], there was a big influx of Armenian population, as around 3,000 families who had migrated from territories in the Ottoman Empire -in particular from the towns of [[Kars]], [[Erzurum]], and [[Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t]]- settled in and around Gyumri. The Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] visited Gyumri during his journey to [[Erzurum]] in 1829.\n[[File:Surb Nshan1.jpg|thumb|Surp Nshan Church of 1870]]\nIn 1837 Russian [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] arrived in Gyumri and changed the name into '''Alexandropol'''. The name was chosen in honour of Tsar Nicholas I's wife, Princess [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte of Prussia]], who had changed her name to ''Alexandra Fyodorovna'' after converting to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]].\n\nA major [[Russia]]n fortress was built on the site in 1837. Alexandropol was finally formed as a town in 1840 to become the centre of the newly established [[Aleksandropolsky Uyezd|Alexandropol Uyezd]], experiencing rapid growth during its first decade. In 1849, the Alexandropol Uyezd became part of the [[Erivan Governorate]]. The town was an important outpost for the Imperial Russian armed forces in the [[Transcaucasus]] where their military barracks were established (e.g., at Poligons, Severski, Kazachi Post). The Russians built the [[Sev Berd]] fortress at the western edge of the city during the 1830s in response to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u20131829]].\n\nAlexandropol had been quickly transformed to become one of the major centres of the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]. After the establishment of the railway station in 1899, Alexandropol witnessed a significant growth and became the largest city in Eastern Armenia. By the end of the 19th century, Alexandropol was home to 430 shopping stores as well as several workshops and cultural institutions.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Alexandropol 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandropol in 1901]]\nIn 1902, the first bank in the city was opened. Until the sovietization of Armenia in 1920, Alexandropol had 31 manufacturing centres including beer, soap, textile, etc. After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 and the Russian withdrawal from the [[South Caucasus]], the Ottoman forces launched a new offensive capturing the city of Alexandropol on 11 May 1918, during the [[Caucasus Campaign]] in [[World War I]]. However, the Ottomans withdrew from the city on 24 December 1918, as a result of the [[Armistice of Mudros]].\n\nThe newly established [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] proclaimed on 28 May 1918, included the city of Alexandropol. On 10 May 1920, the local Bolshevik Armenians aided by the Muslim population, attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in Alexandropol against the Dashnak government of Armenia. The [[May Uprising|uprising]] was suppressed by the Armenian government on May 14 and its leaders were executed. However, during [[Turkish-Armenian War|another Turkish invasion]], Turkish troops attacked Alexandropol and occupied the city on 7 November 1920. Armenia was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on December 3 to stop the Turkish advance towards Yerevan, however a concurrent Soviet invasion led to the fall of the Armenian government on December 2. The Turkish forces withdrew from Alexandropol after the [[Treaty of Kars]] was signed in October 1921 by the unrecognized Soviet and Turkish governments.<ref>Hovannisian.

The city suffered an earthquake in 1926, when many of its significant buildings were destroyed including the Greek church of Saint George. Leninakan became a major industrial centre in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and its second-largest city, after the capital Yerevan.

Extra toppings can be added to both hot and cold soba. Toppings are chosen to reflect the seasons and to balance with other ingredients. Most toppings are added without much cooking, although some are deep-fried. Most of these dishes may also be prepared with [[udon]].\n\n====Cold soba dishes====\n[[File:Mori soba of Fuji-soba.jpg|thumbnail|\"Mori soba\"]]\nChilled soba is often served on a sieve-like bamboo tray called a [[zaru]], sometimes garnished with bits of dried [[nori]] seaweed, with a dipping sauce known as ''soba tsuyu'' on the side. The ''tsuyu'' is made of a strong mixture of [[dashi]], sweetened [[soy sauce]] (also called \"sat\u014dj\u014dyu\") and [[mirin]]. Using chopsticks, the diner picks up a small amount of soba from the tray and dips it in the cold ''tsuyu'' before eating it. [[Wasabi]] and [[scallion]]s are often mixed into the ''tsuyu''.<ref name=\"Ishige\">{{cite book|title=History Of Japanese Food|last=Ishige|first=Naomichi|isbn=9781136602559|publisher=Routledge|location=London, UK|pages=249\u2013251}}</ref> Many people think that the best way to experience the unique texture of hand-made soba noodles is to eat them cold, since letting them soak in hot broth changes their consistency.

It is sweeter and more flavorful than regular soba.\n\n[[Nagano Prefecture]] is famous for soba.  The noodles are known as Shinshu Soba.  One of the reasons for this popularity is that Nagano has natural features well-suited to soba production. The land has plenty of volcanic ash soil because of its highland location.  It also has an extreme difference in temperatures. Many famous soba production centers can be found across the prefecture, from the Kurohime and Togakushi highlands in the north to the Kaida highlands in the south, and the prefecture boasts the second-highest production of soba in Japan. Many facilities are also engaged in integrated soba manufacturing, from cultivation to milling and cutting. Many of these facilities provide soba cutting courses for customers, forming one of the major leisure activities of Nagano. <ref>Shinshu Soba Noodles. (2014).

It is sweeter and more flavorful than regular soba.\n\n[[Nagano Prefecture]] is famous for soba.  The noodles are known as Shinshu Soba.  One of the reasons for this popularity is that Nagano has natural features well-suited to soba production. The land has plenty of volcanic ash soil because of its highland location.  It also has an extreme difference in temperatures. Many famous soba production centers can be found across the prefecture, from the Kurohime and Togakushi highlands in the north to the Kaida highlands in the south, and the prefecture boasts the second-highest production of soba in Japan. Many facilities are also engaged in integrated soba manufacturing, from cultivation to milling and cutting. Many of these facilities provide soba cutting courses for customers, forming one of the major leisure activities of Nagano. <ref>Shinshu Soba Noodles. (2014). Retrieved from Japan Brand: https://japan-brand.jnto.go.jp/foods/noodles/2801/.</ref>\nSoba noodles are produced by mixing buckwheat flour with some wheat flour (to reduce brittleness), adding water, mixing, kneading, rolling and cutting. As a general rule, only noodles containing 40% or more soba flour can carry the Shinshu name. <ref>Story of Japanese Local Cuisine. (2018).

The \"Long Term Re-Equipment Plan 1981\" noted that the MiG-21s would be approaching the end of their service lives by the mid-1990s, and that by 1995, the IAF would lack 40 percent of the aircraft needed to fill its projected force structure requirements.<ref name=\"globalsecurity\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/lca.htm \"Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).\"] ''Global Security'', 2012.
