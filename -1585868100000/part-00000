Although the title is adapted from [[Ian Fleming]]'s short story \"[[From a View to a Kill]]\", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In ''A View to a Kill'', Bond is pitted against [[Max Zorin]], who plans to destroy California's [[Silicon Valley]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]], who also wrote the screenplay with [[Richard Maibaum]]. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], and the last to feature [[Lois Maxwell]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]].\n\nDespite receiving mostly mixed reviews from critics, who frequently took umbrage with the effects of Moore's advanced age on his performance, it was a commercial success, with the [[Duran Duran]] theme song \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" performing well in the charts, becoming the only theme song to reach #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and earning a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Song|Best Song]]. It also marked Swedish actor [[Dolph Lundgren]]'s film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nMI6 agent James Bond is sent to [[Siberia]] to locate the body of 003 and recover a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] originating from the [[Soviet Union]]. Upon his return [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] analyses the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an [[electromagnetic pulse]] and made by government contractor Zorin Industries.\n\nBond visits [[Ascot Racecourse]] to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the [[Eiffel Tower]], Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes, despite being chased by Bond.\n\nBond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him and finds out that Zorin has written her a cheque for $5&nbsp;million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory and discover that he is implanting [[adrenaline]]-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed too.\n\n[[General Gogol]] of the [[KGB]] confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him\u2014and the potential investors\u2014a monopoly over microchip manufacture.\n\nBond goes to San Francisco where he learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin could be the product of [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experimentation]] with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist, now Zorin's physician Dr. Carl Mortner. He then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner is caught and killed, but Ivanova and Bond escape. Later Ivanova takes the recording, but finds that Bond had switched tapes, leaving her with a recording of Japanese music. Bond tracks down the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business.\n\nThe two travel to [[San Francisco City Hall]] to check Zorin's submitted plans.  However, Zorin is alerted to their presence and arrives, killing the Chief Geologist with Bond's pistol and setting fire to the building to both frame Bond for the murder and kill him at the same time. Bond and Sutton escape from the fire, but when the police try to arrest Bond, he and Sutton escape in a fire engine.\n\nBond and Sutton infiltrate Zorin's mine, discovering his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the [[Hayward Fault Zone|Hayward]] and [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] faults, which will cause them to flood, causing Silicon Valley and everything within to be submerged underwater forever. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mines and kill the mine workers. Sutton escapes while Bond fights May Day; when she realises Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and pushing it out of the mine, where it explodes, killing her.\n\nEscaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Sutton as Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but he manages to moor the airship to the framework of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Sutton attacks Zorin and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using lit sticks of dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine. General Gogol awards Bond the [[Order of Lenin]] for foiling Zorin's scheme.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], [[MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Max Zorin]]: a psychopathic industrialist, the product of a Nazi genetic experiment, planning to destroy the Silicon Valley to gain a monopoly in the microchip market.\n* [[Tanya Roberts]] as [[Stacey Sutton]]: The granddaughter of an oil tycoon whose company is taken over by Zorin.\n* [[Grace Jones]] as May Day: Zorin's lover and chief henchwoman.

At the end of ''[[Octopussy]]'' during the \"James Bond Will Return\" sequence, it listed the next film as \"From a View to a Kill\", the name of the original short story; however, the title was later changed.<ref>{{cite book|page=174|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=The Music of James Bond|first=Jon|last=Burlingame|year=2012|ISBN=9780199863303}}</ref> When a company with a name similar to Zorin (the [[Zoran Corporation]]) was discovered in the United States, a disclaimer was added to the start of the film affirming that Zorin was not related to any real-life company.

Lundgren, who was dating [[Grace Jones]] at the time, was visiting her on set when one day an extra was missing so the director [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]] then asked him if he wanted to get a shot at it. Lundgren appears during the confrontation between Gogol and Zorin at the racetrack, standing several steps below Gogol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/avtak_trivia.php3?t=avtak&s=avtak |title=Notes on A View to a Kill |accessdate=7 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot at [[Pinewood Studios]] in London, Iceland, Switzerland, France and the United States. Several French landmarks such as the [[Eiffel Tower]], its Jules Verne restaurant and the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly]] were filmed. The rest of the major filming was done at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California|Fisherman's Wharf]], [[Dunsmuir House]], [[San Francisco City Hall]] and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in San Francisco. The [[Lefty O'Doul Bridge]] was featured in the fire engine chase scene.

The crew then departed for shooting the horse-racing scenes at Royal Ascot Racecourse. The scene in which Bond and Sutton enter the mineshaft was then filmed in a waterlogged quarry near [[Staines-upon-Thames]] and the [[Amberley Chalk Pits Museum]] in West Sussex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/movies/avtak_production.php3?t=avtak&s=avtak |title=Production of ''A View to a Kill'' |accessdate=7 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AVTAK-Moore-Roberts-Jones-promophoto.jpg|thumb|right|Tanya Roberts, Roger Moore and Grace Jones in a promotional still.]] -->\nOn 6 October 1984, the fourth unit, headed by special effects supervisor John Richardson, began its work on the climactic fight sequence. At first, only a few plates constructed to resemble the Golden Gate Bridge were used. Later that night, shooting of the burning San Francisco City Hall commenced. The first actual scenes atop the bridge were filmed on 7 October 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commanderbond.net/article/2545 |title=October: This Month in Bond History |accessdate=7 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231131/http://commanderbond.net/article/2545 |archivedate=26 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn Paris it was planned that two stunt [[Parachuting|parachutists]], B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would undertake two jumps from a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a top edge of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told he would not be performing his own descent. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\n[[Airship Industries]] managed a major marketing coup with the inclusion of its [[Airship Industries Skyship 500|Skyship 500 series]] [[blimp]] in the film. At the time Airship Industries was producing a fleet of blimps which were recognisable over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals.

''[[The Washington Post]]'' critic said \"Moore isn't just long in the tooth\u2014he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie.

He was quoted saying \"I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people.

You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded together and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for.\" Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. \"Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation.

Lavish with their budgets, the producers also bring a great deal of craft, wit and a sense of fun to the films. Agent 007 is like an old friend who an audience meets for drinks every two years or so; he regales them with tall tales, winking all the time. The 14th and newest Bond epic, ''A View to a Kill'', is an especially satisfying encounter. Opening with a breathtaking ski chase in Siberia, ''A View to a Kill'' is the fastest Bond picture yet. Its pace has the precision of a Swiss watch and the momentum of a greyhound on the track. There is a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower and through Paris streets, which Bond finishes in a severed car on just two wheels.

Although the title is adapted from [[Ian Fleming]]'s short story \"[[From a View to a Kill]]\", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In ''A View to a Kill'', Bond is pitted against [[Max Zorin]], who plans to destroy California's [[Silicon Valley]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]], who also wrote the screenplay with [[Richard Maibaum]]. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], and the last to feature [[Lois Maxwell]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]].\n\nDespite receiving mostly mixed reviews from critics, who frequently took umbrage with the effects of Moore's advanced age on his performance, it was a commercial success, with the [[Duran Duran]] theme song \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" performing well in the charts, becoming the only theme song to reach #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and earning a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Song|Best Song]]. It also marked Swedish actor [[Dolph Lundgren]]'s film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nMI6 agent James Bond is sent to [[Siberia]] to locate the body of 003 and recover a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] originating from the [[Soviet Union]]. Upon his return [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] analyses the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an [[electromagnetic pulse]] and made by government contractor Zorin Industries.\n\nBond visits [[Ascot Racecourse]] to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the [[Eiffel Tower]], Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes, despite being chased by Bond.\n\nBond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him and finds out that Zorin has written her a cheque for $5&nbsp;million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory and disover that he is implanting [[adrenaline]]-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed too.\n\n[[General Gogol]] of the [[KGB]] confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him\u2014and the potential investors\u2014a monopoly over microchip manufacture.\n\nBond goes to San Francisco where he learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin could be the product of [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experimentation]] with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist, now Zorin's physician Dr. Carl Mortner. He then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner is caught and killed, but Ivanova and Bond escape. Later Ivanova takes the recording, but finds that Bond had switched tapes, leaving her with a recording of Japanese music. Bond tracks down the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business.\n\nThe two travel to [[San Francisco City Hall]] to check Zorin's submitted plans.  However, Zorin is alerted to their presence and arrives, killing the Chief Geologist with Bond's pistol and setting fire to the building to both frame Bond for the murder and kill him at the same time. Bond and Sutton escape from the fire, but when the police try to arrest Bond, he and Sutton escape in a fire engine.\n\nBond and Sutton infiltrate Zorin's mine, discovering his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the [[Hayward Fault Zone|Hayward]] and [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] faults, which will cause them to flood, causing Silicon Valley and everything within to be submerged underwater forever. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mines and kill the mine workers. Sutton escapes while Bond fights May Day; when she realises Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and pushing it out of the mine, where it explodes, killing her.\n\nEscaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Sutton as Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but he manages to moor the airship to the framework of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Sutton attacks Zorin and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using lit sticks of dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine. General Gogol awards Bond the [[Order of Lenin]] for foiling Zorin's scheme.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], [[MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Max Zorin]]: a psychopathic industrialist, the product of a Nazi genetic experiment, planning to destroy the Silicon Valley to gain a monopoly in the microchip market.\n* [[Tanya Roberts]] as [[Stacey Sutton]]: The granddaughter of an oil tycoon whose company is taken over by Zorin.\n* [[Grace Jones]] as May Day: Zorin's lover and chief henchwoman.

He was quoted saying \"I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people. I said 'That wasn't Bond, those weren't Bond films.' It stopped being what they were all about. You didn't dwell on the blood and the brains spewing all over the place\".<ref>Barnes and Hearn 1997, p 169</ref>\n\n[[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said \"The James Bond series has had its bummers, but nothing before in the class of ''A View to a Kill''. You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded together and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for.\" Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. \"Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)\"<ref name=\"Kael (1985)\">{{cite news|last=Kael|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Kael|title=Slaphappy and Not So Happy|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=3 June 1985}} [http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/v.html Available online.]</ref>\n\nLawrence O'Toole of ''[[Maclean's]]'' believed it was one of the series' best entries. \"Of all the modern formulas in the movie industry, the James Bond series is among the most pleasurable and durable. Lavish with their budgets, the producers also bring a great deal of craft, wit and a sense of fun to the films. Agent 007 is like an old friend who an audience meets for drinks every two years or so; he regales them with tall tales, winking all the time. The 14th and newest Bond epic, ''A View to a Kill'', is an especially satisfying encounter. Opening with a breathtaking ski chase in Siberia, ''A View to a Kill'' is the fastest Bond picture yet. Its pace has the precision of a Swiss watch and the momentum of a greyhound on the track. There is a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower and through Paris streets, which Bond finishes in a severed car on just two wheels. But none of the action prepares the viewer for the heart-stopping climax with Zorin's dirigible tangled in the cables on top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.\" And although O'Toole believed that Moore was showing his age in the role, \"there are plenty of tunes left in his violin.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers \u2013 who ruined villain [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] by making him a nice guy in ''Moonraker'' \u2013 make the mistake of switching May Day at the end from Bond's nemesis to his accomplice, depriving us of a slam-bang fight to the finish between the two (I suppose gentleman Bond isn't allowed to kill women, even a monster like May Day)&nbsp;...

A loose adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the power of the sun, while facing the assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], the \"Man with the Golden Gun\". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.\n\n''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was the fourth and final film in the series directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The script was written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. The film was set in the face of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]], a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular [[martial arts film]] craze, with several [[kung fu]] scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. Part of the film is also set in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], but it was not shot there.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. [[Christopher Lee]]'s portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was generally praised, but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and [[Britt Ekland]]. Whilst profitable, the film is the 4th lowest-grossing in the series and it's relatively modest returns by comparison with those of ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973) reportedly placed the continuation of the franchise in jeopardy.<ref name=Aldis-2020>{{cite web |last=Aldis |first=Ben |date=21 March 2020 |title=The Man With The Golden Gun Almost Ended James Bond Movies |url=https://screenrant.com/james-bond-movies-man-golden-gun-bad/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> It was the last Bond film to be co-produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in [[Danjaq, LLC]], the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn London, a golden bullet with James Bond's code \"007\" etched into its surface is received by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. It is believed that it was sent by the famed assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], who uses a golden gun, to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, [[M (James Bond)|M]] relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of the solar energy scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the [[1973 energy crisis|energy crisis]] with [[solar power]]. At a hint from M, Bond sets out unofficially to locate Scaramanga.\n\nAfter retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in [[Beirut]] and tracking its manufacturer to [[Macau]], Bond forces the gun maker to show him how he delivers the bullets. Seeing Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a [[casino]]. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]] room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the [[Bottoms Up Club]]. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next [[contract killing|hit]], Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's [[dwarfism|dwarf]] henchman Nick Nack steals the \"Solex agitator\", a key component of a [[Power station#Solar|solar power station]]. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.\n\nBond then travels to [[Bangkok]] to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, meets with Fat and is invited to dinner, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured when he returns for dinner and placed in Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat with his golden gun and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.\n\nAnders visits Bond, revealing that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a [[Muay Thai]] venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders dead and meets Scaramanga. Bond observes the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a [[homing device]] on Scaramanga's car, Scaramanga traps her in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an [[AMC Hornet]] from a showroom to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing [[Sheriff J.W. Pepper]], the lawman Bond encountered in [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and let Die]] seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's [[AMC Matador]] transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.\n\nPicking up Goodnight's tracking signal, Bond flies a seaplane into [[People's Republic of China|Red Chinese]] waters and lands at [[Ko Tapu|Scaramanga's island]]. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.\n\nScaramanga then proposes a pistol [[duel]] with Bond on the beach; Bond with his Walther and him with his single-shot golden gun. As he says, he only needs one shot. The two men stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in the place of the mannequin of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the temperature of the helium cooling the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's [[Junk (ship)|Chinese junk]]. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent who receives a golden bullet, supposedly from Scaramanga, indicating that he is a target of Scaramanga. \n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Francisco Scaramanga#Film biography|Francisco Scaramanga]]: The main villain and assassin who is identified by his use of a golden gun; he also has a 'superfluous papilla', or [[supernumerary nipple]].

A loose adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the power of the sun, while facing the assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], the \"Man with the Golden Gun\". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.\n\n''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was the fourth and final film in the series directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The script was written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. The film was set in the face of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]], a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular [[martial arts film]] craze, with several [[kung fu]] scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. Part of the film is also set in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], but it was not shot there.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. [[Christopher Lee]]'s portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was generally praised, but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and [[Britt Ekland]]. Whilst profitable, the film is the 4th lowest-grossing in the series and it's relatively modest returns by comparison with those of ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973) reportedly placed the continuation of the franchise in jeopardy.<ref name=Aldis-2020>{{cite web |last=Aldis |first=Ben |date=21 March 2020 |title=The Man With The Golden Gun Almost Ended James Bond Movies |url=https://screenrant.com/james-bond-movies-man-golden-gun-bad/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> It was the last Bond film to be co-produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in [[Danjaq, LLC]], the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn London, a golden bullet with James Bond's code \"007\" etched into its surface is received by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. It is believed that it was sent by the famed assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], who uses a golden gun, to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, [[M (James Bond)|M]] relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of the solar energy scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the [[1973 energy crisis|energy crisis]] with [[solar power]]. At a hint from M, Bond sets out unofficially to locate Scaramanga.\n\nAfter retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in [[Beirut]] and tracking its manufacturer to [[Macau]], Bond forces the gun maker to show him how he delivers the bullets. Seeing Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a [[casino]]. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]] room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the [[Bottoms Up Club]]. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next [[contract killing|hit]], Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's [[dwarfism|dwarf]] henchman Nick Nack steals the \"Solex agitator\", a key component of a [[Power station#Solar|solar power station]]. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.\n\nBond then travels to [[Bangkok]] to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, meets with Fat and is invited to dinner, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured when he returns for dinner and placed in Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat with his golden gun and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.\n\nAnders visits Bond, revealing that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a [[Muay Thai]] venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders dead and meets Scaramanga. Bond observes the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a [[homing device]] on Scaramanga's car, Scaramanga traps her in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an [[AMC Hornet]] from a showroom to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing [[Sheriff J.W. Pepper]], the lawman Bond encountered in [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and let Die]] seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's [[AMC Matador]] transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.\n\nPicking up Goodnight's tracking signal, Bond flies a seaplane into [[People's Republic of China|Red Chinese]] waters and lands at [[Ko Tapu|Scaramanga's island]]. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.\n\nScaramanga then proposes a pistol [[duel]] with Bond on the beach; Bond with his Walther and him with his single-shot golden gun. As he says, he only needs one shot. The two men stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in the place of the mannequin of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the temperature of the helium cooling the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's [[Junk (ship)|Chinese junk]]. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent who receives a golden bullet, supposedly from Scaramanga, indicating that he is a target of Scaramanga. \n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Francisco Scaramanga#Film biography|Francisco Scaramanga]]: The main villain and assassin who is identified by his use of a golden gun; he also has a 'superfluous papilla', or [[supernumerary nipple]].

DX would go on to break his nose and force him into matches like a [[handicap match]] against [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] and Albert. On the December 12 episode of ''Heat'', Test faced [[Al Snow]] in a losing effort. The next night on ''Raw is War'', Test teamed with Triple H to face [[The New Age Outlaws]] resulting in Triple H turning on and assaulting him. The next week on ''Raw is War'', Triple H would continue to torment him by putting him in a handicap match against [[The New Age Outlaws]], calling it a \"Christmas present\". On the January 17 episode of ''Raw is War'', Test defeated The Big Boss Man to win the WWF Hardcore Championship. At the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by The [[Big Show]]. Test then lost the [[WWF Hardcore Championship]] to [[Crash Holly]] on the February 24 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]''. Test then turned heel and formed a [[tag team]] with [[Matt Bloom|Albert]]. The two were known as [[T & A (professional wrestling)|T & A]] (Test and Albert) and were managed by [[Trish Stratus]]. At [[WrestleMania 2000]] they defeated [[Al Snow]] and [[Steve Blackman]]. Then at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], T & A (with Trish Stratus) defeated [[The Dudley Boyz]]. At [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]], T & A were defeated in a Four corners elimination match for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] by [[Edge and Christian]]. At [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]], T & A and Trish Stratus loss to [[The Hardy Boyz]] and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] in a Six-person mixed tag team match.

At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], T & A and Trish Stratus competed against [[The Acolytes Protection Agency]] ([[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] and [[Faarooq]]) and Lita, which ended in a no contest because of T & A attacking The APA before the match. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], T & A and Trish Stratus faced Steve Blackman, Crash Holly and [[Molly Holly]] in a losing effort.\n\n====The Invasion and various feuds (2000\u20132002)====\n{{Main|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|l1=The Invasion|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l2=The Alliance}}\nOn December 28, 2000, Albert attacked Test at the orders of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, effectively disbanding T & A and turning Test face again.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/>\n\nAgain a singles wrestler, Test eliminated [[William Regal]] during the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|2001 Royal Rumble]] match and subsequently defeated him the next night on ''Raw is War'' to win the [[WWE European Championship|WWF European Championship]].<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> Test then feuded with [[Eddie Guerrero]], losing the championship to him at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] following interference from [[Dean Malenko]] and [[Perry Saturn]]. On the April 30 episode of ''Raw is War'', Test defeated Triple H by disqualification after Triple H hit him with a chair and powerbombed him through the announce table<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Test competed in a Triple threat hardcore match for the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]] which was won by [[Rhyno]]. On the June 12 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Rhyno to win the Hardcore Championship he would lose the title back to Rhyno on the June 25 episode of ''Raw is War''.\n\nDuring the Invasion storyline, [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] were suspicious of Test's friendship with Shane McMahon, prior to Shane's heel turn and the formation of the [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|ECW]] half of the Alliance.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> They decided to attack Test because they thought he was the mole within the WWF, only to find out he wasn't. In retaliation, on the August 9, 2001, episode of ''[[SmackDown!]]'', Test turned heel by joining [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] by helping Alliance members [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeat the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]]. Teaming with [[The Dudley Boyz]], Test went on to pin Bradshaw at [[SummerSlam (2001)|SummerSlam]] to defeat the APA and [[Spike Dudley]] in a six-man tag team match.  The next day on ''Raw is War'', Stephanie approached Test with the task of beating [[Chris Jericho]] after Rhyno failed to do so at SummerSlam. Despite past conflicts, they shook hands, thus finally resolving the grudge between himself and Stephanie. After Test won the match against Jericho he would defeat Kane at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]]. He then began teaming with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] regularly in September 2001. Together they defeated [[The Brothers of Destruction]] on the September 27 episode of ''SmackDown!'' to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|WCW Tag Team Championship]]. However they would go on to lose the titles to [[The Hardy Boyz]] on the October 8 episode of ''Raw''. On November 1, Test and Booker T defeated [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Chris Jericho]] on ''SmackDown!'' to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], which they would go on to also lose to The Hardy Boyz eleven days later on ''Raw''.\n\nFollowing this, Test returned to singles competition and began feuding with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. After defeating Edge to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]], Test lost the title back to him in a unification match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Championship]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]].<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> On the same night, he won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which granted him on-screen immunity from being fired for a year after attacking and taking the place of [[Scotty 2 Hotty]]. For the next few weeks, a storyline was built around Test using that immunity to justify attacking fellow wrestlers but the storyline went nowhere and shortly after the year turned it was dropped. At [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]], Test and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] were defeated by Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert. At the 2002 [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. At [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]], Test and Booker T faced [[Tazz]] and [[Spike Dudley]] for the WWF Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles. At [[WrestleMania X8]], Test, [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] and Lance Storm lost to Rikishi, Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert in six-man tag team match on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]''.\n\nAt the [[WWE brand extension#Raw and SmackDown!|2002]] Draft, Test was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown! brand]]. On the May 2 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test and Christian defeated [[Mark Henry]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]. On the May 9 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Mark Henry. On the May 23 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated [[Randy Orton]]. On the May 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Triple H. On the June 13 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] in a King of the Ring qualifier. The next week, Test defeated [[Hardcore Holly]] in a Quarterfinals match but would go on to lose in the semi-finals of the [[King of the Ring (2002)|King of the Ring]] tournament to the eventual winner, [[Brock Lesnar]]. On the July 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test, Christian and [[Lance Storm]] formed [[The Un-Americans]]. On the July 25 episode of ''SmackDown!'', [[John Cena]] poked fun at him so he slapped him which led to a match where Cena won. On the July 29 episode of ''Raw'', The Un-Americans left SmackDown! and joined the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]]. Later the night they attacked The Undertaker.\n\nThe storyline culminated in a match at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] where [[The Undertaker]] defeated Test.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> The Un-Americans lost to the team of Kane, Goldust, Booker T and Bubba Ray Dudley at [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]] and after a series of losses The Un-Americans divided, and the stable split in brawling fashion and disbanded in September 2002.\n\n====Relationship with Stacy Keibler (2002\u20132004)====\nIn October 2002, after the Un-Americans dissolved, Test received [[Stacy Keibler]] as his on-screen girlfriend and \"image [[consultant]]\". This began by Keibler telling Test he should embrace his fanbase and call them his \"[[Testicle]]s\", in line with The Rock's fan group, the \"People\", [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]'s \"Kaneanites\", and [[Hulk Hogan]]'s \"Hulkamaniacs\". This eventually culminated with Test cutting off his long hair and trading his trademark leather pants for normal wrestling trunks. The couple were originally heels, but due to the popularity of the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], quickly became faces.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|2003 Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by [[Dave Bautista|Batista]]. In May, Test formed a tag team with the returning [[Scott Steiner]], at the request of Keibler, and at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]], they faced [[La R\u00e9sistance (professional wrestling)|La R\u00e9sistance]] in a losing effort. Later in the night, he went on to compete in a [[battle royal]] for the vacant [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]], but it was eventually won by Christian. Test and Stacy eventually split-up due to the ongoing mistreatment of Stacy at the hands of Test, while turning him heel again. At [[Bad Blood (2003)|Bad Blood]], Scott Steiner defeated Test for Stacy Keibler's managerial services. On August 18, Test defeated Steiner on ''Raw'', winning the services of Stacy and announcing his intentions to \"make her a [[Prostitution|whore]]\". At [[Unforgiven (2003)|Unforgiven]], Test again defeated Steiner, forcing him to become his [[Domestic worker|manservant]].<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> Steiner then attacked Stacy, blaming her for the loss and for him having to take orders from another man. Test then freed Steiner from his obligation, and the pair became a tag team once again, as now both treated Keibler like a slave. The two challenged for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] on multiple occasions but came up short each time. The pair were then fired by [[Mick Foley]] (therefore freeing Stacy Keibler from their control), who was the on-screen guest General Manager for two nights, thus finally ending the year-long angle. They were then re-hired by [[Eric Bischoff]], upon his return to the position of ''RAW'' General Manager. At [[Armageddon (2003)|Armageddon]], Test and Scott Steiner competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles.\n\nTest then had a short feud with [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]] in January 2004, which started after Test kicked [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] (Richard's on-screen girlfriend) in the jaw. They fought several times on ''Sunday Night Heat'', with Richards winning every match. On the January 19 episode of ''Raw'', Test competed in a Triple Threat Royal Rumble Qualifying Match against [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and Scott Steiner. After Goldberg won the match Test and Steiner would officially disband. At [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]], Test was found knocked out backstage by some officials and the ''Raw'' Sheriff Stone Cold Steve Austin when it was his turn to enter. Austin ordered someone to quickly replace Test as the 21st rumble entrant. The person who attacked him and replaces him was revealed to be Mick Foley. Test would gain some revenge on February 2, when he and [[Randy Orton]] attacked Mick Foley in a backstage area. Test would start competing against the likes of [[Rico Constantino|Rico]] and Stevie Richards regularly on ''Heat''. On March 1 episode of Raw, Test and [[Matt Hardy]] were defeated by [[Rob Van Dam]] and Booker T. Test would go on to compete on house shows until he reaggravated the neck injury that had kept him out of action the past few months.\n\nMartin had [[spinal fusion]] surgery performed by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]] in July 2004. On November 1, 2004, it was announced that he was released from his WWE contract along with [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]] and [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]].<ref name=\"Clevett\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/01/696384.html|author=Clevett, J.|title=WWE releases Gunn, Albert & Test|work=Slam!

One of his most notable victories during this tenure was against former TNA wrestler [[Samoa Joe]]. His most prominent role in the independent circuit was in the Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion in Italy, where he took on the ring name \"Big Foot\", due to his \"big boot\" finishing move.\n\n===Return to WWE (2006\u20132007)===\n[[File:AndrewMartinECWLive.jpg|left|thumb|Test making his entrance on ECW]]\nOn March 22, 2006, WWE.com announced that Test had verbally agreed to return to WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com:80/inside/news/testwwe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412060313/http://www.wwe.com:80/inside/news/testwwe|url-status=dead|title=Test returning|publisher=WWE|archivedate=April 12, 2006|accessdate=December 23, 2018}}</ref> Subsequently, [[Vignette (wrestling)|vignettes]] began to play during ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW on Sci Fi]]'', announcing that Test was debuting on the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand.

In a scripted event, Martin threw an overzealous fan off the stage during the band's rehearsal. On the December 14, 1998, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', Martin aligned himself with [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] by attacking The Rock's rival [[Triple H]].<ref name=\"Oliver4\"/> A week later on the December 21 episode of ''Raw'', Martin made his in ring debut teaming with The Rock to defeat Triple H and [[X-Pac]] by DQ. Martin went on to join [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], a wrestling stable consisting of numerous other wrestlers. During this time, he received the ring name \"Test\", since he usually checked the mic saying \"test...test...\"<ref name=\"TestProfile\">{{cite news|title=Capsule Profile 335: Test|work=The Wrestler/Inside Wrestling|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=Volume 15, 2007|page=18|date=June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/bruce-prichard-reveals-the-origin-of-andrew-martins-test-gimmick/|title=411MANIA|website=Bruce Prichard Reveals the Origin of Andrew Martin\u2019s Test Gimmick}}</ref>\n\nOn the January 11, 1999, episode of ''Raw is War'', Test competed in a [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] vs. [[D-Generation X|DX]] Corporate Rumble, which was won by [[Chyna]], making her the 30th entrant in the upcoming Royal Rumble. At the [[Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match but was eliminated by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. On the March 8 episode of ''Raw'', Test defeated X-Pac. At [[WrestleMania XV]] on March 28, Test teamed with [[D'Lo Brown]] in a WWF Tag Team Championship title match against [[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Owen Hart]] where Jarrett and Hart retained their titles. Along with Triple H, he helped [[Shane McMahon]] retain the European Championship against X-Pac at WrestleMania XV. After being removed from the Corporation, Martin joined [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]] who were known to carry 2x4 boards of wood with them. The group briefly [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with the Corporation and at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]], [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]] defeated [[The Corporate Ministry]] in an Eight-man [[elimination tag team match]], before quietly disbanding.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/>\n\n====Relationship with Stephanie McMahon and T & A (1999\u20132000)====\n{{main|T & A (professional wrestling)}}\nMartin then began an on-screen relationship with [[Stephanie McMahon]] that would lead to a \"Love her or Leave her\" match at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]]. He went on to defeat [[Shane McMahon]] at SummerSlam in 1999, gaining Shane's blessing, which led to an on-screen engagement between Stephanie and Martin.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> Later in the storyline, [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]] hit Stephanie with a trash can, which caused her to develop amnesia. Plans for the wedding continued however, and on the night of the wedding Test defeated Triple H with a quick 3-count from a referee in a [[Vince McMahon]] mask. Triple H later showed a video which revealed that he had drugged Stephanie and had taken her to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], where he married her in a drive-through ceremony. Stephanie then turned on Test and aligned herself with Triple H, ushering in the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction|McMahon-Helmsley Era]].<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> Test then had a short feud with DX. On the December 6 episode of ''Raw'', Test and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] were defeated by Triple H and X-Pac. DX would go on to break his nose and force him into matches like a [[handicap match]] against [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] and Albert. On the December 12 episode of ''Heat'', Test faced [[Al Snow]] in a losing effort. The next night on ''Raw is War'', Test teamed with Triple H to face [[The New Age Outlaws]] resulting in Triple H turning on and assaulting him. The next week on ''Raw is War'', Triple H would continue to torment him by putting him in a handicap match against [[The New Age Outlaws]], calling it a \"Christmas present\". On the January 17 episode of ''Raw is War'', Test defeated The Big Boss Man to win the WWF Hardcore Championship. At the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by The [[Big Show]]. Test then lost the [[WWF Hardcore Championship]] to [[Crash Holly]] on the February 24 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]''. Test then turned heel and formed a [[tag team]] with [[Matt Bloom|Albert]]. The two were known as [[T & A (professional wrestling)|T & A]] (Test and Albert) and were managed by [[Trish Stratus]]. At [[WrestleMania 2000]] they defeated [[Al Snow]] and [[Steve Blackman]]. Then at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], T & A (with Trish Stratus) defeated [[The Dudley Boyz]]. At [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]], T & A were defeated in a Four corners elimination match for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] by [[Edge and Christian]].

At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], T & A and Trish Stratus competed against [[The Acolytes Protection Agency]] ([[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] and [[Faarooq]]) and Lita, which ended in a no contest because of T & A attacking The APA before the match. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], T & A and Trish Stratus faced Steve Blackman, Crash Holly and [[Molly Holly]] in a losing effort.\n\n====The Invasion and various feuds (2000\u20132002)====\n{{Main|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|l1=The Invasion|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l2=The Alliance}}\nOn December 28, 2000, Albert attacked Test at the orders of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, effectively disbanding T & A and turning Test face again.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/>\n\nAgain a singles wrestler, Test eliminated [[William Regal]] during the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|2001 Royal Rumble]] match and subsequently defeated him the next night on ''Raw is War'' to win the [[WWE European Championship|WWF European Championship]].<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> Test then feuded with [[Eddie Guerrero]], losing the championship to him at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] following interference from [[Dean Malenko]] and [[Perry Saturn]].

On the June 12 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Rhyno to win the Hardcore Championship he would lose the title back to Rhyno on the June 25 episode of ''Raw is War''.\n\nDuring the Invasion storyline, [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] were suspicious of Test's friendship with Shane McMahon, prior to Shane's heel turn and the formation of the [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|ECW]] half of the Alliance.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> They decided to attack Test because they thought he was the mole within the WWF, only to find out he wasn't. In retaliation, on the August 9, 2001, episode of ''[[SmackDown!]]'', Test turned heel by joining [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] by helping Alliance members [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeat the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]]. Teaming with [[The Dudley Boyz]], Test went on to pin Bradshaw at [[SummerSlam (2001)|SummerSlam]] to defeat the APA and [[Spike Dudley]] in a six-man tag team match.  The next day on ''Raw is War'', Stephanie approached Test with the task of beating [[Chris Jericho]] after Rhyno failed to do so at SummerSlam. Despite past conflicts, they shook hands, thus finally resolving the grudge between himself and Stephanie. After Test won the match against Jericho he would defeat Kane at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]]. He then began teaming with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] regularly in September 2001. Together they defeated [[The Brothers of Destruction]] on the September 27 episode of ''SmackDown!'' to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|WCW Tag Team Championship]]. However they would go on to lose the titles to [[The Hardy Boyz]] on the October 8 episode of ''Raw''. On November 1, Test and Booker T defeated [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Chris Jericho]] on ''SmackDown!'' to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], which they would go on to also lose to The Hardy Boyz eleven days later on ''Raw''.\n\nFollowing this, Test returned to singles competition and began feuding with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. After defeating Edge to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]], Test lost the title back to him in a unification match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Championship]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]].<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> On the same night, he won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which granted him on-screen immunity from being fired for a year after attacking and taking the place of [[Scotty 2 Hotty]]. For the next few weeks, a storyline was built around Test using that immunity to justify attacking fellow wrestlers but the storyline went nowhere and shortly after the year turned it was dropped. At [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]], Test and [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] were defeated by Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert. At the 2002 [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. At [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]], Test and Booker T faced [[Tazz]] and [[Spike Dudley]] for the WWF Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles. At [[WrestleMania X8]], Test, [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] and Lance Storm lost to Rikishi, Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert in six-man tag team match on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]''.\n\nAt the [[WWE brand extension#Raw and SmackDown!|2002]] Draft, Test was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown! brand]]. On the May 2 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test and Christian defeated [[Mark Henry]] and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]. On the May 9 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Mark Henry. On the May 23 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated [[Randy Orton]]. On the May 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated Triple H. On the June 13 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] in a King of the Ring qualifier. The next week, Test defeated [[Hardcore Holly]] in a Quarterfinals match but would go on to lose in the semi-finals of the [[King of the Ring (2002)|King of the Ring]] tournament to the eventual winner, [[Brock Lesnar]]. On the July 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Test, Christian and [[Lance Storm]] formed [[The Un-Americans]]. On the July 25 episode of ''SmackDown!'', [[John Cena]] poked fun at him so he slapped him which led to a match where Cena won. On the July 29 episode of ''Raw'', The Un-Americans left SmackDown! and joined the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]]. Later the night they attacked The Undertaker.\n\nThe storyline culminated in a match at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] where [[The Undertaker]] defeated Test.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> The Un-Americans lost to the team of Kane, Goldust, Booker T and Bubba Ray Dudley at [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]] and after a series of losses The Un-Americans divided, and the stable split in brawling fashion and disbanded in September 2002.\n\n====Relationship with Stacy Keibler (2002\u20132004)====\nIn October 2002, after the Un-Americans dissolved, Test received [[Stacy Keibler]] as his on-screen girlfriend and \"image [[consultant]]\". This began by Keibler telling Test he should embrace his fanbase and call them his \"[[Testicle]]s\", in line with The Rock's fan group, the \"People\", [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]'s \"Kaneanites\", and [[Hulk Hogan]]'s \"Hulkamaniacs\". This eventually culminated with Test cutting off his long hair and trading his trademark leather pants for normal wrestling trunks. The couple were originally heels, but due to the popularity of the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], quickly became faces.<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|2003 Royal Rumble]], Test competed in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by [[Dave Bautista|Batista]]. In May, Test formed a tag team with the returning [[Scott Steiner]], at the request of Keibler, and at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]], they faced [[La R\u00e9sistance (professional wrestling)|La R\u00e9sistance]] in a losing effort. Later in the night, he went on to compete in a [[battle royal]] for the vacant [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]], but it was eventually won by Christian. Test and Stacy eventually split-up due to the ongoing mistreatment of Stacy at the hands of Test, while turning him heel again. At [[Bad Blood (2003)|Bad Blood]], Scott Steiner defeated Test for Stacy Keibler's managerial services. On August 18, Test defeated Steiner on ''Raw'', winning the services of Stacy and announcing his intentions to \"make her a [[Prostitution|whore]]\". At [[Unforgiven (2003)|Unforgiven]], Test again defeated Steiner, forcing him to become his [[Domestic worker|manservant]].<ref name=\"TestProfile\"/> Steiner then attacked Stacy, blaming her for the loss and for him having to take orders from another man. Test then freed Steiner from his obligation, and the pair became a tag team once again, as now both treated Keibler like a slave. The two challenged for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] on multiple occasions but came up short each time. The pair were then fired by [[Mick Foley]] (therefore freeing Stacy Keibler from their control), who was the on-screen guest General Manager for two nights, thus finally ending the year-long angle. They were then re-hired by [[Eric Bischoff]], upon his return to the position of ''RAW'' General Manager. At [[Armageddon (2003)|Armageddon]], Test and Scott Steiner competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles.\n\nTest then had a short feud with [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]] in January 2004, which started after Test kicked [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] (Richard's on-screen girlfriend) in the jaw. They fought several times on ''Sunday Night Heat'', with Richards winning every match. On the January 19 episode of ''Raw'', Test competed in a Triple Threat Royal Rumble Qualifying Match against [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and Scott Steiner. After Goldberg won the match Test and Steiner would officially disband. At [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]], Test was found knocked out backstage by some officials and the ''Raw'' Sheriff Stone Cold Steve Austin when it was his turn to enter. Austin ordered someone to quickly replace Test as the 21st rumble entrant. The person who attacked him and replaces him was revealed to be Mick Foley. Test would gain some revenge on February 2, when he and [[Randy Orton]] attacked Mick Foley in a backstage area. Test would start competing against the likes of [[Rico Constantino|Rico]] and Stevie Richards regularly on ''Heat''. On March 1 episode of Raw, Test and [[Matt Hardy]] were defeated by [[Rob Van Dam]] and Booker T. Test would go on to compete on house shows until he reaggravated the neck injury that had kept him out of action the past few months.\n\nMartin had [[spinal fusion]] surgery performed by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]] in July 2004. On November 1, 2004, it was announced that he was released from his WWE contract along with [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]] and [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]].<ref name=\"Clevett\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/01/696384.html|author=Clevett, J.|title=WWE releases Gunn, Albert & Test|work=Slam!

One of his most notable victories during this tenure was against former TNA wrestler [[Samoa Joe]]. His most prominent role in the independent circuit was in the Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion in Italy, where he took on the ring name \"Big Foot\", due to his \"big boot\" finishing move.\n\n===Return to WWE (2006\u20132007)===\n[[File:AndrewMartinECWLive.jpg|left|thumb|Test making his entrance on ECW]]\nOn March 22, 2006, WWE.com announced that Test had verbally agreed to return to WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com:80/inside/news/testwwe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412060313/http://www.wwe.com:80/inside/news/testwwe|url-status=dead|title=Test returning|publisher=WWE|archivedate=April 12, 2006|accessdate=December 23, 2018}}</ref> Subsequently, [[Vignette (wrestling)|vignettes]] began to play during ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW on Sci Fi]]'', announcing that Test was debuting on the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand.

She is an asari, a [[non-binary gender]]ed sapient [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] species with a [[pansexuality|pansexual]]-[[romantic orientation|panromantic]] orientation and are naturally inclined towards biotics<ref name=\"Alien races\"/>, the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain\", allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> Liara is noted for being the galactic community's foremost expert in the field of Prothean archaeology and technology, specifically evidence concerning the demise of the ancient Protheans, believed by the galactic community to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy until their sudden disappearance fifty thousands years before the events of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.\n\nLiara is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in the video games. Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].\n\nLiara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard.

Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>\n\nThe asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.\n\nAsari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>\n\nHillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure. There\u2019s not a mean bone in her body. I like that about her. She\u2019s very analytical. She doesn\u2019t seem to be out for herself in any way.\"<ref name=\"Interview2\"/> Liara is a possible romantic interest for a male and female [[Commander Shepard]] throughout the entire ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"Gamesradar\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:Jillian Murray 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jillian Murray]] was the face and body model for Liara.]]\nThe asari are a race of \"beautiful, blue aliens\" designed to add a familiar science-fiction element to the series.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \nDue to budget concerns, BioWare realized they would be unable to make both male and female versions for each of the races, which led to the creation of an all-female one.<ref name=\"Final Hours\">''The Final Hours of Mass Effect 3''.</ref> More alien-looking designs for the asari were made, but disregarded for their lack of human attractiveness. Their clothing is meant to be both \"alluring and sexy\" while keeping a sense of \"class and style\", akin to a \"[[Hollywood]] [[red carpet]] feel\".<ref name=\"Art\"/>  \n\nThe hair fins arose from the designers mainly experimenting with different shapes,<ref name=\"Origin\"/> and the scalp tentacles on the asari evoke the image of a woman \"emerging from the water with her hair swept back\".<ref name=\"Art\"/> Inspiration was drawn mainly from sports-gear, such as climbing and scuba gear, particularly its \"pliable, flexible\" qualities.<ref>''Mass Effect Limited Collector's Edition'', Bonus DVD.</ref> After the addition of the hair fins, the asari looked more aquatic, and thus their design was altered to fit with that; this also led to the writers altering the asari home climate to be more wet.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Different silhouettes of clothing were made by the design team trying to find looks that a woman would wear, which would appear both futuristic but not \"too far\", while also in-keeping with the kind of clothes that would be worn in more aquatic environments.<ref name=\"Origin\"/>\n\nThe asari's human-like faces helped the designers in making the characters distinct, and some models were used to tweak the faces.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Unlike other characters made for the game, Liara's face did not have a specific design; instead, her face was taken from the original concepts of the asari.<ref name=\"Art\"/> American actress [[Jillian Murray]]'s face and body scans provide the basis for Liara's final design.<ref name=\"Girls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim.com/girls-of-maxim/jillian-murray |title=Girls of Maxim: Jillian Murray |date=October 21, 2009 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ke7vtpE1 |archivedate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Many asari in the series use facepaints, which helps the design team with diversifying asari characters.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Liara's facial design incorporates blue-coloured freckles instead of facepaint.<ref name=\"Endearing\"/> \n\nLiara T'Soni was Ali Hillis' first voice acting role for a video game.<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> When she first began voicing Liara, she was unfamiliar with voicing video game characters nor did she expect much out of the character.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/interview/2950-ali-hillis-interview |title=Ali Hillis Interview |last=Ward |first=Dave |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}</ref> To prepare for the role, particularly for a complicated character like Liara, she would try to \"find an essence, a simplicity of a character\".<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> She credited voice director [[Ginny McSwain]] for guiding her through the entire process, by explaining to her Liara's background, who she was and the different layers of her personality, noting that all she had was a still drawing of Liara to refer to.<ref name=\"Interview\"/> \n\nLiara's outfit from the ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'' DLC was chosen by BioWare as her default appearance for ''Mass Effect 3''. The white jacket is a reminder of her background in science, while the more armor-like pieces serves a reminder to the player that the galaxy is at war, and that civilians are part of the war effort where they have to arm and defend themselves.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\n====''Mass Effect''====\n{{main|Mass Effect (video game)}}\n[[File:LiaraOriginal.png|thumb|right|Prior to ''Mass Effect 3'', fans were most familiar with Liara's outfit in the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"Art\"/> ]]\nLiara is the estranged child of Matriarch Benezia, a well-respected and powerful asari biotic.<ref name=\"Benezia\"/> Following the exposure of Benezia's involvement with the disgraced Spectre Saren Arterius and their search for an artifact known as the Conduit, Shepard is given a lead to search for Liara and discover what she knows. Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.\n\nOn her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nLiara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicking Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. \n\nLiara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".\n\n====Mass Effect 3====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}\nLiara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.\n\nAfter the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>\n\nIf the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.\n\nDuring the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.\n\n====Mass Effect: Andromeda====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}\nLiara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.\n\n===In other media===\n====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}\nThe narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====\nLiara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nLiara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.\n\nAt the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.\n\nAs Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted.

In a 2007 article written for ''GameSetWatch'', Chris Dahlen explained that while he found ''Mass Effect'' disappointing, particularly the lacklustre characterization of its NPC's, he noted that Liara was the \"less obnoxious\" of the available romance options and her explanations about the asari species well articulated.<ref name=\"GameSetWatch\"/> UGO.com included Liara in their list of the 50 sexiest female scientists.<ref name=\"Foxiest\"/> IGN ranked her fourth on their list of best ''Mass Effect'' teammates published in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/05/10-best-mass-effect-teammates?page=2 |title=10 Best Mass Effect Teammates|author= Steven Hopper|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> \n\nFollowing the release of ''Mass Effect 3'', various media outlets have identified Liara as one of the trilogy's best characters.

She is an asari, a [[non-binary gender]]ed sapient [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] species with a [[pansexuality|pansexual]]-[[romantic orientation|panromantic]] orientation and are naturally inclined towards biotics<ref name=\"Alien races\"/>, the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain\", allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> Liara is noted for being the galactic community's foremost expert in the field of Prothean archaeology and technology, specifically evidence concerning the demise of the ancient Protheans, believed by the galactic community to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy until their sudden disappearance fifty thousands years before the events of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.\n\nLiara is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in the video games. Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].\n\nLiara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' squadmates, has been released.\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I think, especially in Mass Effect 1 before she started to evolve, that almost everything was a discovery but especially in her relationships.

Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>\n\nThe asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner\u2019s using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.\n\nAsari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>\n\nHillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure. There\u2019s not a mean bone in her body. I like that about her. She\u2019s very analytical. She doesn\u2019t seem to be out for herself in any way.\"<ref name=\"Interview2\"/> Liara is a possible romantic interest for a male and female [[Commander Shepard]] throughout the entire ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"Gamesradar\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:Jillian Murray 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jillian Murray]] was the face and body model for Liara.]]\nThe asari are a race of \"beautiful, blue aliens\" designed to add a familiar science-fiction element to the series.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \nDue to budget concerns, BioWare realized they would be unable to make both male and female versions for each of the races, which led to the creation of an all-female one.<ref name=\"Final Hours\">''The Final Hours of Mass Effect 3''.</ref> More alien-looking designs for the asari were made, but disregarded for their lack of human attractiveness. Their clothing is meant to be both \"alluring and sexy\" while keeping a sense of \"class and style\", akin to a \"[[Hollywood]] [[red carpet]] feel\".<ref name=\"Art\"/>  \n\nThe hair fins arose from the designers mainly experimenting with different shapes,<ref name=\"Origin\"/> and the scalp tentacles on the asari evoke the image of a woman \"emerging from the water with her hair swept back\".<ref name=\"Art\"/> Inspiration was drawn mainly from sports-gear, such as climbing and scuba gear, particularly its \"pliable, flexible\" qualities.<ref>''Mass Effect Limited Collector's Edition'', Bonus DVD.</ref> After the addition of the hair fins, the asari looked more aquatic, and thus their design was altered to fit with that; this also led to the writers altering the asari home climate to be more wet.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Different silhouettes of clothing were made by the design team trying to find looks that a woman would wear, which would appear both futuristic but not \"too far\", while also in-keeping with the kind of clothes that would be worn in more aquatic environments.<ref name=\"Origin\"/>\n\nThe asari's human-like faces helped the designers in making the characters distinct, and some models were used to tweak the faces.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Unlike other characters made for the game, Liara's face did not have a specific design; instead, her face was taken from the original concepts of the asari.<ref name=\"Art\"/> American actress [[Jillian Murray]]'s face and body scans provide the basis for Liara's final design.<ref name=\"Girls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim.com/girls-of-maxim/jillian-murray |title=Girls of Maxim: Jillian Murray |date=October 21, 2009 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ke7vtpE1 |archivedate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Many asari in the series use facepaints, which helps the design team with diversifying asari characters.<ref name=\"Origin\"/> Liara's facial design incorporates blue-coloured freckles instead of facepaint.<ref name=\"Endearing\"/> \n\nLiara T'Soni was Ali Hillis' first voice acting role for a video game.<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> When she first began voicing Liara, she was unfamiliar with voicing video game characters nor did she expect much out of the character.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgsite.net/interview/2950-ali-hillis-interview |title=Ali Hillis Interview |last=Ward |first=Dave |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}</ref> To prepare for the role, particularly for a complicated character like Liara, she would try to \"find an essence, a simplicity of a character\".<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> She credited voice director [[Ginny McSwain]] for guiding her through the entire process, by explaining to her Liara's background, who she was and the different layers of her personality, noting that all she had was a still drawing of Liara to refer to.<ref name=\"Interview\"/> \n\nLiara's outfit from the ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'' DLC was chosen by BioWare as her default appearance for ''Mass Effect 3''. The white jacket is a reminder of her background in science, while the more armor-like pieces serves a reminder to the player that the galaxy is at war, and that civilians are part of the war effort where they have to arm and defend themselves.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\n====''Mass Effect''====\n{{main|Mass Effect (video game)}}\n[[File:LiaraOriginal.png|thumb|right|Prior to ''Mass Effect 3'', fans were most familiar with Liara's outfit in the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"Art\"/> ]]\nLiara is the estranged child of Matriarch Benezia, a well-respected and powerful asari biotic.<ref name=\"Benezia\"/> Following the exposure of Benezia's involvement with the disgraced Spectre Saren Arterius and their search for an artifact known as the Conduit, Shepard is given a lead to search for Liara and discover what she knows. Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.\n\nOn her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nLiara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicing Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. \n\nLiara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".\n\n====Mass Effect 3====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}\nLiara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.\n\nAfter the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>\n\nIf the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.\n\nDuring the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.\n\n====Mass Effect: Andromeda====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}\nLiara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.\n\n===In other media===\n====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}\nThe narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====\nLiara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nLiara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.\n\nAt the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.\n\nAs Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted.

In a 2007 article written for ''GameSetWatch'', Chris Dahlen explained that while he found ''Mass Effect'' disappointing, particularly the lacklustre characterization of its NPC's, he noted that Liara was the \"less obnoxious\" of the available romance options and her explanations about the asari species well articulated.<ref name=\"GameSetWatch\"/> UGO.com included Liara in their list of the 50 sexiest female scientists.<ref name=\"Foxiest\"/> IGN ranked her fourth on their list of best ''Mass Effect'' teammates published in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/05/10-best-mass-effect-teammates?page=2 |title=10 Best Mass Effect Teammates|author= Steven Hopper|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> \n\nFollowing the release of ''Mass Effect 3'', various media outlets have identified Liara as one of the trilogy's best characters.

{"title_page": "List of Black Lagoon characters", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}\n{{original research|date=December 2014}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Black Lagoon'' characters}}\n\nThe following is a list of characters from the Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] ''[[Black Lagoon]]''.\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n== The Lagoon Company ==\n[[Image:Lagoon Company.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|The entire Lagoon Company. From left to right: Benny, Rock, Revy and Dutch.]]\nThe '''Lagoon Company''' is a [[mercenary]]/[[Piracy|pirate]] group that is the main focus of the series, hired by the many criminal organisations operating in and around Roanapur to locate, acquire and smuggle items by sea.\n\n=== Rokuro Okajima / Rock ===\n{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]|[[Brad Swaile]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rokuro Okajima'''|\u5ca1\u5cf6\u7dd1\u90ce|Okajima Rokur\u014d}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Rock'''|\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Rokku}}, is the [[main character]] in the series. In the anime version, but not in the manga, he is also the [[narrator]] of the story.\n\nHe was a 25-year-old [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[salaryman]] for Asahi Industries in [[Tokyo]] until he was taken hostage by the crew of the ''Black Lagoon'' during their raid on the ship he was on. He joined the Lagoon Company after his department chief Kageyama abandoned him (Kageyama declared him dead) in an attempt to cover up the [[smuggling]] operation in which Rock had been an unwitting participant. Rock is a caring and good-natured [[everyman]] despite being on the business end of guns from friend and foe alike, and often seems surprised at the dangers of the [[Southeast Asian]] crime world. He still wears his tie, dress shirt, and dress pants because although now a pirate, he still retains his business persona. He prefers to use words over weapons when interacting with others. Rock, after joining the Lagoon company, has wondered if he is experiencing [[Stockholm syndrome]].\n\nWithin the Lagoon Company, Rock is usually responsible for account management, diplomacy, negotiation, interpretation, and the occasional errand. Having once worked in the resource investigation department of Asahi Industries, Rock is also skilled in [[geology]]. He is also a natural linguist, being effectively bilingual in Japanese, his [[native language]], and English as well as being familiar with other languages, including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]. He also has a surprisingly high tolerance for [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], owing to the heavy-drinking lifestyle of a ladder-climbing salaryman. Rock's charismatic personality has earned him the interest of several figures in Roanapur, including Balalaika, Mr. Chang, Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon, Yolanda, Eda (who develops a crush on him), and young Garcia Lovelace. In many ways, Rock is the heart of the Lagoon Company, serving as a balance for his more callous teammates and as an average counterbalance in the world of darkness that is Roanapur. Dutch has stated that he believes Lagoon Company is complete with Rock not holding a gun, saying his bullets are the kind to ricochet back at them.\n\nDespite his lack of combat experience, Rock has come through every adventure, kidnapping and firefight with only a few bruises, surviving personal confrontations with most of Roanapur's most dangerous criminals at some point. Rock eventually begins to enjoy his life as a pirate and becomes even more comfortable with corruption.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 9|year=2010|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=El Baile de la muerte, Part 24|page=|isbn=978-1-4215-3629-3}}</ref> This comes to the fore when Mr Chang personally enlists Rock to locate Roberta before she is killed by US Special Forces, as he demonstrates a duplicitous, ruthless side of his personality clearly influenced by Revy and Roanapur.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 9|year=2010|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=El Baile de la muerte, Part 30|page=|isbn=978-1-4215-3629-3}}</ref> He devises a scheme to extract the US soldiers from the city to draw Roberta out, accounting even for Garcia's loyalty, Roberta's psychosis and the personal vendattas amongst the criminals, treating the entire plan like a gambling game. He is forced back towards kindness in the extra missing pages of chapter 76 after an angered Fabiola shoots him with a blank round. In \"The Wired Red Wild Card\" arc, he is last seen driving a car with Revy.\n\nWhile Rock has a family in Tokyo, he does not have connection to them due to their somewhat cold attitude towards him. It was later revealed that he did not pass his college entrance exams on his first try, leading his family to lower their expectations of him. It is known that he has a father, a mother, and an older brother who was academically capable and thus attained a job in the Japanese government. He was born in the 49th year of the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], according to the manga version, which corresponds to 1975\u20131976.\n\n=== Revy ===\n{{voiced by|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]]|[[Maryke Hendrikse]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Revy'''|\u30ec\u30f4\u30a3|Revi|mistranslated '''Levy''' in some adaptations}}, sometimes referred by her real name of '''Rebecca Lee''', is the co-[[protagonist]] of the series. She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past. Revy is a [[Chinese American]] mid to late 20s from [[Chinatown, Manhattan]], near [[Mott Street]], who spent most of her youth as a criminal. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that she may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting her [[Physical abuse|abusive]] father, using a pillow as a [[Suppressor|silencer]]. Revy is very confident, grumpy, aggressive, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], and [[Mental disorder|emotionally unstable]]. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and violence to get her way. In contrast to this, she is revealed to be highly ticklish. She is also a [[Chain smoking|heavy smoker]] and [[Alcoholism|drinker]]. Of all the characters in the series, Revy is recognized as the most foul-mouthed character, yelling constant profanity.\n\nShe is a sadistic killer without a conscience who will murder anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians. She has a loving but bullying attitude towards Rock, the newest and most friendly crew member of the ''Black Lagoon''; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly threatening towards him, having nearly murdered him on two occasions and threatening him with death on several others. However, she does act to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is likely that she is attracted to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda's teasing, which appear to be jealousy. Her attraction is further suggested in the last scenes of Season 2 when Eda asked her if she had gotten anywhere with Rock, instead of denying it with a short comment as usual she said she rather not say causing Eda to laugh at her hopelessness when it comes to men.\n\nRevy is also very protective of Rock. An example can be found in her anger and resolve to kill Chaka after he beats Rock. She has also lied or gone against her \"nature\" in order to save him; such as when he was kidnapped by Takenaka and she lied about him having the documents they required when she actually had them the whole time, or when she stood up to Balalaika when she held Rock at gunpoint after he opposed her plan to destroy the Washimine clan. She also went to Japan as his bodyguard (when Rock acted as Balalaika's interpreter), but as pointed out by Benny the only real reason she went was to look after him because she was worried about him.\n\nAccording to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents on [[Basilan (island)|Basilan Island]], Revy is still notorious in the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] (particularly at the fictional 27th Precinct).\n\nRevy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparalleled. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat. In episode 11 of the first season Revy concedes to Mr. Chang that she does not possess his level of skill but hopes to attain it eventually. Her weapons of choice are a [[Akimbo (firearms)|pair]] of modified [[Beretta 92]]FS's; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for [[suppressor|silencers]]. They are engraved with the words \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, the [[Jolly Roger]] of the pirate [[Calico Jack]] (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in [[Thai alphabet|Thai]]. Due to her [[Cross-dominance|ambidextrous]] marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hands\" by the denizens of Roanapur, which is based on Douglas E. Winter's novel '''Run'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 1|year=2008|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Editor's Note: Revy \"Two Hand\"|page=206|isbn=978-1-4215-1382-9}}</ref> Revy is also proficient in the use of other weapons, such as high-powered rifles and the [[M79 grenade launcher]]. Constantly living on the edge of life combined with the tragedies of her past, Revy has developed a rather bleak outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money.\n\n=== Dutch ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tsutomu Isobe]]|[[Dean Redman]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Dutch'''|\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1|Datchi}} is the [[African American]] leader of the Lagoon Company and captain of the ex-[[U.S. Navy]] [[PT boat]] ''Black Lagoon''. Age 40\u201350, he is a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] who fought in the [[Vietnam War]]. Shortly before the war ended (presumably in 1973), Dutch went [[AWOL]], escaping to [[Thailand]] to work as a mercenary.\n\nDutch first appears where he scolds Revy for taking Rock as a hostage when she had no real plan for obtaining any ransom. Because of this, Dutch apologizes and tries to take care of Rock until they find a safe place to abandon him. As Rock later proves to be incredibly useful, Dutch allows Revy to invite him into the Lagoon Company. Dutch tends to stay away from the fighting associated with Lagoon Company's activities. Instead, he gives orders and negotiates contracts with clients from the many criminal groups of Roanapur. However, Dutch is very capable in combat, skillfully wielding a [[Remington 870]] Marine Magnum shotgun and a [[Smith & Wesson Model 29|Smith & Wesson 629]] revolver. Despite his amoral lifestyle, Dutch is polite and laid-back character, and most of the time, is very considerate. He has a close association with Balalaika of Hotel Moscow, having saved her life during one of Roanapur's gang wars. \n\nHis body is heavily muscled, and he is always seen wearing a pair of sunglasses, typically dressed in camouflage pants and wearing a [[flak jacket]]. He appears to be in his 30s, but is most likely in his 40s, given his apparent military service in Vietnam given the setting of ''Black Lagoon'' in the 1990s. In the \"Baile de los Muertos\" saga in the manga, it is suggested that Dutch lied about his Vietnam service and could just simply be a mercenary with no past. However a U.S soldier advised Benny to be wary of Dutch, because a man like Dutch never lies without a serious reason.\n\n=== Benny ===\n{{voiced by|[[Hiroaki Hirata]]|[[Brian Drummond]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Benny'''|\u30d9\u30cb\u30fc|Ben\u012b}} is a [[High school dropouts|dropout]] from a college in [[Florida]] where he studied until getting into trouble with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the mafia. Benny would have ended up dead if Revy had not saved him. He works as the Lagoon Company's [[mechanic]], computer specialist, and researcher. He also functions as the Lagoon's driver and appears to be the owner of the [[Dodge Coronet#1968-70|1969 Dodge Coronet R/T]] (later replaced with a [[Pontiac GTO#First generation|1965 Pontiac GTO]]) that Lagoon Company travels around Roanapur in. He is Jewish, or at least of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent as he puts it, and is often called \"Benny-Boy\" by Dutch. Benny joined the Lagoon Company two years before Rock after Revy rescued him. Benny has a level-headed and anxiety-free personality. He readily admits to Rock that the two of them are not gunfighters in any way, shape, or form. Unlike Rock, however, Benny is willing to turn a blind eye to Revy and Dutch's barbaric methods. Benny also tends to be possessive of his computers and will not let anyone else touch them. In the second season, he met Greenback Jane and after impressing her with his computer abilities, began an online relationship with her. Jane returns to Roanapur following the teams completion of the Lovelace Incident and Benny meets up with her. Possibly based on [[Jake Adelstein]].\n\n== Hotel Moscow ==\n[[File:Hotel Moscow - Black Lagoon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Boris and Balalaika.]]\n'''Hotel Moscow''' is a branch of the [[Russian mafia]] based on Thai soil named after the Russian capital city of [[Moscow]]. The Bougainvillea Trade Company serves as a front for their activities. It is composed of the men who served under Balalaika in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], who are dedicated to her. They are relatively new to Roanapur, but their brutality, discipline and prior experience make most of the gangsters wary of them.\n\n=== Balalaika ===\n{{voiced by|[[Mami Koyama]]|[[Patricia Drake]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Balalaika'''|\u30d0\u30e9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab|Bararaika}} is the [[Boss (crime)|boss]] of Hotel Moscow. Her real name is Sofiya Pavlovna. She was brought up by her grandfather, the military head of the [[USSR]]. Before joining the mafia, Balalaika was a captain in the [[Soviet Army]] and a ''[[Russian Airborne Troops|Vozdushno-Desantnye Vojska]]'' paratrooper who served in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. A fine marksman and sniper, she was nicknamed \"[[balalaika]]\", one of the Soviet Army's slang terms for the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]]. After being dismissed by the Soviet Military, Balalaika has an intense hatred for the corrupt Russian government and its influence over her country. It is because of this Balalaika decided to work for the Russian Mafia. Due to Balalaika's leadership during the hellish fighting in [[Afghanistan]], her men look up to her as their superior and will do just about anything upon her orders. As a combat officer, she is a skilled strategist and well-rounded fighter, capable of taking care of herself despite the fact that all of her troopers, including Boris, often worry about her. Although she has shown herself to be rather cynical on occasion, she is also a pragmatic and professional businesswoman. She frequently employs Dutch and the Lagoon Company, as he saved her life after she was shot by Mr Chang during a gang war. She, along with Mr Chang, are one of the few people that Revy respects, and Revy would affectionately refer to her as \"Sis\". In turn, Balalaika also seems to hold Rock in high regard, sometimes relying on his knowledge and business skills.  \n\nBalalaika can be easily identified by the burn marks which scar most of the right side of her face, neck, and chest which she suffered in Afghanistan, earning her the nickname \"Fry-Face\" by those who dislike her. She has long blonde hair, and usually wears a [[greatcoat|military greatcoat]], thrown over a low-cut business suit. She smokes [[cigar]]s, in contrast with the other characters who smoke [[cigarette]]s. Based on her service in Afghanistan and the missed opportunity to participate in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], she is between 31\u201335 years old.\n\nIn critical operations, Balalaika calls upon a personal cadre of ex-Soviet airborne troops and [[Spetsnaz GRU|Spetsnaz]] commandos who are Afghanistan veterans. Known as the ''Desantniki'',<ref>In the manga and English dub, they were called Vysotoniki.</ref> they act as Hotel Moscow's special ops team. She and her men share a strong fellowship and there is a great deal of mutual loyalty between them. It is implied that many of her current operatives served with her in [[Afghanistan]]. When conducting foreign operations from Thai soil, she uses the Russian cargo ship ''Maria Zeleska'' as a legal cover from the police and various law enforcement agencies. In spite of the fact that Balalaika is on the [[Interpol]] list, she uses the pseudonym Vladilena N. Vasilinov in Japan, being covered by [[diplomatic immunity]].\n\n=== Boris ===\n{{voiced by|[[Taiten Kusunoki]]|[[Mark Acheson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Boris'''|\u30dc\u30ea\u30b9|Borisu}} is Balalaika's second-in-command. He can be easily identified by the large scar running from the right side of his forehead to his left cheek. He is a calm, broad-built man with a deep Russian accent. Like Balalaika, he also saw service in Afghanistan. She still refers to him as \"Comrade Sergeant\" rather than by his name, suggesting that he was her former [[platoon sergeant]]. He is very loyal and protective of Balalaika and often worries for her safety when she decides to fight in the field.\n\n== The Hong Kong Triad ==\nThe '''Hong Kong Triad''' are a branch of the [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] stationed in Roanapur. They are led by Mr. Chang, who is a proficient gun fighter in his own right. Chang is more patient than Balalaika in terms of getting into battle. Under his services are Shenhua, who is his top assassin; Sawyer, who does disposal jobs for him frequently despite not being a member of the organization, and Leigharch, who is their getaway driver until recent events prevented him from acting in this capacity.\n\n=== Mr. Chang ===\n{{voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]|[[Trevor Devall]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Bai Ji-Shin Chang'''|\u5f35\u7dad\u65b0|Chan Waisan}} is the [[Boss (crime)|boss]] of a Thailand branch of the [[Sun Yee On]] [[Triad society|Triad]]. Like Revy, he is adept with dual-wielding pistols ([[Beretta 70#76|Beretta 76]] and [[AMT Hardballer]]) in a fashion similar to that of [[gun fu]], the former of which are inscribed with a Chinese symbol, meaning \"Heavenly King\", on the grips. Chang is far more proficient in this dual-wielding gunfighting style than Revy, who, in episode 11, freely admits that she is \"not on his level yet\". It may be this prowess in combat that makes Chang the only male whom Revy respectfully refers to as \"Sir\".\n\nHe has a deep respect for Balalaika (who annoys him by referring to him as \"Babe\"), though their beliefs are known to collide. Their relationship is almost playful in a business sort of way, which began after they survived a shootout with each other. They both recognise they would make a strong partnership in crime, but choose not to because it would make their respective lives boring. Chang is rather amused at Rock's \"unique\" way of handling things. Unlike most criminal bosses in the town, he advocates cooperation and joint ventures to keep the [[status quo]] in Roanapur, knowing outside interference would see all the criminals lose. A conversation with Eda just before Roberta's second rampage reveals Chang is in fact secretly backed by the CIA, being permitted to continue his criminal activities in exchange for keeping Roanapur relatively peaceful.\n\nChang seems easily amused, and unusually-easygoing and lighthearted, especially given his position. This might be attributed to the fact that he was once a member of law enforcement, which he reveals after being called 'an inhuman scumbag' by Rock and laughing out loud in response, and he might very well be seeing his current position as an ironic twist of fate. The only time he is shown to be truly angry is when Eda (disguising her voice) taunts him about the USA's influence and the fact he has no choice but to cooperate with them.\n\nHis past as law enforcer may explain his combat expertise. Chang manages to survive a shootout with Balalaika, escape from ambush of superior number of Islamic front jihadists, and disarm Fabiola easily. His expertise is often overshadowed by his easygoing character, in comparison with the ill-tempered Revy and near-psychotic Roberta.\n\nMr. Chang is based on characters commonly played by [[Chow Yun-fat]] in films by [[John Woo]], such as John Lee in ''[[Replacement Killers]]'' and especially [[Mark Gor]] in ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'', as both Chang and Mark Gor are members of the Hong Kong Triads, wield dual pistols and don similar attire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 3|year=2008|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Editor's Note: The Triads|page=193|isbn=978-1-4215-1892-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Shenhua ===\n{{voiced by|Y\u016bko Sasaki|[[Saffron Henderson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Shenhua'''|\u30b7\u30a7\u30f3\u30db\u30a2|Shenhoa}} is a [[Taiwan]]ese [[assassination|assassin]] in the employ of Mr. Chang. She prefers to use various edged weapons in close combat, in particular a pair of [[Kukri]] knives linked together with a length of leather rope at the handles, thus using them as modified [[rope dart]]s. She is also skilled in the use of throwing knives. Shenhua is a professional rival of Revy (who refers to her as \"Chinglish\" in the anime and \"Yes Lady\" in the manga; in return Shenhua calls Revy \"[[Twinkie]]\" in the anime (yellow on the outside (Chinese) and white on the inside), whom she has worked with and against at times. Her personal religion is [[Taoism]]. However, she tells Eda in episode 18 that she is an [[atheist]], but this was due to a mistranslation in the English dubbed anime. One of her most notable traits is her broken speech pattern, which is always moving between [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[English language|English]]. She is last seen being helped to walk by Lotton (who says that he will take her to a doctor, despite her having suffered what she believes to be a fatal wound) after being shot by Eda while hunting for Greenback Jane. In the El Baile de la Muerte arc, she is revealed to have survived the battle when Revy is shown calling her on the phone. She agrees to take up Revy's offer to help Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel who is trying to kill Roberta. She showed her first glimpse of fear when in close range combat with Roberta when she managed to catch one of Shenhua's kukri in her teeth and shattered the blade to pieces.\n\nIt is unknown if Shenhua has any unarmed hand-to-hand skills, although it seems likely. In the anime, she fights only with blades, and never engages anyone in true hand-to-hand combat. The only other person who does this is Sawyer the Cleaner, who frequently works with her in \"disposal\" jobs.\n\n=== Leigharch ===\n{{voiced by|Akimasa Ohmori|[[Trevor Devall]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Leigharch'''|\u30ec\u30ac\u30fc\u30c1|Reg\u0101chi}} is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] who worked with Shenhua during the incident involving the Islamic Liberation Front. A compulsive user of [[marijuana]], he has a distressingly frequent tendency to hallucinate at inopportune times, such as in the middle of a car chase. Most of his hallucinations are actually references to Western pop culture, such as [[Playmate]]s, ''[[Star Trek]]'' characters like [[Jean-Luc Picard]] and [[Klingon]]s, or 1960s rock music such as [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Leigharch is said by Shenhua during the Greenback Jane incident to have suffered a massive overdose (he \"couldn't get back from Mars\"), inducing psychological damage severe enough to commit him to full-time medical attention. Despite his drug addiction and hallucinations, he was still considered a skilled driver before his overdose.\n\n== The Colombian Cartel ==\nThe [[Colombia]]n cartel noted in this section is separate from the Manisalera Cartel which was originally responsible for Garcia Lovelace's kidnapping and was subsequently wiped out by Roberta and Balalaika who seems to have since taken over their territory. Along with the [[Italian Mafia]], they are the most brash of the criminal organizations, much to the disgust of Balalaika and Chang. Just them barely appearing often results in needless fighting and bloodshed. They are led by Abrego, who is somewhat of a coward and usually travels with his men. Lately, they have been made a fool of in the criminal underworld because of the Lovelace Family and their two killer maids. While the Italians do it for profit, the Cartels do it as a sense of pride, which usually gets them into unwanted trouble. It is revealed that they had a hand in the assassination of Diego Lovelace.\n\n=== Abrego ===\n{{voiced by|[[Hisao Egawa]]|[[Eli Gabay]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Abrego'''|\u30a2\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b4|Abur\u0113go}} is a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] drug cartel boss operating in Roanapur. Whilst very arrogant, he has a tendency to be cowardly. He was presumed dead after the South American maid Roberta detonated a bomb in the bar he was in, although his appearance in later episodes is evidence that he somehow survived. After the explosion and the loss of many of his gunmen, Abrego's influence in Roanapur seems to have fallen, judging from the attitude he takes from Balalaika, Chang and Verrocchio. He is once again made a fool of, this time by Fabiola.\n\nEver since the incident with Roberta, the Cartel had tried numerous times to figure out where she was hiding; fortunately for Roberta, through her connection with the Lovelace family, Roberta was protected daily by local police and military forces. Thus, the Cartel couldn't even touch her without causing an incident. Currently, he sends for many [[FARC]] soldiers to assist the cartel in finding Roberta; however, much of the FARC has been suspicious of the cartel's action and even threatened to betray them.\n\n=== Gustavo ===\nVoiced by: [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]] (English)\n\n{{nihongo|'''Gustavo'''|\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc|Gusut\u0101bo}} is one of Abrego's main henchmen. At first, he is seen doing simple tasks for Abrego, such as disposal jobs, early in the series. Recently, he's been assigned to track down Roberta after hearing rumors of her returning to the city by other groups, including the police, Triad, and Hotel Moscow. He, along with some men, search for Roberta throughout the city and meets up with Revy and Rock. He then explains the situation within the Cartel regarding Roberta. He then crosses paths with Fabiola, who is requesting the aid of Lagoon Company. Fabiola is threatened by him and his men, as Revy then instigates a fight between them, resulting in a comical argument between him and Bao over the use of the telephone, much to Revy's amusement. In desperation, he tries to call Abrego, who is out with a girl according to his subordinates. He calls all of them in to warn them of another maid who is as fierce as Roberta. Finally, he orders the total destruction of the Yellow Flag, much to Bao's anger as the Yellow Flag is demolished again. He is left behind by his men after Fabiola scares them off. Because of his failure, Abrego has ordered him to be killed on sight. He is later seen at Abrego's side during a meeting with the other gangs, perhaps Abrego becomes aware with heavy losses he caused.\n\n== Other Roanapur gangsters ==\n=== Verrocchio ===\n{{voiced by|[[Banjo Ginga]]|[[Scott McNeil]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Verrocchio'''|\u30f4\u30a7\u30ed\u30c3\u30ad\u30aa|Verokkio}} is the boss of a branch of the [[Sicilian Mafia|Italian mafia]] based in [[Thailand]]. He once attempted to use the child assassins, H\u00e4nsel and Gretel, to kill the rival gang leaders, including Balalaika and Mr. Chang, in an attempt to seize complete leadership of Roanapur's criminal underworld. Verrocchio was killed when H\u00e4nsel and Gretel turned against him on a murderous whim.\n\n=== Ronny the Jaws ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]|[[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]}}\n\n'''Ronny the Jaws''' is Verrocchio's replacement as the Italian Mafia's boss after his death at the hands of the twins. He wears braces; hence his name. His real name was unknown until Chapter 79. Balalaika calls him by the derogatory slang \"Dago\" prior to this. He seems to have a cooler head than Verrocchio but is still plenty arrogant and foolish. Balalaika and Chang seem to dislike him and his immature way of handling serious business. He doesn't hold much respect for Abrego either and treats him rudely despite being the newest amongst members of those holding the most power in Roanapur. Revy says his group is almost as vicious as Hotel Moscow and he appears to have an alliance with the [[Albanian Mafia]].\n\n=== Chen ===\n{{voiced by|Suetsu Tokaichi|[[Louis Chirillo]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chen'''|\u9673|Chin}} was a Chinese crime boss whose business suffered as a result of Hotel Moscow recently muscling into Roanapur. He is quite cowardly, and Dutch had already stopped taking him seriously after he pulled out of a previous contract he had made with the Lagoon Company. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate Dutch into ending his contracts with Hotel Moscow, he has a proxy hire Lagoon Company for a job and then sends the pirate gang of Luak to ambush them, but Revy and Dutch wipe out the entire fleet. Chen, having bragged about his plan to most of Roanapur, is then located by Hotel Moscow and murdered; they tie him to a chair in his apartment and blow it up using plastic explosives and gasoline.\n\n=== Luak ===\n{{voiced by|[[Naoya Uchida]]|[[Alistair Abell]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Luak'''|\u30eb\u30a2\u30af|Ruaku}} is the captain of a Vietnamese pirate gang that operated in the rivers and seas of Thailand, mostly composed by former [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] defectors. He was contracted by Chen to kill off the Lagoon Company when Dutch wouldn't accept Chen over Balalaika. Luak's gang ambushed the Black Lagoon, but the entire gang was wiped out by Revy and Dutch. Revy is seen to fire a round from an [[M79 grenade launcher]] into his boat at the end of the fight destroying it, so he is presumed dead. \n\n== The Church of Violence/The Rip-Off Church ==\nThe '''Church of Violence''' is a drugs and weapon smuggling operation located in Roanapur. The church is notorious for its double dealings. Using their front as a Christian church, their main business is illegal imports, mainly firearms. However, they are known to import other items, including drugs, which seems to offend Balalaika as it is bad for their business. So far they have consistently outsmarted Hotel Moscow in terms of imports. Dutch refers them as '''\"The Rip-Off Church\"''' due to the group charging heavily on goods, especially those needed for missions. Rock has been able to arrange proper business deals with the Church. The Church is always money-hungry and are known to do double-dealings, much to the disgust of Revy.\n\n=== Eda ===\n{{voiced by|[[Jun Karasawa]]|[[Lisa Ann Beley]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Eda'''|\u30a8\u30c0}} is a woman posing as a [[nun]] in the Rip-Off Church, with ties to the underground, since the convent is mainly a smuggling organization. About 30-year-old, she is friends with Revy and often drinks with her in the Rip-off Church, but this does not prevent them from confronting each other, as they share the same hotheaded personality. She has taken a liking to Rock during the \"Second Barrage\" episodes, and makes fun of Revy by threatening to take Rock for herself. She often calls Rock \"Romeo\".\n\nEda has blond hair, blue eyes, and wears angular pink sunglasses even with her nun's [[Religious habit|habit]], and is often seen either chewing gum or smoking. She is in her mid-30s. Before she came to work for the Church, she claimed to be from [[Langley, Virginia]]. Langley, Virginia, is a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the CIA as its headquarters is located there. Later on, it is revealed that Eda is an operative for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and is being hosted by the Church of Violence in return for monetary payments. She is given an assignment by the CIA to track down Grey Fox, the same foe Roberta is hunting as they are a threat to her CIA division. Using a voice changer inside a mobile, Eda acts as an anonymous handler for Mr. Chang, providing him with intelligence about Grey Fox's mission to capture a major figure in the Triad's drug manufacturing operation. Chang is aggravated by the way he is being manipulated, but Eda mocks him as just a \"two-bit thug\" compared to the USA. Rock is perhaps the only person in Roanapur who openly suspects who Eda might be working for.\n\nEda's preferred firearm is a [[Glock 17L]] (as seen in manga chapter 41), which she wields proficiently, despite Revy's claims that she is a \"second-rate gunman\".\n\nShe apparently was loosely modeled after the character Thana from ''[[Ms. 45]]''.\n\n=== Yolanda ===\n{{voiced by|Akiko Takeguchi|[[Shirley Millner]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yolanda'''|\u30e8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0|Yoranda}} is the leader of The Rip-Off Church. She appears to be quite old and wears an [[eyepatch]] over her right eye. Despite her age and gentle appearance, she leads her organization with an iron fist. As the head of her organization, Yolanda usually never fights, leaving this job to gunmen like Eda and Rico. However, she does carry a customized [[Gold plating|golden]] [[Desert Eagle]] and uses it without hesitation in due course, such as in chapter 38 of the manga. She can fire the Desert Eagle one-handed and with deadly accuracy, seemingly unaffected by the gun's infamous weight and heavy recoil. Her looks could be based on [[Mother Angelica]], a real-life [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] nun who, at one time, wore an eyepatch over her left eye. Yolanda is usually stern with Eda drinking alcohol in the church and seems to love tea. After an intelligent conversation with Rock, who convinces her to make a deal with Lagoon Company, she is impressed by his abilities and credits Dutch for finding someone as rare as him. She refers to Revy as \"Rebecca\" and tells her that she might learn a thing or two from Rock. She has connections with all the criminal organization in terms of intelligence, and though not officially part of the CIA, she serves as Eda's informant and confidant. She gives Eda fair warning that her opponent is no rookie and that she should be careful.\n\n=== Rico ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]|[[Simon Hill (actor)|Simon Hill]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rico'''|\u30ea\u30ab\u30eb\u30c9|Rikarudo}} (Ricardo) is an apprentice [[priest]] in the Rip-Off Church. Like Eda and Yolanda, he is a highly skilled gunman whose choice of weapon is a [[M60 machine gun]]. He refers to Eda as \"Big sis\" (''\"Ane-san\"'' in Japanese) instead of \"Sister\", much to her chagrin.\n\n== Citizens of Roanapur ==\nThe following are the inhabitants of Roanapur:\n\n=== Bao ===\n{{voiced by|[[Shir\u014d Sait\u014d]]|[[Alec Willows]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Bao'''|\u30d0\u30aa|Bao}} is the [[bartender]] and owner of the Yellow Flag bar, which he named in honor of the [[flag of South Vietnam|former South Vietnam flag]]. He is an ex-[[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] soldier who fought in the [[Vietnam War]]. He often feels harassed by Lagoon Company, especially Revy, for messing up his bar whenever they get into a fight with another party and reminds Revy to pay for the damage she has caused, which she always avoids doing. Balalaika seems to cover the repairs after Roberta destroyed it, which implies that the bar may be owned by Hotel Moscow. Seen as a great hang-out by most of the residents as it give many \"jobs\" to locals. After being rebuilt, he calls the Lagoon Company to tell them that Roberta is back in town. When Revy and Rock arrive along with Gustavo, they all meet up with Fabiola. After some words, Revy instigates a fight between Gustavo and Fabiola leading once again to the destruction of his bar. Bao claims that his bar has been destroyed more than 15 times, most of it done by Revy.\n\n=== Flora ===\n'''Madame Flora''' is the morbidly obese [[madam]] of the \"Sloppy Swing\", a brothel located on the top floor of Bao's bar. She took a liking to Rock and offered to \"service him herself\" (were she a bit younger).\n\n=== Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon ===\n{{voiced by|Masaki Aizawa|[[Adrian Holmes]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon'''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30ef\u30f3|R\u014dwan}} is the owner and manager of the GoofFest [[strip club]] on Rachiada Street in Roanapur. Of African-American descent, he has employed Revy as an [[Sadism and masochism|S/M]] dancer once in the past, possibly putting her as a [[dominatrix]]. He has stated, however, that she \"could give it and take it\", implying that Revy could also have been the submissive. This is changed in the anime, with Rowan consistently asking Revy to join his BDSM show when she comes to his place, but with her expressing disgust at the idea. He is also a movie dealer who carries both legal and illegal genres (such as all forms of [[pornography]] and [[snuff films]]). He is extremely frightened of Hotel Moscow, especially of Balalaika.\n\n=== Chief Watsup ===\n{{voiced by|[[Masaaki Tsukada]]|[[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chief Watsup'''|\u30ef\u30c8\u30b5\u30c3\u30d7|Watosappu}} is the [[Chief of Police|chief]] of the  Roanapur police force. He receives a regular stipend from Roanapur's criminal cartels, as well as the Lagoon Company, to stay away from their illegal activities. It is implied throughout the series that Revy tends to cause a lot of trouble in public and he usually has to bail her out much to his chagrin. He gets used to Revy's trouble making and he and Revy became sort of friends. For the most part, Watsup upholds this deal as long as his benefactors do not cause public incidents. He has dealt with Balalaika on more than one occasion, although she detests him for reasons unknown.\n\n== Bounty hunters and mercenaries ==\nThis section depicts the known [[bounty hunter]]s and [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] that appear in this anime:\n\n=== The Captain ===\n{{voiced by|[[Masahiko Tanaka]]|[[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]}}\n\n'''The Captain''' is the rank of an unknown mercenary in the employ of the Extra Order Company, a fictional [[private military company]] similar to modern day [[Blackwater Worldwide]] and the now defunct [[Executive Outcomes]], where the initials EO come from. An experienced ex-soldier who saw action in the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian civil war in the early 1990s]], Captain had no qualms with killing anyone he was asked to kill. He was also something of a challenge-seeker, since he wanted to prolong his fight with the Lagoon Company, whom he saw as worthy opponents. This proved to be his undoing however, since Rock realized this and came up with a strategy to exploit Captain's attitude. While attacking the ''Black Lagoon'' head-on in a [[Mil Mi-24]], the boat launched itself off a sunken ship and fired two torpedoes that brought down the Captain's helicopter, one hitting him in the face before detonating.\n\n=== Sawyer the Cleaner ===\n{{voiced by|[[Asami Yaguchi]]|[[Saffron Henderson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Frederica Sawyer'''|\u30bd\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc|S\u014dy\u0101}}, also known as '''Sawyer the Cleaner''', is a young girl, appearing to be in her late teens-early twenties, who specializes in body disposal, but also does occasional bounty hunter work. She is the person that the [[Triad society|Triads]] turn to execute people in the most brutal ways possible, usually to serve as examples for their clientele and enemies. Her legitimate business front is, fittingly, a meat packing business named \"U.G. Pork\".\n\nSawyer works in a white-tiled room, which is covered in blood from her various executions, and uses a [[chainsaw]] as her tool of trade. When on the job, she is dressed like a surgeon, but otherwise she wears [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] clothing. Few people seem to recognize her when she is not wearing her surgeon's robes. Because her throat had been cut open at some point, she speaks with an [[mechanical larynx|Ultravoice]]. Upon losing the Ultravoice, she is shown to become extremely emotionally distressed and drops into a fetal position.\n\nLike Shenhua, Sawyer is an assassin who eschews the use of firearms in combat. Instead, she utilizes a thick-bladed chainsaw over half-her-height long, the same one she uses on her victims. The size and build of the weapon allows her to deflect rapid gun-fire with horrifying ease, although this can still push her back.\n\nMuch like Roberta, Sawyer is presented as an \"unstoppable\" attacker, much in the manner of [[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', where she will cut through any obstacle in her path while stalking her prey, and the fact she enjoys her work immensely makes her even more dangerous. Her name may also be a homage to the Sawyer family of that film series and when she realized she had lost her Ultravoice in episode 18 she briefly reenacts Leatherface's \"chainsaw dance\" of rage. Strangely, she is one of the few bounty hunters to survive the manhunt on Jane, and is later seen doing some \"cleanup\" work on a Roanapur side street in the morning. She worked with Shenhua and Lotton in helping Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel, who were trying to kill Roberta. She also seems to have replaced her hand held Ultravoice with a wraparound version of the device that can be worn around her neck. Just like Shenhua, she first showed her fear of Roberta after their first encounter when Roberta managed to stop and break the chain of Sawyer's chainsaw with her guns.\n\nShe does not only do disposal jobs, but also cleaning jobs for hotel rooms. When she forgets her Ultravoice, she requests someone to translate for her and draws descriptions on a window or on a person's back to \"speak\". Given the chance to explain, she's extremely graphic about the details of her profession to the point those around her tell her to stop being descriptive. Despite the gruesome nature of her job, Sawyer seems to have a rather happy, yet morbid demeanor at times. In chapter 78 when she explained to Rock that he touched a mattress that had absorbed the bodily fluids of the corpses that died 14 days prior in the hotel room he, Benny, Jane and Feng Yifei were staying in, Sawyer has a blissful expression while everyone else vomits at this information.\n\n=== Claude \"Torch\" Weaver ===\n{{voiced by|[[Youichi Nishijima]]|[[Jason Simpson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Claude \"Torch\" Weaver'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u201c\u30c8\u30fc\u30c1\u201d\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|Kur\u014ddo \"T\u014dchi\" W\u012bb\u0101}} is a heavyset, middle-aged man with blonde hair and glasses and always sports a grin with a look of an archetypical [[everyman]]. As his nickname would suggest, he is a [[pyromaniac]] who uses a [[lighter]] shaped-and-sized [[flamethrower]] as his weapon of choice, although for heavy-duty jobs, he will also use a full-sized flamethrower. In spite of his profession and the fact he burnt his own wife to death (which he claims took five minutes), Weaver claims to be religious (which religion is unknown) and is a [[teetotaler]]. He is one of the few characters in the series that does not use foul language, preferring to speak with euphemisms (such as \"darn\" or \"shucks\") instead. He also moves fast for a man of his weight. He is blown up by Revy while hunting for Greenback Jane.\n\n=== Lotton the Wizard ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Sugita]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Lotton the Wizard'''|\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30f3\u30fb\u201c\u30b6\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u201d|Rotton \"Za Wiz\u0101do\"}} is a mysterious-looking man and one of the bounty hunters hired to capture \"Greenback\" Jane. He has silver hair, wears a black trenchcoat and shaded glasses, and speaks in a light voice. His weapon of choice is one or more [[Mauser C96]](s) with an extended magazine, although it's unknown whether this is an actual Mauser or a foreign version of the gun. He does not drink alcohol (he claims he's allergic to it). He gets shot by Revy when he tries to make a fancy entrance. It is implied that he is not a mighty fighter, but a poser. However, he did survive a fall from atop a warehouse building after getting shot due to his Kevlar vest, so the full extent of his abilities is still in question. He worked with Sawyer and Shenhua in helping Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel, who were trying to kill Roberta.\n\nHe is also one of the few bounty hunters to survive the manhunt for Jane. After the battle takes off in the sea, he gets up and aids a gravely wounded Shenhua and Sawyer. Due to the uncommon act of kind-heartedness, Shenhua comments that he is not the type to kill and would be better as a host in a [[bordello]], but Lotton claims that he is too clumsy for that. He is seen playing video games with Sawyer at Shenhua's residence in chapter 57 of the manga (as well as the OVA). Revy refers him as being more of a gigolo than a gunman; in addition, Revy forgets that she shot Lotton during the Greenback Jane incident (she shot him on reflex) causing Shenhua and Sawyer to mock her intelligence.\n\n=== Major Shane Caxton ===\n{{voiced by|[[Shinji Ogawa]]|[[Ron Halder]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Major Shane Caxton'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3|Kyakusuton}} is an American black-ops operator hiding in Roanapur, awaiting deployment into Indochina. Like Dutch, Caxton is a Vietnam War veteran who still holds on to his moral code of conduct. Caxton's team, called \"[[Intelligence Support Activity|Gray Fox]]\", under orders from a division of the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], orchestrated the assassination of Garcia Lovelace's father. Then were then dispatched to Roanapur in order to infiltrate the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] and capture a key player who have tie with [[Khun Sa]] in the drug trade for trial in the US. However, he and is men are tracked by the formidable Roberta, and their conflict draws in all the major players in Roanapur, including the Triad, Hotel Moscow, and the Church of Violence. When he meets up with Lagoon Company, he automatically recognizes Dutch and mentions something to Dutch that seemed to shock him.\n\nHe is held in high esteem by his colleagues, especially Gray Fox's second in command, for his integrity and honorable conduct, being the ideal symbol of America in the story. In a flashback, he executed one of his subordinates, Larkin, in retaliation for murdering innocent women and trying to rape a young girl during the Vietnam War. He also protects Garcia Lovelace as he and his team are escaping from Hotel Moscow. After escaping Roanapur and deploying to capture a drug baron in the Golden Triangle, his men are ambushed by Roberta, but he is actually shot by Garcia himself, who wants to end Roberta's rampage. It is later shown the gun was filled with blanks.\n\n=== Bren the Black Death ===\n'''Bren the Black Death''' runs a murder for hire business. According to Revy, he has an office in Roanapur but rarely does jobs there because of overlapping contracts. Roberta hires him to gather a team to attack Grey Fox to drive them out into the open. He sends in a group of hired guns knowing very well that they will be slaughtered by the trained soldiers. He then kills the one survivor himself.\n\n=== Filano ===\n'''Filano''' is a young boy who works for Bren the Black Death. He is seen observing the battle between the Grey Foxes and Roberta. He says he prefers to kill with an ordinary object or with nothing at all. He is particularly fond of pushing people downstairs or in front of trains. He considers guns to be the lowest form of killing. He does however like to play first person shooters. He also likes anime.\n\n== U-1324 Crew and Passengers ==\nThe following are the crew members and passengers of the U-1324:\n\n=== Lieutenant Commander Wentzel Ahbe ===\n{{voiced by|[[Shigeru Ushiyama]]|[[Brian Drummond]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Captain (or Lieutenant Commander) Wentzel Ahbe'''|\u30a2\u30fc\u30d9|\u0100be}} was the decorated skipper of the [[Type IX U-boat#Type IXC|Type IXC]] [[U-boat]] U-1324 and a survivor of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. His last order in the closing months of [[World War II]] in Europe was to take the U-1324 and its veteran crew along with two passengers from the [[Kriegsmarine]] naval base at [[Kiel]] to ostensibly return Lt. Col. Matsuda to [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. He succeeded in getting safely to the [[Indian Ocean]], but ran into trouble with [[US Navy]] destroyers near the [[Nicobar Islands]] on March 25, 1945, which succeed in fatally crippling the U-1324 with [[depth charge]]s, leaving it stranded on the seafloor. With only two hours of air left, he relieved his crew of their military duties and allowed them to face death however they chose. Ahbe was a patriot, but he despised the Nazi cause, expressing his bitterness to the SS Lieutenant Colonel that the Nazis had brought Germany to ruin and satisfaction that U-1324's sinking had meaning if his children would never see the Nazi flag again, leading the latter to shoot him. In their last act of loyalty to their captain, his crew avenged him. Ahbe left behind a wife and two children.\n\nHis [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] is sought after by Revy after she and Rock recover ''The Twelve Knights Led by Brunhilda'' for its value on the open market. Ahbe is also shown to have received the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 1st Class]] among his other decorations.\n\nHe is apparently modeled after [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]]'s character from ''[[Das Boot]]''. Additionally, the U-1324 bears the famed laughing sawfish emblem of the {{GS|U-96|1940|2}}.\n\n=== Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda ===\n{{voiced by|Hitoshi Bifu|[[Hiro Kanagawa]]}}\n\n'''Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda''' was an [[Imperial Japanese Army]] officer posted to Germany to study aeronautics, where he remained until the early part of 1945. Returning him to Japanese-held [[Jakarta|Batavia]] is the apparent final mission of the U-1324. He formed a fast friendship with Captain Ahbe and was sociable with the crew, engaging them in games of [[shogi]] during the voyage from Kiel to Batavia. When the U-1324 was fatally depth charged and runs aground on the seabed near the Nicobar Islands, he committed [[seppuku]] (ritual [[suicide]]) using his [[katana]]. He does not appear in the manga.\n\nMatsuda is based on the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lieutenant commander Genzo Shoji, who was posted to Germany to study aeronautics as well, and tried to return to Japan as a passenger of U-234. However, when Germany surrendered in the midst of the voyage, the captain of U-234 decided to surrender to the U.S. Navy. Consequently, Shoji committed seppuku\u2014suicide\u2014to avoid capture. This episode was turned into the movie ''[[Das Letzte U-Boot]]'' in Germany in 1990.\n\n=== SS Lieutenant Colonel Spielberger ===\n{{voiced by|Takaya Kuroda|[[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]}}\n\n'''SS Lieutenant Colonel''' ([[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]) {{nihongo|'''Spielberger'''|\u30b7\u30e5\u30d4\u30fc\u30eb\u30d9\u30eb\u30ac\u30fc|Shup\u012bruberug\u0101}} was the U-1324's second passenger.  A member of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], he was charged with the care of the painting ''The Twelve Knights Led by Brunhilda'', which is part of a Nazi plot to prepare for the Nazis' eventual return to power following their defeat in World War II.\n\nHe boarded the U-1324 the night before it sailed. Unlike Lt. Col. Matsuda, he was not as sociable, tending to keep to himself belowdecks, even when the U-boat was safely cruising on the surface in daytime. Like Captain Ahbe he also had a family, a wife and child in [[Stuttgart]], but unlike the former, was more focused on the failure of his mission rather than on them in his final hours. Ahbe's anti-Nazi comments infuriated him, leading him to fatally shoot the captain. About to then shoot himself, he decided to take down as many of the U-1324's crewmembers as possible in his final moments when they avenged their captain's murder.\n\n== Aryan Socialist Union ==\nThe '''Aryan Socialist Union''' is a group of aspiring [[Neo Nazis]] styling themselves along the lines of the Nazi [[Sturmabteilung]]. They have a large arsenal of weapons such as [[MAC-10]] machine pistols, [[MG3]] machine guns, [[AK47]] assault rifles, [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]], [[MP5]] Sub-Machineguns, and double-action trigger-outfitted Colt 45 pistols and even [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] [[anti-tank missile|Anti-Tank Missiles]].\n\nHowever, they do not realize that they have been lied to and are being set up by Sir Alfred, the head of the Neo Nazi movement, who believes they are a waste. There are more than 30 of them aboard their recovery ship, along with seemingly innocent hostages used to pilot the ship. It is unknown how many, if any, survived the conflict with the Lagoon Company.\n\n=== Ratchman ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ryuji Nakagi]]|[[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ratchman'''|\u30e9\u30c3\u30c1\u30de\u30f3|Racchiman}} is a short, fat man who leads the Aryan Socialist Union. He and his men are sent to retrieve a painting that was supposedly painted by [[Hitler]] and will reunite the Nazis and return them back to their former glory. He hopes that, by obtaining the painting, he will have proven himself and his men loyal enough to be accepted into the Neo-Nazi underworld. Though he shows loyalty on the surface, he is a coward at heart. Ratchman's lack of foresight and proper planning enables the Lagoon Company to sneak onto the ASU's recovery ship and launch a surprise attack while his men are drunk from celebrating after they recover the painting. He is murdered by Revy and Dutch. \n\n=== [[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]] ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ken Narita]]|[[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]}}\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'''|\u30af\u30eb\u30c3\u30da\u30f3\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30fc|Kuruppen Fer\u0101}} is the commander of the Aryan Socialist Union's Suicide Corps. He is the only man, other than Ratchman, to get emotionally worked up over the latter's bombastic pronouncement of his mission. Feller leads his men down to the U-1324 using a special diving pod to connect with the U-boat's hatch. Getting caught up in a firefight with Revy, he is the only member of his team to set foot in the U-1324 to make it out alive, recovering the painting in the process.\n\nWhen Revy and Dutch assault the Aryan Socialist Union aboard their recovery ship, he attempts to arm himself with a [[MG42]] to fight back, but is shot in the back by Revy in the ship's [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]]. In the manga, he is last seen fighting Revy inside the submarine; his fate afterwards is unknown.\n\n=== Fritz Stanford ===\n{{voiced by|[[Youichi Nishijima]]|[[Mark Gibbon]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Fritz Stanford'''|\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9|Burittsu Sutanf\u014ddo}} is the Captain of the Nazi boat that is sent to obtain the [[World War II]]  painting in the sunken [[U-boat]]. He is a physically huge man, and is filled with blind faith and overconfidence. In the end, it is this overconfidence that gets him killed when he brags about his weapon and threatens Revy (as she slowly reloads her weapon), who shoots him in the chest and then point blank in the head, mostly just to shut him up. He wields a large [[Gold plating|gold]] [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] chambered for the [[.454 Casull]] cartridge.\n\n=== Sir Alfred ===\n{{voiced by|[[Fumio Matsuoka]]|French Tickner}}\n\nLittle is known about {{nihongo|'''Alfred'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9|Arufur\u0113do}}, except he seems to be the head of the [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] underworld. He is an elderly man, most likely in his 80s, since he was in the [[SS]] during the war, and it is implied that he is a combat veteran. Sir Alfred sets up a test of loyalty and ability for Ratchman and his Aryan Socialist Union, in which he purposely sends them to face-off with the Lagoon Company. Even though he sets them up, he already knows that Ratchman will most likely be defeated. Ratchman and the Lagoon Company are unaware that they are being set up. Sir Alfred feels that Ratchman and his men are idiots and a disgrace to call themselves Nazis, seeing their easy defeat by a group of \"racially inferior\" members as proof of their incompetence in his view. He even thanks Dutch and Revy for killing them off for him, and even harbours an amount of respect for Dutch, despite being a black man. Dutch later finds out that the Spaniard who hired him was in fact The Boss setting him up.\n\n== Protectors of the Islamic Front ==\nThe '''Protectors of the Islamic Front''' is a [[Mujahideen|Jihadist]] group based in South East Asia.\n\n=== Masahiro Takenaka ===\n{{voiced by|[[Katsuhiko Sasaki]]|[[Fred Henderson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Masahiro Takenaka'''|\u7af9\u4e2d\u6b63\u6d0b|Takenaka Masahiro}} is a co-leader of the terrorist group \"Protectors of the Islamic Front\" and a patient, sociable person who rarely loses his cool. Despite being involved with an [[Islamic terrorist]] group, he himself is an atheist. Born in the [[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi ward in Tokyo]], Masahiro was once an enthusiastic activist for human rights before joining the [[Japanese Red Army]] during the [[Cold War]]. Later, he was forced to evade arrest by hiding overseas after most of its members were arrested; and it was the time he traveled to [[Bekaa]], Lebanon, that he met Ibraha. Takenaka is based on the [[Japanese Red Army]] member [[Kozo Okamoto]].\n\n=== Ibraha ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ken Yamaguchi]]|[[Mackenzie Gray]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ibraha'''|\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30cf|Iburaha}} is a co-leader of the \"Protectors of the Islamic Front\", leading one of its main cells in the [[Philippines]]. He is a Lebanese, and is resolute in his hatred of [[Israel]], as his son was killed by Israeli soldiers in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] in 1987, after which he dedicated his life to destroying the West. Compared to Takenaka, he is the exact opposite in personality. While chasing Revy, Rock, and Shenhua towards a [[Basilan]] military base, he is shot and killed by Takenaka for refusing to pull their forces back for a retreat.\n\n== The Washimine Group ==\nThe '''Washimine Group''' were a [[Yakuza]] formerly run by {{nihongo|Ryuzo Washimine|\u9df2\u5cf0\u9f8d\u4e09|Washimine Ry\u016bz\u014d}}. Balalaika came to Japan to work out a deal with the Washimine group to expand their influence in Japan in exchange for helping them weaken a rival Yakuza group, the Kousa Council.  However, when Hotel Moscow's methods went too far, Tsugio Bando, the current head of the Washimine group, tried to stop them and was killed by Balalaika, who decided she would instead destroy both groups and take over their operations. Following his death, Ryuzo's daughter was put in charge. In the end, the entire Washimine group, and family, were wiped out along with the Kousa Council.\n\n=== Yukio Washimine ===\n{{voiced by|[[Houko Kuwashima]]|Lalainia Lindbjerg}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yukio Washimine'''|\u9df2\u5cf0\u96ea\u7dd2|Washimine Yukio}} is a high school senior and the only daughter of Ryuzo Washimine, who was the former ''kumicho'' (boss) of the [[yakuza]] organization \"Washimine-gumi\" (Washimine Group). She has a chance meeting with Rock and Revy when they come to Tokyo in the employ for Hotel Moscow. Her discussions with Rock lead him to think he might return to an ordinary life, although things soon turn dark when Rock learns that she was born into the Washimine Group. Having lived a normal life free of conflict, she learns that she is the only possible leader of her father's crime family, as the Kousa Council refused to allow anyone other than a blood relative take over. When her bodyguard and unspoken love Ginji resolves to fight \"Hotel Moscow\", she decides join him, assuming the mantle of leader. She falls, seemingly inevitably, into the world of the yakuza, although Rock desperately tries to persuade her to walk away. She initially claims her actions are to uphold the honour of the Washimine Group, but in reality she believes this is the only way she can be with Ginji. In her spare time, Yukio enjoyed reading a wide variety of books, particularly those concerning philosophy (she is once seen reading a book written by [[Martin Heidegger]]). She commits suicide with Ginji's sword after he is killed by Revy. Thoughtful, intelligent and talented, the misfortune of being the only heir to the Washimine group proved too much to bear.\n\n=== Ginji Matsuzaki ===\n{{voiced by|[[Kiyoyuki Yanada]]|[[Michael Adamthwaite]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ginji Matsuzaki'''|\u677e\u5d0e\u9280\u6b21|Matsuzaki Ginji}} is the acting ''wakagashira'' ([[underboss]]) of Washimine Group, and is Yukio's most loyal and humble personal body guard, and possibly love interest. He works as a street stall vendor, but was formerly an assassin nicknamed \"''Hitokiri Ginji''\" (Manslayer Ginji) due to his use of a [[katana]] in combat, serving the Washimine until the death of his leader, who was also Yukio's father. His skills with his blade are exceptional, manifesting themselves in such feats as cleaving bullets in two in midflight. Coupled with his ability to evade gunfire from multiple foes, Ginji almost completely eschews the use of firearms. He and Yukio quietly share an unspoken love, but neither choose to act upon it.\n\nGinji had protected Yukio for a long time and hoped that she would live a normal life despite her family's criminal background. He seems to regret his past as a murderer, and is unwilling to take up arms again until his friend and former leader Tsugio Bondo is killed by Hotel Moscow. Ginji attacks the Japanese branch of the Russian Mafiya to hunt down Balailaka, though he changes targets when the Washimine enforcer Chaka goes rogue and kidnaps Yukio. He briefly allied with Revy and Rock to rescue her, massacring Chaka's henchmen before cutting off the enforcer's hands and drowning him in a pool. Ginji then assists Yukio in her efforts to avenge the slaughter of her clan, and they capture Rock so that he can lead them to Hotel Moscow's base. However, Revy catches up with them, prompting Ginji to face her in a duel.\n\nGinji comes within inches of killing Revy, shattering her cutlass and stabbing her. However, he is distracted by Yukio's admission of love at the last moment; he only manages to put his sword through her leg as she shoots him in the throat. Revy comments that this hesitation was all that stopped Ginji killing her.\n\nAlthough Revy calls Ginji \"Jumbo\" because of his height, the name \"Jumbo\" may also refer to Takashi Takeda (AKA \"Jumbo\") from the [[Yotsuba&!]] manga series with whom he shares an uncanny resemblance.\n\n=== Tsugio Bando ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tomomichi Nishimura]]|[[John Novak]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Tsugio Bando'''|\u5742\u6771\u6b21\u7537|Tsugio Band\u014d}} is the ''wakagashira'' ([[underboss]]) of the Washimine Group. Since the position of boss of the Washimine Group is left vacant by the death of the former boss Ryuzo Washimine, Yukio's father, Tsugio is the actual boss of the Washimine Group. Tsugio is very loyal to the memory of Ryuzo, who had protected him after he just arrived in Tokyo from Osaka. Due to his hate of the Kousa Council's ill-treatment of the Washimine Group, he allied with Hotel Moscow for a short time in order for his group to rise and make a name for itself. However, his plans and Hotel Moscow's completely differed in approach as Balalaika was more brutal in her methods, much to the dismay of Bando. He is killed in a desperate attempt to assassinate Balalaika and protect the Washimine Group, Balalaika easily dodging his attempt to stab her and then breaking his neck, before sending back to the Washimine the suitcase including his body.\n\n=== Yoshida ===\n{{voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]|[[Trevor Devall]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshida'''|\u5409\u7530|Yoshida}} is one of the enforcers working for the Washimine Group. He was very loyal to Tsugio Bando and refers to him as an older brother. Yoshida is usually seen as a bodyguard for Tsugio, and later Yukio when she inherits the leadership of the Washimine Group. During Yukio's inheritance of the Washimine Group's head position, it was Yoshida who rallied support for the young lady. He is killed by Chaka during Yukio's kidnapping.\n\n=== Chaka ===\n{{voiced by|[[Wataru Takagi]]|Jonathan Holmes}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chaka'''|\u30c1\u30e3\u30ab|Chaka}} is one of the enforcers working for the Washimine Group who fancies himself as a \"Wild West\" gunman and is fluent in English. Arrogant, cruel, and sadistic, Chaka is often seen as an idiot by his peers. His earlier appearance showed that Revy's reputation as a gunman in Roanapur is such that even the yakuza in Japan have heard of her. Shortly after Yukio becomes the boss of the Group, Chaka makes his bid to take over the leadership by kidnapping her with the help of a street gang. He was determined to fight Revy in a quickdraw showdown, but she refused and lured him into fighting a duel with Ginji instead, who defeated and finished him off by letting him drown in a pool with both his hands severed. His character and appearance is likely based on Kakihara from [[Ichi the Killer (manga)|Ichi the killer]], as both of them are longing for a strong opponent equal to them and are sadistically violent. Possibly based on a presumably-existing [[Kudo-kai]] member hanging around [[Harajuku]].\n\n== The Lovelace Family ==\nThe '''Lovelace Family''' are one of the 13 prominent [[South America]]n families, and their origin is from [[Venezuela]]. However, the family has come under hard times from not only their peers due to their political beliefs, but also from the Colombian Cartel, which has been harassing employees of the family in order to take control of their land. However, because of Diego Lovelace's military and political connections, the family is constantly protected from threats. In addition, the family includes Roberta (aka Rosarita Cisneros), a former FARC terrorist who is wanted by both the Cartel and various law enforcement agencies. Because of her close relationship with the family, she is accepted as one of their own, serving as maid and, if necessary, bodyguard. Another maid, who is combat ready like Roberta, is Fabiola Igesias.\n\n=== Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ryunosuke Ohbayashi]]|[[Michael Kopsa]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace'''|\u30c7\u30a3\u30a8\u30b4\u30fb\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30e9\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9|Diego Ferunando Raburesu}} was the former head of the Lovelace family, eleventh in succession. While it is one of the thirteen noble families of South America, the Lovelace family fell upon hard times, with only the meager income from their plantations maintaining their lifestyle. He took in Rosarita Cisneros, when she was escaping from the Colombian Cartel as a favor to his old friend, Rosarita's father. He took her in and treated her as family. Recently, he was assassinated during a speech due to the fact his political beliefs were seen as a threat by many. This event makes Roberta take up the \"Bloodhound\" persona once more.\n\n=== Garcia Lovelace ===\n{{voiced by|[[Kazue Ikura]]|[[Cathy Weseluck]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Garcia Fernando Lovelace'''|\u30ac\u30eb\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30e9\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9|Garushia Ferunando Raburesu}} is the only son of Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace, was heir to the Lovelace family line, and as such, is its current head, the twelfth in succession after his father was assassinated. He was kidnapped for a short while by a Colombian cartel and was transported by the Lagoon Company as \"goods\". He and Roberta left Roanapur shortly afterwards, with some help from Hotel Moscow. He has apparently returned to Roanapur searching for Roberta with a new maid named Fabiola, waiting in a local hotel called the \"Sunken Palace Hotel\" and seemed to have matured greatly in terms of emotional strength, as commented by Rock, since his last appearance. He treats both Roberta and Fabiola as if they were his extended family and in return, both care for him equally. He requests help to find Roberta from Lagoon Company with additional help from Chang, Shenhua, Sawyer, and Lotton. However, the only person he truly trusts in Roanapur is Rock. To stop Roberta, Garcia comes up with the most drastic plan to fake Caxton's death with his own hands, thus taking away Roberta's \"Path of Justice\"; this causes her to hallucinate once more and shoot him. Her consequent horror finally snaps her out of her insanity. In the aftermath, Chang told Rock that the Lovelace family will still have a hard road ahead of them in future.\n\n=== Roberta ===\n{{voiced by|[[Michie Tomizawa]]|[[Tabitha St. Germain]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Roberta'''|\u30ed\u30d9\u30eb\u30bf|Roberuta}} is a Colombian [[maid]] who worked for four years at the Lovelace household in [[Venezuela]]. Although her domestic skills such as cleaning and cooking were poor, she developed a close friendship with the young son of the Lovelace family, Garcia. Roberta was once known as {{nihongo|'''Rosarita Cisneros'''|\u30ed\u30b6\u30ea\u30bf\u30fb\u30c1\u30b9\u30cd\u30ed\u30b9|Rozarita Chisunerosu}}, a former [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] guerrilla trained as an assassin in [[Cuba]] and an internationally wanted criminal.  Balalaika refers her as a \"hardcore terrorist\" to the point that Hotel Moscow had to deploy all their commandos as well as Balalaika getting involved in the situation personally should things get out of hand. Revy refers to her as \"Fucking Four Eyes\" or \"That Fucking Glasses Bitch\". She earned the moniker \"Bloodhound of Florencia\" for her relentless drive to achieve her objectives. Her tormented past and the smell of blood, gunpowder and muck like that of a sewer rat emanating from her was something Revy understood full well.\n\nIn combat, Roberta is a truly fearsome opponent, having trained in a wide variety of martial, stealth, and weapon skills. Among the weapons she has used were a .50 caliber [[Barrett M82]], [[SPAS-12]] shotgun disguised as an umbrella (reinforced with Kevlar), [[machine gun]], and semi-automatic [[grenade launcher]] hidden in a suitcase, [[Trench knife]], and twin IMBEL Model 1911 pistols (see Colt [[M1911 pistol]]s). Her strength, speed, endurance, and instincts were honed to almost [[superhuman]] levels, so much so that Rock at one point refers to her sardonically as \"a killer robot from the future\" (a reference to [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Terminator (series)|Terminator]]'' movies). At one point in the manga she was also described as the only person worthy of inheriting the title \"Jackal\" from [[Carlos the Jackal|Carlos]].\n\nWhile Roberta is one of the most powerful warrior-women in ''Black Lagoon'', she is also highly conscientious. She is unwaveringly devoted to her master and his son, Garcia, whom she loves deeply. Roberta and Revy fight each other, but only to beat themselves up. Rock interferes, but Roberta and Revy tell him to stay out of it. In the manga and anime, the fight ends in a draw right after they punch each other out simultaneously (though Garcia claims she won because she remained conscious). Her kindness can easily change as seen in a humorous omake in Volume 1 of the manga when Garcia slapped her butt in a playful manner, which prompted her to pinch his arm and lift him up off the ground by the skin of his arm as punishment.\n\nShe admitted that she did murder children, women, or anyone in name of revolution during her [[FARC]] years. Disillusioned by the fact that she was merely a tool for the drug cartels in cahoots with [[FARC]], she opted out and joined the Lovelace clan as a maid through her father who was a good friend of Diego Lovelace. Despite being asked by Garcia not to pick up gunfighting anymore, later events in the manga, which depicts her watching helplessly as a bomb was set killing many including Diego Lovelace. Garcia's question of why his father was a victim makes her go into battle again, seeking revenge. Roberta's anger almost pushed her to the limit; she is shown taking mouthfuls of anti-psychotics, and experiencing haunting hallucinations in the form of her past victim (Japanese engineer). She once again stalks the city of Roanapur in search of the one responsible for assassinating her master. Unfortunately, it turns out to be the US Special Forces. Roberta's quest for vengeance has put many of the residents including Hotel Moscow, the Triad, and the Colombian Cartel on high alert as it could mean the end for all of them if their new enemy is the United States. Most of the residents blame the Lagoon Company for attracting her back to Roanapur despite the fact the group was in the dark about the situation and brushed it off as if it were an [[Elvis]] sighting. Further into her quest, she begins to lose sight of her goal, almost returning to her former persona to the point she begins to lose her sanity and has trouble identifying friend and foe, thus almost harming Garcia in the process. The FARC commander even comments that she is no longer the hound they once knew, but a diseased stray wolf searching for purpose. Her oath as the \"Bloodhound of Florencia\" is \"In the name of Santa Maria, a hammer blow of righteousness to all injustice.\"\n\nIn Chapter 73, Roberta is seen with an American woman, presumably Eda, passing through airport security to continue her pursuit of the Americans. She finally catches up with Grey Fox and kills 8-9 soldiers (there were 18 soldiers in three groups: Alpha, Bravo and Charlie), but Caxton himself is shot by Garcia in the hope she will give up her thirst for revenge. A still hallucinating Roberta then reflexively shoots Garcia when he turns his gun on her, but her horror at her attack at last restores her sanity. Garcia's gun is in fact loaded only with blanks, and Caxton survives; Garcia himself suffers only minor injuries.\n\nIn the extra missing pages of chapter 76, she and Garcia kissed and they made up with each other and returns to the Lovelace home. However, in the fifth episode of the OVA, Roberta is severely injured and is confined to a wheelchair as she later regains the ability to walk slowly (she has lost her left arm, her right eye, has a prosthetic foot and ankle, implying her lower right leg has been amputated as well).\n\nIn issue #50 of ''[[Anime Insider]]'' magazine, director [[Sunao Katabuchi]] comments that the animation staff referred Roberta as an \"Evil [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]]\". He goes on to add that creator [[Rei Hiroe]] long thought of Roberta as a kind of \"Death Poppins\".\n\n=== Fabiola Iglesias ===\n{{voiced by|[[Satsuki Yukino]]|[[Shannon Chan-Kent]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Fabiola Iglesias'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30d3\u30aa\u30e9\u30fb\u30a4\u30b0\u30ec\u30b7\u30a2\u30b9|Fabiora Igureshiasu}} is a young maid in the employ of the Lovelace family. She is one of the maids who work as Roberta's subordinates, and the only other combat-trained person among the maids apart from Roberta herself. In combat, she prefers to use two [[MAG-7]]s that were given to her by Roberta. She also carries a pump action [[China Lake NATIC]] (Mistakenly referred to as an [[EX 41 grenade launcher]] in the Manga). She also has heel blades concealed in her shoes. She is the same age with Garcia.\n\nFabiola first appears in the same bar, The Yellow Flag, that Roberta met the Lagoon crew in, panicking everybody with her resemblance to Roberta. However, unlike Roberta, her suitcase is revealed to be filled with lollipops and a lunchbox with [[Scooby Doo (character)|Scooby Doo]] and [[Ranger Smith]] on it. She is currently helping Garcia search for Roberta. She is something of a comic relief when compared with Roberta (whom she calls \"head housemaid\" with the utmost respect), as she is little, carries her grenade launcher concealed in her outfit, and is often prominent in humorous situations; such as her height, being picked up like a bratty little kid, to being made fun of her breast size.\n\nDutch describes her as a \"short version of the Killer Maid\", after she destroys Bao's bar. She states that she comes from the poorest slums of [[Caracas]], where she lived with her ten siblings until she was employed by the Lovelace Family. As noticed by Rock, she does not brawl, being a proficient practitioner of [[capoeira]]. According to her, she and Roberta are the only two maids in the Lovelace house who are proficient in firearms, with Roberta being the better of the two. She also mentions that there are three other maids in the Lovelace house: Karina, Masica and Davia (though it's unknown at this time if they're combat proficient as well). This makes Revy question her \"Just what is the Lovelace plantation like? Full of bad-ass motherfuckers who could storm the Iranian embassy by themselves?\". Fabiola was disgusted at Revy for being heartless and merciless against her foes, with Revy lecturing her that love and friendship do not apply in Roanapur. She and Garcia are reunited with Roberta; but the happiness is short lived when she and Roberta witness Garcia shooting Caxton with a 1911 Colt .45 filled with blanks and in retaliation Roberta shoots Garcia. She and Roberta then tend to a wounded Garcia. On their way back, they encountered Rock and Fabiola gets upset and disgusted with him and shot him with a blank round which injured Rock's ribs for \"gambling with people's lives\". She told Rock they will not meet again and that he shall \"continue to dance with the walking dead in Roanapur.\"\n\nJust like Roberta, Fabiola is very protective of Garcia. She is more brash than her mentor, but not as much as Revy. She tries to attack Chang after seeing him with Garcia, but he easily disarms her without trying. She loves to play in the pool when she's relaxing, but is embarrassed to ask Garcia for a break, despite the fact he is aware of her activities.\n\n== Other characters ==\nThe following are the other characters of this anime:\n\n=== Kageyama ===\n{{voiced by|[[J\u014dji Nakata]]|[[Ross Douglas]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Kageyama'''|\u666f\u5c71|Kageyama}} is one of the department chiefs of Asahi Industries, based in Tokyo. He was entrusted by its [[board of directors]] to ensure that their illegal activities were not exposed. Kageyama betrayed Rock by appointing Captain to kill him and the Lagoon Company, thus encouraging Rock to stay on with the Lagoon Company. Although Kageyama is married and has three children (consisting of one teenage son, one teenage daughter, and one pre-teen daughter), he seems to place more emphasis on his job than on his family.\n\n=== H\u00e4nsel and Gretel ===\nH\u00e4nsel {{voiced by|[[Omi Minami]]|[[Ashleigh Ball (voice actress)|Ashleigh Ball]]}}<br/>\nGretel {{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]|[[Jocelyne Loewen]]}}\n\n'''H\u00e4nsel and Gretel''' (also known as Fratele Meu ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"my brother\") and Sora Mea (\"my sister\")) are two Romanian [[twin]] orphans. They were abandoned in a state-run [[orphanage]] as their parents' could not afford  to look after them, following the overthrow of [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], before being sold to black market. As a result of being repeatedly forced to participate in [[Pedophilia|paedophilic]] [[snuff film]]s in which they are either raped or forced to murder other children, and being repeatedly forced to watch the orphanage workers beat children to death, the twins eventually became deranged, sadistic killers. The horrid engrossment with their torturing and murdering for pleasure is shown during the first part of Season 2 when the twins first arrive to Roanupor and  purposely wound one of Balalaika's men during a gunfight, bring him back to their temporary stay with Verrocchio's headquarters, probe his body with sharp objects as a medical experiment, and then drain his body of blood and organs for them to bathe in; afterwards they kill Verrocchio and his men out of indulgence, even though they were supposed to help them escape the city. Unknown to most people, \"H\u00e4nsel\" and \"Gretel\" are actually two personalities alternately adopted by the two children, both of whom suffer from [[dissociative identity disorder]], meaning they swap being \"H\u00e4nsel\" and \"Gretel\" with each other from time to time (it is likely that these were their screen names in the films). There are slight implications that they could be [[incest]]uous, possibly due to the abuse they suffered in the state-run orphanage. It is never made clear of what gender the twins are: in one scene, \"Gretel\" (formerly \"H\u00e4nsel\" before swapping) shows 'her' genitalia to Rock in what she presumably came to believe was a show of gratitude, causing him to flee in disgust and horror at how utterly broken \u201cGretel\u201d was, having known nothing but 'blood and darkness' their whole lives.\n\nIn combat, \"H\u00e4nsel\" wields a sharp [[battle axe]] while \"Gretel\" uses a [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] that appears to be taller than 'she' is. Both also carry additional sidearms. While they were mentally deranged, H\u00e4nsel and Gretel were also cunning, having used two other children as decoys to distract the bounty hunters and using money to distract Eda. They were also not above using their innocent appearance to deceive their enemies.\n\nAs revenge for killing Balalaika's men, H\u00e4nsel is lured into a hunt across the city for Hotel Moscow's forces, until he locates Balalaika herself at a fountain, where he is abruptly shot dead by her snipers. Gretel manages to escape and eventually boards the ''Black Lagoon'' of her own volition. Due to Rock's kindness she takes a genuine liking to him. However, just as Gretel disembarks she is gunned down by the getaway man Dutch contacted, who was bribed by Hotel Moscow. Though initially shocked by her sudden death, Rock is glad that now she and her brother could rest in peace.\n\nThe characters' names are taken from the German fairy tale, ''[[H\u00e4nsel and Gretel]]''. Many of the series' characters compare them to a similar pair of disturbed, sadistic twins from the American film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. In the manga, the song sung by Gretel to Rock on the Black Lagoon is called \"[[Midnight, the Stars and You]]\", the song used in the ending credits to ''The Shining''. In the anime, she sings \"The World of Midnight\", made for the anime and sung by Minako Obata.\n\n=== Greenback Jane ===\n{{voiced by|[[Miki Nagasawa]]|[[Kelly Sheridan]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Janet Bhai'''|\u30b8\u30e3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30a4\u30fc|Janetto B\u0101\u012b}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Greenback Jane'''|\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3|J\u0113n}}, is a professional money [[counterfeit]]er and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] from [[India]]. She served as the leader for her project team, which was spread around the world but was connected thanks to the internet, and is quite knowledgeable on the details of the [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]]. Coincidentally, she falls in love with Benny after he displays his hacking skills. Janet currently seems to be having an [[internet romance]] with Benny. One of the running gags of her story arc is her clumsiness and poor luck, which usually result in her being subject to a [[pantyshot]]. After the Lovelace incident, Janet returns to Roanapur searching out Benny and the team. She, with help of her counterfeiting group, hacks a server of the \"Rainbach AG\" Corporation and makes a scapegoat of a [[People's Liberation Army|PLA spy]]. Jane is apparently a [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]], though Benny calls it \"a bit broad-minded as far as sex goes\". Revy replies that \"if that's \"a bit\", then [[Death Valley]] is a sand pit in a park\".<ref>Chapter 81, Page 5</ref>\n\n=== Russell ===\n{{voiced by|[[Masaki Terasoma]]|[[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''\"Groovy\" Guy Russell'''|\u201c\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30f4\u30a3\u30fb\u30ac\u30a4\u201d\u30fb\u30e9\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb|\"Gur\u016bvi Gai\" Rasseru}} is a middle-aged [[United States|American]] man who works for the Florida crime syndicate that's tracking Jane. He is quite distinguishable, since he dresses like a [[cowboy]]: he has the trademark [[cowboy hat|hat]], [[cowboy boots|boots]] with spurs, a [[revolver]] at the hip, [[bandolier]] belt, tan shirt and jeans. He is not taken serious by the other bounty hunters because he is an outsider. Even Shenhua says, \"Cowboy, this no Florida\", meaning that he is in over his head. However, his skills are shown to be more than everyone thought, when he is the last bounty hunter left in the hunt for Jane and he duels Eda on board the Lagoon. It is then later revealed that he and Eda have met previously in the United States, but Eda says they have never met. Shortly before killing him, she confesses to him to be from the CIA.\n\n=== Vasili Laptev ===\n{{voiced by|[[Toshihiko Kojima]]|[[Ted Cole]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Vasili Laptev'''|\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30fb\u30e9\u30d7\u30c1\u30a7\u30d5|Vashiri Rapuchefu}} is the boss of a branch of the [[Russian mafia]] that is based in Tokyo. A former [[KGB]] officer, Laptev had many difficulties operating in Japan due to his status as a ''[[gaijin]]'' (foreigner). Considered distasteful and incompetent by Balalaika, he appeared to lose his standing with his peers back in Russia and this was reflected in his arrogant personality, since he did not speak Japanese despite being based in Japan. Laptev's detachment is slaughtered single-handedly by Ginji when the fallout between Hotel Moscow and the Washimine-gumi begins.\n\n=== Masami Kousa ===\n{{voiced by|Masahiro Tanaka|[[Andrew Kavadas]]}}\n\nHead of the Kousa Council. In past both Washimine and Kousa Yakuza's were allies as Yukio's father and Masami's \"brother\" were blood brothers. When they both died and Masami took over, any relationship the two groups had were gone and the Kousa's mistreated the Washime group badly to the point that Masami wouldn't recognize Yukio as the heir to the Washimine group and wanted someone in his group to take over. His mistreatment led the Washime group to call Hotel Moscow to weaken them. In the end of Fujiyama Gangsters arc, Masami was about to form an alliance with Hotel Moscow when Balalaika, after talking with Rock, decided to kill him and his lieutenants cited she wouldn't want to work with a group with such poor merchandise.\n\n=== Maki ===\n{{voiced by|[[Shiho Kawaragi]]|[[Ashleigh Ball (voice actress)|Ashleigh Ball]]}}\n\n'''Maki''' is a female high school junior and goes to the same high school as her friend, Yukio Washimine. Maki seems to be a symbolic representative of the typical Japanese high school girl who is interested in skin-care, has a part-time job, reads [[light novel]]s, and has poor school grades.\n\n=== Feng Yifei/Li Xinlin ===\n'''Li Xinlin''' is a Chinese [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] in the People's Liberation Army. She is assigned to infiltrate Greenback Jane's group under the alias '''Feng Yifei'''. However, Jane and the other hacker are aware of this and use her to tap into the PLA's computers. When this is discovered, Li's superiors believed she was a traitor and put a contract on her life to Roanapur-based mercenaries.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej65bjDu1Es YouTube]\n* [http://www.crunchyroll.com/library/Black_Lagoon Crunchyroll]\n* [https://www.funimation.com/shows/black-lagoon/ Funimation]\n\n{{Black Lagoon}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Black Lagoon Characters}}\n\n[[Category:Black Lagoon]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Black Lagoon]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}\n{{original research|date=December 2014}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Black Lagoon'' characters}}\n\nThe following is a list of characters from the Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] ''[[Black Lagoon]]''.\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n== The Lagoon Company ==\n[[Image:Lagoon Company.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|The entire Lagoon Company. From left to right: Benny, Rock, Revy and Dutch.]]\nThe '''Lagoon Company''' is a [[mercenary]]/[[Piracy|pirate]] group that is the main focus of the series, hired by the many criminal organisations operating in and around Roanapur to locate, acquire and smuggle items by sea.\n\n=== Rokuro Okajima / Rock ===\n{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]|[[Brad Swaile]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rokuro Okajima'''|\u5ca1\u5cf6\u7dd1\u90ce|Okajima Rokur\u014d}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Rock'''|\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Rokku}}, is the [[main character]] in the series. In the anime version, but not in the manga, he is also the [[narrator]] of the story.\n\nHe was a 25-year-old [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[salaryman]] for Asahi Industries in [[Tokyo]] until he was taken hostage by the crew of the ''Black Lagoon'' during their raid on the ship he was on. He joined the Lagoon Company after his department chief Kageyama abandoned him (Kageyama declared him dead) in an attempt to cover up the [[smuggling]] operation in which Rock had been an unwitting participant. Rock is a caring and good-natured [[everyman]] despite being on the business end of guns from friend and foe alike, and often seems surprised at the dangers of the [[Southeast Asian]] crime world. He still wears his tie, dress shirt, and dress pants because although now a pirate, he still retains his business persona. He prefers to use words over weapons when interacting with others. Rock, after joining the Lagoon company, has wondered if he is experiencing [[Stockholm syndrome]].\n\nWithin the Lagoon Company, Rock is usually responsible for account management, diplomacy, negotiation, interpretation, and the occasional errand. Having once worked in the resource investigation department of Asahi Industries, Rock is also skilled in [[geology]]. He is also a natural linguist, being effectively bilingual in Japanese, his [[native language]], and English as well as being familiar with other languages, including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]. He also has a surprisingly high tolerance for [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], owing to the heavy-drinking lifestyle of a ladder-climbing salaryman. Rock's charismatic personality has earned him the interest of several figures in Roanapur, including Balalaika, Mr. Chang, Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon, Yolanda, Eda (who develops a crush on him), and young Garcia Lovelace. In many ways, Rock is the heart of the Lagoon Company, serving as a balance for his more callous teammates and as an average counterbalance in the world of darkness that is Roanapur. Dutch has stated that he believes Lagoon Company is complete with Rock not holding a gun, saying his bullets are the kind to ricochet back at them.\n\nDespite his lack of combat experience, Rock has come through every adventure, kidnapping and firefight with only a few bruises, surviving personal confrontations with most of Roanapur's most dangerous criminals at some point. Rock eventually begins to enjoy his life as a pirate and becomes even more comfortable with corruption.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 9|year=2010|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=El Baile de la muerte, Part 24|page=|isbn=978-1-4215-3629-3}}</ref> This comes to the fore when Mr Chang personally enlists Rock to locate Roberta before she is killed by US Special Forces, as he demonstrates a duplicitous, ruthless side of his personality clearly influenced by Revy and Roanapur.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 9|year=2010|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=El Baile de la muerte, Part 30|page=|isbn=978-1-4215-3629-3}}</ref> He devises a scheme to extract the US soldiers from the city to draw Roberta out, accounting even for Garcia's loyalty, Roberta's psychosis and the personal vendattas amongst the criminals, treating the entire plan like a gambling game. He is forced back towards kindness in the extra missing pages of chapter 76 after an angered Fabiola shoots him with a blank round. In \"The Wired Red Wild Card\" arc, he is last seen driving a car with Revy.\n\nWhile Rock has a family in Tokyo, he does not have connection to them due to their somewhat cold attitude towards him. It was later revealed that he did not pass his college entrance exams on his first try, leading his family to lower their expectations of him. It is known that he has a father, a mother, and an older brother who was academically capable and thus attained a job in the Japanese government. He was born in the 49th year of the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], according to the manga version, which corresponds to 1975-1976.\n\n=== Revy ===\n{{voiced by|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]]|[[Maryke Hendrikse]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Revy'''|\u30ec\u30f4\u30a3|Revi|mistranslated '''Levy''' in some adaptations}}, sometimes referred by her real name of '''Rebecca Lee''', is the co-[[protagonist]] of the series. She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past. Revy is a [[Chinese American]] mid to late 20s from [[Chinatown, Manhattan]], near [[Mott Street]], who spent most of her youth as a criminal. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that she may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting her [[Physical abuse|abusive]] father, using a pillow as a [[Suppressor|silencer]]. Revy is very confident, grumpy, aggressive, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], and [[Mental disorder|emotionally unstable]]. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and violence to get her way. In contrast to this, she is revealed to be highly ticklish. She is also a [[Chain smoking|heavy smoker]] and [[Alcoholism|drinker]]. Of all the characters in the series, Revy is recognized as the most foul-mouthed character, yelling constant profanity.\n\nShe is a sadistic killer without a conscience who will murder anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians. She has a loving but bullying attitude towards Rock, the newest and most friendly crew member of the ''Black Lagoon''; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly threatening towards him, having nearly murdered him on two occasions and threatening him with death on several others. However, she does act to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is likely that she is attracted to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda's teasing, which appear to be jealousy. Her attraction is further suggested in the last scenes of Season 2 when Eda asked her if she had gotten anywhere with Rock, instead of denying it with a short comment as usual she said she rather not say causing Eda to laugh at her hopelessness when it comes to men.\n\nRevy is also very protective of Rock. An example can be found in her anger and resolve to kill Chaka after he beats Rock. She has also lied or gone against her \"nature\" in order to save him; such as when he was kidnapped by Takenaka and she lied about him having the documents they required when she actually had them the whole time, or when she stood up to Balalaika when she held Rock at gunpoint after he opposed her plan to destroy the Washimine clan. She also went to Japan as his bodyguard (when Rock acted as Balalaika's interpreter), but as pointed out by Benny the only real reason she went was to look after him because she was worried about him.\n\nAccording to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents on [[Basilan (island)|Basilan Island]], Revy is still notorious in the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] (particularly at the fictional 27th Precinct).\n\nRevy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparalleled. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat. In episode 11 of the first season Revy concedes to Mr. Chang that she does not possess his level of skill but hopes to attain it eventually. Her weapons of choice are a [[Akimbo (firearms)|pair]] of modified [[Beretta 92]]FS's; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for [[suppressor|silencers]]. They are engraved with the words \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, the [[Jolly Roger]] of the pirate [[Calico Jack]] (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in [[Thai alphabet|Thai]]. Due to her [[Cross-dominance|ambidextrous]] marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hands\" by the denizens of Roanapur, which is based on Douglas E. Winter's novel '''Run'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 1|year=2008|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Editor's Note: Revy \"Two Hand\"|page=206|isbn=978-1-4215-1382-9}}</ref> Revy is also proficient in the use of other weapons, such as high-powered rifles and the [[M79 grenade launcher]]. Constantly living on the edge of life combined with the tragedies of her past, Revy has developed a rather bleak outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money.\n\n=== Dutch ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tsutomu Isobe]]|[[Dean Redman]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Dutch'''|\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1|Datchi}} is the [[African American]] leader of the Lagoon Company and captain of the ex-[[U.S. Navy]] [[PT boat]] ''Black Lagoon''. Age 40-50, he is a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] who fought in the [[Vietnam War]]. Shortly before the war ended (presumably in 1973), Dutch went [[AWOL]], escaping to [[Thailand]] to work as a mercenary.\n\nDutch first appears where he scolds Revy for taking Rock as a hostage when she had no real plan for obtaining any ransom. Because of this, Dutch apologizes and tries to take care of Rock until they find a safe place to abandon him. As Rock later proves to be incredibly useful, Dutch allows Revy to invite him into the Lagoon Company. Dutch tends to stay away from the fighting associated with Lagoon Company's activities. Instead, he gives orders and negotiates contracts with clients from the many criminal groups of Roanapur. However, Dutch is very capable in combat, skillfully wielding a [[Remington 870]] Marine Magnum shotgun and a [[Smith & Wesson Model 29|Smith & Wesson 629]] revolver. Despite his amoral lifestyle, Dutch is polite and laid-back character, and most of the time, is very considerate. He has a close association with Balalaika of Hotel Moscow, having saved her life during one of Roanapur's gang wars. \n\nHis body is heavily muscled, and he is always seen wearing a pair of sunglasses, typically dressed in camouflage pants and wearing a [[flak jacket]]. He appears to be in his 30s, but is most likely in his 40s, given his apparent military service in Vietnam given the setting of ''Black Lagoon'' in the 1990s. In the \"Baile de los Muertos\" saga in the manga, it is suggested that Dutch lied about his Vietnam service and could just simply be a mercenary with no past. However a U.S soldier advised Benny to be wary of Dutch, because a man like Dutch never lies without a serious reason.\n\n=== Benny ===\n{{voiced by|[[Hiroaki Hirata]]|[[Brian Drummond]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Benny'''|\u30d9\u30cb\u30fc|Ben\u012b}} is a [[High school dropouts|dropout]] from a college in [[Florida]] where he studied until getting into trouble with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the mafia. Benny would have ended up dead if Revy had not saved him. He works as the Lagoon Company's [[mechanic]], computer specialist, and researcher. He also functions as the Lagoon's driver and appears to be the owner of the [[Dodge Coronet#1968-70|1969 Dodge Coronet R/T]] (later replaced with a [[Pontiac GTO#First generation|1965 Pontiac GTO]]) that Lagoon Company travels around Roanapur in. He is Jewish, or at least of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent as he puts it, and is often called \"Benny-Boy\" by Dutch. Benny joined the Lagoon Company two years before Rock after Revy rescued him. Benny has a level-headed and anxiety-free personality. He readily admits to Rock that the two of them are not gunfighters in any way, shape, or form. Unlike Rock, however, Benny is willing to turn a blind eye to Revy and Dutch's barbaric methods. Benny also tends to be possessive of his computers and will not let anyone else touch them. In the second season, he met Greenback Jane and after impressing her with his computer abilities, began an online relationship with her. Jane returns to Roanapur following the teams completion of the Lovelace Incident and Benny meets up with her. Possibly based on [[Jake Adelstein]].\n\n== Hotel Moscow ==\n[[File:Hotel Moscow - Black Lagoon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Boris and Balalaika.]]\n'''Hotel Moscow''' is a branch of the [[Russian mafia]] based on Thai soil named after the Russian capital city of [[Moscow]]. The Bougainvillea Trade Company serves as a front for their activities. It is composed of the men who served under Balalaika in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], who are dedicated to her. They are relatively new to Roanapur, but their brutality, discipline and prior experience make most of the gangsters wary of them.\n\n=== Balalaika ===\n{{voiced by|[[Mami Koyama]]|[[Patricia Drake]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Balalaika'''|\u30d0\u30e9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab|Bararaika}} is the [[Boss (crime)|boss]] of Hotel Moscow. Her real name is Sofiya Pavlovna. She was brought up by her grandfather, the military head of the [[USSR]]. Before joining the mafia, Balalaika was a captain in the [[Soviet Army]] and a ''[[Russian Airborne Troops|Vozdushno-Desantnye Vojska]]'' paratrooper who served in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. A fine marksman and sniper, she was nicknamed \"[[balalaika]]\", one of the Soviet Army's slang terms for the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]]. After being dismissed by the Soviet Military, Balalaika has an intense hatred for the corrupt Russian government and its influence over her country. It is because of this Balalaika decided to work for the Russian Mafia. Due to Balalaika's leadership during the hellish fighting in [[Afghanistan]], her men look up to her as their superior and will do just about anything upon her orders. As a combat officer, she is a skilled strategist and well-rounded fighter, capable of taking care of herself despite the fact that all of her troopers, including Boris, often worry about her. Although she has shown herself to be rather cynical on occasion, she is also a pragmatic and professional businesswoman. She frequently employs Dutch and the Lagoon Company, as he saved her life after she was shot by Mr Chang during a gang war. She, along with Mr Chang, are one of the few people that Revy respects, and Revy would affectionately refer to her as \"Sis\". In turn, Balalaika also seems to hold Rock in high regard, sometimes relying on his knowledge and business skills.  \n\nBalalaika can be easily identified by the burn marks which scar most of the right side of her face, neck, and chest which she suffered in Afghanistan, earning her the nickname \"Fry-Face\" by those who dislike her. She has long blonde hair, and usually wears a [[greatcoat|military greatcoat]], thrown over a low-cut business suit. She smokes [[cigar]]s, in contrast with the other characters who smoke [[cigarette]]s. Based on her service in Afghanistan and the missed opportunity to participate in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], she is between 31\u201335 years old.\n\nIn critical operations, Balalaika calls upon a personal cadre of ex-Soviet airborne troops and [[Spetsnaz GRU|Spetsnaz]] commandos who are Afghanistan veterans. Known as the ''Desantniki'',<ref>In the manga and English dub, they were called Vysotoniki.</ref> they act as Hotel Moscow's special ops team. She and her men share a strong fellowship and there is a great deal of mutual loyalty between them. It is implied that many of her current operatives served with her in [[Afghanistan]]. When conducting foreign operations from Thai soil, she uses the Russian cargo ship ''Maria Zeleska'' as a legal cover from the police and various law enforcement agencies. In spite of the fact that Balalaika is on the [[Interpol]] list, she uses the pseudonym Vladilena N. Vasilinov in Japan, being covered by [[diplomatic immunity]].\n\n=== Boris ===\n{{voiced by|[[Taiten Kusunoki]]|[[Mark Acheson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Boris'''|\u30dc\u30ea\u30b9|Borisu}} is Balalaika's second-in-command. He can be easily identified by the large scar running from the right side of his forehead to his left cheek. He is a calm, broad-built man with a deep Russian accent. Like Balalaika, he also saw service in Afghanistan. She still refers to him as \"Comrade Sergeant\" rather than by his name, suggesting that he was her former [[platoon sergeant]]. He is very loyal and protective of Balalaika and often worries for her safety when she decides to fight in the field.\n\n== The Hong Kong Triad ==\nThe '''Hong Kong Triad''' are a branch of the [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] stationed in Roanapur. They are led by Mr. Chang, who is a proficient gun fighter in his own right. Chang is more patient than Balalaika in terms of getting into battle. Under his services are Shenhua, who is his top assassin; Sawyer, who does disposal jobs for him frequently despite not being a member of the organization, and Leigharch, who is their getaway driver until recent events prevented him from acting in this capacity.\n\n=== Mr. Chang ===\n{{voiced by|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]|[[Trevor Devall]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Bai Ji-Shin Chang'''|\u5f35\u7dad\u65b0|Chan Waisan}} is the [[Boss (crime)|boss]] of a Thailand branch of the [[Sun Yee On]] [[Triad society|Triad]]. Like Revy, he is adept with dual-wielding pistols ([[Beretta 70#76|Beretta 76]] and [[AMT Hardballer]]) in a fashion similar to that of [[gun fu]], the former of which are inscribed with a Chinese symbol, meaning \"Heavenly King\", on the grips. Chang is far more proficient in this dual-wielding gunfighting style than Revy, who, in episode 11, freely admits that she is \"not on his level yet\". It may be this prowess in combat that makes Chang the only male whom Revy respectfully refers to as \"Sir\".\n\nHe has a deep respect for Balalaika (who annoys him by referring to him as \"Babe\"), though their beliefs are known to collide. Their relationship is almost playful in a business sort of way, which began after they survived a shootout with each other. They both recognise they would make a strong partnership in crime, but choose not to because it would make their respective lives boring. Chang is rather amused at Rock's \"unique\" way of handling things. Unlike most criminal bosses in the town, he advocates cooperation and joint ventures to keep the [[status quo]] in Roanapur, knowing outside interference would see all the criminals lose. A conversation with Eda just before Roberta's second rampage reveals Chang is in fact secretly backed by the CIA, being permitted to continue his criminal activities in exchange for keeping Roanapur relatively peaceful.\n\nChang seems easily amused, and unusually-easygoing and lighthearted, especially given his position. This might be attributed to the fact that he was once a member of law enforcement, which he reveals after being called 'an inhuman scumbag' by Rock and laughing out loud in response, and he might very well be seeing his current position as an ironic twist of fate. The only time he is shown to be truly angry is when Eda (disguising her voice) taunts him about the USA's influence and the fact he has no choice but to cooperate with them.\n\nHis past as law enforcer may explain his combat expertise. Chang manages to survive a shootout with Balalaika, escape from ambush of superior number of Islamic front jihadists, and disarm Fabiola easily. His expertise is often overshadowed by his easygoing character, in comparison with the ill-tempered Revy and near-psychotic Roberta.\n\nMr. Chang is based on characters commonly played by [[Chow Yun-fat]] in films by [[John Woo]], such as John Lee in ''[[Replacement Killers]]'' and especially [[Mark Gor]] in ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'', as both Chang and Mark Gor are members of the Hong Kong Triads, wield dual pistols and don similar attire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hiroe|first=Rei|title=Black Lagoon, Volume 3|year=2008|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Editor's Note: The Triads|page=193|isbn=978-1-4215-1892-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Shenhua ===\n{{voiced by|Y\u016bko Sasaki|[[Saffron Henderson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Shenhua'''|\u30b7\u30a7\u30f3\u30db\u30a2|Shenhoa}} is a [[Taiwan]]ese [[assassination|assassin]] in the employ of Mr. Chang. She prefers to use various edged weapons in close combat, in particular a pair of [[Kukri]] knives linked together with a length of leather rope at the handles, thus using them as modified [[rope dart]]s. She is also skilled in the use of throwing knives. Shenhua is a professional rival of Revy (who refers to her as \"Chinglish\" in the anime and \"Yes Lady\" in the manga; in return Shenhua calls Revy \"[[Twinkie]]\" in the anime (yellow on the outside (Chinese) and white on the inside), whom she has worked with and against at times. Her personal religion is [[Taoism]]. However, she tells Eda in episode 18 that she is an [[atheist]], but this was due to a mistranslation in the English dubbed anime. One of her most notable traits is her broken speech pattern, which is always moving between [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[English language|English]]. She is last seen being helped to walk by Lotton (who says that he will take her to a doctor, despite her having suffered what she believes to be a fatal wound) after being shot by Eda while hunting for Greenback Jane. In the El Baile de la Muerte arc, she is revealed to have survived the battle when Revy is shown calling her on the phone. She agrees to take up Revy's offer to help Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel who is trying to kill Roberta. She showed her first glimpse of fear when in close range combat with Roberta when she managed to catch one of Shenhua's kukri in her teeth and shattered the blade to pieces.\n\nIt is unknown if Shenhua has any unarmed hand-to-hand skills, although it seems likely. In the anime, she fights only with blades, and never engages anyone in true hand-to-hand combat. The only other person who does this is Sawyer the Cleaner, who frequently works with her in \"disposal\" jobs.\n\n=== Leigharch ===\n{{voiced by|Akimasa Ohmori|[[Trevor Devall]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Leigharch'''|\u30ec\u30ac\u30fc\u30c1|Reg\u0101chi}} is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] who worked with Shenhua during the incident involving the Islamic Liberation Front. A compulsive user of [[marijuana]], he has a distressingly frequent tendency to hallucinate at inopportune times, such as in the middle of a car chase. Most of his hallucinations are actually references to Western pop culture, such as [[Playmate]]s, ''[[Star Trek]]'' characters like [[Jean-Luc Picard]] and [[Klingon]]s, or 1960s rock music such as [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Leigharch is said by Shenhua during the Greenback Jane incident to have suffered a massive overdose (he \"couldn't get back from Mars\"), inducing psychological damage severe enough to commit him to full-time medical attention. Despite his drug addition and hallucinations, he was still considered a skilled driver before his overdose.\n\n== The Colombian Cartel ==\nThe [[Colombia]]n cartel noted in this section is separate from the Manisalera Cartel which was originally responsible for Garcia Lovelace's kidnapping and was subsequently wiped out by Roberta and Balalaika who seems to have since taken over their territory. Along with the [[Italian Mafia]], they are the most brash of the criminal organizations, much to the disgust of Balalaika and Chang. Just them barely appearing often results in needless fighting and bloodshed. They are led by Abrego, who is somewhat of a coward and usually travels with his men. Lately, they have been made a fool of in the criminal underworld because of the Lovelace Family and their two killer maids. While the Italians do it for profit, the Cartels do it as a sense of pride, which usually gets them into unwanted trouble. It is revealed that they had a hand in the assassination of Diego Lovelace.\n\n=== Abrego ===\n{{voiced by|[[Hisao Egawa]]|[[Eli Gabay]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Abrego'''|\u30a2\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b4|Abur\u0113go}} is a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] drug cartel boss operating in Roanapur. Whilst very arrogant, he has a tendency to be cowardly. He was presumed dead after the South American maid Roberta detonated a bomb in the bar he was in, although his appearance in later episodes is evidence that he somehow survived. After the explosion and the loss of many of his gunmen, Abrego's influence in Roanapur seems to have fallen, judging from the attitude he takes from Balalaika, Chang and Verrocchio. He is once again made a fool of, this time by Fabiola.\n\nEver since the incident with Roberta, the Cartel had tried numerous times to figure out where she was hiding; fortunately for Roberta, through her connection with the Lovelace family, Roberta was protected daily by local police and military forces. Thus, the Cartel couldn't even touch her without causing an incident. Currently, he sends for many [[FARC]] soldiers to assist the cartel in finding Roberta; however, much of the FARC has been suspicious of the cartel's action and even threatened to betray them.\n\n=== Gustavo ===\nVoiced by: [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]] (English)\n\n{{nihongo|'''Gustavo'''|\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc|Gusut\u0101bo}} is one of Abrego's main henchmen. At first, he is seen doing simple tasks for Abrego, such as disposal jobs, early in the series. Recently, he's been assigned to track down Roberta after hearing rumors of her returning to the city by other groups, including the police, Triad, and Hotel Moscow. He, along with some men, search for Roberta throughout the city and meets up with Revy and Rock. He then explains the situation within the Cartel regarding Roberta. He then crosses paths with Fabiola, who is requesting the aid of Lagoon Company. Fabiola is threatened by him and his men, as Revy then instigates a fight between them, resulting in a comical argument between him and Bao over the use of the telephone, much to Revy's amusement. In desperation, he tries to call Abrego, who is out with a girl according to his subordinates. He calls all of them in to warn them of another maid who is as fierce as Roberta. Finally, he orders the total destruction of the Yellow Flag, much to Bao's anger as the Yellow Flag is demolished again. He is left behind by his men after Fabiola scares them off. Because of his failure, Abrego has ordered him to be killed on sight. He is later seen at Abrego's side during a meeting with the other gangs, perhaps Abrego becomes aware with heavy losses he caused.\n\n== Other Roanapur gangsters ==\n=== Verrocchio ===\n{{voiced by|[[Banjo Ginga]]|[[Scott McNeil]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Verrocchio'''|\u30f4\u30a7\u30ed\u30c3\u30ad\u30aa|Verokkio}} is the boss of a branch of the [[Sicilian Mafia|Italian mafia]] based in [[Thailand]]. He once attempted to use the child assassins, H\u00e4nsel and Gretel, to kill the rival gang leaders, including Balalaika and Mr. Chang, in an attempt to seize complete leadership of Roanapur's criminal underworld. Verrocchio was killed when H\u00e4nsel and Gretel turned against him on a murderous whim.\n\n=== Ronny the Jaws ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]|[[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]}}\n\n'''Ronny the Jaws''' is Verrocchio's replacement as the Italian Mafia's boss after his death at the hands of the twins. He wears braces; hence his name. His real name was unknown until Chapter 79. Balalaika calls him by the derogatory slang \"Dago\" prior to this. He seems to have a cooler head than Verrocchio but is still plenty arrogant and foolish. Balalaika and Chang seem to dislike him and his immature way of handling serious business. He doesn't hold much respect for Abrego either and treats him rudely despite being the newest amongst members of those holding the most power in Roanapur. Revy says his group is almost as vicious as Hotel Moscow and he appears to have an alliance with the [[Albanian Mafia]].\n\n=== Chen ===\n{{voiced by|Suetsu Tokaichi|[[Louis Chirillo]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chen'''|\u9673|Chin}} was a Chinese crime boss whose business suffered as a result of Hotel Moscow recently muscling into Roanapur. He is quite cowardly, and Dutch had already stopped taking him seriously after he pulled out of a previous contract he had made with the Lagoon Company. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate Dutch into ending his contracts with Hotel Moscow, he has a proxy hire Lagoon Company for a job and then sends the pirate gang of Luak to ambush them, but Revy and Dutch wipe out the entire fleet. Chen, having bragged about his plan to most of Roanapur, is then located by Hotel Moscow and murdered; they tie him to a chair in his apartment and blow it up using plastic explosives and gasoline.\n\n=== Luak ===\n{{voiced by|[[Naoya Uchida]]|[[Alistair Abell]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Luak'''|\u30eb\u30a2\u30af|Ruaku}} is the captain of a Vietnamese pirate gang that operated in the rivers and seas of Thailand, mostly composed by former [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] defectors. He was contracted by Chen to kill off the Lagoon Company when Dutch wouldn't accept Chen over Balalaika. Luak's gang ambushed the Black Lagoon, but the entire gang was wiped out by Revy and Dutch. Revy is seen to fire a round from an [[M79 grenade launcher]] into his boat at the end of the fight destroying it, so he is presumed dead. \n\n== The Church of Violence/The Rip-Off Church ==\nThe '''Church of Violence''' is a drugs and weapon smuggling operation located in Roanapur. The church is notorious for its double dealings. Using their front as a Christian church, their main business is illegal imports, mainly firearms. However, they are known to import other items, including drugs, which seems to offend Balalaika as it is bad for their business. So far they have consistently outsmarted Hotel Moscow in terms of imports. Dutch refers them as '''\"The Rip-Off Church\"''' due to the group charging heavily on goods, especially those needed for missions. Rock has been able to arrange proper business deals with the Church. The Church is always money-hungry and are known to do double-dealings, much to the disgust of Revy.\n\n=== Eda ===\n{{voiced by|[[Jun Karasawa]]|[[Lisa Ann Beley]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Eda'''|\u30a8\u30c0}} is a woman posing as a [[nun]] in the Rip-Off Church, with ties to the underground, since the convent is mainly a smuggling organization. About 30-year-old, she is friends with Revy and often drinks with her in the Rip-off Church, but this does not prevent them from confronting each other, as they share the same hotheaded personality. She has taken a liking to Rock during the \"Second Barrage\" episodes, and makes fun of Revy by threatening to take Rock for herself. She often calls Rock \"Romeo\".\n\nEda has blond hair, blue eyes, and wears angular pink sunglasses even with her nun's [[Religious habit|habit]], and is often seen either chewing gum or smoking. She is in her mid-30s. Before she came to work for the Church, she claimed to be from [[Langley, Virginia]]. Langley, Virginia, is a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the CIA as its headquarters is located there. Later on, it is revealed that Eda is an operative for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and is being hosted by the Church of Violence in return for monetary payments. She is given an assignment by the CIA to track down Grey Fox, the same foe Roberta is hunting as they are a threat to her CIA division. Using a voice changer inside a mobile, Eda acts as an anonymous handler for Mr. Chang, providing him with intelligence about Grey Fox's mission to capture a major figure in the Triad's drug manufacturing operation. Chang is aggravated by the way he is being manipulated, but Eda mocks him as just a \"two-bit thug\" compared to the USA. Rock is perhaps the only person in Roanapur who openly suspects who Eda might be working for.\n\nEda's preferred firearm is a [[Glock 17L]] (as seen in manga chapter 41), which she wields proficiently, despite Revy's claims that she is a \"second-rate gunman\".\n\nShe apparently was loosely modeled after the character Thana from ''[[Ms. 45]]''.\n\n=== Yolanda ===\n{{voiced by|Akiko Takeguchi|[[Shirley Millner]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yolanda'''|\u30e8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0|Yoranda}} is the leader of The Rip-Off Church. She appears to be quite old and wears an [[eyepatch]] over her right eye. Despite her age and gentle appearance, she leads her organization with an iron fist. As the head of her organization, Yolanda usually never fights, leaving this job to gunmen like Eda and Rico. However, she does carry a customized [[Gold plating|golden]] [[Desert Eagle]] and uses it without hesitation in due course, such as in chapter 38 of the manga. She can fire the Desert Eagle one-handed and with deadly accuracy, seemingly unaffected by the gun's infamous weight and heavy recoil. Her looks could be based on [[Mother Angelica]], a real-life [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] nun who, at one time, wore an eyepatch over her left eye. Yolanda is usually stern with Eda drinking alcohol in the church and seems to love tea. After an intelligent conversation with Rock, who convinces her to make a deal with Lagoon Company, she is impressed by his abilities and credits Dutch for finding someone as rare as him. She refers to Revy as \"Rebecca\" and tells her that she might learn a thing or two from Rock. She has connections with all the criminal organization in terms of intelligence, and though not officially part of the CIA, she serves as Eda's informant and confidant. She gives Eda fair warning that her opponent is no rookie and that she should be careful.\n\n=== Rico ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]|[[Simon Hill (actor)|Simon Hill]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rico'''|\u30ea\u30ab\u30eb\u30c9|Rikarudo}} (Ricardo) is an apprentice [[priest]] in the Rip-Off Church. Like Eda and Yolanda, he is a highly skilled gunman whose choice of weapon is a [[M60 machine gun]]. He refers to Eda as \"Big sis\" (''\"Ane-san\"'' in Japanese) instead of \"Sister\", much to her chagrin.\n\n== Citizens of Roanapur ==\nThe following are the inhabitants of Roanapur:\n\n=== Bao ===\n{{voiced by|[[Shir\u014d Sait\u014d]]|[[Alec Willows]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Bao'''|\u30d0\u30aa|Bao}} is the [[bartender]] and owner of the Yellow Flag bar, which he named in honor of the [[flag of South Vietnam|former South Vietnam flag]]. He is an ex-[[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] soldier who fought in the [[Vietnam War]]. He often feels harassed by Lagoon Company, especially Revy, for messing up his bar whenever they get into a fight with another party and reminds Revy to pay for the damage she has caused, which she always avoids doing. Balalaika seems to cover the repairs after Roberta destroyed it, which implies that the bar may be owned by Hotel Moscow. Seen as a great hang-out by most of the residents as it give many \"jobs\" to locals. After being rebuilt, he calls the Lagoon Company to tell them that Roberta is back in town. When Revy and Rock arrive along with Gustavo, they all meet up with Fabiola. After some words, Revy instigates a fight between Gustavo and Fabiola leading once again to the destruction of his bar. Bao claims that his bar has been destroyed more than 15 times, most of it done by Revy.\n\n=== Flora ===\n'''Madame Flora''' is the morbidly obese [[madam]] of the \"Sloppy Swing\", a brothel located on the top floor of Bao's bar. She took a liking to Rock and offered to \"service him herself\" (were she a bit younger).\n\n=== Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon ===\n{{voiced by|Masaki Aizawa|[[Adrian Holmes]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon'''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30ef\u30f3|R\u014dwan}} is the owner and manager of the GoofFest [[strip club]] on Rachiada Street in Roanapur. Of African-American descent, he has employed Revy as an [[Sadism and masochism|S/M]] dancer once in the past, possibly putting her as a [[dominatrix]]. He has stated, however, that she \"could give it and take it\", implying that Revy could also have been the submissive. This is changed in the anime, with Rowan consistently asking Revy to join his BDSM show when she comes to his place, but with her expressing disgust at the idea. He is also a movie dealer who carries both legal and illegal genres (such as all forms of [[pornography]] and [[snuff films]]). He is extremely frightened of Hotel Moscow, especially of Balalaika.\n\n=== Chief Watsup ===\n{{voiced by|[[Masaaki Tsukada]]|[[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chief Watsup'''|\u30ef\u30c8\u30b5\u30c3\u30d7|Watosappu}} is the [[Chief of Police|chief]] of the  Roanapur police force. He receives a regular stipend from Roanapur's criminal cartels, as well as the Lagoon Company, to stay away from their illegal activities. It is implied throughout the series that Revy tends to cause a lot of trouble in public and he usually has to bail her out much to his chagrin. He gets used to Revy's trouble making and he and Revy became sort of friends. For the most part, Watsup upholds this deal as long as his benefactors do not cause public incidents. He has dealt with Balalaika on more than one occasion, although she detests him for reasons unknown.\n\n== Bounty hunters and mercenaries ==\nThis section depicts the known [[bounty hunter]]s and [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] that appear in this anime:\n\n=== The Captain ===\n{{voiced by|[[Masahiko Tanaka]]|[[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]}}\n\n'''The Captain''' is the rank of an unknown mercenary in the employ of the Extra Order Company, a fictional [[private military company]] similar to modern day [[Blackwater Worldwide]] and the now defunct [[Executive Outcomes]], where the initials EO come from. An experienced ex-soldier who saw action in the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian civil war in the early 1990s]], Captain had no qualms with killing anyone he was asked to kill. He was also something of a challenge-seeker, since he wanted to prolong his fight with the Lagoon Company, whom he saw as worthy opponents. This proved to be his undoing however, since Rock realized this and came up with a strategy to exploit Captain's attitude. While attacking the ''Black Lagoon'' head-on in a [[Mil Mi-24]], the boat launched itself off a sunken ship and fired two torpedoes that brought down the Captain's helicopter, one hitting him in the face before detonating.\n\n=== Sawyer the Cleaner ===\n{{voiced by|[[Asami Yaguchi]]|[[Saffron Henderson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Frederica Sawyer'''|\u30bd\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc|S\u014dy\u0101}}, also known as '''Sawyer the Cleaner''', is a young girl, appearing to be in her late teens-early twenties, who specializes in body disposal, but also does occasional bounty hunter work. She is the person that the [[Triad society|Triads]] turn to execute people in the most brutal ways possible, usually to serve as examples for their clientele and enemies. Her legitimate business front is, fittingly, a meat packing business named \"U.G. Pork\".\n\nSawyer works in a white-tiled room, which is covered in blood from her various executions, and uses a [[chainsaw]] as her tool of trade. When on the job, she is dressed like a surgeon, but otherwise she wears [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] clothing. Few people seem to recognize her when she is not wearing her surgeon's robes. Because her throat had been cut open at some point, she speaks with an [[mechanical larynx|Ultravoice]]. Upon losing the Ultravoice, she is shown to become extremely emotionally distressed and drops into a fetal position.\n\nLike Shenhua, Sawyer is an assassin who eschews the use of firearms in combat. Instead, she utilizes a thick-bladed chainsaw over half-her-height long, the same one she uses on her victims. The size and build of the weapon allows her to deflect rapid gun-fire with horrifying ease, although this can still push her back.\n\nMuch like Roberta, Sawyer is presented as an \"unstoppable\" attacker, much in the manner of [[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', where she will cut through any obstacle in her path while stalking her prey, and the fact she enjoys her work immensely makes her even more dangerous. Her name may also be a homage to the Sawyer family of that film series and when she realized she had lost her Ultravoice in episode 18 she briefly reenacts Leatherface's \"chainsaw dance\" of rage. Strangely, she is one of the few bounty hunters to survive the manhunt on Jane, and is later seen doing some \"cleanup\" work on a Roanapur side street in the morning. She worked with Shenhua and Lotton in helping Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel, who were trying to kill Roberta. She also seems to have replaced her hand held Ultravoice with a wraparound version of the device that can be worn around her neck. Just like Shenhua, she first showed her fear of Roberta after their first encounter when Roberta managed to stop and break the chain of Sawyer's chainsaw with her guns.\n\nShe does not only do disposal jobs, but also cleaning jobs for hotel rooms. When she forgets her Ultravoice, she requests someone to translate for her and draws descriptions on a window or on a person's back to \"speak\". Given the chance to explain, she's extremely graphic about the details of her profession to the point those around her tell her to stop being descriptive. Despite the gruesome nature of her job, Sawyer seems to have a rather happy, yet morbid demeanor at times. In chapter 78 when she explained to Rock that he touched a mattress that had absorbed the bodily fluids of the corpses that died 14 days prior in the hotel room he, Benny, Jane and Feng Yifei were staying in, Sawyer has a blissful expression while everyone else vomits at this information.\n\n=== Claude \"Torch\" Weaver ===\n{{voiced by|[[Youichi Nishijima]]|[[Jason Simpson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Claude \"Torch\" Weaver'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u201c\u30c8\u30fc\u30c1\u201d\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|Kur\u014ddo \"T\u014dchi\" W\u012bb\u0101}} is a heavyset, middle-aged man with blonde hair and glasses and always sports a grin with a look of an archetypical [[everyman]]. As his nickname would suggest, he is a [[pyromaniac]] who uses a [[lighter]] shaped-and-sized [[flamethrower]] as his weapon of choice, although for heavy-duty jobs, he will also use a full-sized flamethrower. In spite of his profession and the fact he burnt his own wife to death (which he claims took five minutes), Weaver claims to be religious (which religion is unknown) and is a [[teetotaler]]. He is one of the few characters in the series that does not use foul language, preferring to speak with euphemisms (such as \"darn\" or \"shucks\") instead. He also moves fast for a man of his weight. He is blown up by Revy while hunting for Greenback Jane.\n\n=== Lotton the Wizard ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Sugita]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Lotton the Wizard'''|\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30f3\u30fb\u201c\u30b6\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u201d|Rotton \"Za Wiz\u0101do\"}} is a mysterious-looking man and one of the bounty hunters hired to capture \"Greenback\" Jane. He has silver hair, wears a black trenchcoat and shaded glasses, and speaks in a light voice. His weapon of choice is one or more [[Mauser C96]](s) with an extended magazine, although it's unknown whether this is an actual Mauser or a foreign version of the gun. He does not drink alcohol (he claims he's allergic to it). He gets shot by Revy when he tries to make a fancy entrance. It is implied that he is not a mighty fighter, but a poser. However, he did survive a fall from atop a warehouse building after getting shot due to his Kevlar vest, so the full extent of his abilities is still in question. He worked with Sawyer and Shenhua in helping Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel, who were trying to kill Roberta.\n\nHe is also one of the few bounty hunters to survive the manhunt for Jane. After the battle takes off in the sea, he gets up and aids a gravely wounded Shenhua and Sawyer. Due to the uncommon act of kind-heartedness, Shenhua comments that he is not the type to kill and would be better as a host in a [[bordello]], but Lotton claims that he is too clumsy for that. He is seen playing video games with Sawyer at Shenhua's residence in chapter 57 of the manga (as well as the OVA). Revy refers him as being more of a gigolo than a gunman; in addition, Revy forgets that she shot Lotton during the Greenback Jane incident (she shot him on reflex) causing Shenhua and Sawyer to mock her intelligence.\n\n=== Major Shane Caxton ===\n{{voiced by|[[Shinji Ogawa]]|[[Ron Halder]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Major Shane Caxton'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3|Kyakusuton}} is an American black-ops operator hiding in Roanapur, awaiting deployment into Indochina. Like Dutch, Caxton is a Vietnam War veteran who still holds on to his moral code of conduct. Caxton's team, called \"[[Intelligence Support Activity|Gray Fox]]\", under orders from a division of the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], orchestrated the assassination of Garcia Lovelace's father. Then were then dispatched to Roanapur in order to infiltrate the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] and capture a key player who have tie with [[Khun Sa]] in the drug trade for trial in the US. However, he and is men are tracked by the formidable Roberta, and their conflict draws in all the major players in Roanapur, including the Triad, Hotel Moscow, and the Church of Violence. When he meets up with Lagoon Company, he automatically recognizes Dutch and mentions something to Dutch that seemed to shock him.\n\nHe is held in high esteem by his colleagues, especially Gray Fox's second in command, for his integrity and honorable conduct, being the ideal symbol of America in the story. In a flashback, he executed one of his subordinates, Larkin, in retaliation for murdering innocent women and trying to rape a young girl during the Vietnam War. He also protects Garcia Lovelace as he and his team are escaping from Hotel Moscow. After escaping Roanapur and deploying to capture a drug baron in the Golden Triangle, his men are ambushed by Roberta, but he is actually shot by Garcia himself, who wants to end Roberta's rampage. It is later shown the gun was filled with blanks.\n\n=== Bren the Black Death ===\n'''Bren the Black Death''' runs a murder for hire business. According to Revy, he has an office in Roanapur but rarely does jobs there because of overlapping contracts. Roberta hires him to gather a team to attack Grey Fox to drive them out into the open. He sends in a group of hired guns knowing very well that they will be slaughtered by the trained soldiers. He then kills the one survivor himself.\n\n=== Filano ===\n'''Filano''' is a young boy who works for Bren the Black Death. He is seen observing the battle between the Grey Foxes and Roberta. He says he prefers to kill with an ordinary object or with nothing at all. He is particularly fond of pushing people downstairs or in front of trains. He considers guns to be the lowest form of killing. He does however like to play first person shooters. He also likes anime.\n\n== U-1324 Crew and Passengers ==\nThe following are the crew members and passengers of the U-1324:\n\n=== Lieutenant Commander Wentzel Ahbe ===\n{{voiced by|[[Shigeru Ushiyama]]|[[Brian Drummond]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Captain (or Lieutenant Commander) Wentzel Ahbe'''|\u30a2\u30fc\u30d9|\u0100be}} was the decorated skipper of the [[Type IX U-boat#Type IXC|Type IXC]] [[U-boat]] U-1324 and a survivor of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. His last order in the closing months of [[World War II]] in Europe was to take the U-1324 and its veteran crew along with two passengers from the [[Kriegsmarine]] naval base at [[Kiel]] to ostensibly return Lt. Col. Matsuda to [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. He succeeded in getting safely to the [[Indian Ocean]], but ran into trouble with [[US Navy]] destroyers near the [[Nicobar Islands]] on March 25, 1945, which succeed in fatally crippling the U-1324 with [[depth charge]]s, leaving it stranded on the seafloor. With only two hours of air left, he relieved his crew of their military duties and allowed them to face death however they chose. Ahbe was a patriot, but he despised the Nazi cause, expressing his bitterness to the SS Lieutenant Colonel that the Nazis had brought Germany to ruin and satisfaction that U-1324\u2019s sinking had meaning if his children would never see the Nazi flag again, leading the latter to shoot him. In their last act of loyalty to their captain, his crew avenged him. Ahbe left behind a wife and two children.\n\nHis [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] is sought after by Revy after she and Rock recover ''The Twelve Knights Led by Brunhilda'' for its value on the open market. Ahbe is also shown to have received the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 1st Class]] among his other decorations.\n\nHe is apparently modeled after [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]]'s character from ''[[Das Boot]]''. Additionally, the U-1324 bears the famed laughing sawfish emblem of the {{GS|U-96|1940|2}}.\n\n=== Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda ===\n{{voiced by|Hitoshi Bifu|[[Hiro Kanagawa]]}}\n\n'''Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda''' was an [[Imperial Japanese Army]] officer posted to Germany to study aeronautics, where he remained until the early part of 1945. Returning him to Japanese-held [[Jakarta|Batavia]] is the apparent final mission of the U-1324. He formed a fast friendship with Captain Ahbe and was sociable with the crew, engaging them in games of [[shogi]] during the voyage from Kiel to Batavia. When the U-1324 was fatally depth charged and runs aground on the seabed near the Nicobar Islands, he committed [[seppuku]] (ritual [[suicide]]) using his [[katana]]. He does not appear in the manga.\n\nMatsuda is based on the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lieutenant commander Genzo Shoji, who was posted to Germany to study aeronautics as well, and tried to return to Japan as a passenger of U-234. However, when Germany surrendered in the midst of the voyage, the captain of U-234 decided to surrender to the U.S. Navy. Consequently, Shoji committed seppuku\u2014suicide\u2014to avoid capture. This episode was turned into the movie ''[[Das Letzte U-Boot]]'' in Germany in 1990.\n\n=== SS Lieutenant Colonel Spielberger ===\n{{voiced by|Takaya Kuroda|[[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]}}\n\n'''SS Lieutenant Colonel''' ([[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]) {{nihongo|'''Spielberger'''|\u30b7\u30e5\u30d4\u30fc\u30eb\u30d9\u30eb\u30ac\u30fc|Shup\u012bruberug\u0101}} was the U-1324\u2019s second passenger.  A member of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], he was charged with the care of the painting ''The Twelve Knights Led by Brunhilda'', which is part of a Nazi plot to prepare for the Nazis' eventual return to power following their defeat in World War II.\n\nHe boarded the U-1324 the night before it sailed. Unlike Lt. Col. Matsuda, he was not as sociable, tending to keep to himself belowdecks, even when the U-boat was safely cruising on the surface in daytime. Like Captain Ahbe he also had a family, a wife and child in [[Stuttgart]], but unlike the former, was more focused on the failure of his mission rather than on them in his final hours. Ahbe's anti-Nazi comments infuriated him, leading him to fatally shoot the captain. About to then shoot himself, he decided to take down as many of the U-1324\u2019s crewmembers as possible in his final moments when they avenged their captain's murder.\n\n== Aryan Socialist Union ==\nThe '''Aryan Socialist Union''' is a group of aspiring [[Neo Nazis]] styling themselves along the lines of the Nazi [[Sturmabteilung]]. They have a large arsenal of weapons such as [[MAC-10]] machine pistols, [[MG3]] machine guns, [[AK47]] assault rifles, [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]], [[MP5]] Sub-Machineguns, and double-action trigger-outfitted Colt 45 pistols and even [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] [[anti-tank missile|Anti-Tank Missiles]].\n\nHowever, they do not realize that they have been lied to and are being set up by Sir Alfred, the head of the Neo Nazi movement, who believes they are a waste. There are more than 30 of them aboard their recovery ship, along with seemingly innocent hostages used to pilot the ship. It is unknown how many, if any, survived the conflict with the Lagoon Company.\n\n=== Ratchman ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ryuji Nakagi]]|[[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ratchman'''|\u30e9\u30c3\u30c1\u30de\u30f3|Racchiman}} is a short, fat man who leads the Aryan Socialist Union. He and his men are sent to retrieve a painting that was supposedly painted by [[Hitler]] and will reunite the Nazis and return them back to their former glory. He hopes that, by obtaining the painting, he will have proven himself and his men loyal enough to be accepted into the Neo-Nazi underworld. Though he shows loyalty on the surface, he is a coward at heart. Ratchman's lack of foresight and proper planning enables the Lagoon Company to sneak onto the ASU's recovery ship and launch a surprise attack while his men are drunk from celebrating after they recover the painting. He is murdered by Revy and Dutch. \n\n=== [[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]] ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ken Narita]]|[[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]}}\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'''|\u30af\u30eb\u30c3\u30da\u30f3\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30fc|Kuruppen Fer\u0101}} is the commander of the Aryan Socialist Union's Suicide Corps. He is the only man, other than Ratchman, to get emotionally worked up over the latter's bombastic pronouncement of his mission. Feller leads his men down to the U-1324 using a special diving pod to connect with the U-boat's hatch. Getting caught up in a firefight with Revy, he is the only member of his team to set foot in the U-1324 to make it out alive, recovering the painting in the process.\n\nWhen Revy and Dutch assault the Aryan Socialist Union aboard their recovery ship, he attempts to arm himself with a [[MG42]] to fight back, but is shot in the back by Revy in the ship's [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]]. In the manga, he is last seen fighting Revy inside the submarine; his fate afterwards is unknown.\n\n=== Fritz Stanford ===\n{{voiced by|[[Youichi Nishijima]]|[[Mark Gibbon]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Fritz Stanford'''|\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9|Burittsu Sutanf\u014ddo}} is the Captain of the Nazi boat that is sent to obtain the [[World War II]]  painting in the sunken [[U-boat]]. He is a physically huge man, and is filled with blind faith and overconfidence. In the end, it is this overconfidence that gets him killed when he brags about his weapon and threatens Revy (as she slowly reloads her weapon), who shoots him in the chest and then point blank in the head, mostly just to shut him up. He wields a large [[Gold plating|gold]] [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] chambered for the [[.454 Casull]] cartridge.\n\n=== Sir Alfred ===\n{{voiced by|[[Fumio Matsuoka]]|French Tickner}}\n\nLittle is known about {{nihongo|'''Alfred'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9|Arufur\u0113do}}, except he seems to be the head of the [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] underworld. He is an elderly man, most likely in his 80s, since he was in the [[SS]] during the war, and it is implied that he is a combat veteran. Sir Alfred sets up a test of loyalty and ability for Ratchman and his Aryan Socialist Union, in which he purposely sends them to face-off with the Lagoon Company. Even though he sets them up, he already knows that Ratchman will most likely be defeated. Ratchman and the Lagoon Company are unaware that they are being set up. Sir Alfred feels that Ratchman and his men are idiots and a disgrace to call themselves Nazis, seeing their easy defeat by a group of \"racially inferior\" members as proof of their incompetence in his view. He even thanks Dutch and Revy for killing them off for him, and even harbours an amount of respect for Dutch, despite being a black man. Dutch later finds out that the Spaniard who hired him was in fact The Boss setting him up.\n\n== Protectors of the Islamic Front ==\nThe '''Protectors of the Islamic Front''' is a [[Mujahideen|Jihadist]] group based in South East Asia.\n\n=== Masahiro Takenaka ===\n{{voiced by|[[Katsuhiko Sasaki]]|[[Fred Henderson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Masahiro Takenaka'''|\u7af9\u4e2d\u6b63\u6d0b|Takenaka Masahiro}} is a co-leader of the terrorist group \"Protectors of the Islamic Front\" and a patient, sociable person who rarely loses his cool. Despite being involved with an [[Islamic terrorist]] group, he himself is an atheist. Born in the [[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi ward in Tokyo]], Masahiro was once an enthusiastic activist for human rights before joining the [[Japanese Red Army]] during the [[Cold War]]. Later, he was forced to evade arrest by hiding overseas after most of its members were arrested; and it was the time he traveled to [[Bekaa]], Lebanon, that he met Ibraha. Takenaka is based on the [[Japanese Red Army]] member [[Kozo Okamoto]].\n\n=== Ibraha ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ken Yamaguchi]]|[[Mackenzie Gray]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ibraha'''|\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30cf|Iburaha}} is a co-leader of the \"Protectors of the Islamic Front\", leading one of its main cells in the [[Philippines]]. He is a Lebanese, and is resolute in his hatred of [[Israel]], as his son was killed by Israeli soldiers in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] in 1987, after which he dedicated his life to destroying the West. Compared to Takenaka, he is the exact opposite in personality. While chasing Revy, Rock, and Shenhua towards a [[Basilan]] military base, he is shot and killed by Takenaka for refusing to pull their forces back for a retreat.\n\n== The Washimine Group ==\nThe '''Washimine Group''' were a [[Yakuza]] formerly run by {{nihongo|Ryuzo Washimine|\u9df2\u5cf0\u9f8d\u4e09|Washimine Ry\u016bz\u014d}}. Balalaika came to Japan to work out a deal with the Washimine group to expand their influence in Japan in exchange for helping them weaken a rival Yakuza group, the Kousa Council.  However, when Hotel Moscow's methods went too far, Tsugio Bando, the current head of the Washimine group, tried to stop them and was killed by Balalaika, who decided she would instead destroy both groups and take over their operations. Following his death, Ryuzo's daughter was put in charge. In the end, the entire Washimine group, and family, were wiped out along with the Kousa Council.\n\n=== Yukio Washimine ===\n{{voiced by|[[Houko Kuwashima]]|Lalainia Lindbjerg}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yukio Washimine'''|\u9df2\u5cf0\u96ea\u7dd2|Washimine Yukio}} is a high school senior and the only daughter of Ryuzo Washimine, who was the former ''kumicho'' (boss) of the [[yakuza]] organization \"Washimine-gumi\" (Washimine Group). She has a chance meeting with Rock and Revy when they come to Tokyo in the employ for Hotel Moscow. Her discussions with Rock lead him to think he might return to an ordinary life, although things soon turn dark when Rock learns that she was born into the Washimine Group. Having lived a normal life free of conflict, she learns that she is the only possible leader of her father's crime family, as the Kousa Council refused to allow anyone other than a blood relative take over. When her bodyguard and unspoken love Ginji resolves to fight \"Hotel Moscow\", she decides join him, assuming the mantle of leader. She falls, seemingly inevitably, into the world of the yakuza, although Rock desperately tries to persuade her to walk away. She initially claims her actions are to uphold the honour of the Washimine Group, but in reality she believes this is the only way she can be with Ginji. In her spare time, Yukio enjoyed reading a wide variety of books, particularly those concerning philosophy (she is once seen reading a book written by [[Martin Heidegger]]). She commits suicide with Ginji's sword after he is killed by Revy. Thoughtful, intelligent and talented, the misfortune of being the only heir to the Washimine group proved too much to bear.\n\n=== Ginji Matsuzaki ===\n{{voiced by|[[Kiyoyuki Yanada]]|[[Michael Adamthwaite]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ginji Matsuzaki'''|\u677e\u5d0e\u9280\u6b21|Matsuzaki Ginji}} is the acting ''wakagashira'' ([[underboss]]) of Washimine Group, and is Yukio's most loyal and humble personal body guard, and possibly love interest. He works as a street stall vendor, but was formerly an assassin nicknamed \"''Hitokiri Ginji''\" (Manslayer Ginji) due to his use of a [[katana]] in combat, serving the Washimine until the death of his leader, who was also Yukio's father. His skills with his blade are exceptional, manifesting themselves in such feats as cleaving bullets in two in midflight. Coupled with his ability to evade gunfire from multiple foes, Ginji almost completely eschews the use of firearms. He and Yukio quietly share an unspoken love, but neither choose to act upon it.\n\nGinji had protected Yukio for a long time and hoped that she would live a normal life despite her family's criminal background. He seems to regret his past as a murderer, and is unwilling to take up arms again until his friend and former leader Tsugio Bondo is killed by Hotel Moscow. Ginji attacks the Japanese branch of the Russian Mafiya to hunt down Balailaka, though he changes targets when the Washimine enforcer Chaka goes rogue and kidnaps Yukio. He briefly allied with Revy and Rock to rescue her, massacring Chaka's henchmen before cutting off the enforcer's hands and drowning him in a pool. Ginji then assists Yukio in her efforts to avenge the slaughter of her clan, and they capture Rock so that he can lead them to Hotel Moscow's base. However, Revy catches up with them, prompting Ginji to face her in a duel.\n\nGinji comes within inches of killing Revy, shattering her cutlass and stabbing her. However, he is distracted by Yukio's admission of love at the last moment; he only manages to put his sword through her leg as she shoots him in the throat. Revy comments that this hesitation was all that stopped Ginji killing her.\n\nAlthough Revy calls Ginji \"Jumbo\" because of his height, the name \"Jumbo\" may also refer to Takashi Takeda (AKA \"Jumbo\") from the [[Yotsuba&!]] manga series with whom he shares an uncanny resemblance.\n\n=== Tsugio Bando ===\n{{voiced by|[[Tomomichi Nishimura]]|[[John Novak]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Tsugio Bando'''|\u5742\u6771\u6b21\u7537|Tsugio Band\u014d}} is the ''wakagashira'' ([[underboss]]) of the Washimine Group. Since the position of boss of the Washimine Group is left vacant by the death of the former boss Ryuzo Washimine, Yukio's father, Tsugio is the actual boss of the Washimine Group. Tsugio is very loyal to the memory of Ryuzo, who had protected him after he just arrived in Tokyo from Osaka. Due to his hate of the Kousa Council's ill-treatment of the Washimine Group, he allied with Hotel Moscow for a short time in order for his group to rise and make a name for itself. However, his plans and Hotel Moscow's completely differed in approach as Balalaika was more brutal in her methods, much to the dismay of Bando. He is killed in a desperate attempt to assassinate Balalaika and protect the Washimine Group, Balalaika easily dodging his attempt to stab her and then breaking his neck, before sending back to the Washimine the suitcase including his body.\n\n=== Yoshida ===\n{{voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]|[[Trevor Devall]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshida'''|\u5409\u7530|Yoshida}} is one of the enforcers working for the Washimine Group. He was very loyal to Tsugio Bando and refers to him as an older brother. Yoshida is usually seen as a bodyguard for Tsugio, and later Yukio when she inherits the leadership of the Washimine Group. During Yukio's inheritance of the Washimine Group's head position, it was Yoshida who rallied support for the young lady. He is killed by Chaka during Yukio's kidnapping.\n\n=== Chaka ===\n{{voiced by|[[Wataru Takagi]]|Jonathan Holmes}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chaka'''|\u30c1\u30e3\u30ab|Chaka}} is one of the enforcers working for the Washimine Group who fancies himself as a \"Wild West\" gunman and is fluent in English. Arrogant, cruel, and sadistic, Chaka is often seen as an idiot by his peers. His earlier appearance showed that Revy's reputation as a gunman in Roanapur is such that even the yakuza in Japan have heard of her. Shortly after Yukio becomes the boss of the Group, Chaka makes his bid to take over the leadership by kidnapping her with the help of a street gang. He was determined to fight Revy in a quickdraw showdown, but she refused and lured him into fighting a duel with Ginji instead, who defeated and finished him off by letting him drown in a pool with both his hands severed. His character and appearance is likely based on Kakihara from [[Ichi the Killer (manga)|Ichi the killer]], as both of them are longing for a strong opponent equal to them and are sadistically violent. Possibly based on a presumably-existing [[Kudo-kai]] member hanging around [[Harajuku]].\n\n== The Lovelace Family ==\nThe '''Lovelace Family''' are one of the 13 prominent [[South America]]n families, and their origin is from [[Venezuela]]. However, the family has come under hard times from not only their peers due to their political beliefs, but also from the Colombian Cartel, which has been harassing employees of the family in order to take control of their land. However, because of Diego Lovelace's military and political connections, the family is constantly protected from threats. In addition, the family includes Roberta (aka Rosarita Cisneros), a former FARC terrorist who is wanted by both the Cartel and various law enforcement agencies. Because of her close relationship with the family, she is accepted as one of their own, serving as maid and, if necessary, bodyguard. Another maid, who is combat ready like Roberta, is Fabiola Igesias.\n\n=== Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace ===\n{{voiced by|[[Ryunosuke Ohbayashi]]|[[Michael Kopsa]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace'''|\u30c7\u30a3\u30a8\u30b4\u30fb\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30e9\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9|Diego Ferunando Raburesu}} was the former head of the Lovelace family, eleventh in succession. While it is one of the thirteen noble families of South America, the Lovelace family fell upon hard times, with only the meager income from their plantations maintaining their lifestyle. He took in Rosarita Cisneros, when she was escaping from the Colombian Cartel as a favor to his old friend, Rosarita's father. He took her in and treated her as family. Recently, he was assassinated during a speech due to the fact his political beliefs were seen as a threat by many. This event makes Roberta take up the \"Bloodhound\" persona once more.\n\n=== Garcia Lovelace ===\n{{voiced by|[[Kazue Ikura]]|[[Cathy Weseluck]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Garcia Fernando Lovelace'''|\u30ac\u30eb\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30e9\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9|Garushia Ferunando Raburesu}} is the only son of Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace, was heir to the Lovelace family line, and as such, is its current head, the twelfth in succession after his father was assassinated. He was kidnapped for a short while by a Colombian cartel and was transported by the Lagoon Company as \"goods\". He and Roberta left Roanapur shortly afterwards, with some help from Hotel Moscow. He has apparently returned to Roanapur searching for Roberta with a new maid named Fabiola, waiting in a local hotel called the \"Sunken Palace Hotel\" and seemed to have matured greatly in terms of emotional strength, as commented by Rock, since his last appearance. He treats both Roberta and Fabiola as if they were his extended family and in return, both care for him equally. He requests help to find Roberta from Lagoon Company with additional help from Chang, Shenhua, Sawyer, and Lotton. However, the only person he truly trusts in Roanapur is Rock. To stop Roberta, Garcia comes up with the most drastic plan to fake Caxton's death with his own hands, thus taking away Roberta's \"Path of Justice\"; this causes her to hallucinate once more and shoot him. Her consequent horror finally snaps her out of her insanity. In the aftermath, Chang told Rock that the Lovelace family will still have a hard road ahead of them in future.\n\n=== Roberta ===\n{{voiced by|[[Michie Tomizawa]]|[[Tabitha St. Germain]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Roberta'''|\u30ed\u30d9\u30eb\u30bf|Roberuta}} is a Colombian [[maid]] who worked for four years at the Lovelace household in [[Venezuela]]. Although her domestic skills such as cleaning and cooking were poor, she developed a close friendship with the young son of the Lovelace family, Garcia. Roberta was once known as {{nihongo|'''Rosarita Cisneros'''|\u30ed\u30b6\u30ea\u30bf\u30fb\u30c1\u30b9\u30cd\u30ed\u30b9|Rozarita Chisunerosu}}, a former [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] guerrilla trained as an assassin in [[Cuba]] and an internationally wanted criminal.  Balalaika refers her as a \"hardcore terrorist\" to the point that Hotel Moscow had to deploy all their commandos as well as Balalaika getting involved in the situation personally should things get out of hand. Revy refers to her as \"Fucking Four Eyes\" or \"That Fucking Glasses Bitch\". She earned the moniker \"Bloodhound of Florencia\" for her relentless drive to achieve her objectives. Her tormented past and the smell of blood, gunpowder and muck like that of a sewer rat emanating from her was something Revy understood full well.\n\nIn combat, Roberta is a truly fearsome opponent, having trained in a wide variety of martial, stealth, and weapon skills. Among the weapons she has used were a .50 caliber [[Barrett M82]], [[SPAS-12]] shotgun disguised as an umbrella (reinforced with Kevlar), [[machine gun]], and semi-automatic [[grenade launcher]] hidden in a suitcase, [[Trench knife]], and twin IMBEL Model 1911 pistols (see Colt [[M1911 pistol]]s). Her strength, speed, endurance, and instincts were honed to almost [[superhuman]] levels, so much so that Rock at one point refers to her sardonically as \"a killer robot from the future\" (a reference to [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Terminator (series)|Terminator]]'' movies). At one point in the manga she was also described as the only person worthy of inheriting the title \"Jackal\" from [[Carlos the Jackal|Carlos]].\n\nWhile Roberta is one of the most powerful warrior-women in ''Black Lagoon'', she is also highly conscientious. She is unwaveringly devoted to her master and his son, Garcia, whom she loves deeply. Roberta and Revy fight each other, but only to beat themselves up. Rock interferes, but Roberta and Revy tell him to stay out of it. In the manga and anime, the fight ends in a draw right after they punch each other out simultaneously (though Garcia claims she won because she remained conscious). Her kindness can easily change as seen in a humorous omake in Volume 1 of the manga when Garcia slapped her butt in a playful manner, which prompted her to pinch his arm and lift him up off the ground by the skin of his arm as punishment.\n\nShe admitted that she did murder children, women, or anyone in name of revolution during her [[FARC]] years. Disillusioned by the fact that she was merely a tool for the drug cartels in cahoots with [[FARC]], she opted out and joined the Lovelace clan as a maid through her father who was a good friend of Diego Lovelace. Despite being asked by Garcia not to pick up gunfighting anymore, later events in the manga, which depicts her watching helplessly as a bomb was set killing many including Diego Lovelace. Garcia's question of why his father was a victim makes her go into battle again, seeking revenge. Roberta's anger almost pushed her to the limit; she is shown taking mouthfuls of anti-psychotics, and experiencing haunting hallucinations in the form of her past victim (Japanese engineer). She once again stalks the city of Roanapur in search of the one responsible for assassinating her master. Unfortunately, it turns out to be the US Special Forces. Roberta's quest for vengeance has put many of the residents including Hotel Moscow, the Triad, and the Colombian Cartel on high alert as it could mean the end for all of them if their new enemy is the United States. Most of the residents blame the Lagoon Company for attracting her back to Roanapur despite the fact the group was in the dark about the situation and brushed it off as if it were an [[Elvis]] sighting. Further into her quest, she begins to lose sight of her goal, almost returning to her former persona to the point she begins to lose her sanity and has trouble identifying friend and foe, thus almost harming Garcia in the process. The FARC commander even comments that she is no longer the hound they once knew, but a diseased stray wolf searching for purpose. Her oath as the \"Bloodhound of Florencia\" is \"In the name of Santa Maria, a hammer blow of righteousness to all injustice.\"\n\nIn Chapter 73, Roberta is seen with an American woman, presumably Eda, passing through airport security to continue her pursuit of the Americans. She finally catches up with Grey Fox and kills 8-9 soldiers (there were 18 soldiers in three groups: Alpha, Bravo and Charlie), but Caxton himself is shot by Garcia in the hope she will give up her thirst for revenge. A still hallucinating Roberta then reflexively shoots Garcia when he turns his gun on her, but her horror at her attack at last restores her sanity. Garcia's gun is in fact loaded only with blanks, and Caxton survives; Garcia himself suffers only minor injuries.\n\nIn the extra missing pages of chapter 76, she and Garcia kissed and they made up with each other and returns to the Lovelace home. However, in the fifth episode of the OVA, Roberta is severely injured and is confined to a wheelchair as she later regains the ability to walk slowly (she has lost her left arm, her right eye, has a prosthetic foot and ankle, implying her lower right leg has been amputated as well).\n\nIn issue #50 of ''[[Anime Insider]]'' magazine, director [[Sunao Katabuchi]] comments that the animation staff referred Roberta as an \"Evil [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]]\". He goes on to add that creator [[Rei Hiroe]] long thought of Roberta as a kind of \"Death Poppins\".\n\n=== Fabiola Iglesias ===\n{{voiced by|[[Satsuki Yukino]]|[[Shannon Chan-Kent]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Fabiola Iglesias'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30d3\u30aa\u30e9\u30fb\u30a4\u30b0\u30ec\u30b7\u30a2\u30b9|Fabiora Igureshiasu}} is a young maid in the employ of the Lovelace family. She is one of the maids who work as Roberta's subordinates, and the only other combat-trained person among the maids apart from Roberta herself. In combat, she prefers to use two [[MAG-7]]s that were given to her by Roberta. She also carries a pump action [[China Lake NATIC]] (Mistakenly referred to as an [[EX 41 grenade launcher]] in the Manga). She also has heel blades concealed in her shoes. She is the same age with Garcia.\n\nFabiola first appears in the same bar, The Yellow Flag, that Roberta met the Lagoon crew in, panicking everybody with her resemblance to Roberta. However, unlike Roberta, her suitcase is revealed to be filled with lollipops and a lunchbox with [[Scooby Doo (character)|Scooby Doo]] and [[Ranger Smith]] on it. She is currently helping Garcia search for Roberta. She is something of a comic relief when compared with Roberta (whom she calls \"head housemaid\" with the utmost respect), as she is little, carries her grenade launcher concealed in her outfit, and is often prominent in humorous situations; such as her height, being picked up like a bratty little kid, to being made fun of her breast size.\n\nDutch describes her as a \"short version of the Killer Maid\", after she destroys Bao's bar. She states that she comes from the poorest slums of [[Caracas]], where she lived with her ten siblings until she was employed by the Lovelace Family. As noticed by Rock, she does not brawl, being a proficient practitioner of [[capoeira]]. According to her, she and Roberta are the only two maids in the Lovelace house who are proficient in firearms, with Roberta being the better of the two. She also mentions that there are three other maids in the Lovelace house: Karina, Masica and Davia (though it's unknown at this time if they're combat proficient as well). This makes Revy question her \"Just what is the Lovelace plantation like? Full of bad-ass motherfuckers who could storm the Iranian embassy by themselves?\". Fabiola was disgusted at Revy for being heartless and merciless against her foes, with Revy lecturing her that love and friendship do not apply in Roanapur. She and Garcia are reunited with Roberta; but the happiness is short lived when she and Roberta witness Garcia shooting Caxton with a 1911 Colt .45 filled with blanks and in retaliation Roberta shoots Garcia. She and Roberta then tend to a wounded Garcia. On their way back, they encountered Rock and Fabiola gets upset and disgusted with him and shot him with a blank round which injured Rock's ribs for \"gambling with people's lives\". She told Rock they will not meet again and that he shall \"continue to dance with the walking dead in Roanapur.\"\n\nJust like Roberta, Fabiola is very protective of Garcia. She is more brash than her mentor, but not as much as Revy. She tries to attack Chang after seeing him with Garcia, but he easily disarms her without trying. She loves to play in the pool when she's relaxing, but is embarrassed to ask Garcia for a break, despite the fact he is aware of her activities.\n\n== Other characters ==\nThe following are the other characters of this anime:\n\n=== Kageyama ===\n{{voiced by|[[J\u014dji Nakata]]|[[Ross Douglas]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Kageyama'''|\u666f\u5c71|Kageyama}} is one of the department chiefs of Asahi Industries, based in Tokyo. He was entrusted by its [[board of directors]] to ensure that their illegal activities were not exposed. Kageyama betrayed Rock by appointing Captain to kill him and the Lagoon Company, thus encouraging Rock to stay on with the Lagoon Company. Although Kageyama is married and has three children (consisting of one teenage son, one teenage daughter, and one pre-teen daughter), he seems to place more emphasis on his job than on his family.\n\n=== H\u00e4nsel and Gretel ===\nH\u00e4nsel {{voiced by|[[Omi Minami]]|[[Ashleigh Ball (voice actress)|Ashleigh Ball]]}}<br/>\nGretel {{voiced by|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]|[[Jocelyne Loewen]]}}\n\n'''H\u00e4nsel and Gretel''' (also known as Fratele Meu ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"my brother\") and Sora Mea (\"my sister\")) are two Romanian [[twin]] orphans. They were abandoned in a state-run [[orphanage]] as their parents' could not afford  to look after them, following the overthrow of [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], before being sold to black market. As a result of being repeatedly forced to participate in [[Pedophilia|paedophilic]] [[snuff film]]s in which they are either raped or forced to murder other children, and being repeatedly forced to watch the orphanage workers beat children to death, the twins eventually became deranged, sadistic killers. The horrid engrossment with their torturing and murdering for pleasure is shown during the first part of Season 2 when the twins first arrive to Roanupor and  purposely wound one of Balalaika's men during a gunfight, bring him back to their temporary stay with Verrocchio's headquarters, probe his body with sharp objects as a medical experiment, and then drain his body of blood and organs for them to bathe in; afterwards they kill Verrocchio and his men out of indulgence, even though they were supposed to help them escape the city. Unknown to most people, \"H\u00e4nsel\" and \"Gretel\" are actually two personalities alternately adopted by the two children, both of whom suffer from [[dissociative identity disorder]], meaning they swap being \"H\u00e4nsel\" and \"Gretel\" with each other from time to time (it is likely that these were their screen names in the films). There are slight implications that they could be [[incest]]uous, possibly due to the abuse they suffered in the state-run orphanage. It is never made clear of what gender the twins are: in one scene, \"Gretel\" (formerly \"H\u00e4nsel\" before swapping) shows 'her' genitalia to Rock in what she presumably came to believe was a show of gratitude, causing him to flee in disgust and horror at how utterly broken \u201cGretel\u201d was, having known nothing but 'blood and darkness' their whole lives.\n\nIn combat, \"H\u00e4nsel\" wields a sharp [[battle axe]] while \"Gretel\" uses a [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] that appears to be taller than 'she' is. Both also carry additional sidearms. While they were mentally deranged, H\u00e4nsel and Gretel were also cunning, having used two other children as decoys to distract the bounty hunters and using money to distract Eda. They were also not above using their innocent appearance to deceive their enemies.\n\nAs revenge for killing Balalaika's men, H\u00e4nsel is lured into a hunt across the city for Hotel Moscow's forces, until he locates Balalaika herself at a fountain, where he is abruptly shot dead by her snipers. Gretel manages to escape and eventually boards the ''Black Lagoon'' of her own volition. Due to Rock's kindness she takes a genuine liking to him. However, just as Gretel disembarks she is gunned down by the getaway man Dutch contacted, who was bribed by Hotel Moscow. Though initially shocked by her sudden death, Rock is glad that now she and her brother could rest in peace.\n\nThe characters' names are taken from the German fairy tale, ''[[H\u00e4nsel and Gretel]]''. Many of the series' characters compare them to a similar pair of disturbed, sadistic twins from the American film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. In the manga, the song sung by Gretel to Rock on the Black Lagoon is called \"[[Midnight, the Stars and You]]\", the song used in the ending credits to ''The Shining''. In the anime, she sings \"The World of Midnight\", made for the anime and sung by Minako Obata.\n\n=== Greenback Jane ===\n{{voiced by|[[Miki Nagasawa]]|[[Kelly Sheridan]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Janet Bhai'''|\u30b8\u30e3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30a4\u30fc|Janetto B\u0101\u012b}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Greenback Jane'''|\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3|J\u0113n}}, is a professional money [[counterfeit]]er and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] from [[India]]. She served as the leader for her project team, which was spread around the world but was connected thanks to the internet, and is quite knowledgeable on the details of the [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]]. Coincidentally, she falls in love with Benny after he displays his hacking skills. Janet currently seems to be having an [[internet romance]] with Benny. One of the running gags of her story arc is her clumsiness and poor luck, which usually result in her being subject to a [[pantyshot]]. After the Lovelace incident, Janet returns to Roanapur searching out Benny and the team. She, with help of her counterfeiting group, hacks a server of the \"Rainbach AG\" Corporation and makes a scapegoat of a [[People's Liberation Army|PLA spy]]. Jane is apparently a [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]], though Benny calls it \"a bit broad-minded as far as sex goes\". Revy replies that \"if that's \"a bit\", then [[Death Valley]] is a sand pit in a park\".<ref>Chapter 81, Page 5</ref>\n\n=== Russell ===\n{{voiced by|[[Masaki Terasoma]]|[[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''\"Groovy\" Guy Russell'''|\u201c\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30f4\u30a3\u30fb\u30ac\u30a4\u201d\u30fb\u30e9\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb|\"Gur\u016bvi Gai\" Rasseru}} is a middle-aged [[United States|American]] man who works for the Florida crime syndicate that's tracking Jane. He is quite distinguishable, since he dresses like a [[cowboy]]: he has the trademark [[cowboy hat|hat]], [[cowboy boots|boots]] with spurs, a [[revolver]] at the hip, [[bandolier]] belt, tan shirt and jeans. He is not taken serious by the other bounty hunters because he is an outsider. Even Shenhua says, \"Cowboy, this no Florida\", meaning that he is in over his head. However, his skills are shown to be more than everyone thought, when he is the last bounty hunter left in the hunt for Jane and he duels Eda on board the Lagoon. It is then later revealed that he and Eda have met previously in the United States, but Eda says they have never met. Shortly before killing him, she confesses to him to be from the CIA.\n\n=== Vasili Laptev ===\n{{voiced by|[[Toshihiko Kojima]]|[[Ted Cole]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Vasili Laptev'''|\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30fb\u30e9\u30d7\u30c1\u30a7\u30d5|Vashiri Rapuchefu}} is the boss of a branch of the [[Russian mafia]] that is based in Tokyo. A former [[KGB]] officer, Laptev had many difficulties operating in Japan due to his status as a ''[[gaijin]]'' (foreigner). Considered distasteful and incompetent by Balalaika, he appeared to lose his standing with his peers back in Russia and this was reflected in his arrogant personality, since he did not speak Japanese despite being based in Japan. Laptev's detachment is slaughtered single-handedly by Ginji when the fallout between Hotel Moscow and the Washimine-gumi begins.\n\n=== Masami Kousa ===\n{{voiced by|Masahiro Tanaka|[[Andrew Kavadas]]}}\n\nHead of the Kousa Council. In past both Washimine and Kousa Yakuza's were allies as Yukio's father and Masami's \"brother\" were blood brothers.
