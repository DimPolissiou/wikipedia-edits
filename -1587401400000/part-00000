Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and [[Music download|digital]]), [[airplay|radio play]], and [[Music streaming|online streaming]] in the United States.\n\nThe weekly tracking period for sales was initially Monday to Sunday when [[Nielsen Holdings PLC|Nielsen]] started tracking sales in 1991, but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015. This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data. Radio airplay, which, unlike sales figures and streaming, is readily available on a real-time basis, is tracked on a Monday to Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday to Tuesday).<ref name=\"tracking\">{{cite news|authors=''Billboard'' Staff|title=Billboard to Alter Chart Tracking Week for Global Release Date|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6605842/billboard-alter-chart-tracking-week-global-release-date|work=Billboard|date=June 24, 2015| accessdate=June 24, 2015}}</ref> A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by ''Billboard'' on Tuesdays.\n\nThe first number one song of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 was \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" by [[Ricky Nelson]], on August 4, 1958. As of the issue for the week ending on April 25, 2020, the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 has had 1,098 different number one entries. The chart's current number-one song is \"[[Blinding Lights]]\" by [[The Weeknd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9361802/weeknd-blinding-lights-three-weeks-number-one-hot-100|titleThe Weeknd Returns to No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100, Doja Cat Hits Top 5, Post Malone Ties Top 10 Record|work=Billboard|last=Trust|first=Gary||date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to 1955, ''Billboard''{{'}}s lead popularity chart was the ''Honor Roll of Hits'', established in 1945.

This chart ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores, as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country (20 to 50 positions).\n* ''Most Played by Jockeys'' was ''Billboard''{{'}}s original airplay chart. It ranked the most played songs on United States radio stations, as reported by radio disc jockeys and radio stations (20 to 25 positions).\n* ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' ranked the most played songs in [[jukebox]]es across the United States (20 positions). This was one of the main outlets of measuring song popularity with the younger generation of music listeners, as many radio stations resisted adding [[rock and roll]] music to their playlists for many years.\n\nAlthough officially all three charts had equal \"weight\" in terms of their importance, Billboard Magazine considers the ''Best Sellers in Stores'' chart when referencing a song's performance prior to the creation of the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|title=CHART BEAT CHAT 12/2/2005|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60472/chart-beat-chat|website=billboard.com|publisher=Billboard Music|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=2 December 2005|quote=The main chart was Best Sellers in Stores, and that's the list Billboard uses as THE pre-Hot 100 chart.}}</ref> On the week ending November 12, 1955, ''Billboard'' published '''The Top 100''' for the first time. ''The Top 100'' combined all aspects of a single's performance (sales, airplay and jukebox activity), based on a point system that typically gave sales (purchases) more weight than radio airplay. The ''Best Sellers In Stores'', ''Most Played by Jockeys'' and ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' charts continued to be published concurrently with the new ''Top 100'' chart.\n\nOn June 17, 1957, ''Billboard'' discontinued the ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' chart, as the popularity of jukeboxes waned and radio stations incorporated more and more rock-oriented music into their playlists. The week ending July 28, 1958 was the final publication of the ''Most Played by Jockeys'' and ''Top 100'' charts, both of which had [[Perez Prado]]'s instrumental version of \"[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\" ascending to the top.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOn August 4, 1958, ''Billboard'' premiered one main all-genre singles chart: the ''Hot 100''. The Hot 100 quickly became the industry standard and ''Billboard'' discontinued the ''Best Sellers In Stores'' chart on October 13, 1958.\n\nThe ''Billboard'' Hot 100 is still the standard by which a song's popularity is measured in the United States. The Hot 100 is ranked by radio airplay audience impressions as measured by Nielsen BDS, sales data compiled by [[Nielsen SoundScan|Nielsen Soundscan]] (both at retail and digitally) and streaming activity provided by online music sources.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nThere are several component charts that contribute to the overall calculation of the Hot 100. The most significant ones are:\n\n* ''[[Hot 100 Airplay]]'': ''(per Billboard)'' approximately 1,000 stations, \"composed of [[adult contemporary]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Country music|country]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] and [[Christian music|Christian]] formats, digitally monitored twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Charts are ranked by number of gross audience impressions, computed by cross-referencing exact times of radio airplay with [[Arbitron]] listener data.\"\n* ''Hot Singles Sales'': ''(per Billboard)'' \"the top selling singles compiled from a national sample of retail store, mass merchant and internet sales reports collected, compiled, and provided by [[Nielsen SoundScan]].\" The chart is released weekly and measures sales of physical commercial singles. With the decline in sales of physical singles in the US, many songs that become number one on this chart often do not even chart on the Hot 100.\n* ''[[Digital Songs]]'': Digital sales are tracked by Nielsen SoundScan and are included as part of a title's sales points.\n* ''[[Streaming Songs]]'': a collaboration between ''Billboard'', Nielsen SoundScan and [[National Association of Recording Merchandisers]] which measures the top streamed radio songs, on-demand songs and videos on leading online music services.\n\n== Compilation ==\n\nThe tracking week for sales and streaming begins on Friday and ends on Thursday, while the radio play tracking-week runs from Monday to Sunday. A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by ''Billboard'' on Tuesday. Each chart is post-dated with the \"week-ending\" issue date four days after the charts are refreshed online (i.e., the following Saturday).<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8071011/billboard-chart-magazine-dates-release-week-change|title=Billboard Chart & Magazine Dates Now to Align Closer to Release Week|magazine=Billboard|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref> For example:\n\n*Friday, January 1 \u2013 sales tracking-week begins, streaming tracking-week begins\n*Monday, January 4 \u2013 airplay tracking-week begins\n*Thursday, January 7 \u2013 sales tracking-week ends, streaming tracking-week ends\n*Sunday, January 10 \u2013 airplay tracking-week ends\n*Tuesday, January 12 \u2013 new chart released, with issue post-dated Saturday, January 16\n\n== Policy changes ==\n\nThe methods and policies by which this data is obtained and compiled have changed many times throughout the chart's history.\n\nAlthough the advent of a singles music chart spawned chart historians and chart-watchers and greatly affected [[popular culture|pop culture]] and produced countless bits of trivia, the main purpose of the Hot 100 is to aid those within the music industry: to reflect the popularity of the \"product\" (the singles, the albums, etc.) and to track the trends of the buying public. ''Billboard'' has (many times) changed its methodology and policies to give the most precise and accurate reflection of what is popular. A very basic example of this would be the ratio given to sales and airplay. During the Hot 100's early history, singles were the leading way by which people bought music. At times, when singles sales were robust, more weight was given to a song's retail points than to its radio airplay.\n\nAs the decades passed, the recording industry concentrated more on album sales than singles sales. Musicians eventually expressed their creative output in the form of full-length albums rather than singles, and by the 1990s many record companies stopped releasing singles altogether (see ''Album Cuts'', below). Eventually, a song's airplay points were weighted more so than its sales. ''Billboard'' has adjusted the sales/airplay ratio many times to more accurately reflect the true popularity of songs.\n\n=== Double-sided singles ===\n\n''Billboard'' has also changed its Hot 100 policy regarding \"two-sided singles\" several times. The pre-Hot 100 chart \"Best Sellers in Stores\" listed popular A- and-B-sides together, with the side that was played most often (based on its other charts) listed first. One of the most notable of these, but far from the only one, was [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"Don't Be Cruel\" / \"Hound Dog\". During the Presley single's chart run, top billing was switched back and forth between the two sides several times. But on the concurrent \"Most Played in Juke Boxes\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\" and the \"Top 100\", the two songs were listed separately, as was true of all songs. With the initiation of the Hot 100 in 1958, A- and-B-sides charted separately, as they had on the former Top 100.\n\nStarting with the Hot 100 chart for the week ending November 29, 1969, this rule was altered; if both sides received significant airplay, they were listed together. This started to become a moot point by 1972, as most major record labels solidified a trend they had started in the 1960s by putting the same song on both sides of the singles provided to radio.\n\nMore complex issues began to arise as the typical A-and-B-side format of singles gave way to [[12 inch singles]] and maxi-singles, many of which contained more than one B-side. Further problems arose when, in several cases, a B-side would eventually overtake the A-side in popularity, thus prompting record labels to release a new single, featuring the former B-side as the A-side, along with a \"new\" B-side.\n\nThe inclusion of album cuts on the Hot 100 put the double-sided hit issues to rest permanently.\n\n=== Album cuts ===\n\nAs many Hot 100 chart policies have been modified over the years, one rule always remained constant: songs were not eligible to enter the Hot 100 unless they were available to purchase as a single. However, on December 5, 1998, the Hot 100 changed from being a \"singles\" chart to a \"songs\" chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer|title=How The Hot 100 Became America's Hit Barometer|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-08-01|accessdate=2017-08-02}}</ref> During the 1990s, a growing trend in the music industry was to promote songs to radio without ever releasing them as singles. It was claimed by major record labels that singles were cannibalizing album sales, so they were slowly phased out. During this period, accusations began to fly of chart manipulation as labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its absolute peak, thus prompting a top ten or, in some cases, a number one debut. In many cases, a label would delete a single from its catalog after only one week, thus allowing the song to enter the Hot 100, make a high debut and then slowly decline in position as the one-time production of the retail single sold out.\n\nIt was during this period that several popular mainstream hits never charted on the Hot 100, or charted well after their airplay had declined. During the period that they were not released as singles, the songs were not eligible to chart. Many of these songs dominated the ''Hot 100 Airplay'' chart for extended periods of time:\n\n* 1995 [[The Rembrandts]]: \"[[I'll Be There for You (The Rembrandts song)|I'll Be There for You]]\" (number one for eight weeks)\n* 1996 [[No Doubt]]: \"[[Don't Speak]]\" (number one for 16 weeks)\n* 1997 [[Sugar Ray]] featuring [[Super Cat]]: \"[[Fly (Sugar Ray song)|Fly]]\" (number one for six weeks)\n* 1997 [[Will Smith]]: \"[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]\" (number one for four weeks)\n* 1997 [[The Cardigans]]: \"[[Lovefool]]\" (number two for eight weeks)\n* 1998 [[Natalie Imbruglia]]: \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)#Natalie Imbruglia version|Torn]]\" (number one for 11 weeks)\n* 1998 [[Goo Goo Dolls]]: \"[[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Iris]]\" (number one for 18 weeks)\n\nAs debate and conflicts occurred more and more often, ''Billboard'' finally answered the requests of music industry artists and insiders by including airplay-only singles (or \"album cuts\") in the Hot 100.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n[[Extended play]] (EP) releases were listed by ''Billboard'' on the Hot 100 and in pre-Hot 100 charts (Top 100) until the mid-to-late 1960s. With the growing popularity of albums, it was decided to move EPs (which typically contain four to six tracks) from the Hot 100 to the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where they are included to this day.\n\n=== Digital downloads and online streaming ===\nSince February 12, 2005, the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 tracks paid digital downloads from such internet services as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], [[Musicmatch]], and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]. ''Billboard'' initially started tracking downloads in 2003 with the [[Hot Digital Tracks]] chart. However, these downloads did not count towards the Hot 100 and that chart (as opposed to [[Hot Digital Songs]]) counted each version of a song separately (the chart still exists today along with Hot Digital Songs). This was the first major overhaul of the Hot 100's chart formula since December 1998.\n\nThe change in methodology has shaken up the chart considerably, with some songs debuting on the chart strictly with robust online sales and others making drastic leaps. In recent years, several songs have been able to achieve 80-to-90 position jumps in a single week as their digital components were made available at online music stores. Since 2006, the all-time record for the biggest single-week upward movement was broken nine times.\n\nIn the issue dated August 11, 2007, Billboard began incorporating weekly data from [[streaming media]] and on-demand services into the Hot 100. The first two major companies to provide their statistics to Nielsen BDS on a weekly basis were [[AOL]] Music and [[Yahoo! Music]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Geoff |last=Mayfield |title=Billboard Hot 100 To Include Digital Streams |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050326/billboard-hot-100-to-include-digital-streams |work=Billboard |date=August 4, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref> On March 24, 2012, Billboard premiered its [[On-Demand Songs]] chart, and its data was incorporated into the equation that compiles the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/502020/hot-100-impacted-by-new-on-demand-songs-chart|work=Billboard|title=Hot 100 Impacted by New On-Demand Songs Chart|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref> This was expanded to a broader [[Streaming Songs]] chart in January 2013, which ranks web radio streams from services such as [[Spotify]], as well as on-demand audio titles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1510640/new-danceelectronic-songs-chart-launches-with-william-britney-at-no-1|work=Billboard|title=New Dance/Electronic Songs Chart Launches With Will.i.am & Britney at No. 1|first=Silvio|last=Pietroluongo|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> In February 2013, U.S. views for a song on [[YouTube]] were added to the Hot 100 formula. \"[[Harlem Shake (song)|Harlem Shake]]\" was the first song to reach number one after the changes were made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sisario|first=Ben|title=What's Billboard's No. 1?

Under normal circumstances, airplay points from a song's album version, \"radio\" mix and/or [[dance music]] remix, etc. were all combined and factored into the song's performance on the Hot 100, as the structure, lyrics and melody remained intact. Criticisms began when songs were being completely re-recorded to the point that they no longer resembled the original recording. The first such example of this scenario is [[Jennifer Lopez]]' \"[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]\". Originally entering the Hot 100 in its album version, a \"remix\" was issued in the midst of its chart run that featured rapper [[Ja Rule]]. This new version proved to be far more popular than\nthe album version and the track was propelled to number one.\n\nTo address this issue, ''Billboard'' now separates airplay points from a song's original version and its remix, if the remix is determined to be a \"new song\". Since administering this new chart rule, several songs have charted twice, normally credited as \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\". The remix rule is still in place.\n\n=== Recurrents ===\n\n''Billboard'', in an effort to allow the chart to remain as current as possible and to give proper representation to new and developing artists and tracks, has (since 1991) removed titles that have reached certain criteria regarding its current rank and number of weeks on the chart. Recurrent criteria have been modified several times and currently ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}), a song is permanently moved to \"recurrent status\" if it has spent 20 weeks on the Hot 100 and fallen below position number 50. Additionally, descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below number 25 after 52 weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6770427/adele-tops-hot-100-fourth-week-justin-bieber-alessia-cara|work=Billboard|title=Adele Tops Hot 100 for Fourth Week; Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara Hit Top 10|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}</ref> Exceptions are made to re-releases and sudden resurgence in popularity of tracks that have taken a very long time to gain mainstream success. These rare cases are handled on a case-by-case basis and ultimately determined by ''Billboard''{{'}}s chart managers and staff. Christmas songs have been a regular presence on the Hot 100 each December since the relaxation of recurrent rules, culminating in [[Mariah Carey]]'s 1994 recording \"[[All I Want for Christmas is You]]\" reaching #1 on the chart in December 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wish Come True: Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' Hits No. 1 on Hot 100 After 25-Year Wait |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546418/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-number-one |website=Billboard |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Adjustment of tracking week===\n''Billboard'' altered its tracking-week for sales, streaming and radio airplay in order to conform to a new Global Release Date, which now falls on Fridays in all major-market territories (United States product was formerly released on Tuesdays prior to June 2015). This modified tracking schedule took effect in the issue dated July 25, 2015.<ref name=\"tracking\"/>\n\n== Year-end charts ==\n\n''Billboard''{{'}}s \"chart year\" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for ''Billboard'' to calculate [[Billboard Year-End|year-end charts]] and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December.\n\nPrior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end singles charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on a song's performance on the Hot 100 (for example, a song would be given one point for a week spent at position 100, two points for a week spent at position 99 and so forth, up to 100 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its year-end total.\n\nAfter ''Billboard'' began obtaining sales and airplay information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales, streaming, and airplay points. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's most popular tracks, as the points accrued by one song during its week at number one in March might be less than those accrued by another song reaching number three in January. Songs at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years, but often are ranked lower than they would have been had the peak occurred in a single year.\n\n== Use in media ==\n\nThe Hot 100 served for many years as the data source for the weekly radio countdown show ''[[American Top 40]]''. This relationship ended on November 30, 1991, as ''American Top 40'' started using the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|airplay-only side of the Hot 100]] (then called '''Top 40 Radio Monitor'''). The ongoing splintering of [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 radio]] in the early 1990s led stations to lean into specific formats, meaning that practically no station would play the wide array of genres that typically composed each weekly Hot 100 chart.\n\nAn artist or band's ability to have hits in the Hot 100 across multiple decades is recognized as a sign of longevity and being able to adapt to changing musical styles. As of November 2019, only five artists have had a Hot 100 Top 40 hit in each of the last four decades: [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (artist)|Madonna]], [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], [[U2]], and [[Kenny G]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542554/kenny-g-top-40-hits-four-decades-kanye-west-use-this-gospel | title = Thanks to Kanye, Kenny G Is Just the Fifth Act With Hot 100 Top 40 Hits in Each of the Last Four Decades | first = Gary | last = Trust | date = November 4, 2019 | accessdate = November 6, 2019 | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref>\n\n== Similar charts ==\n\nA new chart, the [[Pop 100]], was created by ''Billboard'' in February 2005 to answer criticism that the Hot 100 was biased in favor of [[Rhythmic Top 40|rhythmic]] songs, as throughout most of its existence, the Hot 100 was seen predominantly as a pop chart. It was discontinued in June 2009 due to the charts becoming increasingly similar.\n\nThe [[Canadian Hot 100]] was launched June 16, 2007.

Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and [[Music download|digital]]), [[airplay|radio play]], and [[Music streaming|online streaming]] in the United States.\n\nThe weekly tracking period for sales was initially Monday to Sunday when [[Nielsen Holdings PLC|Nielsen]] started tracking sales in 1991, but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015. This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data. Radio airplay, which, unlike sales figures and streaming, is readily available on a real-time basis, is tracked on a Monday to Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday to Tuesday).<ref name=\"tracking\">{{cite news|authors=''Billboard'' Staff|title=Billboard to Alter Chart Tracking Week for Global Release Date|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6605842/billboard-alter-chart-tracking-week-global-release-date|work=Billboard|date=June 24, 2015| accessdate=June 24, 2015}}</ref> A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by ''Billboard'' on Tuesdays.\n\nThe first number one song of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 was \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" by [[Ricky Nelson]], on August 4, 1958. As of the issue for the week ending on April 25, 2020, the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 has had 1,098 different number one entries. The chart's current number-one song is \"[[Blinding Lights]]\" by [[The Weeknd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9361802/weeknd-blinding-lights-three-weeks-number-one-hot-100|titleThe Weeknd Returns to No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100, Doja Cat Hits Top 5, Post Malone Ties Top 10 Record|work=Billboard|last=Trust|first=Gary||date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref\n\n== History ==\nPrior to 1955, ''Billboard''{{'}}s lead popularity chart was the ''Honor Roll of Hits'', established in 1945.

This chart ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores, as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country (20 to 50 positions).\n* ''Most Played by Jockeys'' was ''Billboard''{{'}}s original airplay chart. It ranked the most played songs on United States radio stations, as reported by radio disc jockeys and radio stations (20 to 25 positions).\n* ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' ranked the most played songs in [[jukebox]]es across the United States (20 positions). This was one of the main outlets of measuring song popularity with the younger generation of music listeners, as many radio stations resisted adding [[rock and roll]] music to their playlists for many years.\n\nAlthough officially all three charts had equal \"weight\" in terms of their importance, Billboard Magazine considers the ''Best Sellers in Stores'' chart when referencing a song's performance prior to the creation of the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|title=CHART BEAT CHAT 12/2/2005|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60472/chart-beat-chat|website=billboard.com|publisher=Billboard Music|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=2 December 2005|quote=The main chart was Best Sellers in Stores, and that's the list Billboard uses as THE pre-Hot 100 chart.}}</ref> On the week ending November 12, 1955, ''Billboard'' published '''The Top 100''' for the first time. ''The Top 100'' combined all aspects of a single's performance (sales, airplay and jukebox activity), based on a point system that typically gave sales (purchases) more weight than radio airplay. The ''Best Sellers In Stores'', ''Most Played by Jockeys'' and ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' charts continued to be published concurrently with the new ''Top 100'' chart.\n\nOn June 17, 1957, ''Billboard'' discontinued the ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' chart, as the popularity of jukeboxes waned and radio stations incorporated more and more rock-oriented music into their playlists. The week ending July 28, 1958 was the final publication of the ''Most Played by Jockeys'' and ''Top 100'' charts, both of which had [[Perez Prado]]'s instrumental version of \"[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\" ascending to the top.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOn August 4, 1958, ''Billboard'' premiered one main all-genre singles chart: the ''Hot 100''. The Hot 100 quickly became the industry standard and ''Billboard'' discontinued the ''Best Sellers In Stores'' chart on October 13, 1958.\n\nThe ''Billboard'' Hot 100 is still the standard by which a song's popularity is measured in the United States. The Hot 100 is ranked by radio airplay audience impressions as measured by Nielsen BDS, sales data compiled by [[Nielsen SoundScan|Nielsen Soundscan]] (both at retail and digitally) and streaming activity provided by online music sources.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\nThere are several component charts that contribute to the overall calculation of the Hot 100. The most significant ones are:\n\n* ''[[Hot 100 Airplay]]'': ''(per Billboard)'' approximately 1,000 stations, \"composed of [[adult contemporary]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Country music|country]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] and [[Christian music|Christian]] formats, digitally monitored twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Charts are ranked by number of gross audience impressions, computed by cross-referencing exact times of radio airplay with [[Arbitron]] listener data.\"\n* ''Hot Singles Sales'': ''(per Billboard)'' \"the top selling singles compiled from a national sample of retail store, mass merchant and internet sales reports collected, compiled, and provided by [[Nielsen SoundScan]].\" The chart is released weekly and measures sales of physical commercial singles. With the decline in sales of physical singles in the US, many songs that become number one on this chart often do not even chart on the Hot 100.\n* ''[[Digital Songs]]'': Digital sales are tracked by Nielsen SoundScan and are included as part of a title's sales points.\n* ''[[Streaming Songs]]'': a collaboration between ''Billboard'', Nielsen SoundScan and [[National Association of Recording Merchandisers]] which measures the top streamed radio songs, on-demand songs and videos on leading online music services.\n\n== Compilation ==\n\nThe tracking week for sales and streaming begins on Friday and ends on Thursday, while the radio play tracking-week runs from Monday to Sunday. A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by ''Billboard'' on Tuesday. Each chart is post-dated with the \"week-ending\" issue date four days after the charts are refreshed online (i.e., the following Saturday).<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8071011/billboard-chart-magazine-dates-release-week-change|title=Billboard Chart & Magazine Dates Now to Align Closer to Release Week|magazine=Billboard|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref> For example:\n\n*Friday, January 1 \u2013 sales tracking-week begins, streaming tracking-week begins\n*Monday, January 4 \u2013 airplay tracking-week begins\n*Thursday, January 7 \u2013 sales tracking-week ends, streaming tracking-week ends\n*Sunday, January 10 \u2013 airplay tracking-week ends\n*Tuesday, January 12 \u2013 new chart released, with issue post-dated Saturday, January 16\n\n== Policy changes ==\n\nThe methods and policies by which this data is obtained and compiled have changed many times throughout the chart's history.\n\nAlthough the advent of a singles music chart spawned chart historians and chart-watchers and greatly affected [[popular culture|pop culture]] and produced countless bits of trivia, the main purpose of the Hot 100 is to aid those within the music industry: to reflect the popularity of the \"product\" (the singles, the albums, etc.) and to track the trends of the buying public. ''Billboard'' has (many times) changed its methodology and policies to give the most precise and accurate reflection of what is popular. A very basic example of this would be the ratio given to sales and airplay. During the Hot 100's early history, singles were the leading way by which people bought music. At times, when singles sales were robust, more weight was given to a song's retail points than to its radio airplay.\n\nAs the decades passed, the recording industry concentrated more on album sales than singles sales. Musicians eventually expressed their creative output in the form of full-length albums rather than singles, and by the 1990s many record companies stopped releasing singles altogether (see ''Album Cuts'', below). Eventually, a song's airplay points were weighted more so than its sales. ''Billboard'' has adjusted the sales/airplay ratio many times to more accurately reflect the true popularity of songs.\n\n=== Double-sided singles ===\n\n''Billboard'' has also changed its Hot 100 policy regarding \"two-sided singles\" several times. The pre-Hot 100 chart \"Best Sellers in Stores\" listed popular A- and-B-sides together, with the side that was played most often (based on its other charts) listed first. One of the most notable of these, but far from the only one, was [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"Don't Be Cruel\" / \"Hound Dog\". During the Presley single's chart run, top billing was switched back and forth between the two sides several times. But on the concurrent \"Most Played in Juke Boxes\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\" and the \"Top 100\", the two songs were listed separately, as was true of all songs. With the initiation of the Hot 100 in 1958, A- and-B-sides charted separately, as they had on the former Top 100.\n\nStarting with the Hot 100 chart for the week ending November 29, 1969, this rule was altered; if both sides received significant airplay, they were listed together. This started to become a moot point by 1972, as most major record labels solidified a trend they had started in the 1960s by putting the same song on both sides of the singles provided to radio.\n\nMore complex issues began to arise as the typical A-and-B-side format of singles gave way to [[12 inch singles]] and maxi-singles, many of which contained more than one B-side. Further problems arose when, in several cases, a B-side would eventually overtake the A-side in popularity, thus prompting record labels to release a new single, featuring the former B-side as the A-side, along with a \"new\" B-side.\n\nThe inclusion of album cuts on the Hot 100 put the double-sided hit issues to rest permanently.\n\n=== Album cuts ===\n\nAs many Hot 100 chart policies have been modified over the years, one rule always remained constant: songs were not eligible to enter the Hot 100 unless they were available to purchase as a single. However, on December 5, 1998, the Hot 100 changed from being a \"singles\" chart to a \"songs\" chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer|title=How The Hot 100 Became America's Hit Barometer|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-08-01|accessdate=2017-08-02}}</ref> During the 1990s, a growing trend in the music industry was to promote songs to radio without ever releasing them as singles. It was claimed by major record labels that singles were cannibalizing album sales, so they were slowly phased out. During this period, accusations began to fly of chart manipulation as labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its absolute peak, thus prompting a top ten or, in some cases, a number one debut. In many cases, a label would delete a single from its catalog after only one week, thus allowing the song to enter the Hot 100, make a high debut and then slowly decline in position as the one-time production of the retail single sold out.\n\nIt was during this period that several popular mainstream hits never charted on the Hot 100, or charted well after their airplay had declined. During the period that they were not released as singles, the songs were not eligible to chart. Many of these songs dominated the ''Hot 100 Airplay'' chart for extended periods of time:\n\n* 1995 [[The Rembrandts]]: \"[[I'll Be There for You (The Rembrandts song)|I'll Be There for You]]\" (number one for eight weeks)\n* 1996 [[No Doubt]]: \"[[Don't Speak]]\" (number one for 16 weeks)\n* 1997 [[Sugar Ray]] featuring [[Super Cat]]: \"[[Fly (Sugar Ray song)|Fly]]\" (number one for six weeks)\n* 1997 [[Will Smith]]: \"[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]\" (number one for four weeks)\n* 1997 [[The Cardigans]]: \"[[Lovefool]]\" (number two for eight weeks)\n* 1998 [[Natalie Imbruglia]]: \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)#Natalie Imbruglia version|Torn]]\" (number one for 11 weeks)\n* 1998 [[Goo Goo Dolls]]: \"[[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Iris]]\" (number one for 18 weeks)\n\nAs debate and conflicts occurred more and more often, ''Billboard'' finally answered the requests of music industry artists and insiders by including airplay-only singles (or \"album cuts\") in the Hot 100.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n[[Extended play]] (EP) releases were listed by ''Billboard'' on the Hot 100 and in pre-Hot 100 charts (Top 100) until the mid-to-late 1960s. With the growing popularity of albums, it was decided to move EPs (which typically contain four to six tracks) from the Hot 100 to the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where they are included to this day.\n\n=== Digital downloads and online streaming ===\nSince February 12, 2005, the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 tracks paid digital downloads from such internet services as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], [[Musicmatch]], and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]. ''Billboard'' initially started tracking downloads in 2003 with the [[Hot Digital Tracks]] chart. However, these downloads did not count towards the Hot 100 and that chart (as opposed to [[Hot Digital Songs]]) counted each version of a song separately (the chart still exists today along with Hot Digital Songs). This was the first major overhaul of the Hot 100's chart formula since December 1998.\n\nThe change in methodology has shaken up the chart considerably, with some songs debuting on the chart strictly with robust online sales and others making drastic leaps. In recent years, several songs have been able to achieve 80-to-90 position jumps in a single week as their digital components were made available at online music stores. Since 2006, the all-time record for the biggest single-week upward movement was broken nine times.\n\nIn the issue dated August 11, 2007, Billboard began incorporating weekly data from [[streaming media]] and on-demand services into the Hot 100. The first two major companies to provide their statistics to Nielsen BDS on a weekly basis were [[AOL]] Music and [[Yahoo! Music]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Geoff |last=Mayfield |title=Billboard Hot 100 To Include Digital Streams |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050326/billboard-hot-100-to-include-digital-streams |work=Billboard |date=August 4, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref> On March 24, 2012, Billboard premiered its [[On-Demand Songs]] chart, and its data was incorporated into the equation that compiles the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/502020/hot-100-impacted-by-new-on-demand-songs-chart|work=Billboard|title=Hot 100 Impacted by New On-Demand Songs Chart|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref> This was expanded to a broader [[Streaming Songs]] chart in January 2013, which ranks web radio streams from services such as [[Spotify]], as well as on-demand audio titles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1510640/new-danceelectronic-songs-chart-launches-with-william-britney-at-no-1|work=Billboard|title=New Dance/Electronic Songs Chart Launches With Will.i.am & Britney at No. 1|first=Silvio|last=Pietroluongo|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> In February 2013, U.S. views for a song on [[YouTube]] were added to the Hot 100 formula. \"[[Harlem Shake (song)|Harlem Shake]]\" was the first song to reach number one after the changes were made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sisario|first=Ben|title=What's Billboard's No. 1?

Under normal circumstances, airplay points from a song's album version, \"radio\" mix and/or [[dance music]] remix, etc. were all combined and factored into the song's performance on the Hot 100, as the structure, lyrics and melody remained intact. Criticisms began when songs were being completely re-recorded to the point that they no longer resembled the original recording. The first such example of this scenario is [[Jennifer Lopez]]' \"[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]\". Originally entering the Hot 100 in its album version, a \"remix\" was issued in the midst of its chart run that featured rapper [[Ja Rule]]. This new version proved to be far more popular than\nthe album version and the track was propelled to number one.\n\nTo address this issue, ''Billboard'' now separates airplay points from a song's original version and its remix, if the remix is determined to be a \"new song\". Since administering this new chart rule, several songs have charted twice, normally credited as \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\". The remix rule is still in place.\n\n=== Recurrents ===\n\n''Billboard'', in an effort to allow the chart to remain as current as possible and to give proper representation to new and developing artists and tracks, has (since 1991) removed titles that have reached certain criteria regarding its current rank and number of weeks on the chart. Recurrent criteria have been modified several times and currently ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}), a song is permanently moved to \"recurrent status\" if it has spent 20 weeks on the Hot 100 and fallen below position number 50. Additionally, descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below number 25 after 52 weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6770427/adele-tops-hot-100-fourth-week-justin-bieber-alessia-cara|work=Billboard|title=Adele Tops Hot 100 for Fourth Week; Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara Hit Top 10|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}</ref> Exceptions are made to re-releases and sudden resurgence in popularity of tracks that have taken a very long time to gain mainstream success. These rare cases are handled on a case-by-case basis and ultimately determined by ''Billboard''{{'}}s chart managers and staff. Christmas songs have been a regular presence on the Hot 100 each December since the relaxation of recurrent rules, culminating in [[Mariah Carey]]'s 1994 recording \"[[All I Want for Christmas is You]]\" reaching #1 on the chart in December 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wish Come True: Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' Hits No. 1 on Hot 100 After 25-Year Wait |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546418/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-number-one |website=Billboard |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Adjustment of tracking week===\n''Billboard'' altered its tracking-week for sales, streaming and radio airplay in order to conform to a new Global Release Date, which now falls on Fridays in all major-market territories (United States product was formerly released on Tuesdays prior to June 2015). This modified tracking schedule took effect in the issue dated July 25, 2015.<ref name=\"tracking\"/>\n\n== Year-end charts ==\n\n''Billboard''{{'}}s \"chart year\" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for ''Billboard'' to calculate [[Billboard Year-End|year-end charts]] and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December.\n\nPrior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end singles charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on a song's performance on the Hot 100 (for example, a song would be given one point for a week spent at position 100, two points for a week spent at position 99 and so forth, up to 100 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its year-end total.\n\nAfter ''Billboard'' began obtaining sales and airplay information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales, streaming, and airplay points. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's most popular tracks, as the points accrued by one song during its week at number one in March might be less than those accrued by another song reaching number three in January. Songs at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years, but often are ranked lower than they would have been had the peak occurred in a single year.\n\n== Use in media ==\n\nThe Hot 100 served for many years as the data source for the weekly radio countdown show ''[[American Top 40]]''. This relationship ended on November 30, 1991, as ''American Top 40'' started using the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|airplay-only side of the Hot 100]] (then called '''Top 40 Radio Monitor'''). The ongoing splintering of [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 radio]] in the early 1990s led stations to lean into specific formats, meaning that practically no station would play the wide array of genres that typically composed each weekly Hot 100 chart.\n\nAn artist or band's ability to have hits in the Hot 100 across multiple decades is recognized as a sign of longevity and being able to adapt to changing musical styles. As of November 2019, only five artists have had a Hot 100 Top 40 hit in each of the last four decades: [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (artist)|Madonna]], [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], [[U2]], and [[Kenny G]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542554/kenny-g-top-40-hits-four-decades-kanye-west-use-this-gospel | title = Thanks to Kanye, Kenny G Is Just the Fifth Act With Hot 100 Top 40 Hits in Each of the Last Four Decades | first = Gary | last = Trust | date = November 4, 2019 | accessdate = November 6, 2019 | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref>\n\n== Similar charts ==\n\nA new chart, the [[Pop 100]], was created by ''Billboard'' in February 2005 to answer criticism that the Hot 100 was biased in favor of [[Rhythmic Top 40|rhythmic]] songs, as throughout most of its existence, the Hot 100 was seen predominantly as a pop chart. It was discontinued in June 2009 due to the charts becoming increasingly similar.\n\nThe [[Canadian Hot 100]] was launched June 16, 2007.

Building on their successes in 1858, Republican candidates won increasing percentages in the House. After secessionist vacancies, their caucus of 108 amounted to 59% of the House, and with another 16% in the Unionist caucus, they had over a two-thirds super-majority to govern.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nFollowing Lincoln's election and before his inauguration, seven secessionist states declared rebellion and Jefferson Davis mobilized 100,000 troops in defense of the Confederacy. Lincoln responded with a call-up of 75,000 troops to reoccupy federal property in port cities. That motivated another four border states to declare [[Ordinance of Secession|secession]], forming the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that fought the [[American Civil War]].\n\nSeceding states cancelled elections to Federal office, and all but a few of their Representatives departed. Twenty-three representatives to U.S. 37th Congress came from five slave-holding states represented in the Confederacy: Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The rebellion left seventeen vacancies in those states. Meanwhile for the duration of the conflict those same five states sent full delegations to the Confederate Congress even though over half their Congressional districts were federally occupied or disrupted by the end of 1862.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 47.</ref>\n\nOverwhelmingly, seceding states had [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representation, so despite losing seats to Democrats{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} in the North, this state-by-state mass departure left Republicans with a clear House majority. Remaining Representatives of all parties were united in support for the Union. Representatives opposing Democrats but not wishing to affiliate with Republicans, and wishing to emphasize support for the Union and opposition to secession, coalesced as the [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist Party]]. Many of these Unionists were from Southern states. The [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing|American Party]] disappeared, with its remaining support usually absorbed by Unionists.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Election summaries==\n[[#California|California]] was [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] one additional seat for the 37th Congress,<ref>{{USStat|12|411}}</ref> increasing the total seats to 239.\n\n[[Ordinance_of_Secession|Secession]] of Southern states vacated many seats. Few Representatives from these states remained. Missing Representatives were overwhelmingly Democrats, boosting Republican control. Several states held elections for the 37th Congress, but seceded before Congress convened, so the elected Representatives never served. Other seceding states held no elections.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:59.02%;\" | '''108'''\n| style=\"background:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:16.39%;\" | '''30'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:0.55%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:24.04%;\" | '''44'''\n\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Republican'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Unionist'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''ID'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n|}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State\n! rowspan=2 | Type\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! rowspan=2 | Total<br/>seats\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Republican}} | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Democratic}} | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Unionist}} | [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist]]{{efn | Includes Unionists, Constitutional Unionists, and the two \"Union\" members from [[Rhode Island]].}}\n! colspan=2 | Others\n\n|-\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Change\n!

Before 1872, different states held elections at various times; the first elections for the 37th Congress were held on August 6, 1860 in [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], while the last election took place in [[California]] on September 4, 1861, a year later. Three Southern states \u2013 [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], and [[South Carolina]] \u2013 chose Representatives before the presidential election, electing seven Democrats and two independents. These were the only House elections from the seceding states to the 37th Congress. After South Carolina resolved disunion and the [[Confederate States of America]] was formed, other Southern states declared as well and elected Representatives to the new [[Congress of the Confederate States]] instead of the United States Congress.\n\nSince the states not holding elections had many strong Democratic districts \u2013 in the previous [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] their Representatives included a total of 46 Democrats, 14 [[Opposition Party (Southern U.S.)|Oppositionists]], five independents, and one member of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] \u2013 when Congress was called into session on July 4, 1861 (five months earlier than usual at the time) the size of the Democratic House caucus had been drastically reduced, resulting in a huge Republican majority.\n\nOf the 183 seats, 102 were held by Republicans, 45 by Democrats,{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} 23 by Unionists, and five others by one party each. There were several vacancies, and California had not held its election when Congress assembled.\n\n==End of a Congressional era==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" align=right\n\n! colspan=4 | US Congressional Party Transformation, 1857\u20131863<ref>Martis, pp. 111, 113, 115.</ref>\n\n|-\n!

Likewise, the congressional elections also marked the transition from one major era of political parties to another.

They were held before, during and after the pre-determined Presidential campaign. And they were held before, during and after the secessionist campaigns in various states as they were reported throughout the country. Political conditions varied hugely from time to time during the course of congressional selection, but they had been shifting to a considerable extent in the years running up to the crisis.<ref>Martis, p. 36.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1856 United States House of Representatives elections|1856 elections]], the Democrats had taken the Presidency for the sixth time in the last 40 years, with James Buchanan's victory over John C. Fremont and Millard Fillmore. They held almost a two-thirds majority in both the US House and Senate. Democrats held onto the Senate during the midterm elections, but the four opposition parties then amounted to two-thirds of the House. The congressional elections in 1860 transformed Democratic fortunes: Republican and Unionist candidates won a two-thirds majority in both House and Senate.<ref>Martis, p. 34.</ref>\n\nAfter the secessionist withdrawal, resignation and expulsion, the Democrats would have less than 25% of the House for the 37th Congress, and that minority divided further between pro-unionists (Stephen Douglas), and anti-war (Clement Vallandingham) factions.<ref>Martis, pp. 114, 115.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Results by region ==\n\nThe politics of these elections were distinctive in every region of the country.

Each Congressional District has a link, named by its state abbreviation and its assigned number or noted At-large election. In a time before the Census Department published aggregate population data by Congressional District, the reader may have ready access to census data identifying the make up of those each district by referring to their respective articles.\n\nThe articles use different formats. The constituent counties of Congressional Districts are sometimes listed in a contents heading \"List of representatives\" within tables. These tables have a column naming the District's counties for each election, such as (a) \"District Area\" for Massachusetts, or (b) \"Area\" for Illinois and Maryland. Virginia uses \"Historical composition of the district\" to describe composition at each reapportionment. Pennsylvania notes the home county of the elected representative, sometimes holding the largest population for respective districts. Minnesota makes a geographical allusion for its 1st District applicable to the 37th Congress. Michigan uses \"History\" since 1852 for its 4th district. In some states, previous district composition is not described.\n\n=== New England ===\n\n::[[#Connecticut|Connecticut]] \u2014 [[#Maine|Maine]] \u2014 [[#Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] \u2014 [[#New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] \u2014 [[#Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] \u2014 [[#Vermont|Vermont]]\n\nThe twenty-nine seats in the House among these six states are divided 24 Republican, two Union one Constitutional Union, and two Democratic.

The Territories elected four Republicans, one Democrat and two Independents.\n\nWhen California entered the Union, it broke the free soil - slave state tie in the Senate. Minnesota, and Oregon followed as free soil states. Once Congress was depleted of the secessionist Democrats, the lame duck 36th Congress admitted Kansas as a free state in January 1861, in time for it to send a Representative to the 37th Congress in March.

Building on their successes in 1858, Republican candidates won increasing percentages in the House. After secessionist vacancies, their caucus of 108 amounted to 59% of the House, and with another 16% in the Unionist caucus, they had over a two-thirds super-majority to govern.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nFollowing Lincoln's election and before his inauguration, seven secessionist states declared rebellion and Jefferson Davis mobilized 100,000 troops in defense of the Confederacy. Lincoln responded with a call-up of 75,000 troops to reoccupy federal property in port cities. That motivated another four border states to declare [[Ordinance of Secession|secession]], forming the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that fought the [[American Civil War]].\n\nSeceding states cancelled elections to Federal office, and all but a few of their Representatives departed. Twenty-three representatives to U.S. 37th Congress came from five slave-holding states represented in the Confederacy: Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The rebellion left seventeen vacancies in those states. Meanwhile for the duration of the conflict those same five states sent full delegations to the Confederate Congress even though over half their Congressional districts were federally occupied or disrupted by the end of 1862.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 47.</ref>\n\nOverwhelmingly, seceding states had [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representation, so despite losing seats to Democrats{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} in the North, this state-by-state mass departure left Republicans with a clear House majority. Remaining Representatives of all parties were united in support for the Union. Representatives opposing Democrats but not wishing to affiliate with Republicans, and wishing to emphasize support for the Union and opposition to secession, coalesced as the [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist Party]]. Many of these Unionists were from Southern states. The [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing|American Party]] disappeared, with its remaining support usually absorbed by Unionists.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Election summaries==\n[[#California|California]] was [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] one additional seat for the 37th Congress,<ref>{{USStat|12|411}}</ref> increasing the total seats to 239.\n\n[[Ordinance_of_Secession|Secession]] of Southern states vacated many seats. Few Representatives from these states remained. Missing Representatives were overwhelmingly Democrats, boosting Republican control. Several states held elections for the 37th Congress, but seceded before Congress convened, so the elected Representatives never served. Other seceding states held no elections.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:59.02%;\" | '''108'''\n| style=\"background:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:16.39%;\" | '''30'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:0.55%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:24.04%;\" | '''44'''\n\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Republican'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Unionist'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''ID'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n|}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State\n! rowspan=2 | Type\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! rowspan=2 | Total<br/>seats\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Republican}} | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Democratic}} | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Unionist}} | [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist]]{{efn | Includes Unionists, Constitutional Unionists, and the two \"Union\" members from [[Rhode Island]].}}\n! colspan=2 | Others\n\n|-\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Change\n!

Before 1872, different states held elections at various times; the first elections for the 37th Congress were held on August 6, 1860 in [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], while the last election took place in [[California]] on September 4, 1861, a year later. Three Southern states \u2013 [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], and [[South Carolina]] \u2013 chose Representatives before the presidential election, electing seven Democrats and two independents. These were the only House elections from the seceding states to the 37th Congress. After South Carolina resolved disunion and the [[Confederate States of America]] was formed, other Southern states declared as well and elected Representatives to the new [[Congress of the Confederate States]] instead of the United States Congress.\n\nSince the states not holding elections had many strong Democratic districts \u2013 in the previous [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] their Representatives included a total of 46 Democrats, 14 [[Opposition Party (Southern U.S.)|Oppositionists]], five independents, and one member of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] \u2013 when Congress was called into session on July 4, 1861 (five months earlier than usual at the time) the size of the Democratic House caucus had been drastically reduced, resulting in a huge Republican majority.\n\nOf the 183 seats, 102 were held by Republicans, 45 by Democrats,{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} 23 by Unionists, and five others by one party each. There were several vacancies, and California had not held its election when Congress assembled.\n\n==End of a Congressional era==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" align=right\n\n! colspan=4 | US Congressional Party Transformation, 1857\u20131863<ref>Martis, pp. 111, 113, 115.</ref>\n\n|-\n!

Likewise, the congressional elections also marked the transition from one major era of political parties to another. In just six years, over the course of the 35th, 36th and 37th Congresses, a complete reversal of party fortunes swamped the Democrats.<ref>Martis, pp. 31\u201335.</ref>\n\n[[File:Spanking Douglas.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] switches Stephen A.

They were held before, during and after the pre-determined Presidential campaign. And they were held before, during and after the secessionist campaigns in various states as they were reported throughout the country. Political conditions varied hugely from time to time during the course of congressional selection, but they had been shifting to a considerable extent in the years running up to the crisis.<ref>Martis, p. 36.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1856 United States House of Representatives elections|1856 elections]], the Democrats had taken the Presidency for the sixth time in the last 40 years, with James Buchanan's victory over John C. Fremont and Millard Fillmore. They held almost a two-thirds majority in both the US House and Senate. Democrats held onto the Senate during the midterm elections, but the four opposition parties then amounted to two-thirds of the House. The congressional elections in 1860 transformed Democratic fortunes: Republican and Unionist candidates won a two-thirds majority in both House and Senate.<ref>Martis, p. 34.</ref>\n\nAfter the secessionist withdrawal, resignation and expulsion, the Democrats would have less than 25% of the House for the 37th Congress, and that minority divided further between pro-unionists (Stephen Douglas), and anti-war (Clement Vallandingham) factions.<ref>Martis, pp. 114, 115.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Results by region ==\n\nThe politics of these elections were distinctive in every region of the country.

Each Congressional District has a link, named by its state abbreviation and its assigned number or noted At-large election. In a time before the Census Department published aggregate population data by Congressional District, the reader may have ready access to census data identifying the make up of those each district by referring to their respective articles.\n\nThe articles use different formats. The constituent counties of Congressional Districts are sometimes listed in a contents heading \"List of representatives\" within tables. These tables have a column naming the District's counties for each election, such as (a) \"District Area\" for Massachusetts, or (b) \"Area\" for Illinois and Maryland. Virginia uses \"Historical composition of the district\" to describe composition at each reapportionment. Pennsylvania notes the home county of the elected representative, sometimes holding the largest population for respective districts. Minnesota makes a geographical allusion for its 1st District applicable to the 37th Congress. Michigan uses \"History\" since 1852 for its 4th district.

Minnesota, and Oregon followed as free soil states. Once Congress was depleted of the secessionist Democrats, the lame duck 36th Congress admitted Kansas as a free state in January 1861, in time for it to send a Representative to the 37th Congress in March.

The [[etymological dictionary]] was among the first of its type published in Europe in a [[vernacular]] language.\n\n==Original publication==\nSebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias began writing what would become the ''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola'' in the spring of 1605. He completed the work over the course of three years, writing in [[Valencia]] and [[Cuenca (Spain)|Cuenca]]. Covarrubias, who was sixty-six years old when he began the project, decided to reduce the number of [[word]]s after the letter {{angle bracket|C}}, fearing he may die before finishing the project.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Carriazo Ruiz |first1=Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n |last2=Mancho Duque |first2=Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas |chapter=Los comienzos de la lexicograf\u00eda monoling\u00fce |trans-chapter=The beginnings of monolingual lexicography |editor=Antonia M.

Covarrubias adopted Isidore's idea that [[etymological fallacy|the original form of a word is related to its original meaning]], so that investigating etymology reveals the origin and deeper meaning of things. The quality of Covarrubias's etymologies were prone to fanciful speculation, in line with other etymological work of the time. He was especially interested in connecting Spanish words to [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], which was considered the [[original language of humanity]] before the [[Tower of Babel]]. Covarrubias was also aware of contemporary work in [[lexicography]] from other countries, including Jean Pallet's ''Dictionnaire tr\u00e8s ample de la langue espagnole et fran\u00e7oise'' [''Very Copious Dictionary of the Spanish and French Language''] (Paris, 1604) and Jean Nicot's ''Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7ais'' [''Treasury of the French Language''] (Paris, 1606). He aimed to give foreigners a sense of the propriety and elegance of the Spanish language, to the honor of the Spanish nation (\"''dar noticia a los extranjeros del lenguaje espa\u00f1ol, y de su propiedad y elegancia, que es muy gran honor de la naci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola''\").<ref>{{Cite book |last=Covarrubias |first=Sebasti\u00e1n |editor=Ignacio Arellano and Rafael Zafra |title=Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola |version=edici\u00f3n integral e ilustrada |location=Madrid |publisher=Iberoamericana-Vervuert |year=2006 |language=Spanish |isbn=8484890740}}</ref>\n\n===Organization===\nThe lexicon consists of about 11,000 entries.

Spelling reflects the instability of written Spanish prior to the establishment of the [[Spanish Academy]], so that a single word may be spelled several different ways in different sections of the book. Covarrubias was a supporter of [[phonetic spelling]], but his own spelling was not always consistent with the principle.\n\nThe book takes a broad view of the lexicon, including [[Dialect|regionalisms]] (especially from [[Old Castile]], [[Kingdom of Toledo|Toledo]], and [[Andalusia]]), [[slang]], [[jargon]], and [[archaism]]s. The length of entries is uneven, ranging from a few lines to as many as eight pages.

These include the ''Thresor de deux langues fran\u00e7oise et spagnole'' [Treasure of two languages, French and Spanish] by [[C\u00e9sar Oudin]] (1616), the ''Ductor in linguas'' [Guide into Tongues] by [[John Minsheu]] (1617), and the ''Vocabolario italiano e spagnolo'' [Italian and Spanish Vocabulary] by [[Lorenzo Franciosini]] (1620).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Google books|K10MJdL7pGIC|Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola}}\n* [http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/765/16/tesoro-de-la-lengua-castellana-o-espanola/ ''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola'', digital edition at Universidad de Sevilla.] {{in lang|es}}\n* {{Cite web |last=Eberenz |first=Rolf |url=http://descargas.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/91349429656690619532279/019829.pdf?incr=1 |format=PDF |title=Sebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias y las variedades regionales del espa\u00f1ol.
