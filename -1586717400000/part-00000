'A [[Flood myth|flood]] will carry away all these creatures: from that I will save thee!'

When I outgrow that, thou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me down to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.' \n\nIt soon became a ''ghasha'' (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all fish). Thereupon it said, 'In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.'...\n\nBeing desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities.

After the Earth is flooded, the ship is tied with rope to the horn of Matsya, and 'by that means he passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain'. As the water subsides, Manu performs the p\u00e2ka-sacrifice, from which \"Ida\" emerges. \"Ida\" identifies herself as 'Manu's daughter' when approached by [[Mitra]] and [[Varuna]], and explains to Manu that 'Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice'. Manu does so to regenerate the human race through sacrifice.\n\nThe legend of Matsya rescuing [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] from the flood, taking the ship to the summit of a mountain, and the birth of \"Ida\" from the p\u00e2ka-sacrifice - consisting of only the first 10 of 44 verses in this Brahmana - is a prelude to explain the symbolic importance of the ''ida,'' the domestic offering in the form of a sacrificial cake (including butter). In the practice of the ritual described in the remaining verses, the daughter of Manu is explicitly stated to be 'essentially the same as the Ida' to attain prosperity from a successful sacrifice in the form of cattle and offspring. Linking to academics' claims of Ida representing libations such as milk in the [[Rigveda|RigVeda]], the domestic offering is stated to be milk in the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (e.g. SB 2.3.1.21).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe12/sbe1248.htm|title=Satapatha Brahmana Part 1 (SBE12): Second K\u00e2nda: II, 3, 1.

Bonnefoy states that 'classical India indeed speaks of the \"law of the fishes\" to designate what we could call the \"[[law of the jungle]].\" The law of the fishes is set against the order imposed by a good [[king]], an order in which the weak are protected from the strong and in which [[dharma]] rather than individual force is the organizing principle.

And, O Bharata, the fish then told those on the vessel to tie it to the peak of the Himavat. And hearing the words of the fish they immediately tied the boat on that peak of the mountain and, O son of [[Kunti]] and ornament of Bharata's race, know that that high peak of the Himavat is still called by the name of Naubandhana (the harbour). Then the fish addressing the associated [[Rishi|Rishis]] told them these words, 'I am [[Brahma]], the Lord of all creatures; there is none greater than myself.

In this account, [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivaswata]] Manu performs austerities for 10,000 years in the '[[jujube]] forest called Visala' before a small-fish, i.e. Matsya, approaches him on the banks of the Chirini river. Outgrowing a tank 'two [[Yojana|yojanas]] in length and one yojana in width', Matsya is deposited in the [[Ganges]] river before outgrowing that and being deposited in the sea, where Manu is warned 'the dissolution of all this mobile and immobile world is nigh at hand' and is instructed to 'build a strong massive ark and have it furnished with a long rope. On that must thou ascend, O great Muni, with the [[Saptarishi|seven Rishis]] and take with thee all the different [[Seed|seeds]] which were enumerated by regenerate [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] in days of yore'.

Matsya then identifies itself as [[Brahma]] and states 'Manu will create (again) all beings--gods, ''[[Asura|Asuras]]'' and men' before disappearing. Notably, this account does not mention Ida/Ila.

Growing and being transferred first to a vessel, then to a tank, and then the ocean when finally 'in size extending to a [[lakh]] of [[Yojana|yojanas]]', Manu identifies the fish as [[Vishnu]], who warns of the impending flood and instructs him to board a ship with seeds, etc. Notably, this includes being told that he will spend the 'night of [[Brahma]]' on the ship (i.e. the time of universal dissolution lasting 1000 [[Yuga|yugas]] or 'celestial years' where all creation begins again anew) while 'being encircled by the seven sages', i.e. the [[Saptarishi]].\n\nAfter the flood occurs and Manu is on the ship, a serpent ([[N\u0101ga|Naga]]) - in place of a rope - is used to tie the ship to the horn of Matsya, described as 'one million yojanas in length'. The final verses, rather than narrate the arrival of Manu at the safety at the peak of a mountain or his subsequent sacrificial ritual to produce [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]], instead briefly narrate that Manu 'heard from the fish the [[Puranas|Purana]] known as the [[Matsya Purana]], and that '[[Keshava|Kesava]] (Vishnu) killed the demon Hayagriva, the destroyer of the [[Vedas]] of [[Brahmin|Brahman]] and thus protected the Vedic [[Mantra|mantras]]'.

In the first, as quoted above in its entirety, after the [[Vedas]] are stolen by an [[Asura]] called Hayagriva (not to be confused with the horse-headed avatar also called '[[Hayagriva]]'), [[Krishna]] assumes the form of Matsya to destroy the demon and retrieve the stolen Vedas.

From the second account, following directly from the first:\n\n{{quote|<poem>The Supreme Personality of Godhead [Matsya] said: O [[Shraddhadeva Manu|King]], who can subdue your enemies, on the seventh day from today the three worlds \u2014 Bh\u016b\u1e25, Bhuva\u1e25 and Sva\u1e25 \u2014 will all merge into the water of inundation.

By the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was given the post of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'. While performing austerities, a small fish jumps into the King's hands, which he throws back into the river, prompting to fish to request his protection. Doing so, the fish grows as it is first deposited in a water jug, then a well, a lake, and then finally the sea where it expands for 'hundreds of miles'. Recognising the fish as [[Krishna]], Satyavrata is warned of the impending dissolution of the [[Trailokya|three worlds]] and instructed to board a boat built for him, taking 'herbs and seeds... the [[Saptarishi|seven \u1e5b\u1e63is]] and... all kinds of living entities'.\n\nSatyavrata meditates on [[Krishna]] until the 'gigantic clouds pouring incessant water swelled the ocean more and more', boards the boat, and 'while the King constantly meditated upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a large golden fish appeared in the ocean of inundation. The fish had one horn and was eight million miles long'. [[Vasuki]] is used as a rope. During the journey, Satyavrata praises [[Krishna]], and Krishna - as Matsya - 'explained to King Satyavrata the spiritual science known as [[Samkhya|s\u0101\u1e45khya]]-yoga, the science by which one distinguishes between matter and spirit, along with the instructions contained in the [[Puranas|Pur\u0101\u1e47as]] and the [[Samhita|sa\u1e41hit\u0101s]]' (8.24).\n\nThe second account is similar to that given in the [[Matsya Purana]], particularly as both [[Puranas]] omit the remainder of the original legend from the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (White [[Yajurveda|YajurVeda]], see above), where Manu is taken to safety by Matsya to a mountain where he consequently performs a [[Yajna|sacrifice]] to produce his \"daughter\" [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]]. Instead, this sacrifice is described in a separate legend, similar to that of the [[Vishnu Purana]] (see below), where 'Manu had begun that sacrifice for the sake of getting a son, but because the priest was diverted by the request of Manu\u2019s wife, a daughter named Il\u0101 was born' (9.1.16).\n\n=== Brahma Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Brahma Purana|Brahma]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Matsya:''' 38.1-63, 56.3, 57.1-3, 68.73; '''Flood:''' 24.19-21; '''Manu:''' 3.4-7; '''Ship:''' 38.85-86; '''Ila:''' 5.3-7, Gautami-Mahaymya: 3.9-12<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/brahma_purana_english_full|title=Brahma Purana - Parts I - IV|last=Motilal Banarsidass|date=1955-01-01}}</ref>\n|The legend of Matsya is not narrated in this [[Puranas|Purana]].\n|}\n\n{{quote|By visiting Svetamadhava and Matsyamadhava by his side and by bowing to the first incarnation of [[Krishna|Madhava]] in the form of a fish [i.e. Matsya-Madhava], one is liberated from all miseries.

Deshpande (1988), Part 8, Chapter 91, Verses 1-11}}[[File:Matsya painting.jpg|thumb|left|Matsya preparing to slay the demon.|alt=|200x200px]]There are two accounts of the Matsya legend in [[Padma Purana]]. In the first, it is [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] - a [[Saptarishi]] synonymous with [[Kurma]] - who rears Matsya, not the Manu [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivasvata]]. The story itself is in regards to rescuing the Vedas from the demon Sankha (Hayasiras or Hayagriva in other accounts), not in regards to protection from the deluge or dissolution of the Earth. It is also the sages that return the [[Vedas]] to [[Brahma]], not [[Vishnu]] (i.e. in other accounts, such as that below, it is usually the horse-headed avatar also called '[[Hayagriva]]', or the fish avatar, that returns the Vedas to Brahma; Part 8: 91.1-11).\n\nIn the second account, [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] is stated to have had four (i.e. not thirteen) wives: [[Aditi]], [[Diti]], [[Kadru]] and [[Vinata]]. As well as [[Hiranyaksha|Hiranyaksa]] and [[Hiranyakashipu]] ([[Asura|Asuras]] relating to the legends of the [[Varaha]] and [[Narasimha]] avatars, respectively), Diti also gives birth to other demons including Hayagriva and [[Makara]]. \n\nIt is Makara, through performance of severe penances, who enters into the realm of [[Brahma]], steals the [[Vedas]], and enters 'into the great ocean' with them, causing ruin to the world. Reminiscent of the legend of [[Kurma]], Brahma, 'surrounded by the hosts of all gods, went to the [[Samudra manthan|Milky Ocean]], and seeking refuge of god ([[Vishu]])' informs Him of what has happened. Vishnu 'thus addressed by Brahma, resorted to the Fish-form [Matsya] and entered the great ocean' before then adopting the form of a [[crocodile]] to kill Makara and return the Vedas, [[Vedanga|Vedangas]], and Upangas to Brahma. Other details include:\n\n<br />\n\n* [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]] was created from a sacrifice by [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] to produce a son (Part 1: 8.75-77) and alternated between being man for one month (called Sudyumna) and woman in another; made  pregnant by [[Budha]] (Part 1: 8.118-119)\n* Matsya is listed as first in the [[Dashavatara]], the ten primary incarnations of [[Vishnu]] (Part 7: 66.44-54 and 71.23-29 and Part 9: 229.40-44)\n* 'That [<nowiki/>[[Shaligram|salagrama]]] stone which is long, has a golden complexion, and adorned with three lines, is known as 'Matsya', and gives the fruit like enjoyments and salvation' (Part 8: 120.51b-73)\n* It is stated about [[Vishnu]] that 'You are the Fish holding the [[Vedas]]' (Part 9: 197.57b-70a) and that 'taking the form of a Fish, extracted the Vedas' (Part 10: Kritayogasara khanda - 6.175-190)\n* It is stated 'The third auspicious covering [of [[Vaikuntha]]] consists of the worlds of Matsya, Kurma, etc.' (Part 9: 228.59-65)\n\n=== Shiva Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Shiva Purana|Shiva]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' Rudra-Samhita II - 2.24-29 ([[Kama]] fish banner and vehicle);<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 2:''' 17.16, Yuddha Khanda - 16.16;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 3:''' Satarudra Samhita - 11.18;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart3|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 3 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 4:''' Uma Samhita - 36; Vayaviya Samhita - 30.56-58, 31.134-136<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart4|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 4 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref>\n|\n|}\nThe legend of Matsya does not seem to be narrated in the [[Shiva Purana]].

He could move through the waters of [the] ocean. The Lord too could wield Maya. At the request of [[Brahma]] the Lord took up the incarnation of [a] Fish and entered the ocean. He searched for and found (the demon). He dragged him to the shore and thrashed him on the surface of the earth. The excellent [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danava]] fell on the fourteenth day in the bright half of the month of Madhu (i.e [[Chaitra|Caitra]]).\n\nBy contact of the hands of the Lord he became a fragrant gross of the same name, i.e. Damanaka (Artemisia indica). The Lord accepted it with a surprised mind. He made a garland of it and wore it on his chest along with the garland of sylvan flowers. He thought that its fragrance should stay as long as the object exists.</poem>|source=Skanda Purana, Unknown translator (1951), Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra-Mahatmya, Chapter 38, Verses 113-117}}\n\nThere are several accounts of Matsya in the [[Skanda Purana]]. In the first, as quoted above, [[Vishnu]] in the form of Matsya destroys the [[Asura]] called Damanaka in the ocean, who turns into fragrant Damanaka grass. This story is in relation to the Matsya Jayanti which takes place in [[Chaitra|Caitra]], as related by the [[Naradiya Purana|Narada Purana]] (Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra-Mahatmya: 38.113-117). From the second account:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Formerly there was an [[Asura]] named Sankha. He was the son of Sagara (Ocean). He usurped the powers of [[Indra]] and other Guardians of the Quarters... on seeing [[Vishnu]] asleep, he took away the [[Vedas]] [to weaken the gods] from the primordial self-born Lord [[Brahma]] from [[Brahmaloka|Satyaloka]]. While they were being carried away by him, the Vedas, out of fear of him, escaped and entered the waters along with the seeds of the Yajnamantras. In search of them, Sankha too entered the ocean. Wandering here and there the [[Daitya]] did not find them together anywhere...\n\n[Vishnu said:] All the Vedas carried away by Sankha now lie submerged in the waters. O Devas, I shall bring them all after killing the son of the Ocean... After saying this, Lord Visnu assumed the form of a Saphari fish and plunged into the water from the sky even as Brahma staying on [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] was watching. After killing [the] Asura Sankha, Visnu went to the forest of Badari. There the Lord called together all the sages and commanded thus: O you all, do search for the Vedas scattered within the waters. Bring them quickly from the midst of the waters of the sea. Till then I shall remain at [[Prayaga]] accompanied by the groups of [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].</poem>|source=Skanda Purana, Unknown translator (1951), Part 6, Karttikamsa-Mahatmya, Chapter 13|author=|title=}}\n[[File:DASWANTH Birth of Brhma and madhu-kaitabha kill by vishnu.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The deaths of [[Madhu-Kaitabha|Madhu and Kaitabha]].]]\nNotably, the second account, as quoted above, is in many respects almost identical to the account in the [[Padma Purana]] (see above), with the exception of being nurtured by [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] (or, in the original account of the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]], [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivasvata]] Manu; Part 6: Karttikamsa-Mahatmya: 13). In the third account, the Asuras [[Madhu-Kaitabha|Madhu and Kaitabha]] steal the [[Vedas]] from [[Brahma]] and enter 'the great ocean'. Mahadeva - i.e. [[Shiva]], not [[Vishnu]] in this account - assumes the form of a Fish, stirs up the ocean, and finds the Vedas in [[Patala]] before destroying the [[Daitya|Daityas]] and returning the Vedas to Brahma (Part 14: Reva Khanda: 9). Notably, in the [[Bhagavata Purana]], it is [[Vishnu]] in the form of [[Hayagriva]] (also the name of another Veda-stealing demon as described above) who retrieves the Vedas from Madhu and Kaitabha.\n\nThe fourth and fifth accounts are brief mentions of Matsya in relation to the legend of the flood and of [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Manu]]. In the fourth account Vishnu states <nowiki>''</nowiki>When you day ends, I shall become a fish and shall support (floating) like a boat, the earth along with its medicinal plants, Manus and others' (Part 7: Ayidhya-Mahatmya: 18.12-20). In the fifth account it is stated 'In order to please [[Brahma]] in a former [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]], the Lord became a Fish, recovered the [[Vedas]] that were immersed in the great sea and handed them over to Brahma' (Part 15: Reva Khanda - 151.8-17). Elsewhere, it is also stated that at the beginning of a new Kalpa, Vishnu in the form of Matsya taught the Vedas to Brahma (Part 19: Prabhasa-Ksetra Mahatmya - 2.20-23). The accounts of Matsya in this Purana are thus primarily concerned with the retrieval or restoration of the Vedas after being stolen by various demons. Other details include:\n\n* It is stated 'in the morning on [[Dwadashi|Dvadasi]] day, in the bright half of the month of [[Agrahayana|Margasirsa]], the Matsya festival is to be celebrated by the wise' (Part 6: Karttikamsa-Mahatmya: 14.1)\n* Matsya is stated to be the protector of the Vedas (Part 8: Setu-Mahaymya: 46.37-43)\n* Matsya is listed in the [[Dashavatara]], or ten primary incarnations of Vishnu (Part 15: Reva-Khanda, 151.1-7)\n* King [[Pururavas]] was the son of [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]] (Part 12: Avantiksetra-Mahatmya - 8.20-26); it is also stated that 'The earth is called Ila' (Part 20: Prabhasa Khanda: 152.4)\n* 'Matsya' is one of the thousand names ([[Vishnu Sahasranama]]) of [[Vishnu]] (Part 12: Avantiksetra-Mahatmya: 63.81)\n* It is stated that the Matsyavahana is the emblem of [[Parvati]] (Part 18: Nagara Khanda - 254.92)\n\n=== Vamana Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Vamana Purana|Vamana]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n| --<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.313087|title=The Vamana Purana With English Translation|last=Gupta|first=anand Swarup|date=1968}}</ref>\n|No notable mentions.\n|}\n=== Varaha Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Varaha Purana|Varaha]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' 1.6, 4.2-3, 7.40, 9, 12.8-9, 15.10, 15.18-19, 40.46-48, 48.17-22, 113.20, 113.42;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12962|title=THE VARAHA PURANA PART. 1|last=N.A|date=1960|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, DELHI}}</ref> '''Part 2:''' 211.69<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12972|title=THE VARAHA PURANA PART. 2|last=N.A|date=1960|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, DELHI}}</ref>\n|}\n\n{{quote|<poem>Night being over, the lotus-eyed God [<nowiki/>[[Narayana]]] got up and thought about the four [[Vedas]] and in them the Goddess of the Vedas.

The Manu [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivaswata]] was the son of the celestial luminary [<nowiki/>[[Surya]]]; and his sons were [[Ikshvaku|Ikshw\u00e1ku]], Nriga, Dhrisht\u0301a, \u015aary\u00e1ti, Narishyanta, Pr\u00e1n\u015bu, N\u00e1bh\u00e1ga, Nedisht\u0301a, Kar\u00fasha, and Prishadhra. Before their birth, the Manu being desirous of sons, offered a sacrifice for that purpose to [[Mitra]] and [[Varuna|Varu\u0144a]]; but the rite being deranged, through an irregularity of the ministering priest, a daughter, [[Ila (Hinduism)|Il\u00e1]], was produced. Through the favour of the two divinities, however, her sex was changed, and she became a man, named Sudyumna. \n\nAt a subsequent period, in consequence of becoming subject to the effects of a malediction once pronounced by [[Shiva|\u015aiva]], Sudyumna was again transformed to a woman in the vicinity of the hermitage of [[Budha]], the son of the deity of the [[Soma (deity)|moon]]. Budha saw and espoused her, and had by her a son named [[Pururavas|Pur\u00faravas]]. After his birth, the illustrious [[Rishi|Rishis]], desirous of restoring Sudyumna to his sex, prayed to the mighty [[Vishnu|Vish\u0144u]], who is the essence of the four [[Vedas]], of mind, of every thing, and of nothing; and who is in the form of the sacrificial male; and through his favour Il\u00e1 once more became Sudyumna, in which character he had three sons, Utkala, Gaya, and Vinata.</poem>|source=Vishnu Purana, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson (1840), Book IV, Chapter 1}}It seems the legend of Matsya is not narrated in the [[Vishnu Purana]].

The Himalayas are treated as a boundary between the earthly existence and land of salvation beyond. The protection of the fish and its horn represent the sacrifices that help guide Manu to salvation. Treated as a parable, the tale advises a good king should protect the weak from the mighty, reversing the \"law of fishes\" and uphold [[dharma]], like Manu, who defines an ideal king.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|pp= 79-80}} In the tales where the demon hides the Vedas, dharma is threatened and Vishnu as the divine Saviour rescues dharma, aided by his earthly counterpart, Manu - the king.{{sfn|Bonnefoy|1993|p= 80}}\n\n==Worship and significance==\n===India===\nThere are very few temples dedicated to Matsya.

When he was washing himself, a fish came into his hands. \n\nIt spake to him the word, 'Rear me, I will save thee!' 'Wherefrom wilt thou save me?' 'A [[Flood myth|flood]] will carry away all these creatures: from that I will save thee!' 'How am I to rear thee?' \n\nIt said, 'As long as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish devours fish. Thou wilt first keep me in a jar. When I outgrow that, thou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me down to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.' \n\nIt soon became a ''ghasha'' (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all fish). Thereupon it said, 'In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.'...\n\nBeing desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a p\u00e2ka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint.</poem>|source=[[Shatapatha Brahmana]], translated by [[Julius Eggeling]] (1900), Kanda I, Adhyaya 8, Brahmana 1 ('The Ida'), Verses 1-4 and 7|sign=}}[[File:The fish avatara of Vishnu saves Manu during the great deluge.jpg|thumb|Matsya pulling Manu's boat|alt=|274x274px]]In this original account, Manu is approached by a small fish requesting his protection, and having reared it to become a ''ghasha'', is warned of an impending flood and instructed to build a ship. After the Earth is flooded, the ship is tied with rope to the horn of Matsya, and 'by that means he passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain'. As the water subsides, Manu performs the p\u00e2ka-sacrifice, from which \"Ida\" emerges. \"Ida\" identifies herself as 'Manu's daughter' when approached by [[Mitra]] and [[Varuna]], and explains to Manu that 'Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice'. Manu does so to regenerate the human race through sacrifice.\n\nThe legend of Matsya rescuing [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] from the flood, taking the ship to the summit of a mountain, and the birth of \"Ida\" from the p\u00e2ka-sacrifice - consisting of only the first 10 of 44 verses in this Brahmana - is a prelude to explain the symbolic importance of the ''ida,'' the domestic offering in the form of a sacrificial cake (including butter). In the practice of the ritual described in the remaining verses, the daughter of Manu is explicitly stated to be 'essentially the same as the Ida' to attain prosperity from a successful sacrifice in the form of cattle and offspring. Linking to academics' claims of Ida representing libations such as milk in the [[Rigveda|RigVeda]], the domestic offering is stated to be milk in the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (e.g. SB 2.3.1.21).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe12/sbe1248.htm|title=Satapatha Brahmana Part 1 (SBE12): Second K\u00e2nda: II, 3, 1.

Bonnefoy states that 'classical India indeed speaks of the \"law of the fishes\" to designate what we could call the \"[[law of the jungle]].\" The law of the fishes is set against the order imposed by a good [[king]], an order in which the weak are protected from the strong and in which [[dharma]] rather than individual force is the organizing principle.

In this account, [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivaswata]] Manu performs austerities for 10,000 years in the '[[jujube]] forest called Visala' before a small-fish, i.e. Matsya, approaches him on the banks of the Chirini river. Outgrowing a tank 'two [[Yojana|yojanas]] in length and one yojana in width', Matsya is deposited in the [[Ganges]] river before outgrowing that and being deposited in the sea, where Manu is warned 'the dissolution of all this mobile and immobile world is nigh at hand' and is instructed to 'build a strong massive ark and have it furnished with a long rope.

Growing and being transferred first to a vessel, then to a tank, and then the ocean when finally 'in size extending to a [[lakh]] of [[Yojana|yojanas]]', Manu identifies the fish as [[Vishnu]], who warns of the impending flood and instructs him to board a ship with seeds, etc. Notably, this includes being told that he will spend the 'night of [[Brahma]]' on the ship (i.e. the time of universal dissolution lasting 1000 [[Yuga|yugas]] or 'celestial years' where all creation begins again anew) while 'being encircled by the seven sages', i.e. the [[Saptarishi]].\n\nAfter the flood occurs and Manu is on the ship, a serpent ([[N\u0101ga|Naga]]) - in place of a rope - is used to tie the ship to the horn of Matsya, described as 'one million yojanas in length'. The final verses, rather than narrate the arrival of Manu at the safety at the peak of a mountain or his subsequent sacrificial ritual to produce [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]], instead briefly narrate that Manu 'heard from the fish the [[Puranas|Purana]] known as the [[Matsya Purana]], and that '[[Keshava|Kesava]] (Vishnu) killed the demon Hayagriva, the destroyer of the [[Vedas]] of [[Brahmin|Brahman]] and thus protected the Vedic [[Mantra|mantras]]'.

Then, accompanied by the [[Saptarishi|seven \u1e5b\u1e63is]] and surrounded by all kinds of living entities, you shall get aboard that boat, and without moroseness you shall easily travel with your companions on the ocean of inundation, the only illumination being the effulgence of the great [[Rishi|\u1e5b\u1e63is]].\n\nThen, as the boat is tossed about by the powerful winds, attach the vessel to My horn by means of the great serpent [[Vasuki|V\u0101suki]], for I shall be present by your side.

C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami Prabhupada]], Canto 8, Chapter 24, Verses 32-37}}\n[[File:Matsya Avatar, ca 1870.jpg|left|thumb|274x274px|Matsya.]]\nThe second account occurs at the end of the [[Chakshusha|C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a]]-[[manvantara]] with King [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Satyavrata]], stated to 'later became the son of [[Surya|Vivasv\u0101n]]... and was [to be] known as \u015ar\u0101ddhadeva. By the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was given the post of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'. While performing austerities, a small fish jumps into the King's hands, which he throws back into the river, prompting to fish to request his protection. Doing so, the fish grows as it is first deposited in a water jug, then a well, a lake, and then finally the sea where it expands for 'hundreds of miles'. Recognising the fish as [[Krishna]], Satyavrata is warned of the impending dissolution of the [[Trailokya|three worlds]] and instructed to board a boat built for him, taking 'herbs and seeds... the [[Saptarishi|seven \u1e5b\u1e63is]] and... all kinds of living entities'.\n\nSatyavrata meditates on [[Krishna]] until the 'gigantic clouds pouring incessant water swelled the ocean more and more', boards the boat, and 'while the King constantly meditated upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a large golden fish appeared in the ocean of inundation. The fish had one horn and was eight million miles long'. [[Vasuki]] is used as a rope. During the journey, Satyavrata praises [[Krishna]], and Krishna - as Matsya - 'explained to King Satyavrata the spiritual science known as [[Samkhya|s\u0101\u1e45khya]]-yoga, the science by which one distinguishes between matter and spirit, along with the instructions contained in the [[Puranas|Pur\u0101\u1e47as]] and the [[Samhita|sa\u1e41hit\u0101s]]' (8.24).\n\nThe second account is similar to that given in the [[Matsya Purana]], particularly as both [[Puranas]] omit the remainder of the original legend from the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (White [[Yajurveda|YajurVeda]], see above), where Manu is taken to safety by Matsya to a mountain where he consequently performs a [[Yajna|sacrifice]] to produce his \"daughter\" [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]]. Instead, this sacrifice is described in a separate legend, similar to that of the [[Vishnu Purana]] (see below), where 'Manu had begun that sacrifice for the sake of getting a son, but because the priest was diverted by the request of Manu\u2019s wife, a daughter named Il\u0101 was born' (9.1.16).\n\n=== Brahma Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Brahma Purana|Brahma]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Matsya:''' 38.1-63, 56.3, 57.1-3, 68.73; '''Flood:''' 24.19-21; '''Manu:''' 3.4-7; '''Ship:''' 38.85-86; '''Ila:''' 5.3-7, Gautami-Mahaymya: 3.9-12<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/brahma_purana_english_full|title=Brahma Purana - Parts I - IV|last=Motilal Banarsidass|date=1955-01-01}}</ref>\n|The legend of Matsya is not narrated in this [[Puranas|Purana]].\n|}\n\n{{quote|By visiting Svetamadhava and Matsyamadhava by his side and by bowing to the first incarnation of [[Krishna|Madhava]] in the form of a fish [i.e. Matsya-Madhava], one is liberated from all miseries.

He adds that in the [[Skanda Purana]] (Purusottama Mahatmya: 37.55-6), [[Vishnu]] granted Sveta a crystalline image seated in front of Matsya (at Puri, between the blue hill and the sea) as a reward for [[asceticism]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=v4bV3beb0n8C&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Svetamadhava#v=onepage&q=Svetamadhava&f=false|title=The Jagannatha Temple at Puri: Its Architecture, Art, and Cult|last=Starza|first=O.

Ila/Ida is also mentioned as emerging after [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] 'desirous of begetting sons, so performed the sacrifice with [[Mitra]] and [[Varuna]] as deities... It is said in the [[Vedas]] that Ila was born therefrom' (5.3-7). This is consistent of the account of Matsya in the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (1.8.1).

Thereupon, prayed to by Brahma, [[Vishnu|Visnu]] manifested himself in the form of a divine Fish [Matsya]. The lord killed the demon and handed over the Vedas to Brahma.|source=Narada Purana, unknown translator (1952), Part 5, Chapter 67, Verses 45-47}}\n\n[[File:Matsya Raja Ravi Varma Press.jpg|thumb|Matsya with the [[Vedas]] depicted as infants.|alt=|250x250px]]\n\nIt seems the legend of Matsya rescuing [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] from the flood is not narrated in the [[Naradiya Purana|Narada Purana]]. Instead, a brief account of Matsya destroying the demon Hayasiras (i.e. Hayagriva) to return the [[Vedas]] to [[Brahma]] is given, similar to the accounts of the [[Agni Purana|Agni]] and [[Garuda Purana|Garuda]] [[Puranas]] (see above). Notably, worldly existence is described as a 'terrible ocean... Miseries constitute its foams; it is turbulent with furious temperament constituting its sharks and crocodiles. The mundane affairs are its flood of waters; the different kinds of ailments are its waves; it is impassable due to the whirlpool of delusion' (Part 5: Uttarabhaga - 55.47-48). Also notably - especially as virtually identical to the account given in the [[Brahma Purana]] (see above) - mention is made of visiting the shrines of Matsya (Matsyamadhava; 'who had at the outset assumed the form of a fish of the [[Rohu|Rohita]] type') and King Sveta (Svetamadhava; Part 5: Uttarabhaga - 56.14-16). Other details include: \n\n* It is stated that the legend of Matsya is narrated in the eighth [[Skandha]] (or canto) of the [[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]] (Part 4 96.14-15a),\n* It is stated that the 'Pancami (fifth day) in the bright half of the month of [[Chaitra|Caitra]] is called Matsya Jayanti. On this day, the worship of the incarnation of the Lord as (Divine) fish is to be formed with great festivities, by devotees' (Part 4: 114.2)\n* In ritual worship, 'a beautiful square-shaped put fourteen [[A\u1e45gula|Angulas]] deep should be made and sprinkled with sandal water. After filling it with the milk of cows, the devotee should put in it an image of a fish made of gold and exquisite in every limb, and with eyes constituted of pearls. Uttering the [[Mantra]], 'Obeisance to the great fish' the devotee should worship it with scents and other things and offer it to a [[Brahmin|Brahmana]]' (Part 4: 125.62-64)\n* [[Kama]] (Cupid) has a fish for a banner (Part 4: Uttarabhaga - 2.44b-46 and 19.14)\n* Matsya is listed as the first of the [[Dashavatara]], or ten primary incarnations of [[Vishnu]] (Part 4: 119.14-19)\n\n=== Padma Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Padma Purana|Padma]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' 1.44b-50, 3.25b-29, 8.75-77, 8.118-119;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/padma_purana_part1_english|title=Padma Purana Part 1 Srishti Khanda Motilal Banarsidass 1988|last=N.

Deshpande (1988), Part 8, Chapter 91, Verses 1-11}}[[File:Matsya painting.jpg|thumb|left|Matsya preparing to slay the demon.|alt=|200x200px]]There are two accounts of the Matsya legend in [[Padma Purana]]. In the first, it is [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] - a [[Saptarishi]] synonymous with [[Kurma]] - who rears Matsya, not the Manu [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivasvata]]. The story itself is in regards to rescuing the Vedas from the demon Sankha (Hayasiras or Hayagriva in other accounts), not in regards to protection from the deluge or dissolution of the Earth. It is also the sages that return the [[Vedas]] to [[Brahma]], not [[Vishnu]] (i.e. in other accounts, such as that below, it is usually the horse-headed avatar also called '[[Hayagriva]]', or the fish avatar, that returns the Vedas to Brahma; Part 8: 91.1-11).\n\nIn the second account, [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] is stated to have had four (i.e. not thirteen) wives: [[Aditi]], [[Diti]], [[Kadru]] and [[Vinata]]. As well as [[Hiranyaksha|Hiranyaksa]] and [[Hiranyakashipu]] ([[Asura|Asuras]] relating to the legends of the [[Varaha]] and [[Narasimha]] avatars, respectively), Diti also gives birth to other demons including Hayagriva and [[Makara]]. \n\nIt is Makara, through performance of severe penances, who enters into the realm of [[Brahma]], steals the [[Vedas]], and enters 'into the great ocean' with them, causing ruin to the world. Reminiscent of the legend of [[Kurma]], Brahma, 'surrounded by the hosts of all gods, went to the [[Samudra manthan|Milky Ocean]], and seeking refuge of god ([[Vishu]])' informs Him of what has happened. Vishnu 'thus addressed by Brahma, resorted to the Fish-form [Matsya] and entered the great ocean' before then adopting the form of a [[crocodile]] to kill Makara and return the Vedas, [[Vedanga|Vedangas]], and Upangas to Brahma. Other details include:\n\n<br />\n\n* [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]] was created from a sacrifice by [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] to produce a son (Part 1: 8.75-77) and alternated between being man for one month (called Sudyumna) and woman in another; made  pregnant by [[Budha]] (Part 1: 8.118-119)\n* Matsya is listed as first in the [[Dashavatara]], the ten primary incarnations of [[Vishnu]] (Part 7: 66.44-54 and 71.23-29 and Part 9: 229.40-44)\n* 'That [<nowiki/>[[Shaligram|salagrama]]] stone which is long, has a golden complexion, and adorned with three lines, is known as 'Matsya', and gives the fruit like enjoyments and salvation' (Part 8: 120.51b-73)\n* It is stated about [[Vishnu]] that 'You are the Fish holding the [[Vedas]]' (Part 9: 197.57b-70a) and that 'taking the form of a Fish, extracted the Vedas' (Part 10: Kritayogasara khanda - 6.175-190)\n* It is stated 'The third auspicious covering [of [[Vaikuntha]]] consists of the worlds of Matsya, Kurma, etc.' (Part 9: 228.59-65)\n\n=== Shiva Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Shiva Purana|Shiva]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' Rudra-Samhita II - 2.24-29 ([[Kama]] fish banner and vehicle);<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 2:''' 17.16, Yuddha Khanda - 16.16;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 3:''' Satarudra Samhita - 11.18;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart3|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 3 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 4:''' Uma Samhita - 36; Vayaviya Samhita - 30.56-58, 31.134-136<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart4|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 4 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref>\n|\n|}\nThe legend of Matsya does not seem to be narrated in the [[Shiva Purana]].

The excellent [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danava]] fell on the fourteenth day in the bright half of the month of Madhu (i.e [[Chaitra|Caitra]]).\n\nBy contact of the hands of the Lord he became a fragrant gross of the same name, i.e. Damanaka (Artemisia indica).

He thought that its fragrance should stay as long as the object exists.</poem>|source=Skanda Purana, Unknown translator (1951), Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra-Mahatmya, Chapter 38, Verses 113-117}}\n\nThere are several accounts of Matsya in the [[Skanda Purana]]. In the first, as quoted above, [[Vishnu]] in the form of Matsya destroys the [[Asura]] called Damanaka in the ocean, who turns into fragrant Damanaka grass. This story is in relation to the Matsya Jayanti which takes place in [[Chaitra|Caitra]], as related by the [[Naradiya Purana|Narada Purana]] (Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra-Mahatmya: 38.113-117). From the second account:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Formerly there was an [[Asura]] named Sankha. He was the son of Sagara (Ocean). He usurped the powers of [[Indra]] and other Guardians of the Quarters... on seeing [[Vishnu]] asleep, he took away the [[Vedas]] [to weaken the gods] from the primordial self-born Lord [[Brahma]] from [[Brahmaloka|Satyaloka]]. While they were being carried away by him, the Vedas, out of fear of him, escaped and entered the waters along with the seeds of the Yajnamantras. In search of them, Sankha too entered the ocean. Wandering here and there the [[Daitya]] did not find them together anywhere...\n\n[Vishnu said:] All the Vedas carried away by Sankha now lie submerged in the waters. O Devas, I shall bring them all after killing the son of the Ocean... After saying this, Lord Visnu assumed the form of a Saphari fish and plunged into the water from the sky even as Brahma staying on [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] was watching. After killing [the] Asura Sankha, Visnu went to the forest of Badari. There the Lord called together all the sages and commanded thus: O you all, do search for the Vedas scattered within the waters. Bring them quickly from the midst of the waters of the sea. Till then I shall remain at [[Prayaga]] accompanied by the groups of [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].</poem>|source=Skanda Purana, Unknown translator (1951), Part 6, Karttikamsa-Mahatmya, Chapter 13|author=|title=}}\n[[File:DASWANTH Birth of Brhma and madhu-kaitabha kill by vishnu.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The deaths of [[Madhu-Kaitabha|Madhu and Kaitabha]].]]\nNotably, the second account, as quoted above, is in many respects almost identical to the account in the [[Padma Purana]] (see above), with the exception of being nurtured by [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] (or, in the original account of the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]], [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivasvata]] Manu; Part 6: Karttikamsa-Mahatmya: 13). In the third account, the Asuras [[Madhu-Kaitabha|Madhu and Kaitabha]] steal the [[Vedas]] from [[Brahma]] and enter 'the great ocean'. Mahadeva - i.e. [[Shiva]], not [[Vishnu]] in this account - assumes the form of a Fish, stirs up the ocean, and finds the Vedas in [[Patala]] before destroying the [[Daitya|Daityas]] and returning the Vedas to Brahma (Part 14: Reva Khanda: 9). Notably, in the [[Bhagavata Purana]], it is [[Vishnu]] in the form of [[Hayagriva]] (also the name of another Veda-stealing demon as described above) who retrieves the Vedas from Madhu and Kaitabha.\n\nThe fourth and fifth accounts are brief mentions of Matsya in relation to the legend of the flood and of [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Manu]]. In the fourth account Vishnu states <nowiki>''</nowiki>When you day ends, I shall become a fish and shall support (floating) like a boat, the earth along with its medicinal plants, Manus and others' (Part 7: Ayidhya-Mahatmya: 18.12-20). In the fifth account it is stated 'In order to please [[Brahma]] in a former [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]], the Lord became a Fish, recovered the [[Vedas]] that were immersed in the great sea and handed them over to Brahma' (Part 15: Reva Khanda - 151.8-17). Elsewhere, it is also stated that at the beginning of a new Kalpa, Vishnu in the form of Matsya taught the Vedas to Brahma (Part 19: Prabhasa-Ksetra Mahatmya - 2.20-23). The accounts of Matsya in this Purana are thus primarily concerned with the retrieval or restoration of the Vedas after being stolen by various demons.

The Himalayas are treated as a boundary between the earthly existence and land of salvation beyond. The protection of the fish and its horn represent the sacrifices that help guide Manu to salvation.

They also increased their share of the vote to their highest since [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]].\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] substantially increased their share of the vote and made gains for the first time since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], but did not overtake the Conservatives. Labour received its highest share of the vote in England since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]].\n\nThe [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], led by [[Tim Farron]] saw their previous leader [[Nick Clegg]] lose his seat; as [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] was gained by the Labour candidate, [[Jared O'Mara]]. They also lost their [[2016 Richmond Park by-election|by-election]] gain at [[Richmond Park (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond Park]] to [[Zac Goldsmith]] of the Conservatives; whose resignation on 25 October 2016 triggered the by-election initially. They also gained some seats, including the recovery of [[Twickenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Twickenham]] by former Business Secretary [[Sir Vince Cable]] who had lost it to the Conservatives [[2015 United Kingdom general election|two years previously]]. Cable succeeded Farron as party leader on 20 July 2017.\n\nUKIP saw their share of the vote collapse to almost negligible levels. They failed to gain any new seats and their one success from 2015, [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]], returned to Conservative control. [[Paul Nuttall]] resigned as party leader on 9 June 2017 after finishing in third place at [[Boston and Skegness (UK Parliament constituency)|Boston and Skegness]].\n\nThe [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] decreased its share of the vote and failed to make any gains, but retained [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]]. The party deliberately chose not to contest many seats, in order to give Labour an increased chance of winning over Conservative candidates.\n\n==Regional results==\n\nRegional vote shares and changes are sourced from [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SGkPQqosDbVL9tSX_uMNaXPGiW2z02z2fchDezlyNss/edit#gid=1413119988 Britain Elects].\n\n===East Midlands===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! colspan=\"5\" |Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" |Votes\n|-\n!

They also held [[Exeter (UK Parliament constituency)|Exeter]] for the sixth consecutive time. The other ten constituencies were held by the Conservatives, including treasury minister [[Mel Stride]] and former [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]] minister [[Sir Hugo Swire]], who defeated a challenge by independent candidate [[Claire Wright (politician)|Claire Wright]] in his [[East Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|East Devon constituency]]. The former armed forces minister [[Sir Nick Harvey]] attempted to regain the constituency of [[North Devon]] but the Conservative [[Peter Heaton-Jones]] held it by a margin of 4,332.\n\nIn [[Dorset]] all eight Conservative MPs were re-elected, including the counter-terrorism minister [[Tobias Ellwood]] and former [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster chancellor]] [[Sir Oliver Letwin]].\n\nThe Conservatives held five seats in [[Gloucestershire]], returning former chief whip [[Mark Harper]].

Both parties increased their share of the popular vote. The Liberal Democrats and Greens failed to make any improvement on the 2015 result, while UKIP saw its support collapse.\n\nIn the ceremonial county of West Midlands Labour won twenty seats and the Conservatives won eight. [[Gisela Stuart]] retired and was succeeded in [[Birmingham Edgbaston (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Edgbaston]] by Sandwell councillor [[Preet Gill]], making her the first female [[Sikh]] in the House of Commons. Work & Pensions spokesman [[Jack Dromey]] (husband of [[Harriet Harman]]) was re-elected in [[Birmingham Erdington (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Erdington]].

[[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]], deputy Labour leader, was re-elected in [[West Bromwich East]] and [[Valerie Vaz]], shadow leader of the Commons, held [[Walsall South]].\n\nThe Conservatives made a clean sweep of [[Worcestershire]] for the third consecutive election. Their six MPs included communities secretary [[Sajid Javid]] and three junior ministers ([[Harriet Baldwin]], [[Robin Walker]] and [[Mark Garnier]]).\n\nThe Conservatives also maintained their sweep of [[Shropshire]] from 2015. Five MPs were elected, including [[Philip Dunne (Ludlow MP)|Philip Dunne]] (incumbent Minister of State for Health) and [[Owen Paterson]] (who had headed the [[Northern Ireland Office]] and [[Defra]] under the [[First Cameron ministry|coalition]]).\n\nIn [[Staffordshire]] the Conservatives won nine seats and Labour the remaining three. Junior whips [[Andrew Griffiths (politician)|Andrew Griffiths]] and [[Christopher Pincher]] secured re-election, as did their predecessor [[Michael Fabricant]] in [[Lichfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Lichfield]], while Chief Whip [[Gavin Williamson]] increased his majority by two thousand. The [[Staffordshire Moorlands (UK Parliament constituency)|Moorlands]] gave a third term to culture secretary [[Karen Bradley]].

The Conservatives held the five other seats, electing attorney-general [[Jeremy Wright]], DCLG minister [[Marcus Jones (politician)|Marcus Jones]] and [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|PPS]] [[Mark Pawsey]].\n\nIn [[Herefordshire]] [[Jesse Norman]] and [[Bill Wiggin]] were both returned to Parliament.\n\n===Yorkshire and the Humber===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! colspan=\"5\" |Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" |Votes\n|-\n!

UKIP had polled strongly in 2015 but this year declined to insignificance. The Green Party continued to have negligible presence.\n\nAll three [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] constituencies were held by Labour: [[Diana Johnson]] and [[Karl Turner (British politician)|Karl Turner]] were re-elected by large majorities, while former [[Home Secretary]] [[Alan Johnson]] retired and was replaced by [[Hessle]] town councillor [[Emma Hardy (politician)|Emma Hardy]].\n\nIn the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], the four Conservative MPs ([[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], [[Graham Stuart (politician)|Graham Stuart]], [[Greg Knight]] and [[Andrew Percy]]) were all re-elected with substantially increased shares of the vote.\n\nLabour made a clean sweep across [[South Yorkshire]], holding the thirteen which they had already (including [[Doncaster North]] for former leader [[Ed Miliband]] and [[Doncaster Central]] for former Chief Whip [[Dame Rosie Winterton]]) as well as gaining [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] from the former Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]].\n\nIn [[West Yorkshire]] five Conservatives ([[Craig Whittaker]], [[Alec Shelbrooke]], [[Andrea Jenkyns]], [[Stuart Andrew]] and [[Philip Davies]]) were re-elected. Two others ([[Jason McCartney (politician)|Jason McCartney]] and [[Kris Hopkins]]) were defeated by Labour, as was the only Liberal Democrat [[Greg Mulholland]]. Labour held the fourteen seats it had won in 2015, returning shadow Lord Chancellor [[Richard Burgon]] and leadership contender [[Yvette Cooper]] as well as actress [[Tracy Brabin]] who had been elected [[2016 Batley and Spen by-election|the previous autumn]] following the murder of [[Jo Cox]].\n\nNo constituencies changed allegiance in [[North Yorkshire]]: Labour's [[Rachael Maskell]] was re-elected in [[York Central]] while all seven other seats were held by the Conservatives, including [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household|vice-chamberlain]] and junior whip [[Julian Smith (politician)|Julian Smith]] and transport minister [[Andrew Jones (British politician)|Andrew Jones]].\n\nIn [[North Lincolnshire|North]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]] [[Nick Dakin]] and [[Martin Vickers]] were both re-elected.

They also increased their share of the vote to their highest since [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]].\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] substantially increased their share of the vote and made gains for the first time since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], but did not overtake the Conservatives. Labour received its highest share of the vote in England since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]].\n\nThe [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], led by [[Tim Farron]] saw their previous leader [[Nick Clegg]] lose his seat; as [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] was gained by the Labour candidate, [[Jared O'Mara]]. They also lost their [[2016 Richmond Park by-election|by-election]] gain at [[Richmond Park (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond Park]] to [[Zac Goldsmith]] of the Conservatives; whose resignation on 25 October 2016 triggered the by-election initially. They also gained some seats, including the recovery of [[Twickenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Twickenham]] by former Business Secretary [[Sir Vince Cable]] who had lost it to the Conservatives [[2015 United Kingdom general election|two years previously]]. Cable succeeded Farron as party leader on 20 July 2017.\n\nUKIP saw their share of the vote collapse to almost negligible levels. They failed to gain any new seats and their one success from 2015, [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]], returned to Conservative control.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.
