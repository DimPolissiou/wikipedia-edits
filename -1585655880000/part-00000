One theory of its origin is that it is derived from a [[Latin]] exclamation of joy (''io''). The modern graphical representation is believed to have been born in the Middle Ages. Medieval copyists wrote the Latin word ''io'' at the end of a sentence to indicate joy. The word ''io'' meant \"hurray\". Over time, the ''i'' moved above the ''o'', and the ''o'' became smaller, becoming a point.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Jan V.|year=1991|isbn=0935603646 |title=Graphic Idea Notebook |publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing|Allworth Press New York]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Manunzio |first=Aldo |year=1531 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptNv7Gfa8KcC&dq=manuzio+%22puncto+scilicet+%22  |title=Romani Institutionum grammaticarum libri IIII }}</ref>\nThe only thing you have any questions about how are things that you can get\nThe exclamation mark was first introduced into English printing in the 15th century to show [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and was called the \"sign of admiration or exclamation\"<ref>{{cite book |title= The American Printer: A Manual of Typography, Containing Practical Directions for Managing all Departments of a Printing Office, As Well as Complete Instructions for Apprentices: With Several Useful Tables, Numerous Schemes for Imposing Forms in Every Variety, Hints to Authors, Etc.|edition= Fifteenth - Revised and Enlarged|last= MacKellar|first= Thomas|year= 1885 |publisher= MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan |location= Philadelphia |page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-0YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> or the \"note of admiration\" until the mid-17th century;<ref>{{cite book|last=Truss |first=Lynne|year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3ETv37GqfcC&lpg=PP1&dq=Eats%2C%20Shoots%20%26%20Leaves&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Eats, Shoots & Leaves: the zero tolerance approach to punctuation |publisher=[[Gotham Books]] |location=New York |page=137 |isbn=1-59240-087-6}}</ref> admiration referred to its [[Latin]] sense of wonderment.\n\nThe exclamation mark did not have its own dedicated key on standard manual typewriters before the 1970s.

A space ({{lang|fr|petit espace}}) is used between the last word and the exclamation mark in European French, but not in Canadian French.  One can also combine an exclamation mark with a question mark at the end of a sentence where appropriate.\n\n=== German ===\n[[German language|German]] uses the exclamation mark for several things that English conveys with other [[punctuation]]:\n* It is used at the end of [[imperative mood|imperative]] sentences even when not particularly emphatic: {{lang|de|Ruf mich morgen an!}} ('Call me tomorrow.') A normal full stop, as in English, is fairly common but is considered substandard.\n* A related use is on signs that express a command or interdiction: {{lang|de|Betreten verboten!}} (English: 'No trespassing!').\n* The exclamation mark may also be used in the salutation line of a letter: {{lang|de|Lieber Hans!}} (English: 'Dear Hans,'). However, the use of a [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] is equally correct and is more common.\n\n{{anchor|Greek exclamation mark|Thavmastiko}}<!--linked from Romanization of Greek, Thavmastiko, &c.-->\n\n=== Cantonese ===\nCantonese has not historically used exclamation marks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Usage of exclamation marks is common in written [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and in some [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] speaking regions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The [[Guangdong|Canton]] and [[Hong Kong]] regions, however, generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations; however, an exclamation mark, including in some written representations of colloquy in [[Written Cantonese|Cantonese]], can be used informally to indicate strong feeling. For example, to represent a response of someone surprised by a gift, one could write: \"{{lang|cmn|\u8c22\u8c22!}}\" ({{lang|cmn-Latn|xi\u00e8 xie!}}, \"thanks!\").\n\n===Greek===\nIn [[Modern Greek]], the exclamation mark ({{lang|el|\u0398\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc}}, {{lang|el-Latn|thavmastik\u00f3}}) has been introduced from [[Latin script]]s and is used identically, although without the reluctance seen in [[#English|English usage]].<ref name=nicky>Nicolas, Nick. \"[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation]\". 2005.

Ach!}}, 'Oops! Oh!'), an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by a comma (e.g., {{lang|el|\u03a9\u03c7, \u03be\u03ad\u03c7\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03cc!}}, {{lang|de|\u014cch, x\u00e9chasa to m\u00e1ti t\u012bs kouz\u00ednas anoicht\u00f3!}}, 'Oops!

(typically at the beginning of letters, e.g. {{lang|hu|Kedves P\u00e9ter!}} - 'Dear Peter,').<ref>{{cite web |last1=www.nytud.hu |first1=MTA NYTI |title=A magyar helyes\u00edr\u00e1s szab\u00e1lyai (AkH.) \u2013 helyesiras.mta.hu |url=https://helyesiras.mta.hu/helyesiras/default/akh |website=helyesiras.mta.hu |accessdate=11 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\nGreetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark (e.g. {{lang|hu|J\u00f3 est\u00e9t!}} - 'Good evening.').\n\n=== Spanish ===\n[[File:Billboard at Montju\u00efc, Barcelona (detail).jpg|thumb|Trilingual billboard in [[Barcelona]] (detail), showing the initial exclamation mark for Spanish, but not for [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (top line) and English]]\nIn Spanish, a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an [[Inverted question and exclamation marks|inverted exclamation mark]] (the same also applies to the question mark): {{lang|es|\u00bfEst\u00e1s loco? \u00a1Casi la matas!}}, 'Are you crazy? You almost killed her!'\n\nAs in British English, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at a statement: {{lang|es|Dice que esta noche no va a salir de fiesta (!)}}, 'He said that he's not going to a party tonight(!).' Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark.\n\n=== Turkish ===\n\nIn [[Turkish language|Turkish]], an exclamation mark is used after a sentence or phrase for [[:wikt:emphasis|emphasis]], and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the {{lang|tr|Ordular! \u0130lk hedefiniz Akdenizdir, ileri!}} ('Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean') order by [[Atat\u00fcrk]], {{lang|tr|ordular}} ('the armies') constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses, {{lang|tr|(!)}}, after a sentence or phrase to indicate [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]: {{lang|tr|\u00c7ok iyi bir i\u015f yapt\u0131n (!)}}, 'You've done a very good job \u2013 [[Not!]]'.\n\n=== Limbu ===\n\nIn [[Limbu language|Limbu]], an exclamation mark is used after a Limbu sentence or phrase for [[:wikt:emphasis|emphasis]], and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Limbu sentence ''\u1910\u191a\u1922\u1944 \u1904\u1928\u1918\u1911 \u1902\u1925\u1906\u190c\u1919 Mediterranean, \u191a\u1926\u191b\u1905\u1944'' \u2014 ''Pa\u1e61u! Gh\u014dwapha kh\u014dcatha\u015ba Mediterranean, \u1e61ausa\u1e45a!'' (Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean!). It is further used in parentheses, (\u1944), after a sentence or phrase to indicate [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]: ''\u1916\u1925\u1902\u190c \u1914\u191a\u1917 \u1910\u1924 \u190a\u1907 \u1903\u1926\u1904 (\u1944)'' \u2014 ''R\u014dkhatha ma\u1e61ala pai yancha gaugha (!)'' (You did a very good job \u2014 [[Not!]]).\n\n=== Phonetics ===\n\nIn [[Khoisan languages]], and the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the [[postalveolar click]] sound (represented as ''q'' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] orthography). In [[Unicode]], this letter is properly coded as {{unichar|01C3|latin letter retroflex click}} and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol {{unichar|0021|exclamation mark}} to allow software to deal properly with word breaks.\n\nThe exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a [[Phonetic notation|phonetic symbol]] to indicate that a consonant is [[ejective consonant|ejective]]. More commonly this is represented by an [[apostrophe]], or a [[superscript]] [[glottal stop]] symbol ({{unichar|02c0|Modifier letter glottal stop}}).\n\n=== Interrobang ===\n{{Main|Interrobang}}\n\nThere is a non\u2013standard punctuation mark intended to combine the functions of a question mark and an exclamation mark in English called [[interrobang]], which resembles those marks superimposed over one another (\u203d) but it is seldom seen outside Unicode documentation{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} - the sequence of \"?!\" or \"!?\" is used almost exclusively.\n\n==Proper names==\nAlthough not part of dictionary words, exclamation marks appear in some [[brand names]] and [[trade name]]s, including [[Yum! Brands]] (parent of fast food chains like  [[Taco Bell]] and [[KFC]]) and [[World Wide Web|Web]] services [[Yahoo!]] and [[Joomla!]]. It appears in the titles of stage and screen works, especially comedies and [[musical theatre|musicals]]; examples include the [[game show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', the '60s musical TV show ''[[Shindig!]]''; musicals  ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''; and movies ''[[Airplane!]]'' and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''. Writer [[Elliot S! Maggin]] and cartoonist [[Scott Shaw!]] include exclamation marks in their names. In the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Republican candidate Jeb Bush used \"Jeb!\" as his campaign logo.\n\n===Place names===\nThe [[England|English]] town of [[Westward Ho!]], named after [[Westward Ho! (novel)|the novel]] by [[Charles Kingsley]], is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark. There is a town in [[Quebec]] called [[Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!]], which is spelled with two exclamation marks. The city of [[Hamilton, Ohio]], changed its name to Hamilton! in 1986, but neither the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] nor mapmakers [[Rand McNally]] recognised the change.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hamilton!

The expression {{var|n}}! means \"the product of the [[integers]] from 1 to {{var|n}}\".  For example, 4! (read ''four factorial'') is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24. (0! is defined as 1, which is a [[neutral element]] in [[multiplication]], not multiplied by anything.) Additionally, it can also represent [[uniqueness quantification|uniqueness]] or, if used in front of a number, it can represent a [[subfactorial]].\n\nIn [[linear logic]], the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction.\n\n===Computers===\nIn [[computing]], the exclamation mark is [[ASCII]] [[character (computing)|character]] 33 (21 in [[hexadecimal]]). Due to its availability on even early computers, the character was used for many purposes. The name given to \"!\" by programmers varies according to their background, though it was very common to give it a short name to make reading code aloud easier. \"Bang\"<ref>{{cite book |title= The New Hacker's Dictionary|edition=3rd|last= Raymond|first= Eric S.|year= 1996|publisher= The MIT Press|isbn= 978-0-262-68092-9|page=55}}</ref> is very popular. In the UK the term [[pling]] was popular in the earlier days of computing, whilst in the United States, the term [[Vociferation|shriek]] was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and ''shriek'' is from Stanford or MIT; however, ''shriek'' for the ! sign is found in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dating from the 1860s.\n\nMany computer languages use \"!\" for logical negation; e.g. A&nbsp;[[!=]]&nbsp;B means \"A is [[inequation|not equal]] to B\", and !A means \"not A\" (the logical [[negation]] of A). \n\nEarly [[e-mail]] systems also used the exclamation mark as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as \"[[bang path]]\" notation.\n\nIn the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] protocol, a user's nickname and [[Identifier|ident]] are separated by an exclamation mark in the [[hostmask]] assigned to him or her by the server.\n\nIn [[UNIX]] scripting (typically for [[UNIX shell]] or [[Perl]]), \"!\" is usually used after a \"#\" in the first line of a script, the [[interpreter directive]], to tell the OS what program to use to run the script.  The \"#!\" is usually called a \"hash-bang\" or [[shebang (Unix)|shebang]]. A similar convention for [[PostScript]] files calls for the first line to begin with \"%!\", called \"percent-bang\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5001.DSC_Spec.pdf |title=PostScript Language Document Structuring Conventions (DSC) Specification Version 3.0 |author=Adobe Developer Support |date=25 September 1992 |website=Developer Resources |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |access-date=2016-03-07 |page=92 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417234413/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5001.DSC_Spec.pdf |archive-date=17 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAn exclamation mark starts history expansions in many [[Unix shell]]s such as [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] and [[tcsh]] where <code>!!</code> executes the previous command and <code>!*</code> refers to all of the arguments from the previous command.\n\n[[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[RISC OS]] used filenames starting with pling to create an [[application directory]]: for instance a file called <code>!Run</code> is executed when the folder containing it is double-clicked (holding down shift prevented this).

In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as ''G!'' denoting a geek of no qualifications, ''!d'' denoting not wearing any clothes, ''P!'' denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations, however.\n\n===Video games===\nThe exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that a character is startled or alarmed.

Examples of this would be \"Romantic!Draco\" or \"Vampire!Harry\" from [[Harry Potter]] fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of a character with multiple identities or appearances, such as to distinguish \"Armor!Al\" from \"Human!Al\" in a work based on [[Fullmetal Alchemist]]. The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] action figures, for example, \"Football Player!

Often, few or no [[full stop|periods]] would be used in the entire book.]]\nSome [[comic book]]s, especially [[superhero]] comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other [[hyperbole]]s common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period [[Stan Lee]], as [[Editor-in-Chief]] of [[Marvel Comics]], attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.<ref>Cronin, Brian (January 28, 2010).

One theory of its origin is that it is derived from a [[Latin]] exclamation of joy (''io''). The modern graphical representation is believed to have been born in the Middle Ages. Medieval copyists wrote the Latin word ''io'' at the end of a sentence to indicate joy. The word ''io'' meant \"hurray\". Over time, the ''i'' moved above the ''o'', and the ''o'' became smaller, becoming a point.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Jan V.|year=1991|isbn=0935603646 |title=Graphic Idea Notebook |publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing|Allworth Press New York]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Manunzio |first=Aldo |year=1531 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptNv7Gfa8KcC&dq=manuzio+%22puncto+scilicet+%22  |title=Romani Institutionum grammaticarum libri IIII }}</ref>\n\nThe exclamation mark was first introduced into English printing in the 15th century to show [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and was called the \"sign of admiration or exclamation\"<ref>{{cite book |title= The American Printer: A Manual of Typography, Containing Practical Directions for Managing all Departments of a Printing Office, As Well as Complete Instructions for Apprentices: With Several Useful Tables, Numerous Schemes for Imposing Forms in Every Variety, Hints to Authors, Etc.|edition= Fifteenth - Revised and Enlarged|last= MacKellar|first= Thomas|year= 1885 |publisher= MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan |location= Philadelphia |page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-0YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> or the \"note of admiration\" until the mid-17th century;<ref>{{cite book|last=Truss |first=Lynne|year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3ETv37GqfcC&lpg=PP1&dq=Eats%2C%20Shoots%20%26%20Leaves&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Eats, Shoots & Leaves: the zero tolerance approach to punctuation |publisher=[[Gotham Books]] |location=New York |page=137 |isbn=1-59240-087-6}}</ref> admiration referred to its [[Latin]] sense of wonderment.\n\nThe exclamation mark did not have its own dedicated key on standard manual typewriters before the 1970s.

A normal full stop, as in English, is fairly common but is considered substandard.\n* A related use is on signs that express a command or interdiction: {{lang|de|Betreten verboten!}} (English: 'No trespassing!').\n* The exclamation mark may also be used in the salutation line of a letter: {{lang|de|Lieber Hans!}} (English: 'Dear Hans,'). However, the use of a [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] is equally correct and is more common.\n\n{{anchor|Greek exclamation mark|Thavmastiko}}<!--linked from Romanization of Greek, Thavmastiko, &c.-->\n\n=== Cantonese ===\nCantonese has not historically used exclamation marks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Usage of exclamation marks is common in written [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and in some [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] speaking regions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The [[Guangdong|Canton]] and [[Hong Kong]] regions, however, generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations; however, an exclamation mark, including in some written representations of colloquy in [[Written Cantonese|Cantonese]], can be used informally to indicate strong feeling. For example, to represent a response of someone surprised by a gift, one could write: \"{{lang|cmn|\u8c22\u8c22!}}\" ({{lang|cmn-Latn|xi\u00e8 xie!}}, \"thanks!\").\n\n===Greek===\nIn [[Modern Greek]], the exclamation mark ({{lang|el|\u0398\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc}}, {{lang|el-Latn|thavmastik\u00f3}}) has been introduced from [[Latin script]]s and is used identically, although without the reluctance seen in [[#English|English usage]].<ref name=nicky>Nicolas, Nick. \"[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation]\". 2005. Accessed 7 Oct 2014.  {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |date=August 6, 2012 }}</ref> A minor grammatical difference is that, while a series of interjections each employ an exclamation mark (e.g., {{lang|el|\u03a9\u03c7! \u0391\u03c7!}}, {{lang|el-Latn|\u014cch! Ach!}}, 'Oops! Oh!'), an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by a comma (e.g., {{lang|el|\u03a9\u03c7, \u03be\u03ad\u03c7\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03c4\u03cc!}}, {{lang|de|\u014cch, x\u00e9chasa to m\u00e1ti t\u012bs kouz\u00ednas anoicht\u00f3!}}, 'Oops! I left the stove on.').\n\n=== Hungarian ===\nIn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], an exclamation mark is put at the end of exclamations, imperative or prohibitive sentences, and sentences expressing a wish (e.g. {{lang|hu|De sz\u00e9p!}} - 'How beautiful!', {{lang|hu|A f\u0171re l\u00e9pni tilos!}} - 'Do not step on the grass.', {{lang|hu|B\u00e1rcsak siker\u00fclne a tervem!}} - 'If only my plan worked out.').\nThe use of the exclamation mark is also needed when addressing someone and the addressing is a separate sentence. (typically at the beginning of letters, e.g. {{lang|hu|Kedves P\u00e9ter!}} - 'Dear Peter,').<ref>{{cite web |last1=www.nytud.hu |first1=MTA NYTI |title=A magyar helyes\u00edr\u00e1s szab\u00e1lyai (AkH.) \u2013 helyesiras.mta.hu |url=https://helyesiras.mta.hu/helyesiras/default/akh |website=helyesiras.mta.hu |accessdate=11 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\nGreetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark (e.g. {{lang|hu|J\u00f3 est\u00e9t!}} - 'Good evening.').\n\n=== Spanish ===\n[[File:Billboard at Montju\u00efc, Barcelona (detail).jpg|thumb|Trilingual billboard in [[Barcelona]] (detail), showing the initial exclamation mark for Spanish, but not for [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (top line) and English]]\nIn Spanish, a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an [[Inverted question and exclamation marks|inverted exclamation mark]] (the same also applies to the question mark): {{lang|es|\u00bfEst\u00e1s loco? \u00a1Casi la matas!}}, 'Are you crazy? You almost killed her!'\n\nAs in British English, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at a statement: {{lang|es|Dice que esta noche no va a salir de fiesta (!)}}, 'He said that he's not going to a party tonight(!).' Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark.\n\n=== Turkish ===\n\nIn [[Turkish language|Turkish]], an exclamation mark is used after a sentence or phrase for [[:wikt:emphasis|emphasis]], and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the {{lang|tr|Ordular! \u0130lk hedefiniz Akdenizdir, ileri!}} ('Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean') order by [[Atat\u00fcrk]], {{lang|tr|ordular}} ('the armies') constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses, {{lang|tr|(!)}}, after a sentence or phrase to indicate [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]: {{lang|tr|\u00c7ok iyi bir i\u015f yapt\u0131n (!)}}, 'You've done a very good job \u2013 [[Not!]]'.\n\n=== Limbu ===\n\nIn [[Limbu language|Limbu]], an exclamation mark is used after a Limbu sentence or phrase for [[:wikt:emphasis|emphasis]], and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Limbu sentence ''\u1910\u191a\u1922\u1944 \u1904\u1928\u1918\u1911 \u1902\u1925\u1906\u190c\u1919 Mediterranean, \u191a\u1926\u191b\u1905\u1944'' \u2014 ''Pa\u1e61u! Gh\u014dwapha kh\u014dcatha\u015ba Mediterranean, \u1e61ausa\u1e45a!'' (Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean!). It is further used in parentheses, (\u1944), after a sentence or phrase to indicate [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]: ''\u1916\u1925\u1902\u190c \u1914\u191a\u1917 \u1910\u1924 \u190a\u1907 \u1903\u1926\u1904 (\u1944)'' \u2014 ''R\u014dkhatha ma\u1e61ala pai yancha gaugha (!)'' (You did a very good job \u2014 [[Not!]]).\n\n=== Phonetics ===\n\nIn [[Khoisan languages]], and the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the [[postalveolar click]] sound (represented as ''q'' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] orthography). In [[Unicode]], this letter is properly coded as {{unichar|01C3|latin letter retroflex click}} and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol {{unichar|0021|exclamation mark}} to allow software to deal properly with word breaks.\n\nThe exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a [[Phonetic notation|phonetic symbol]] to indicate that a consonant is [[ejective consonant|ejective]]. More commonly this is represented by an [[apostrophe]], or a [[superscript]] [[glottal stop]] symbol ({{unichar|02c0|Modifier letter glottal stop}}).\n\n=== Interrobang ===\n{{Main|Interrobang}}\n\nThere is a non\u2013standard punctuation mark intended to combine the functions of a question mark and an exclamation mark in English called [[interrobang]], which resembles those marks superimposed over one another (\u203d) but it is seldom seen outside Unicode documentation{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} - the sequence of \"?!\" or \"!?\" is used almost exclusively.\n\n==Proper names==\nAlthough not part of dictionary words, exclamation marks appear in some [[brand names]] and [[trade name]]s, including [[Yum! Brands]] (parent of fast food chains like  [[Taco Bell]] and [[KFC]]) and [[World Wide Web|Web]] services [[Yahoo!]] and [[Joomla!]]. It appears in the titles of stage and screen works, especially comedies and [[musical theatre|musicals]]; examples include the [[game show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', the '60s musical TV show ''[[Shindig!]]''; musicals  ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''; and movies ''[[Airplane!]]'' and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''. Writer [[Elliot S! Maggin]] and cartoonist [[Scott Shaw!]] include exclamation marks in their names. In the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Republican candidate Jeb Bush used \"Jeb!\" as his campaign logo.\n\n===Place names===\nThe [[England|English]] town of [[Westward Ho!]], named after [[Westward Ho! (novel)|the novel]] by [[Charles Kingsley]], is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark. There is a town in [[Quebec]] called [[Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!]], which is spelled with two exclamation marks. The city of [[Hamilton, Ohio]], changed its name to Hamilton! in 1986, but neither the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] nor mapmakers [[Rand McNally]] recognised the change.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hamilton!

These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow [[triangle]] with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle with a red border is common on [[Europe]]an [[Warning sign|road warning signs]].\n\n[[File:Cattle stop sign - New Zealand.jpg|thumb|New Zealand road sign warning of a \"cattle stop\" ([[cattle grid]]/cattle guard)]]\n\n==Unicode and HTML==\n* {{unichar|0021|EXCLAMATION MARK}} (HTML <code>&amp;#33;</code>, <code>&amp;excl;</code>{{efn|group=lower-alpha|HTML5 is the only version of HTML that has a named entity for the exclamation mark.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html |title=24 Character entity references in HTML 4 |access-date=April 7, 2018 |work=[[w3.org]] |quote=The following sections present the complete lists of character entity references}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-html5-20140731/syntax.html#named-character-references |title=A vocabulary and associated APIs for HTML and XHTML |date=July 31, 2014 |access-date=April 7, 2018 |work=[[w3.org]] |quote=excl;}}</ref>}})\n\nRelated forms are encoded:\n* {{unichar|00a1|INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}}\n* {{unichar|01c3|LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK|use=IPA|html=}} (In IPA: [[alveolar click]])\n* {{unichar|203C|DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}} (for use in vertical text)\n* {{unichar|2048|QUESTION EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}} (for use in vertical text)\n* {{unichar|2049|EXCLAMATION QUESTION MARK|html=}} (for use in vertical text)\n* {{unichar|26A0|WARNING SIGN |html=}} (exclamation mark in triangle)\n* {{unichar|2755|WHITE EXCLAMATION MARK ORNAMENT|html=}} (in Unicode lingo, \"white\" means hollow)\n* {{unichar|2757|HEAVY EXCLAMATION MARK SYMBOL|html=}}\n* {{unichar|2762|HEAVY EXCLAMATION MARK ORNAMENT|html=}}\n* {{unichar|2763|HEAVY HEART EXCLAMATION MARK ORNAMENT|html=}}\n* {{unichar|A71D|MODIFIER LETTER RAISED EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}}\n* {{unichar|A71E|MODIFIER LETTER RAISED INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}}\n* {{unichar|A71F|MODIFIER LETTER LOW INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}}\n* {{unichar|FE57|SMALL EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}} (for special applications within [[CJK characters|CJK]] text)\n* {{unichar|FF01|FULLWIDTH EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}} (for special applications within [[CJK characters|CJK]] text)\n* {{unichar|1F574|MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING|html=}} (a humanized exclamation mark imported from [[Webdings]])\n* {{unichar|E0021|TAG EXCLAMATION MARK|html=}}\nSome scripts have their own exclamation mark:\n\n* {{unichar|055C|ARMENIAN EXCLAMATION MARK|nlink=Armenian alphabet}}\n* {{unichar|07F9|NKO EXCLAMATION MARK|nlink=N'Ko script}}\n* {{unichar|109F|MYANMAR SYMBOL SHAN EXCLAMATION|nlink=Burmese script|use=lang|use2=my}}\n* {{unichar|1944|LIMBU EXCLAMATION MARK|nlink=Limbu script}}\n\n==Use in various fields==\n\n===Mathematics and formal logic===\n{{anchor|Mathematics|reason=Original heading title.}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the symbol represents the [[factorial]] operation. The expression {{var|n}}! means \"the product of the [[integers]] from 1 to {{var|n}}\".  For example, 4! (read ''four factorial'') is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24. (0! is defined as 1, which is a [[neutral element]] in [[multiplication]], not multiplied by anything.) Additionally, it can also represent [[uniqueness quantification|uniqueness]] or, if used in front of a number, it can represent a [[subfactorial]].\n\nIn [[linear logic]], the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction.\n\n===Computers===\nIn [[computing]], the exclamation mark is [[ASCII]] [[character (computing)|character]] 33 (21 in [[hexadecimal]]). Due to its availability on even early computers, the character was used for many purposes. The name given to \"!\" by programmers varies according to their background, though it was very common to give it a short name to make reading code aloud easier. \"Bang\"<ref>{{cite book |title= The New Hacker's Dictionary|edition=3rd|last= Raymond|first= Eric S.|year= 1996|publisher= The MIT Press|isbn= 978-0-262-68092-9|page=55}}</ref> is very popular. In the UK the term [[pling]] was popular in the earlier days of computing, whilst in the United States, the term [[Vociferation|shriek]] was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and ''shriek'' is from Stanford or MIT; however, ''shriek'' for the ! sign is found in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dating from the 1860s.\n\nMany computer languages use \"!\" for logical negation; e.g. A&nbsp;[[!=]]&nbsp;B means \"A is [[inequation|not equal]] to B\", and !A means \"not A\" (the logical [[negation]] of A). \n\nEarly [[e-mail]] systems also used the exclamation mark as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as \"[[bang path]]\" notation.\n\nIn the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] protocol, a user's nickname and [[Identifier|ident]] are separated by an exclamation mark in the [[hostmask]] assigned to him or her by the server.\n\nIn [[UNIX]] scripting (typically for [[UNIX shell]] or [[Perl]]), \"!\" is usually used after a \"#\" in the first line of a script, the [[interpreter directive]], to tell the OS what program to use to run the script.  The \"#!\" is usually called a \"hash-bang\" or [[shebang (Unix)|shebang]]. A similar convention for [[PostScript]] files calls for the first line to begin with \"%!\", called \"percent-bang\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5001.DSC_Spec.pdf |title=PostScript Language Document Structuring Conventions (DSC) Specification Version 3.0 |author=Adobe Developer Support |date=25 September 1992 |website=Developer Resources |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |access-date=2016-03-07 |page=92 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417234413/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5001.DSC_Spec.pdf |archive-date=17 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAn exclamation mark starts history expansions in many [[Unix shell]]s such as [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] and [[tcsh]] where <code>!!</code> executes the previous command and <code>!*</code> refers to all of the arguments from the previous command.\n\n[[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[RISC OS]] used filenames starting with pling to create an [[application directory]]: for instance a file called <code>!Run</code> is executed when the folder containing it is double-clicked (holding down shift prevented this).

The \"!\" operator \"force unwraps\" an option type, causing an error if it is nil.\n\nIn [[Geek Code]] version 3, \"!\" is used before a letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as ''G!'' denoting a geek of no qualifications, ''!d'' denoting not wearing any clothes, ''P!'' denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations, however.\n\n===Video games===\nThe exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that a character is startled or alarmed. In the ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]]'' and ''[[Paper Mario]]'' series, an exclamation mark appears over enemies' heads when they notice the player.\n\nIn [[Massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer online (MMO)]] games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', an exclamation mark hovering over a character's head indicates that they are offering a quest for the player to complete.\n\nIn the 2005 arcade dance simulation game ''[[In the Groove 2]]'', there is a song titled \"!\" (also referred to as \"bang\") by the artist Onyx.\n\n===Internet culture===\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\nIn recent [[Internet#Social impact|Internet culture]], especially where [[leet]] is used, multiple exclamation marks may be affixed with the numeral \"1\" as in ''!!!!!!111''. The notation originates from a common error: when typing multiple exclamation points quickly, the typist may fail to hold the {{keypress|[[shift key|shift]]}}{{keypress|1}} combination that produces the exclamation mark on many [[keyboard layout]]s.

Examples of this would be \"Romantic!Draco\" or \"Vampire!Harry\" from [[Harry Potter]] fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of a character with multiple identities or appearances, such as to distinguish \"Armor!Al\" from \"Human!Al\" in a work based on [[Fullmetal Alchemist]]. The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] action figures, for example, \"Football Player! Leonardo\", \"Rockstar! Raphael\", and \"Breakdancer!

Often, few or no [[full stop|periods]] would be used in the entire book.]]\nSome [[comic book]]s, especially [[superhero]] comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other [[hyperbole]]s common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period [[Stan Lee]], as [[Editor-in-Chief]] of [[Marvel Comics]], attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.<ref>Cronin, Brian (January 28, 2010).
