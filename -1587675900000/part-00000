He was the only son of martial artist and film star [[Bruce Lee]]. As a child from visiting his father's sets, who at the time was a major [[martial arts film]] leading man, Lee developed the desire to become an actor. Lee was 8 years old when his father died, becoming an iconic figure of both the art and the film genre he specialized in. Lee pursued his goal of being a thespian, he then studied the craft at the [[Emerson College]] and the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]]. Wanting to escape his father's image to become a dramatic actor, Lee figured that acting in action oriented films would eventually lead him to other types of roles. After a stint doing local theater, Lee made his screen debut opposite [[David Carradine]] in the 1986 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s television film ''[[Kung Fu: The Movie]]'', a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the 1970s television series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]],'' where he received second billing and starred in his first leading role in [[Ronny Yu]]'s [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action film]] ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'' that same year.\n\nShortly after, on television, Lee played a lead in the [[television pilot|pilot]] ''[[Kung Fu: The Next Generation]]'' (1987), guest starred in an episode of the television series ''[[Ohara (TV series)|Ohara]]'' (1988).  Following this, Lee was the lead in the low budget action film ''[[Laser Mission]]'' (1989), the US direct to video release of it proved to be financially successful. In the 1990s, he started working with major Hollywood studios and his first American theatrical release was the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]]' [[buddy cop]] [[action film]] ''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]'' (1991), directed by [[Mark L. Lester]] and co-starring [[Dolph Lundgren]]. By critics described it as an overwhelmingly silly action film and didn't like it upon release, but found appreciation in retrospective for that same reason. This was followed with the leading role in [[Dwight H. Little]]'s ''[[Rapid Fire (1992 film)|Rapid Fire]]'' (1992) produced by [[20th Century Fox]], where Lee also did the fight choreography. While some critics liked the film, most felt the script was too simple, however almost all described Lee to be charismatic, in a slick Hollywood action film.\n\nIn 1992, he landed his breakthrough role as Eric Draven in [[Alex Proyas]]'s ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' (1994), based on the comic book [[The Crow|of the same name]], which would be his final film.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Bruce Lee - son.jpg|thumb|left|Brandon and his father [[Bruce Lee]] c. 1966]]\nBrandon was born on February 1, 1965, in [[Oakland, California]], the son of martial artist and actor Bruce Lee and [[Linda Lee Cadwell]] (n\u00e9e Emery). The family moved to [[Los Angeles]], California, when he was three months old. From a young age, Lee learned martial arts from his father, who at the time was a major martial arts movie star.

(For film scenes that utilize a revolver where the bullets are visible from the front and do not require the gun to actually be fired, dummy cartridges provide the realistic appearance of actual rounds.)\n\nInstead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film's [[Running crew#Stage management|prop crew]] created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge and then reinserting the bullets. However, they unknowingly or unintentionally left the live [[primer (firearm)|primer]] in place at the rear of the cartridge. At some point during filming, the revolver was apparently discharged with one of these improperly deactivated cartridges in the chamber, setting off the primer with enough force to drive the bullet partway into the barrel, where it became stuck (a condition known as a [[squib load]]). The prop crew either failed to notice this or failed to recognize the significance of this issue.\n\nIn the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be fired at Lee from a distance of 3.6\u20134.5 meters (12\u201315 feet), the dummy cartridges were exchanged with [[blank rounds]], which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. However, since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him.<ref>{{cite news|title= Brandon Lee's Mother Claims Negligence Caused His Death : Movies: Linda Lee Cadwell sues 14 entities regarding the actor's 'agonizing pain, suffering and untimely death' last March on the North Carolina set of 'The Crow' | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date=August 11, 1993|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-11/entertainment/ca-22553_1_linda-lee-cadwell | accessdate =2010-12-04|first=Terry|last= Pristin}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title= The Brief Life and Unnecessary Death of Brandon Lee|magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 16, 1993|url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306206,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-07|first=Mark|last=Harris}}</ref> He was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], where he underwent six hours of surgery.\n\nAttempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead on March 31, 1993 at 1:03&nbsp;pm.

And these barriers are such things as when you come up against your own limitations, when you come up against the limitations of your will, your ability, your natural ability, your courage, how you deal with success\u2014and failure as well, for that matter. And as you overcome each one of these barriers, you end up learning something about yourself. And sometimes, the things you learn about yourself can, to the individual, seem to convey a certain spiritual sense along with them.\n\n...It's funny, every time you come up against a true barrier to your progress, you are a child again. And it's a very interesting experience to be reduced, once again, to the level of knowing nothing about what you're doing. I think there's a lot of room for learning and growth when that happens\u2014if you face it head on and don't choose to say, \"Ah, screw that! I'm going to do something else!\"\n\nWe reduce ourselves at a certain point in our lives to kind of solely pursuing things that we already know how to do. You know, because you don't want to have that experience of not knowing what you're doing and being an amateur again. And I think that's rather unfortunate. It's so much more interesting and usually illuminating to put yourself in a situation where you don't know what's going to happen, than to do something again that you already know essentially what the outcome will be within three or four points either way.<ref name=\"warriorwithin150\">{{cite book | last = Little | first = John | title = The Warrior Within \u2013 The philosophies of Bruce Lee to better understand the world around you and achieve a rewarding life | publisher = Contemporary Books | year = 1996 | page = [https://archive.org/details/warriorwithinphi00litt/page/150 150] | isbn = 0-8092-3194-8 | url = https://archive.org/details/warriorwithinphi00litt/page/150 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Film\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[Legacy of Rage]]''\n|Brandon Mac\n|Alternative title: ''Long Zai Jiang Hu, Dragon Blood''\n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Laser Mission]]''\n|Michael Gold\n|Alternative titles: ''Mercenary Man'', ''Soldier of Fortune''\n|-\n|1991\n|''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]''\n|Johnny Murata\n|\n|-\n|1992\n|''[[Rapid Fire (1992 film)|Rapid Fire]]''\n|Jake Lo\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''\n|[[Crow (comics)|Eric Draven/The Crow]]\n|Shot and killed as a result of negligence during filming.

He was the only son of martial artist and film star [[Bruce Lee]]. As a child from visiting his father's sets, who at the time was a major [[martial arts film]] leading man, Lee developed the desire to become an actor. Lee was 8 years old when his father died, becoming an iconic figure of both the art and the film genre he specialized in. Lee pursued his goal of being a thespian, he then studied the craft at the [[Emerson College]] and the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]]. Wanting to escape his father's image to become a dramatic actor, Lee figured that acting in action oriented films would eventually lead him to other types of roles. After a stint doing local theater, Lee made his screen debut opposite [[David Carradine]] in the 1986 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s television film ''[[Kung Fu: The Movie]]'', a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the 1970s television series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]],'' where he received second billing and starred in his first leading role in [[Ronny Yu]]'s [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action film]] ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'' that same year.\n\nShortly after, on television, Lee played a lead in the [[television pilot|pilot]] ''[[Kung Fu: The Next Generation]]'' (1987), guest starred in an episode of the television series ''[[Ohara (TV series)|Ohara]]'' (1988).  Following this, Lee was the lead in the low budget action film ''[[Laser Mission]]'' (1989), the US direct to video release of it proved to be financially successful. In the 1990s, he started working with major Hollywood studios and his first American theatrical release was the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]]' [[buddy cop]] [[action film]] ''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]'' (1991), directed by [[Mark L. Lester]] and co-starring [[Dolph Lundgren]]. By critics described it as an overwhelmingly silly action film and didn't like it upon release, but found appreciation in retrospective for that same reason. This was followed with the leading role in [[Dwight H. Little]]'s ''[[Rapid Fire (1992 film)|Rapid Fire]]'' (1992) produced by [[20th Century Fox]], where Lee also did the fight choreography. While some critics liked the film, most felt the script was too simple, however almost all described Lee to be charismatic, in a slick Hollywood action film.\n\nIn 1992, he landed his breakthrough role as Eric Draven in [[Alex Proyas]]'s ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' (1994), based on the comic book [[The Crow|of the same name]], which would be his final film.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Bruce Lee - son.jpg|thumb|left|Brandon and his father [[Bruce Lee]] c. 1966]]\nBrandon was born on February 1, 1965, in [[Oakland, California]], the son of martial artist and actor Bruce Lee and [[Linda Lee Cadwell]] (n\u00e9e Emery).

(For film scenes that utilize a revolver where the bullets are visible from the front and do not require the gun to actually be fired, dummy cartridges provide the realistic appearance of actual rounds.)\n\nInstead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film's [[Running crew#Stage management|prop crew]] created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge and then reinserting the bullets. However, they unknowingly or unintentionally left the live [[primer (firearm)|primer]] in place at the rear of the cartridge. At some point during filming, the revolver was apparently discharged with one of these improperly deactivated cartridges in the chamber, setting off the primer with enough force to drive the bullet partway into the barrel, where it became stuck (a condition known as a [[squib load]]). The prop crew either failed to notice this or failed to recognize the significance of this issue.\n\nIn the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be fired at Lee from a distance of 3.6\u20134.5 meters (12\u201315 feet), the dummy cartridges were exchanged with [[blank rounds]], which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. However, since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him.<ref>{{cite news|title= Brandon Lee's Mother Claims Negligence Caused His Death : Movies: Linda Lee Cadwell sues 14 entities regarding the actor's 'agonizing pain, suffering and untimely death' last March on the North Carolina set of 'The Crow' | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=August 11, 1993|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-11/entertainment/ca-22553_1_linda-lee-cadwell | accessdate =2010-12-04|first=Terry|last= Pristin}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title= The Brief Life and Unnecessary Death of Brandon Lee|magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 16, 1993|url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306206,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-07|first=Mark|last=Harris}}</ref> He was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], where he underwent six hours of surgery.\n\nAttempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead on March 31, 1993 at 1:03&nbsp;pm.

And these barriers are such things as when you come up against your own limitations, when you come up against the limitations of your will, your ability, your natural ability, your courage, how you deal with success&mdash;and failure as well, for that matter. And as you overcome each one of these barriers, you end up learning something about yourself. And sometimes, the things you learn about yourself can, to the individual, seem to convey a certain spiritual sense along with them.\n\n...It's funny, every time you come up against a true barrier to your progress, you are a child again. And it's a very interesting experience to be reduced, once again, to the level of knowing nothing about what you're doing. I think there's a lot of room for learning and growth when that happens&mdash;if you face it head on and don't choose to say, \"Ah, screw that! I'm going to do something else!\"\n\nWe reduce ourselves at a certain point in our lives to kind of solely pursuing things that we already know how to do. You know, because you don't want to have that experience of not knowing what you're doing and being an amateur again. And I think that's rather unfortunate. It's so much more interesting and usually illuminating to put yourself in a situation where you don't know what's going to happen, than to do something again that you already know essentially what the outcome will be within three or four points either way.<ref name=\"warriorwithin150\">{{cite book | last = Little | first = John | title = The Warrior Within - The philosophies of Bruce Lee to better understand the world around you and achieve a rewarding life | publisher = Contemporary Books | year = 1996 | page = [https://archive.org/details/warriorwithinphi00litt/page/150 150] | isbn = 0-8092-3194-8 | url = https://archive.org/details/warriorwithinphi00litt/page/150 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Film\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[Legacy of Rage]]''\n|Brandon Mac\n|Alternative title: ''Long Zai Jiang Hu, Dragon Blood''\n|-\n|1989\n|''[[Laser Mission]]''\n|Michael Gold\n|Alternative titles: ''Mercenary Man'', ''Soldier of Fortune''\n|-\n|1991\n|''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]''\n|Johnny Murata\n|\n|-\n|1992\n|''[[Rapid Fire (1992 film)|Rapid Fire]]''\n|Jake Lo\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''\n|[[Crow (comics)|Eric Draven/The Crow]]\n|Shot and killed as a result of negligence during filming.

Under the [[city commission government]], Connor had responsibility for administrative oversight of the Birmingham Fire Department and the [[Birmingham Police Department (Alabama)|Birmingham Police Department]], which also had their own chiefs. Connor was a [[Southern Democrat]].\n\nConnor enforced legal [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and denied [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] to black citizens, especially during the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]'s [[Birmingham campaign]] of 1963. He became an international symbol of institutional racism. Bull Connor directed the use of [[fire hose]]s and police [[attack dog]]s against civil rights activists; child protestors were also subject to these attacks.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/story/07_c.html \"Eyes on the Prize\", including video of Connor], PBS</ref><ref>[http://www2.nbc13.com/vtm/news/local/article/bull_connors_tank_returns_to_birmingham/39865/ \"Connor's Tank Returns to Birmingham\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130111064311/http://www2.nbc13.com/vtm/news/local/article/bull_connors_tank_returns_to_birmingham/39865/ |date=2013-01-11 }}, NBC 13</ref> National media broadcast these tactics on television, horrifying much of the country.

Wallace|Henry Wallace]], former Democratic [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Taylor, who had attempted to speak to the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], was arrested for violating Birmingham's racial segregation laws. Connor's effort to enforce the law was sparked by the group's reported [[Communism|communist]] philosophy,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123771194|title=How 'Communism' Brought Racial Equality To The South|publisher=}}</ref> with Connor noting at the time, \"There's not enough room in town for Bull and the Commies.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDuring the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]], Connor led the Alabama delegation in a walkout when the national party included a civil rights plank in its platform.<ref name=\"EOA\" /> The offshoot [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Democratic Party]] (Dixiecrats) nominated [[Strom Thurmond]] for president at its convention in Birmingham's [[Boutwell Memorial Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]].<ref>J.

His forces raided a meeting at the house of African-American activist Reverend [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], where three [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] ministers were attending. He feared that the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] that was under way would spread to Birmingham, in an effort to integrate city buses. He had the ministers arrested on charges of [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], which did not allow a prisoner bail, nor any visitors during the first three days of their incarceration. A federal investigation followed, but Connor refused to cooperate.\n\nShuttlesworth had led civil rights activities despite being threatened with violence. His church was bombed twice. He, his wife, and a white minister were attacked by a racist mob after attempting to use \"white\" restrooms at the local bus station, which had segregated facilities.\n\nIn 1960, Connor was elected [[Democratic National Committee]]man for [[Alabama]], soon after filing a civil lawsuit against ''[[The New York Times]]'' for $1.5 million. He objected to what he claimed was their insinuation that he had promoted racial hatred. He dropped his claim for damages to $400,000; the case dragged on for six years until Connor lost a $40,000 judgment on appeal.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/11/archives/eugene-bull-connor-dies-at-75-police-head-fought-integration-less.html</ref>\n\n==Freedom Riders==\n{{main|Freedom Riders}}\nIn the spring of 1961, integrated teams of civil rights activists mounted what they called \"Freedom Rides\" to highlight the illegal imposition of racial segregation on interstate buses, whose operations came under federal law and the constitution.

Rather than an at-large election of three commissioners, who had specific oversight of certain city departments, there would be a mayor-council form of government. Members of the city council were to be elected from nine single-member districts. Blacks were still largely disenfranchised. The city had changed its government in response to the extremely negative perception of the city. It had been derisively nicknamed \"[[Bombingham]]\" by outsiders for numerous attacks on civil rights activists and blacks moving into new areas of the city. For instance, in 1961 when the president of the city's [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] was visiting Japan, he saw a newspaper photo of a bus engulfed in flames, which occurred during the [[Freedom Rides]]. Bull Connor arranged for opponents to have time to attack civil rights activists when their bus reached Birmingham.\n\nEndorsed by Governor [[George Wallace|George C.

Connor and his fellow commissioners filed suit to block the change in power, but on May 23, 1963, the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]] ruled against them. Connor ended his 23-year tenure in the post.

The day after the April election, he and local civil rights leaders began \"[[Birmingham campaign|Project 'C']]\" (for \"confrontation\") in Birmingham against the business community. They used economic boycotts and demonstrations to seek integration of stores and job opportunities. Throughout April 1963 Martin Luther King led smaller demonstrations, which resulted in his arrest along with many others.<ref name=\"Segregation at All Costs: Bull Connor and the Civil Rights Movement - YouTube\" >[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9kT1yO4MGg \"Segregation at All Costs: Bull Connor and the Civil Rights Movement\"], YouTube, 8 Apr 2011</ref>\n\nKing wanted to have massive arrests to highlight the brutal police tactics used by Connor and his subordinates. (By extension, the campaign was intended to demonstrate the general suppression by other Southern police officials as well). After King was arrested and jailed, he wrote his ''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]],'' which became noted as an expression of  moral argument for civil rights activism. The goal of the campaign was to gain mass arrests of non-violent protesters and overwhelm the judicial and penal systems. It would also demonstrate to national media and local residents the strong desire of African Americans to exercise their constitutional rights as citizens.\n\n===Children's Crusade===\n{{Main|Children's Crusade (1963)|l1 = Children's Crusade}}\n\nIn the final phase of Project C, [[James Bevel]], SCLC's Director of Direct Action, introduced a revolutionary and controversial new tactic to use young people in the demonstrations. Most adults were working and could not afford to keep losing time at work. On May 2, 1963, the first youths and students walked out of the [[16th Street Baptist Church]] and attempted to march to Birmingham's City Hall to talk to the Mayor. By the end of the day, 959 children, ranging from ages 6\u201318, had been arrested.\n\nThe next day, even more students joined the marches. Connor ordered the use of fire hoses and attack dogs against them. This did not stop the demonstrators, but generated bad publicity for Connor through the news media. The use of fire hoses continued and by May 7, Connor and the police department had jailed more than 3,000 demonstrators.<ref name=\"Segregation at All Costs: Bull Connor and the Civil Rights Movement - YouTube\" />\n\nThe blacks' economic boycott of businesses that refused to hire them and downtown stores that kept segregated facilities helped gain negotiation by the city's business leaders. The SCLC and the Senior Citizens Committee, who represented a majority of Birmingham businesses, came to an agreement. On May 10, they agreed on  desegregation of lunch counters, restrooms, fitting rooms and drinking fountains at department stores, the upgrading in position and hiring of blacks, cooperation with SCLC legal representatives in releasing all jailed persons, and the establishment of formal communication between black and whites through the Senior Citizens Committee.<ref>Nunnelley, William.

He suffered a stroke on December 7, 1966, and he used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He was present on February 16, 1968, when the [[Haleyville, Alabama]] police station made the first use of [[9-1-1]] as an [[emergency telephone number]] in the United States. Months later, Connor won another term, but he was defeated in 1972.\n\nHe suffered another stroke on February 26, 1973, which left him unconscious. He died a few weeks later, in March of that year.<ref>\"Eugene 'Bull' Connor Dies at 75\", ''Associated Press'', March 11, 1973</ref> Survivors included his widow, Beara, a daughter and a brother, Edward King Connor.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Legacy==\nConnor's brutality and tolerance for violence against civil rights activists contributed to KKK and other violence against blacks in the city of Birmingham. On a Sunday in September 1963, the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] destroyed a portion of the church basement causing the death of four African-American girls. The church was known as the center of civil rights activities in Birmingham. Ironically, the city and movement leaders had just reached a negotiated agreement on integration of facilities and jobs. The deaths of these innocent children prompted the US Attorney General Robert Kennedy to call Governor George Wallace and threaten to send in federal troops to control violence and bombings in Birmingham. Bombings of homes and churches of black civil rights leaders were so frequent during this period that the city was commonly referred to as \u201cBombingham\u201d.\n\n*Connor is mentioned in contemporary folk singer [[Phil Ochs]]'s 1965 song \"Talking Birmingham Jam\".\n*[[Spike Lee]]'s [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997) (about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], includes footage of Connor and interviews with people describing police tactics during his tenure).\n*Footage of Connor also appears in the film ''[[Our Friend, Martin]],'' in which he is voiced by veteran voice artist [[Frank Welker]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Nunnelley, William A.

He feared that the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] that was under way would spread to Birmingham, in an effort to integrate city buses.

He, his wife, and a white minister were attacked by a racist mob after attempting to use \"white\" restrooms at the local bus station, which had segregated facilities.\n\nIn 1960, Connor was elected [[Democratic National Committee]]man for [[Alabama]], soon after filing a civil lawsuit against ''[[The New York Times]]'' for $1.5 million.

After King was arrested and jailed, he wrote his ''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]],'' which became noted as an expression of  moral argument for civil rights activism. The goal of the campaign was to gain mass arrests of non-violent protesters and overwhelm the judicial and penal systems. It would also demonstrate to national media and local residents the strong desire of African Americans to exercise their constitutional rights as citizens.\n\n===Children's Crusade===\n{{Main|Children's Crusade (1963)|l1 = Children's Crusade}}\n\nIn the final phase of Project C, [[James Bevel]], SCLC's Director of Direct Action, introduced a revolutionary and controversial new tactic to use young people in the demonstrations. Most adults were working and could not afford to keep losing time at work. On May 2, 1963, the first youths and students walked out of the [[16th Street Baptist Church]] and attempted to march to Birmingham's City Hall to talk to the Mayor. By the end of the day, 959 children, ranging from ages 6\u201318, had been arrested.\n\nThe next day, even more students joined the marches. Connor ordered the use of fire hoses and attack dogs against them. This did not stop the demonstrators, but generated bad publicity for Connor through the news media. The use of fire hoses continued and by May 7, Connor and the police department had jailed more than 3,000 demonstrators.<ref name=\"Segregation at All Costs: Bull Connor and the Civil Rights Movement - YouTube\" />\n\nThe blacks' economic boycott of businesses that refused to hire them and downtown stores that kept segregated facilities helped gain negotiation by the city's business leaders. The SCLC and the Senior Citizens Committee, who represented a majority of Birmingham businesses, came to an agreement. On May 10, they agreed on  desegregation of lunch counters, restrooms, fitting rooms and drinking fountains at department stores, the upgrading in position and hiring of blacks, cooperation with SCLC legal representatives in releasing all jailed persons, and the establishment of formal communication between black and whites through the Senior Citizens Committee.<ref>Nunnelley, William.

He suffered a stroke on December 7, 1966, and he used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He was present on February 16, 1968, when the [[Haleyville, Alabama]] police station made the first use of [[9-1-1]] as an [[emergency telephone number]] in the United States. Months later, Connor won another term, but he was defeated in 1972.\n\nHe suffered another stroke on February 26, 1973, which left him unconscious. He died a few weeks later, in March of that year.<ref>\"Eugene 'Bull' Connor Dies at 75\", ''Associated Press'', March 11, 1973</ref> Survivors included his widow, Beara, a daughter and a brother, Edward King Connor.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Legacy==\nConnor's brutality and tolerance for violence against civil rights activists contributed to KKK and other violence against blacks in the city of Birmingham. On a Sunday in September 1963, the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] destroyed a portion of the church basement causing the death of four African-American girls. The church was known as the center of civil rights activities in Birmingham. Ironically, the city and movement leaders had just reached a negotiated agreement on integration of facilities and jobs. The deaths of these innocent children prompted the US Attorney General Robert Kennedy to call Governor George Wallace and threaten to send in federal troops to control violence and bombings in Birmingham. Bombings of homes and churches of black civil rights leaders were so frequent during this period that the city was commonly referred to as \u201cBombingham\u201d.\n\n*Connor is mentioned in contemporary folk singer [[Phil Ochs]]'s 1965 song \"Talking Birmingham Jam\".\n*[[Spike Lee]]'s [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997) (about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], includes footage of Connor and interviews with people describing police tactics during his tenure).\n*Footage of Connor also appears in the film ''[[Our Friend, Martin]],'' in which he is voiced by veteran voice artist [[Frank Welker]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Nunnelley, William A.
