The [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|modernizing reforms undertaken by President Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] in the 1920s and 1930s further established secularism in Turkey.\n\nDespite its official secularism, the Turkish government includes the state agency of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]] ({{lang-tr|Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diyanet.gov.tr|title=T.C.

The Presidency of Religious Affairs' budget rose from USD $0.9 billion for the year 2006 to $2.5 billion in 2012.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the role of religion in the state has been a divisive issue, as influential religious factions challenged the complete secularization called for by [[Kemalism]] and the observance of Islamic practices experienced a substantial revival. In the early 2000s (decade), Islamic groups challenged the concept of a secular state with increasing vigor after [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]'s Islamist-rooted [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) came into power in 2002.\n\nTurkey, through the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), recognizes the civil, political, and cultural rights of non-Muslim minorities.

The directorate is criticized by some [[Alevi]] Muslims for not supporting their beliefs and instead favouring only the Sunni faith.\n\nThe [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (''Patrik'') is the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in Turkey, and also serves as the [[Primus inter pares#Religion|spiritual leader]] of all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] throughout the world. The [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarch]] is the head of the Armenian Church in Turkey, while the [[Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]] is led by the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Hahambasi]]'', Turkey's [[Chief Rabbi]], based in Istanbul. These groups have also criticized the Presidency of Religious Affairs for only financially supporting Islam in Turkey.\n\n== Historical Christian sites ==\n[[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]]), the city where \"the disciples were first called Christians\" according to the biblical [[Book of Acts]], is located in modern Turkey, as are most of the areas visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] during his missions. The [[Epistle to the Galatians]], [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], [[Epistle to the Colossians]], [[First Epistle of Peter]], and [[Book of Revelation]] are addressed to recipients in the territory of modern Turkey. Additionally, all of the first [[Ecumenical Council#First seven ecumenical councils|Seven Ecumenical Councils]] that define Christianity for [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christians took place in the territory that is now Turkey. Many [[titular see]]s exist in Turkey, as Anatolia was historically home to a large Christian population for centuries.\n\n==Freedom of religion==\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in Turkey}}\n[[File:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Mehmed II|Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Patriarch Gennadios II of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarch Gennadios II]]. Mehmed II not only allowed the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] to remain active in the city after [[fall of Constantinople|its conquest]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, he also established the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in 1461, as part of the [[Millet system]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] used to regard the Armenian Church as [[heresy|heretic]] and did not allow it to operate inside the [[Walls of Constantinople]].]]\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and Turkey is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=us>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90204.htm|title=Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2007|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date=2007|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTurkey has a democratic government and a [[Secularism in Turkey|strong tradition of secularism]]. Nevertheless, the Turkish state's interpretation of secularism has reportedly resulted in religious freedom violations for some of its non-Muslim citizens. The 2009 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report placed Turkey on its watchlist with countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, the Russian Federation, and Venezuela.<ref name=cirf>{{cite web|url=http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|title=Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|work=U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509151708/http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|archivedate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, according to this report, the situation for Jews in Turkey is better than in other majority Muslim countries. Jews report being able to worship freely and their places of worship having the protection of the government when required. Jews also operate their own schools, hospitals, two elderly homes, welfare institutions, as well as a newspaper. Despite this, concerns have arisen in recent years because of [[2003 Istanbul bombings|attacks by extremists on synagogues in 2003]], as well as [[Antisemitism in Turkey|growing anti-Semitism]] in some sectors of the Turkish media and society.\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]] have also occasionally been subjected to violent societal attacks. In February 2006, an Italian Catholic priest was shot to death in his church in [[Trabzon]], reportedly by a youth angered over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|caricatures of Muhammad in Danish newspapers]]. The government strongly condemned the killing. A 16-year-old boy was subsequently charged with the murder and sentenced to 19 years in prison. In December 2007, a 19-year-old stabbed a Catholic priest outside a church in \u0130zmir; the priest was treated and released the following day. According to newspaper reports, the assailant, who was arrested soon afterwards, admitted that he had been influenced by a recent television program that depicted Christian missionaries as \"infiltrators\" who took advantage of poor people.\n\nThe [[Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul|Armenian Patriarch]], head of the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], also lacks the status of legal personality (unlike the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], who has a government-recognized role), and there is no seminary in Turkey to educate its clerics since the closure of the last remaining seminar by the state, as only 65,000 Armenian Orthodox people live in Turkey. In 2006, the Armenian Patriarch submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education to enable his community to establish a faculty in the Armenian language at a state university with instruction by the Patriarch. Under current restrictions, only the Sunni Muslim community can legally operate institutions to train new clergy in Turkey for future leadership.\n\nPatriarch [[Bartholomew I]], [[primus inter pares|most senior bishop among equals]] in the traditional hierarchy of Orthodox Christianity, said that he felt \"crucified\" living in Turkey under a government that did not recognize the [[ecumenical]] status of Patriarch and which would like to see his Patriarchate die out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6001717n|title=The Patriarch Bartholomew|date=20 December 2009|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government under Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] criticized [[Bartholomew I]], with deputy prime minister [[B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7|Ar\u0131n\u00e7]] saying that the [[Orthodox Church]] enjoyed their religious rights during the AKP's rule, and foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu|Davuto\u011flu]] saying that he hoped that the Patriarch's remarks had been a \"slip of the tongue\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=347858|title=Government Spokesman Criticizes Greek Patriarch Over Crucifixion Remarks|date=21 December 2009|publisher=Turkishpress.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196263-100-gul-backs-ministers-criticism-of-patriarch-bartholomew.html|title=G\u00fcl backs minister's criticism of Patriarch Bartholomew|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> In response to the government's criticism, Bartholomew's lawyer said when the patriarchate was criticizing government, he was referring to the state, not the AKP government in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196532-109-centerbartholomew-crucified-erdogan-suffers-from-hellish-torture1br-i-by-i-brorhan-kemal-cengizcenter.html|title=Bartholomew crucified, Erdo\u011fan suffers from Hellish torture!(1)|date=25 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan said that \"When it comes to the question, 'Are you recognizing [him] as ecumenical?', I wouldn't be annoyed by it [this title].

In the early 2000s (decade), Islamic groups challenged the concept of a secular state with increasing vigor after [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]'s Islamist-rooted [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) came into power in 2002.\n\nTurkey, through the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), recognizes the civil, political, and cultural rights of non-Muslim minorities. In practice, Turkey only recognizes [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], and [[Jewish]] religious minorities. [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi]], and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|C\u00e2fer\u00ee]] Muslims among other Muslim sects,<ref name=\"clarke\">The World of the Alevis: Issues of Culture and Identity, Gloria L.

The directorate is criticized by some [[Alevi]] Muslims for not supporting their beliefs and instead favouring only the Sunni faith.\n\nThe [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (''Patrik'') is the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in Turkey, and also serves as the [[Primus inter pares#Religion|spiritual leader]] of all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] throughout the world. The [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarch]] is the head of the Armenian Church in Turkey, while the [[Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]] is led by the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Hahambasi]]'', Turkey's [[Chief Rabbi]], based in Istanbul. These groups have also criticized the Presidency of Religious Affairs for only financially supporting Islam in Turkey.\n\n== Historical Christian sites ==\n[[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]]), the city where \"the disciples were first called Christians\" according to the biblical [[Book of Acts]], is located in modern Turkey, as are most of the areas visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] during his missions. The [[Epistle to the Galatians]], [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], [[Epistle to the Colossians]], [[First Epistle of Peter]], and [[Book of Revelation]] are addressed to recipients in the territory of modern Turkey. Additionally, all of the first [[Ecumenical Council#First seven ecumenical councils|Seven Ecumenical Councils]] that define Christianity for [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christians took place in the territory that is now Turkey. Many [[titular see]]s exist in Turkey, as Anatolia was historically home to a large Christian population for centuries.\n\n==Freedom of religion==\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in Turkey}}\n[[File:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Mehmed II|Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Patriarch Gennadios II of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarch Gennadios II]]. Mehmed II not only allowed the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] to remain active in the city after [[fall of Constantinople|its conquest]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, he also established the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in 1461, as part of the [[Millet system]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] used to regard the Armenian Church as [[heresy|heretic]] and did not allow it to operate inside the [[Walls of Constantinople]].]]\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and Turkey is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=us>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90204.htm|title=Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2007|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date=2007|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTurkey has a democratic government and a [[Secularism in Turkey|strong tradition of secularism]]. Nevertheless, the Turkish state's interpretation of secularism has reportedly resulted in religious freedom violations for some of its non-Muslim citizens. The 2009 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report placed Turkey on its watchlist with countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, the Russian Federation, and Venezuela.<ref name=cirf>{{cite web|url=http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|title=Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|work=U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509151708/http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|archivedate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, according to this report, the situation for Jews in Turkey is better than in other majority Muslim countries. Jews report being able to worship freely and their places of worship having the protection of the government when required. Jews also operate their own schools, hospitals, two elderly homes, welfare institutions, as well as a newspaper. Despite this, concerns have arisen in recent years because of [[2003 Istanbul bombings|attacks by extremists on synagogues in 2003]], as well as [[Antisemitism in Turkey|growing anti-Semitism]] in some sectors of the Turkish media and society.\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]] have also occasionally been subjected to violent societal attacks. In February 2006, an Italian Catholic priest was shot to death in his church in [[Trabzon]], reportedly by a youth angered over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|caricatures of Muhammad in Danish newspapers]]. The government strongly condemned the killing. A 16-year-old boy was subsequently charged with the murder and sentenced to 19 years in prison. In December 2007, a 19-year-old stabbed a Catholic priest outside a church in \u0130zmir; the priest was treated and released the following day. According to newspaper reports, the assailant, who was arrested soon afterwards, admitted that he had been influenced by a recent television program that depicted Christian missionaries as \"infiltrators\" who took advantage of poor people.\n\nThe [[Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul|Armenian Patriarch]], head of the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], also lacks the status of legal personality (unlike the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], who has a government-recognized role), and there is no seminary in Turkey to educate its clerics since the closure of the last remaining seminar by the state, as only 65,000 Armenian Orthodox people live in Turkey. In 2006, the Armenian Patriarch submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education to enable his community to establish a faculty in the Armenian language at a state university with instruction by the Patriarch. Under current restrictions, only the Sunni Muslim community can legally operate institutions to train new clergy in Turkey for future leadership.\n\nPatriarch [[Bartholomew I]], [[primus inter pares|most senior bishop among equals]] in the traditional hierarchy of Orthodox Christianity, said that he felt \"crucified\" living in Turkey under a government that did not recognize the [[ecumenical]] status of Patriarch and which would like to see his Patriarchate die out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6001717n|title=The Patriarch Bartholomew|date=20 December 2009|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government under Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] criticized [[Bartholomew I]], with deputy prime minister [[B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7|Ar\u0131n\u00e7]] saying that the [[Orthodox Church]] enjoyed their religious rights during the AKP's rule, and foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu|Davuto\u011flu]] saying that he hoped that the Patriarch's remarks had been a \"slip of the tongue\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=347858|title=Government Spokesman Criticizes Greek Patriarch Over Crucifixion Remarks|date=21 December 2009|publisher=Turkishpress.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196263-100-gul-backs-ministers-criticism-of-patriarch-bartholomew.html|title=G\u00fcl backs minister's criticism of Patriarch Bartholomew|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> In response to the government's criticism, Bartholomew's lawyer said when the patriarchate was criticizing government, he was referring to the state, not the AKP government in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196532-109-centerbartholomew-crucified-erdogan-suffers-from-hellish-torture1br-i-by-i-brorhan-kemal-cengizcenter.html|title=Bartholomew crucified, Erdo\u011fan suffers from Hellish torture!(1)|date=25 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan said that \"When it comes to the question, 'Are you recognizing [him] as ecumenical?', I wouldn't be annoyed by it [this title].

{"title_page": "Compton scattering", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Scattering of photons off charged particles}}\n{{Light\u2013matter interaction}}\n'''Compton scattering''', discovered by [[Arthur Compton|Arthur Holly Compton]], is the scattering of a [[photon]] by a [[electric charge|charged]] particle, usually an [[electron]]. It results in a decrease in [[energy]] (increase in [[wavelength]]) of the photon (which may be an [[X-ray]] or [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]), called the '''Compton effect'''. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron. '''Inverse Compton scattering''' occurs when a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon.\n\n== Introduction ==\n[[File:Compton en.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Fig. 1: Schematic diagram of Compton's experiment. Compton scattering occurs in the graphite target on the left. The slit passes X-ray photons scattered at a selected angle. The energy of a scattered photon is measured using [[Bragg scattering]] in the crystal on the right in conjunction with ionization chamber; the chamber could measure total energy deposited over time, not the energy of single scattered photons.]]\n\nCompton scattering is an example of [[inelastic scattering]]<ref>Elastic or [[inelastic scattering]]? The incident photon loses energy in the lab frame, which centuries of practice had identified with inelastic scattering\u2014even though, in the c.m.  frame, the respective masses remaining the same, no new species are created and kinetic energy is conserved,  the mark of an ''elastic collision''. As a result, HEP and nuclear physicists prefer to emphasize elasticity, while atomic and molecular physicists use \"inelastic\".</ref> of light by a free charged particle, where the wavelength of the scattered light is different from that of the incident radiation.  In Compton's original experiment (see Fig. 1), the energy of the X ray photon (\u224817 keV) was very much larger than the binding energy of the atomic electron, so the electrons could be treated as being free.  The amount by which the light's wavelength changes is called the '''Compton shift'''. Although nuclear Compton scattering exists,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nuclear Compton scattering|author=P. Christillin|year=1986|journal= J. Phys. G: Nucl. Phys.|volume=12|pages=837\u2013851|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0305-4616/12/9/008|doi=10.1088/0305-4616/12/9/008|bibcode = 1986JPhG...12..837C|issue=9 }}</ref> Compton scattering usually refers to the interaction involving only the electrons of an atom. The Compton effect was observed by [[Arthur Holly Compton]] in 1923 at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and further verified by his graduate student [[Wu Youxun|Y. H. Woo]] in the years following. Compton earned the 1927 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery.\n\nThe effect is significant because it demonstrates that light cannot be explained purely as a [[wave]] phenomenon.\n<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Griffiths | first = David\n | author-link =\n | title = Introduction to Elementary Particles\n | publisher = Wiley\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition =\n | date = 1987\n | location =\n | pages = 15, 91\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-471-60386-4 }}</ref>\n[[Thomson scattering]], the classical theory of an [[electromagnetic wave]] scattered by charged particles, cannot explain shifts in wavelength at low intensity: classically, light of sufficient intensity for the electric field to accelerate a charged particle to a relativistic speed will cause radiation-pressure recoil and an associated Doppler shift of the scattered light,<ref>{{cite web|title=Observation of the Transition from Thomson to Compton Scattering in Optical Multiphoton Interactions with Electrons|author=C. Moore|year=1995|url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/media/publications/documents/theses/Moore.pdf}}</ref> but the effect would become arbitrarily small at sufficiently low light intensities ''regardless of wavelength''. Thus, light behaves as if it consists of particles, if we are to explain low-intensity Compton scattering. Or the assumption that the electron can be treated as free is invalid resulting in the effectively infinite electron mass equal to the nuclear mass (see e.g. the comment below on elastic scattering of X-rays being from that effect).  Compton's experiment convinced physicists that light can be treated as a stream of particle-like objects (quanta called photons), whose energy is proportional to the light wave's frequency.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, The interaction between an electron and a photon results in the electron being given part of the energy (making it recoil), and a photon of the remaining energy being emitted in a different direction from the original, so that the overall [[momentum]] of the system is also conserved. If the scattered photon still has enough energy, the process may be repeated. In this scenario, the electron is treated as free or loosely bound. Experimental verification of momentum conservation in individual Compton scattering processes by [[Walther Bothe|Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger|Geiger]] as well as by Compton and Simon has been important in disproving the [[BKS theory]].\n\nCompton scattering is one of three competing processes when photons interact with matter.  At energies of a few eV to a few keV, corresponding to [[visible light]] through soft X-rays, a photon can be completely absorbed and its energy can eject an electron from its host atom, a process known as the [[photoelectric effect]]. High energy photons of {{val|1.022|u=MeV}} and above may bombard the nucleus and cause an electron and a positron to be formed, a process called [[pair production]].  Compton scattering is the most important interaction in the intervening energy region.\n\n== Description of the phenomenon ==\n[[Image:Compton-scattering.svg|thumb|200px|right|Fig. 2: A photon of wavelength <math>\\lambda</math> comes in from the left, collides with a target at rest, and a new photon of wavelength <math>\\lambda'</math> emerges at an angle <math>\\theta</math>. The target recoils, carrying away an angle-dependent amount of the incident energy.]]\nBy the early 20th century, research into the interaction of [[X-ray]]s with matter was well under way. It was observed that when X-rays of a known wavelength interact with atoms, the X-rays are scattered through an angle <math>\\theta</math> and emerge at a different wavelength related to <math>\\theta</math>. Although [[classical electromagnetism]] predicted that the wavelength of scattered rays should be equal to the initial wavelength,<ref name=\"taylor_136-9\">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=J.R.|last2=Zafiratos|first2=C.D.|last3=Dubson|first3=M.A.|year=2004|title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-805715-X|pages=136\u20139}}</ref> multiple experiments had found that the wavelength of the scattered rays was longer (corresponding to lower energy) than the initial wavelength.<ref name=\"taylor_136-9\" />\n\nIn 1923, Compton published a paper in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to light quanta (Einstein had proposed light quanta in 1905 in explaining the photo-electric effect, but Compton did not build on Einstein's work). The energy of light quanta depends only on the frequency of the light. In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron.  His paper concludes by reporting on experiments which verified his derived relation:\n:<math>\\lambda' - \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\\cos{\\theta}),</math>\n:where\n:<math>\\lambda</math> is the initial wavelength,\n:<math>\\lambda'</math> is the wavelength after scattering,\n:<math>h</math> is the [[Planck constant]],\n:<math>m_e</math> is the [[electron rest mass]],\n:<math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]], and\n:<math>\\theta</math> is the scattering angle.\n\nThe quantity {{sfrac|''h''|''m<sub>e</sub>c''}} is known as the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron; it is equal to {{val|2.43|e=-12|u=m}}. The wavelength shift {{nowrap|''\u03bb\u2032'' \u2212 ''\u03bb''}} is at least zero (for {{nowrap|''\u03b8'' {{=}} 0\u00b0}}) and at most twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for {{nowrap|''\u03b8'' {{=}} 180\u00b0}}).\n\nCompton found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron.<ref name=\"taylor_136-9\" /> Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10000 times smaller.  This is known as \"coherent\" scattering off the entire atom since the atom remains intact, gaining no internal excitation.\n\nIn Compton's original experiments the wavelength shift given above was the directly-measurable observable.  In modern experiments it is conventional to measure the energies, not the wavelengths, of the scattered photons.  For a given incident energy <math>E_\\gamma = hc/\\lambda</math>, the outgoing final-state photon energy, <math>E_{\\gamma^\\prime}</math>, is given by\n: <math>\nE_{\\gamma^\\prime} = \\frac{E_\\gamma}{1 + (E_\\gamma/m_e c^2)(1-\\cos\\theta)}.\n</math>\n\n=== Derivation of the scattering formula ===\n[[File:ComptonEnergy.jpg|thumb|Fig. 3: Energies of a photon at 500 keV and an electron after Compton scattering.]]\nA photon  {{mvar|\u03b3}}  with wavelength {{mvar|\u03bb}}   collides with an electron {{mvar|e}} in an atom, which is treated as being at rest. The collision causes the electron to [[recoil]], and a new photon {{mvar|\u03b3}}'   with wavelength {{mvar|\u03bb}}'   emerges at angle {{mvar|\u03b8}}  from the photon's incoming path. Let {{mvar|e}}'  denote the electron after the collision. Compton allowed for the possibility that the interaction would sometimes accelerate the electron to speeds sufficiently close to the velocity of light as to require the application of Einstein's [[special relativity]] theory to properly describe its energy and momentum.\n\nAt the conclusion of Compton's 1923 paper, he reported results of experiments confirming the predictions of his scattering formula, thus supporting the assumption that photons carry momentum as well as quantized energy.  At the start of his derivation, he had postulated an expression for the momentum of a photon from equating Einstein's already established mass-energy relationship of <math>E=mc^2</math> to the quantized photon energies of <math>h f</math>, which Einstein had separately postulated.

[[Compton suppression]] is used to detect stray scatter gamma rays to counteract this effect.\n\n=== Magnetic Compton scattering ===\nMagnetic Compton scattering is an extension of the previously mentioned technique which involves the magnetisation of a crystal sample hit with high energy, circularly polarised photons. By measuring the scattered photons' energy and reversing the magnetisation of the sample, two different Compton profiles are generated (one for spin up momenta and one for spin down momenta). Taking the difference between these two profiles gives the magnetic Compton profile  (MCP), given by <math>J_{\\text{mag}}(\\mathbf{p}_z)</math> - a one-dimensional projection of the electron spin density.\n\n<math>J_{\\text{mag}}(\\mathbf{p}_z) = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\iint_{-\\infty}^\\infty (n_{\\uparrow} (\\mathbf{p}) - n_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{p})) d\\mathbf{p}_x d\\mathbf{p}_y</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the number of spin-unpaired electrons in the system, <math>n_\\uparrow(\\mathbf{p})</math> and <math>n_\\downarrow(\\mathbf{p})</math> are the three-dimensional electron momentum distributions for the majority spin and minority spin electrons respectively.\n\nSince this scattering process is [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] (there is no phase relationship between the scattered photons), the MCP is representative of the bulk properties of the sample and is a probe of the ground state. This means that the MCP is ideal for comparison with theoretical techniques such as [[density functional theory]].\nThe area under the MCP is directly proportional to the spin moment of the system and so, when combined with total moment measurements methods (such as [[SQUID]] magnetometry), can be used to isolate both the spin and orbital contributions to the total moment of a system.\nThe shape of the MCP also yields insight into the origin of the magnetism in the system.<ref name=\"Cooper2004\">{{cite book|author=Malcolm Cooper|title=X-Ray Compton Scattering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m58jXIJDs3QC|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=14 October 2004|publisher=[[OUP Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-19-850168-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Inverse Compton scattering ===\nInverse Compton scattering is important in [[astrophysics]].

It results in a decrease in [[energy]] (increase in [[wavelength]]) of the photon (which may be an [[X-ray]] or [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]), called the '''Compton effect'''. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron. '''Inverse Compton scattering''' occurs when a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon.\n\n== Introduction ==\n[[File:Compton en.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Fig. 1: Schematic diagram of Compton's experiment. Compton scattering occurs in the graphite target on the left. The slit passes X-ray photons scattered at a selected angle. The energy of a scattered photon is measured using [[Bragg scattering]] in the crystal on the right in conjunction with ionization chamber; the chamber could measure total energy deposited over time, not the energy of single scattered photons.]]\n\nCompton scattering is an example of [[inelastic scattering]]<ref>Elastic or [[inelastic scattering]]? The incident photon loses energy in the lab frame, which centuries of practice had identified with inelastic scattering\u2014even though, in the c.m.  frame, the respective masses remaining the same, no new species are created and kinetic energy is conserved,  the mark of an ''elastic collision''. As a result, HEP and nuclear physicists prefer to emphasize elasticity, while atomic and molecular physicists use \"inelastic\". </ref> of light by a free charged particle, where the wavelength of the scattered light is different from that of the incident radiation.  In Compton's original experiment (see Fig. 1), the energy of the X ray photon (\u224817 keV) was very much larger than the binding energy of the atomic electron, so the electrons could be treated as being free.  The amount by which the light's wavelength changes is called the '''Compton shift'''. Although nuclear Compton scattering exists,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nuclear Compton scattering|author=P.

The Compton effect was observed by [[Arthur Holly Compton]] in 1923 at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and further verified by his graduate student [[Wu Youxun|Y. H. Woo]] in the years following. Compton earned the 1927 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery.\n\nThe effect is significant because it demonstrates that light cannot be explained purely as a [[wave]] phenomenon.\n<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Griffiths | first = David\n | author-link =\n | title = Introduction to Elementary Particles\n | publisher = Wiley\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition =\n | date = 1987\n | location =\n | pages = 15, 91\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-471-60386-4 }}</ref>\n[[Thomson scattering]], the classical theory of an [[electromagnetic wave]] scattered by charged particles, cannot explain shifts in wavelength at low intensity: classically, light of sufficient intensity for the electric field to accelerate a charged particle to a relativistic speed will cause radiation-pressure recoil and an associated Doppler shift of the scattered light,<ref>{{cite web|title=Observation of the Transition from Thomson to Compton Scattering in Optical Multiphoton Interactions with Electrons|author=C. Moore|year=1995|url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/media/publications/documents/theses/Moore.pdf}}</ref> but the effect would become arbitrarily small at sufficiently low light intensities ''regardless of wavelength''. Thus, light behaves as if it consists of particles, if we are to explain low-intensity Compton scattering. Or the assumption that the electron can be treated as free is invalid resulting in the effectively infinite electron mass equal to the nuclear mass (see e.g. the comment below on elastic scattering of X-rays being from that effect).  Compton's experiment convinced physicists that light can be treated as a stream of particle-like objects (quanta called photons), whose energy is proportional to the light wave's frequency.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, The interaction between an electron and a photon results in the electron being given part of the energy (making it recoil), and a photon of the remaining energy being emitted in a different direction from the original, so that the overall [[momentum]] of the system is also conserved. If the scattered photon still has enough energy, the process may be repeated. In this scenario, the electron is treated as free or loosely bound. Experimental verification of momentum conservation in individual Compton scattering processes by [[Walther Bothe|Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger|Geiger]] as well as by Compton and Simon has been important in disproving the [[BKS theory]].\n\nCompton scattering is one of three competing processes when photons interact with matter.  At energies of a few eV to a few keV, corresponding to [[visible light]] through soft X-rays, a photon can be completely absorbed and its energy can eject an electron from its host atom, a process known as the [[photoelectric effect]]. High energy photons of {{val|1.022|u=MeV}} and above may bombard the nucleus and cause an electron and a positron to be formed, a process called [[pair production]].  Compton scattering is the most important interaction in the intervening energy region.\n\n== Description of the phenomenon ==\n[[Image:Compton-scattering.svg|thumb|200px|right|Fig. 2: A photon of wavelength <math>\\lambda</math> comes in from the left, collides with a target at rest, and a new photon of wavelength <math>\\lambda'</math> emerges at an angle <math>\\theta</math>. The target recoils, carrying away an angle-dependent amount of the incident energy.]]\nBy the early 20th century, research into the interaction of [[X-ray]]s with matter was well under way. It was observed that when X-rays of a known wavelength interact with atoms, the X-rays are scattered through an angle <math>\\theta</math> and emerge at a different wavelength related to <math>\\theta</math>. Although [[classical electromagnetism]] predicted that the wavelength of scattered rays should be equal to the initial wavelength,<ref name=\"taylor_136-9\">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=J.R.|last2=Zafiratos|first2=C.D.|last3=Dubson|first3=M.A.|year=2004|title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-805715-X|pages=136\u20139}}</ref> multiple experiments had found that the wavelength of the scattered rays was longer (corresponding to lower energy) than the initial wavelength.<ref name=\"taylor_136-9\" />\n\nIn 1923, Compton published a paper in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to light quanta (Einstein had proposed light quanta in 1905 in explaining the photo-electric effect, but Compton did not build on Einstein's work). The energy of light quanta depends only on the frequency of the light. In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron.  His paper concludes by reporting on experiments which verified his derived relation:\n:<math>\\lambda' - \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\\cos{\\theta}),</math>\n:where\n:<math>\\lambda</math> is the initial wavelength,\n:<math>\\lambda'</math> is the wavelength after scattering,\n:<math>h</math> is the [[Planck constant]],\n:<math>m_e</math> is the [[electron rest mass]],\n:<math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]], and\n:<math>\\theta</math> is the scattering angle.\n\nThe quantity {{sfrac|''h''|''m<sub>e</sub>c''}} is known as the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron; it is equal to {{val|2.43|e=-12|u=m}}. The wavelength shift {{nowrap|''\u03bb\u2032'' \u2212 ''\u03bb''}} is at least zero (for {{nowrap|''\u03b8'' {{=}} 0\u00b0}}) and at most twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for {{nowrap|''\u03b8'' {{=}} 180\u00b0}}).\n\nCompton found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron.<ref name=\"taylor_136-9\" /> Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10000 times smaller.  This is known as \"coherent\" scattering off the entire atom since the atom remains intact, gaining no internal excitation.\n\nIn Compton's original experiments the wavelength shift given above was the directly-measurable observable.  In modern experiments it is conventional to measure the energies, not the wavelengths, of the scattered photons.  For a given incident energy <math>E_\\gamma = hc/\\lambda</math>, the outgoing final-state photon energy, <math>E_{\\gamma^\\prime}</math>, is given by\n: <math>\nE_{\\gamma^\\prime} = \\frac{E_\\gamma}{1 + (E_\\gamma/m_e c^2)(1-\\cos\\theta)}.\n</math>\n\n=== Derivation of the scattering formula ===\n[[File:ComptonEnergy.jpg|thumb|Fig. 3: Energies of a photon at 500 keV and an electron after Compton scattering.]]\nA photon  {{mvar|\u03b3}}  with wavelength {{mvar|\u03bb}}   collides with an electron {{mvar|e}} in an atom, which is treated as being at rest. The collision causes the electron to [[recoil]], and a new photon {{mvar|\u03b3}}'   with wavelength {{mvar|\u03bb}}'   emerges at angle {{mvar|\u03b8}}  from the photon's incoming path. Let {{mvar|e}}'  denote the electron after the collision. Compton allowed for the possibility that the interaction would sometimes accelerate the electron to speeds sufficiently close to the velocity of light as to require the application of Einstein's [[special relativity]] theory to properly describe its energy and momentum.\n\nAt the conclusion of Compton's 1923 paper, he reported results of experiments confirming the predictions of his scattering formula, thus supporting the assumption that photons carry momentum as well as quantized energy.  At the start of his derivation, he had postulated an expression for the momentum of a photon from equating Einstein's already established mass-energy relationship of <math>E=mc^2</math> to the quantized photon energies of <math>h f</math>, which Einstein had separately postulated. If <math>mc^2 = hf</math>, the equivalent photon mass must be <math>hf/c^2</math>. The photon's momentum is then simply this effective mass times the photon's frame-invariant velocity {{mvar|c}}. For a photon, its momentum <math>p=hf/c</math>, and thus {{math|''hf''}}  can be substituted for {{math|''pc''}}   for all photon momentum terms which arise in course of the derivation below. The derivation which appears in Compton's paper is more terse, but follows the same logic in the same sequence as the following derivation.\n\nThe [[conservation of energy]] <math>E</math> merely equates the sum of energies before and after scattering.\n:<math>E_\\gamma + E_e = E_{\\gamma'} + E_{e'}.\\!</math>\nCompton postulated that photons carry momentum;<ref name=\"taylor_136-9\" /> thus from the [[conservation of momentum]], the momenta of the particles should be similarly related by\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_\\gamma = \\mathbf{p}_{\\gamma'} + \\mathbf{p}_{e'},</math>\n:in which (<math>{p_e}</math>) is omitted on the assumption it is effectively zero.\n\nThe photon energies are related to the frequencies by\n:<math>E_{\\gamma} = hf\\!</math>\n:<math>E_{\\gamma'} = hf'\\!</math>\n:where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].\nBefore the scattering event, the electron is treated as sufficiently close to being at rest that its total energy consists entirely of the mass-energy equivalence of its (rest) mass <math> m_e </math>,\n:<math>E_e = m_ec^2.\\!</math>\nAfter scattering, the possibility that the electron might be accelerated to a significant fraction of the speed of light, requires that its total energy be represented using the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]\n:<math>E_{e'} = \\sqrt{(p_{e'}c)^2 + (m_ec^2)^2} ~.</math>\n\nSubstituting these quantities into the expression for the conservation of energy gives\n:<math>hf + m_e c^2 = hf' + \\sqrt{(p_{e'}c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2}.</math>\nThis expression can be used to find the magnitude of the momentum of the scattered electron,\n:<math>p_{e'}^{\\, 2}c^2 = (hf - hf' + m_{e}c^2)^2-m_{e}^2c^4. \\qquad\\qquad (1) \\!</math>\n:Note that this magnitude of the momentum gained by the electron (formerly zero) exceeds the energy/c lost by the photon,\n:<math>\\frac{1}{c}\\sqrt{(hf - hf' + m_{e}c^2)^2-m_{e}^2c^4} > \\frac{hf - hf'}{c}~. </math>\n\nEquation (1) relates the various energies associated with the collision.

[http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 \"Principles of Radiation Therapy\"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref>\n\nIn material physics, Compton scattering can be used to probe the [[wave function]] of the electrons in matter in the momentum representation.\n\nCompton scattering is an important effect in [[gamma spectroscopy]] which gives rise to the [[Compton edge]], as it is possible for the gamma rays to scatter out of the detectors used. [[Compton suppression]] is used to detect stray scatter gamma rays to counteract this effect.\n\n=== Magnetic Compton scattering ===\nMagnetic Compton scattering is an extension of the previously mentioned technique which involves the magnetisation of a crystal sample hit with high energy, circularly polarised photons. By measuring the scattered photons' energy and reversing the magnetisation of the sample, two different Compton profiles are generated (one for spin up momenta and one for spin down momenta). Taking the difference between these two profiles gives the magnetic Compton profile  (MCP), given by <math>J_{\\text{mag}}(\\mathbf{p}_z)</math> - a one-dimensional projection of the electron spin density.\n\n<math>J_{\\text{mag}}(\\mathbf{p}_z) = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\iint_{-\\infty}^\\infty (n_{\\uparrow} (\\mathbf{p}) - n_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{p})) d\\mathbf{p}_x d\\mathbf{p}_y</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the number of spin-unpaired electrons in the system, <math>n_\\uparrow(\\mathbf{p})</math> and <math>n_\\downarrow(\\mathbf{p})</math> are the three-dimensional electron momentum distributions for the majority spin and minority spin electrons respectively.\n\nSince this scattering process is [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] (there is no phase relationship between the scattered photons), the MCP is representative of the bulk properties of the sample and is a probe of the ground state. This means that the MCP is ideal for comparison with theoretical techniques such as [[density functional theory]].\nThe area under the MCP is directly proportional to the spin moment of the system and so, when combined with total moment measurements methods (such as [[SQUID]] magnetometry), can be used to isolate both the spin and orbital contributions to the total moment of a system.\nThe shape of the MCP also yields insight into the origin of the magnetism in the system.<ref name=\"Cooper2004\">{{cite book|author=Malcolm Cooper|title=X-Ray Compton Scattering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m58jXIJDs3QC|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=14 October 2004|publisher=[[OUP Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-19-850168-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Inverse Compton scattering ===\nInverse Compton scattering is important in [[astrophysics]]. In [[X-ray astronomy]], the [[accretion disk]] surrounding a [[black hole]] is presumed to produce a thermal spectrum. The lower energy photons produced from this spectrum are scattered to higher energies by relativistic electrons in the surrounding [[corona]]. This is surmised to cause the power law component in the X-ray spectra (0.2\u201310 keV) of accreting black holes.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe effect is also observed when photons from the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) move through the hot gas surrounding a [[galaxy cluster]].  The CMB photons are scattered to higher energies by the electrons in this gas, resulting in the [[Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect]]. Observations of the Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect provide a nearly redshift-independent means of detecting galaxy clusters.\n\nSome synchrotron radiation facilities scatter laser light off the stored electron beam.\nThis Compton backscattering produces high energy photons in the MeV to GeV range<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.infn.it/~levisand/graal/graal.html |title=GRAAL home page |publisher=Lnf.infn.it |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> subsequently used for nuclear physics experiments.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Outline of astronomy]]\n* [[Outline of physics]]\n* [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]]\n* [[Klein\u2013Nishina formula]]\n* [[Pair production]]\n* [[Peter Debye]]\n* [[Photoelectric effect]]\n* [[Radiation pressure#Theory|Radiation pressure]]\n* [[Thomson scattering]]\n* [[Timeline of cosmic microwave background astronomy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal|author=S.
