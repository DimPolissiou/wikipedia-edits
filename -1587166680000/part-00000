The special is televised for the 12th year by [[GMA Network]] (with selected [[GMA Regional TV]] stations in Visayas and Mindanao pre-empting the national special with the local versions of the said special), and simulcast on [[DZRV-AM|Radyo Veritas]] in Manila, and [[Catholic Media Network]] radio stations nationwide.\n* April 12 \n** ''[[ASAP (TV program)|ASAP Natin 'To]]'' moves provisionally to 2:30 p.m. Sundays as a result of ABS-CBN's decision to extend the Sunday edition of ''KB Family Weekend'' to two movies in response to GMA's moves the Sunday before. To give way, the network stops the ''Banana Sundae'' reruns which began the month prior. This is the first time in 25 years that the show airs in the mid-afternoon.\n** Digital free-to-air channel [[Movie Central (Philippines)|Movie Central]] premieres ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', the first weekly television series of the channel.\n** ANC now resumes use of the studios for its news programming.\n* April 13\n** Commercial feeds for both ANC and DZMM TeleRadyo for Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays are now separated after days of using a singular commercial feed. In addition, DZMM (and DZMM TeleRadyo) now resume use of the radio studios following disinfection measures, with ''SRO: Suhestyon, Reaksyon at Opinion'' as the first broadcasts to be aired from there.\n** After 4 weeks of hiatus, ''[[Unang Hirit]]'' returns to broadcasts on GMA, but with a 6:00\u20138:00 a.m. slot.\n** GMA News TV resumes evening broadcasts of its own news programming, while retaining the provisional ''[[Dobol B sa News TV]]'' afternoon broadcasts.\n\n===Upcoming===\n====April====\n* April 23 \u2013 [[Net 25]], The television network of [[Iglesia ni Cristo]]-affiliated

Sexual relations were instigated by Vanier, usually in the context of giving spiritual guidance. \"These women reported similar facts associated with highly unusual spiritual or mystical explanations used to justify these behaviours\", the statement said that \"The relationships ... had a significant negative impact on their personal lives and subsequent relationships. These actions are indicative of a deep psychological and spiritual hold Jean Vanier had on these women.\" It also said that Vanier asked the women to keep the incidents secret. The women included assistants and nuns.

[[Ice Cube]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Amber Stevens West]], and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2012 film ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', based on<!--Please do not change. A film based on a TV series is never referred to as a \"loose sequel\" even if it takes place within the same continuity after the series has ended.--> the [[21 Jump Street|television series of the same name]]. The plot follows police officers Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko as they go undercover at a college in order to find the supplier of a new drug.\n\nPlans for a ''Jump Street'' sequel began the week of the first film's release. Hill and Tatum were quickly confirmed to be reprising their roles, while Miller and Lord announced they'd be returning to direct in July 2013. Filming took place from September to December 2013 in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, as well as [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].\n\nThe film was released on June 13, 2014, by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It received positive reviews, with some critics calling it one of the best comedy sequels of all time, and grossed $331 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt ([[Jonah Hill]]) and Jenko ([[Channing Tatum]]) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost ([[Peter Stormare]]), Deputy Chief Hardy ([[Nick Offerman]]) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson ([[Ice Cube]]) \u2013 now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as \"WHY-PHY\" (Work Hard? Yes, Play Hard? Yes) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus from a dealer.\n\nAt college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook ([[Wyatt Russell]]) and Rooster ([[Jimmy Tatro]]), they later become the prime suspects of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya ([[Amber Stevens]]), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Maya's roommate Mercedes ([[Jillian Bell]]), and Schmidt later finds that Maya is the daughter of Captain Dickson, whom Schmidt bragged to about \"getting laid\", much to Dickson's fury. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.\n\nWhen Schmidt and Jenko are unable to identify the dealer, they visit Mr. Walters ([[Rob Riggle]]) and Eric ([[Dave Franco]]) in jail for advice. After confessing the two are having regular intercourse, Walters points out a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook's arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks, but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two as Jenko passes their requirements. They later realize that Zook is not the dealer but rather another customer. Soon afterwards, they find Ghost and his men on campus, but Ghost again evades them. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he has been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is uncertain about his future as a police officer. Afterwards, Schmidt reveals his true identity and moves out of the dorm, angering Maya.\n\nSpring break arrives, and Schmidt goes after Ghost. He is joined by Jenko, so the two can have one final mission together. The pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHY-PHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, who is Ghost's daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson and the rest of Jump Street, ambush the meeting. Ghost flees, while Mercedes is knocked out by Schmidt. While pursuing Ghost, Jenko is shot in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter; Schmidt and Jenko manage to jump across to it, but they fall into the sea and Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter. Ghost celebrates his victory prematurely while the grenade explodes, sending the totalled remains into the sea. Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd.

[[Ice Cube]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Amber Stevens West]], and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2012 film ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', based on<!--Please do not change. A film based on a TV series is never referred to as a \"loose sequel\" even if it takes place within the same continuity after the series has ended.--> the [[21 Jump Street|television series of the same name]]. The plot follows police officers Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko as they go undercover at a college in order to find the supplier of a new drug.\n\nPlans for a ''Jump Street'' sequel began the week of the first film's release. Hill and Tatum were quickly confirmed to be reprising their roles, while Miller and Lord announced they'd be returning to direct in July 2013. Filming took place from September to December 2013 in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, as well as [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].\n\nThe film was released on June 13, 2014, by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It received positive reviews, with some critics calling it one of the best comedy sequels of all time, and grossed $331 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt ([[Jonah Hill]]) and Jenko ([[Channing Tatum]]) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost ([[Peter Stormare]]), Deputy Chief Hardy ([[Nick Offerman]]) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson ([[Ice Cube]]) \u2013 now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as \"WHY-PHY\" (Work Hard? Yes, Play Hard? Yes) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus from a dealer.\n\nAt college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook ([[Wyatt Russell]]) and Rooster ([[Jimmy Tatro]]), they later become the prime suspects of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya ([[Amber Stevens]]), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Maya's roommate Mercedes ([[Jillian Bell]]), and Schmidt later finds that Maya is the daughter of Captain Dickson, whom Schmidt bragged to about \"getting laid\", much to Dickson's fury. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.\n\nWhen Schmidt and Jenko are unable to identify the dealer, they visit Mr. Walters ([[Rob Riggle]]) and Eric ([[Dave Franco]]) in jail for advice. After confessing the two are having regular intercourse, Walters points out a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook's arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks, but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two as Jenko passes their requirements. They later realize that Zook is not the dealer but rather another customer. Soon afterwards, they find Ghost and his men on campus, but Ghost again evades them. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he has been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is uncertain about his future as a police officer. Afterwards, Schmidt reveals his true identity and moves out of the dorm, angering Maya.\n\nSpring break arrives, and Schmidt goes after Ghost. He is joined by Jenko, so the two can have one final mission together. The pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHY-PHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, who is Ghost's daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson and the rest of Jump Street, ambush the meeting. Ghost flees, while Mercedes is knocked out by Schmidt. While pursuing Ghost, Jenko is shot in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter; Schmidt and Jenko manage to jump across to it, but they fall into the sea and Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter. Ghost celebrates his victory prematurely while the grenade explodes, sending the totalled remains into the sea. Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd.

When the income increases, the rate of spending income of child support decreases. Also, researchers claimed that the income shares depend on economic researches. One study has suggested that the underlying economic data failed to reflect true child-related expenditures in upper income families including such non-consumer expenditures as principal on home, savings, and trusts for the benefit of children. Thus, the income shares model does not accomplish the goal of ensuring that parents, after they break up, continue to spend on their children the same percentage of income that they would have spent if they were together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fathersrightsnetwork.net/home/wiki/custody-and-divorce-terms/child-support---the-income-shares-model|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n*[[Bradley Amendment]]\n*[[California Child Support Guideline Review]]\n*[[Child Support Agency]] (UK)\n*[[Child Support Agency Australia]]\n*[[Child support in the United States]]\n*[[Costs of raising a child]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* Income Shares at GuidelineEconomics.comAdvisory Panel on Child Support Guidelines (U.S.) Williams, Robert J. \"Development of Guidelines for Child Support Orders: Advisory Panel Recommendations and Final Report\", II-68 to II-75.

He reportedly died holding the rosary in his hands, and shouting: \"Long live [[Christ King|Christ the King]]!\".<ref name=Gioia/> He was buried in a mass grave; his body has never been found.\n\n==Veneration==\nOn May 4, 1997 Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla was beatified by [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] who said that Malla \"knew how to sow harmony and solidarity among his own, also mediating conflicts that sometimes blur the relationship between non-Roma and Roma, showing Christ's love knows no boundaries of race or culture.\" <ref name=Vilches>[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.zenit.org/es/articles/beato-ceferino-gimenez-malla-el-pele&prev=search Vilches, Isabel Orellana. \"Blessed Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla, 'Pele'\", ''Zenit'', August 2, 2013]</ref> \n\nApproximately 3,000 Rom attended the beatification ceremony in Rome, some travelling from as far away as Slovakia and Brazil.<ref name=Bohlen/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90025 Agasso, Domenico. \"Beato Zeffirino (Ceferino) Gimenez Malla\", Famiglia Christiani] in Italian (translation available).\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19970504_en.html Homily for Beatification of Five Servants of Gods on Vatican site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071030200940/http://www.stthomasirondequoit.com/SaintsAlive/id544.htm Bl.
