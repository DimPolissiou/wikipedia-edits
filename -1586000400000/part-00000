Some believe that capitalism can only be overcome through revolution, and some believe that structural change can come slowly through [[Reformism|political reforms]]. Some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the [[social market]] movement).\n\nProminent among critiques of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently [[Wage slavery|exploitative]], that it is [[unsustainable]], that it creates [[economic inequality]], that it is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of [[human rights]] and that it incentivizes [[imperialist]] expansion and [[Military\u2013industrial complex|war]].\n\n== History ==\n{{socialism sidebar}}\nAccording to contemporary critics{{quantify|date=April 2010}} of capitalism, [[Industrial Revolution|rapid industrialization]] in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including [[8-hour day|14-hour work days]], [[child labor]] and [[shanty towns]].<ref name=\"conditionsworking\">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html|title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living|author=Clark Nardinelli, economist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|work=The concise encyclopedia of economics|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Socialism|socialist]] thinkers rejected capitalism altogether, attempting to create socialist communities free of the perceived injustices of early capitalism. Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] released ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a contemporary of Marx, was another notable critic of capitalism and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].\n\nBy the early 20th century, myriad socialist tendencies (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g. [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as \"[[socialism of the 21st century]]\".\n\n== General criticism ==\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\nThe authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] state that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is by its very nature hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss during working hours (sometimes outside work too). They state: \"This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical? by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to them, this is why \"[c]apitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other \"resources\"\u2014that is to say its inseparability from its bearer\u2014labour, unlike other \"property,\" is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralized, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical?\" by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the influential German [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], [[private property]] is a \"spook\" which \"lives by the grace of law\" and \"becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law\". In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected.

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed \"[[capitalist roader]]s\", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these \"capitalist roaders\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n== Issues ==\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone\".\n| source = \u2014 [[John Maynard Keynes]]<ref>''The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics'', by Eric D.

Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] released ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a contemporary of Marx, was another notable critic of capitalism and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].\n\nBy the early 20th century, myriad socialist tendencies (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g. [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as \"[[socialism of the 21st century]]\".\n\n== General criticism ==\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\nThe authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] state that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is by its very nature hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss during working hours (sometimes outside work too). They state: \"This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical? by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to them, this is why \"[c]apitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other \"resources\"\u2014that is to say its inseparability from its bearer\u2014labour, unlike other \"property,\" is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values.

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism.

In an economic sense, exploitation is often related to the [[Wage slavery|expropriation]] of labor for [[profit (economics)|profit]] and based on [[Karl Marx]]'s version of the [[labor theory of value]].

Their report goes on to link many seemingly disparate contemporary crises to this system, including environmental factors such as [[global warming]] and accelerated [[Holocene extinction|species extinctions]] and also societal factors such as rising [[economic inequality]], [[unemployment]], sluggish economic growth, rising debt levels, and impuissant governments unable to deal with these problems.

The judge grants bail of {{USD|7 million}} cash, which Lalo tells a shocked Jimmy he can pay.\n\nHoward approaches Jimmy about working at HHM and Jimmy says he is still considering it. Howard realizes Jimmy has been toying with him, including damaging his car and disrupting his recent lunch, and rescinds the offer. Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says he has grown too big for the constraints of an HHM job.\n\n==Production==\n\"JMM\" is the directorial debut of Melissa Bernstein, an executive producer on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|El Camino]]''.<ref name=\"rs review\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-7-jmm-974534/ |title='Better Call Saul' Recap: Just Make Money |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=March 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] calling back to ''Breaking Bad'' were included in this episode.

Madrid.|alt=]]\n[[File:Assumption of Mary, Piazzetta (Louvre INV20022) 02.jpg|thumb|''The Assumption of Mary'' (1735), oil on canvas. In the collection of the [[Louvre]]]]\n\n'''Giovanni Battista Piazzetta''' (also called '''Giambattista Piazzetta''' or '''Giambattista Valentino Piazzetta''') (February 13, 1682 or 1683 \u2013 April 28, 1754) was an [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] painter of religious subjects and [[Genre works|genre scenes]].\n\n==Biography==\nPiazzetta was born in [[Venice]], the son of a sculptor [[Giacomo Piazzetta]], from whom he had early training in wood carving. Starting in 1697 he studied with the painter [[Antonio Molinari (painter)|Antonio Molinari]]. By Piazzetta's account, he studied under [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] while living in Bologna in 1703\u201305, although there is no record by Crespi of formal tutelage. Thanks to Crespi, [[Carlo Cignani]]'s influence reached Piazzetta. Piazzetta did find inspiration in Crespi's art, in which the [[chiaroscuro]] of [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio|Caravaggio]] was transformed into an idiom of graceful charm in his pictures of common folk.  He was also greatly impressed by the altarpieces created by another Bolognese painter of a half-century earlier, [[Guercino]].\n\nAround 1710, he returned to Venice.  There he won recognition as a leading artist despite his limited output and his unassuming nature, but he ultimately was less patronized, both in Venice and especially abroad, than two other eminent stars in Venetian late-[[Baroque]]/[[Rococo]], [[Sebastiano Ricci|Ricci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]. yet Piazzeta's range of topics was broader than that of these artists; Tiepolo, for example, never painted genre paintings and restricted himself to grand history and religious altarpieces. Ricci and Tiepolo had a luminous palette and facile ease that allowed them to carpet meters of ceiling with frescoes, although with a superficiality and glamor that is absent from Piazzetta's darker and more intimate depictions. Nonetheless, Tiepolo, who collaborated with Piazzetta on some projects, was greatly influenced by the older artist; in turn, the luminosity and brilliance of Tiepolo's palette influenced Piazzetta in his later years.\n[[File:Accademia - L'indovina 1740-1745 - Giambattista Piazzetta - Cat.483 154x114.jpg|thumb|left|''The Soothsayer'', Accademia, Venice]]\nPiazzetta created an art of warm, rich color and a mysterious poetry.  He often depicted peasantry, even if often in a grand fashion. He was highly original in the intensity of color he sometimes used in his shadows, and in the otherworldly quality he gave to the light which throws part of a composition into relief. The gestures and glances of his protagonists hint at unseen dramas, as in one of his best-known paintings, ''The Soothsayer'' (1740, now in [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], Venice). He brought similar elusiveness to works of a religious nature, such as the ''[[Sotto in su]]'' ''Glory of [[St. Dominic]]'' in the Church of [[Basilica dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Venice)|''Santi Giovanni e Paolo'']].\n\nAlso notable are his many carefully rendered drawings of half-length figures or groups of heads. Usually in [[charcoal]] or black chalk with white heightening on gray paper, these are filled with the same spirit that animates his paintings, and were purchased by collectors as independent works. He also produced [[engraving]]s.\n\nIn 1750 Piazzetta became the first director of the newly founded [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]], and he devoted the last few years of his life to teaching. He was elected a member of the Bolognese [[Clementine Academy|Accademia Clementina]] in 1727. Among the painters in his studio were [[Domenico Maggiotto]], [[Francesco Dagiu]] (il Capella), [[Johann Heinrich Tischbein]], [[Egidio Dall'Oglio]], and [[Antonio Marinetti]].<ref>Spike, JT. p181</ref> The engraver [[Giovanni Marco Pitteri|Marco Pitteri]] was affiliated with his studio, and engraved many of his works.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgE9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA400 ''Carlo Goldoni e Venezia nel secolo XVIII''].(1882) Ferdinando Galanti, page 400.</ref> Among younger painters who emulated his style are [[Giovanni Battista Pissati]],.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9SirqqQ6tdEC Lodi monografia storico-artistica], by Felice De Angeli, Andrea Timolati, published in Milan (1877), page 134.</ref> [[Giulia Lama]], [[Federico Bencovich]], and [[Francesco Polazzo]] (1683\u20131753).

In the collection of the [[Louvre]]]]\n\n'''Giovanni Battista Piazzetta''' (also called '''Giambattista Piazzetta''' or '''Giambattista Valentino Piazzetta''') (February 13, 1682 or 1683 \u2013 April 28, 1754) was an [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] painter of religious subjects and [[Genre works|genre scenes]].\n\n==Biography==\nPiazzetta was born in [[Venice]], the son of a sculptor [[Giacomo Piazzetta]], from whom he had early training in wood carving. Starting in 1697 he studied with the painter [[Antonio Molinari (painter)|Antonio Molinari]]. By Piazzetta's account, he studied under [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] while living in Bologna in 1703\u201305, although there is no record by Crespi of formal tutelage. Thanks to Crespi, [[Carlo Cignani]]'s influence reached Piazzetta. Piazzetta did find inspiration in Crespi's art, in which the [[chiaroscuro]] of [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio|Caravaggio]] was transformed into an idiom of graceful charm in his pictures of common folk.  He was also greatly impressed by the altarpieces created by another Bolognese painter of a half-century earlier, [[Guercino]].\n\nAround 1710, he returned to Venice.  There he won recognition as a leading artist despite his limited output and his unassuming nature, but he ultimately was less patronized, both in Venice and especially abroad, than two other eminent stars in Venetian late-[[Baroque]]/[[Rococo]], [[Sebastiano Ricci|Ricci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]. yet Piazzeta's range of topics was broader than that of these artists; Tiepolo, for example, never painted genre paintings and restricted himself to grand history and religious altarpieces. Ricci and Tiepolo had a luminous palette and facile ease that allowed them to carpet meters of ceiling with frescoes, although with a superficiality and glamor that is absent from Piazzetta's darker and more intimate depictions. Nonetheless, Tiepolo, who collaborated with Piazzetta on some projects, was greatly influenced by the older artist; in turn, the luminosity and brilliance of Tiepolo's palette influenced Piazzetta in his later years.\n[[File:Accademia - L'indovina 1740-1745 - Giambattista Piazzetta - Cat.483 154x114.jpg|thumb|left|''The Soothsayer'', Accademia, Venice]]\nPiazzetta created an art of warm, rich color and a mysterious poetry.  He often depicted peasantry, even if often in a grand fashion. He was highly original in the intensity of color he sometimes used in his shadows, and in the otherworldly quality he gave to the light which throws part of a composition into relief. The gestures and glances of his protagonists hint at unseen dramas, as in one of his best-known paintings, ''The Soothsayer'' (1740, now in [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], Venice). He brought similar elusiveness to works of a religious nature, such as the ''[[Sotto in su]]'' ''Glory of [[St. Dominic]]'' in the Church of [[Basilica dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Venice)|''Santi Giovanni e Paolo'']].\n\nAlso notable are his many carefully rendered drawings of half-length figures or groups of heads. Usually in [[charcoal]] or black chalk with white heightening on gray paper, these are filled with the same spirit that animates his paintings, and were purchased by collectors as independent works. He also produced [[engraving]]s.\n\nIn 1750 Piazzetta became the first director of the newly founded [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]], and he devoted the last few years of his life to teaching. He was elected a member of the Bolognese [[Clementine Academy|Accademia Clementina]] in 1727. Among the painters in his studio were [[Domenico Maggiotto]], [[Francesco Dagiu]] (il Capella), [[Johann Heinrich Tischbein]], [[Egidio Dall'Oglio]], and [[Antonio Marinetti]].<ref>Spike, JT. p181</ref> The engraver [[Giovanni Marco Pitteri|Marco Pitteri]] was affiliated with his studio, and engraved many of his works.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgE9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA400 ''Carlo Goldoni e Venezia nel secolo XVIII''].(1882) Ferdinando Galanti, page 400.</ref> Among younger painters who emulated his style are [[Giovanni Battista Pissati]],.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9SirqqQ6tdEC Lodi monografia storico-artistica], by Felice De Angeli, Andrea Timolati, published in Milan (1877), page 134.</ref> [[Giulia Lama]], [[Federico Bencovich]], and [[Francesco Polazzo]] (1683\u20131753).

This was the last season of the EBSL to take place under this original format, as major changes were introduced [[2001 Euro Beach Soccer League|the following season]] including amendments to the presentation of the stages of fixtures and introduction of the Superfinal. [[Austria national beach soccer team|Austria]] did not return from last season and were replaced by the [[Netherlands national beach soccer team|Netherlands]] who competed for the first time.\n\nThe 2000 season has been noted as having one of the most exciting endings to a season in the early years of the EBSL;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/organisation/history/ |title=Beach Soccer History |publisher=fifa.com |accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref> defending champions [[Spain national beach soccer team|Spain]] and challengers and arch-rivals [[Portugal national beach soccer team|Portugal]] both went into the very final game of the season against each other knowing that a win for either would see their team claim the title.\n\nUltimately, Spain successfully defended their title by winning the match by a single goal and claimed their second league title.\n\n==Participating teams==\nSix teams took part in the 2000 season of the EBSL.\n*{{beachsoccer|FRA}}\n*{{beachsoccer|GER}}\n*{{beachsoccer|ITA}}\n*{{beachsoccer|NED}}\n*{{beachsoccer|POR}}\n*{{beachsoccer|ESP}}\n\n==Organisation==\n{{Location map+ |Europe |width=380 |float=right |caption=Locations of the six stages of the '''2000 Euro Beach Soccer League'''|places=\n{{Location map~ |Europe |lat=45.5908 |long=4.3181 |label=<small>''Stage 1'', '''[[Saint-Galmier]]'''</small>|position=top|mark=Yellow_pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |Europe |lat=39.566667 |long=2.65  |label=<small>''Stage 2'', '''[[Palma de Mallorca]]'''</small>|position=bottom|mark=Yellow_pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |Europe |lat=36.533333 |long=-6.283333 |label=<small>''Stage 3'',<br>'''[[C\u00e1diz]]'''</small>|position=bottom|mark=Yellow_pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |Europe |lat=41.133333 |long=-8.616667 |label=<small>''Stage 4'', '''[[Vila Nova de Gaia]]'''</small>|position=right|mark=Yellow_pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |Europe |lat=43.966667 |long=12.733333 |label=<small>''Stage 5'', '''[[Cattolica]]'''</small>|position=right|mark=Yellow_pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ |Europe |lat=43.739722 |long=7.427222 |label=<small>''Stage 6'', '''[[Monte Carlo]]'''</small>|position=bottom|mark=Yellow_pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n===Format===\nThe format remained the same as that established in 1998, only adjusted to the differing number of stages this year than in previous editions as follows:\n\nMatches were split into six rounds of fixtures known as ''stages'', with two stages hosted [[Spain]] and one in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Monaco]] and [[Portugal]], whilst the participating nations of [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] did not host any stage. Four teams took part in each, three joining the host nation of that particular stage, with each individual team taking part in four of the six stages overall.\n\nEach stage was played as a small [[knock-out tournament]], with semi finals, the final and a third place decider being the fixtures throughout all six rounds. Teams earned points for their successes per game and per stage which were then tallied up in the final [[league table]].\n\nThe team who topped the table after all six stages was crowned the winner of the league.\n\n===Point distribution===\nPoints were allocated for the following achievements in each stage, contributing to the final points total in the league table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/beachepbsl.html#00|title=European Pro Beach Soccer League (EPBSL)|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Scenario\n!Points earned\n|-\n|Win in normal time||'''3 points'''\n|-\n|Win in overtime/penalties||'''2 points'''\n|-\n!colspan=2|\n|-\n|Stage winners||'''3 ''bonus'' points'''\n|-\n|Stage runners-up||'''2 ''bonus'' points'''\n|}\n\n==Stages==\n===Stage 1===\nThe first stage took place in [[Saint-Galmier]], [[France]].

{"title_page": "1993 congressional hearings on video games", "text_new": "{{short description|USA video game industry lawmaking}}\nOn December 7, 1993, and March 5, 1994, members of the combined United States Senate Committees on [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Governmental Affairs]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|the Judiciary]] held [[congressional hearing]]s with several spokespersons for companies in the [[video game industry]] including [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]], involving violence in video games and the perceived impacts on children. The hearing was a result of concerns raised by members of the public on the 1993 releases of ''[[Night Trap]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' for home consoles. Besides general concerns related to [[violence in video games]], the situation had been inflamed by a [[moral panic]] over gun violence, as well as the state of the industry and an intense rivalry between [[Sega]] and [[Nintendo]].\n\nThe hearings, led by Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Herb Kohl]], put the video game companies to task for the realistic depiction of violence in video games, and threatened that Congress would take action to regulate the industry if they did not take steps themselves. As a result, the American video game industry created the Interactive Digital Software Association (now known as the [[Entertainment Software Association]]) in July 1994 to serve as an advocacy group for the industry, and subsequently formed the [[Entertainment Software Ratings Board]] (ESRB) to provide content ratings on video games sold at retail in North America.\n\n==Background==\nSince as early as 1970s, video games have been criticized for having violent content that may influence those that play the games. In 1982, the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] asserted that video games may be affecting the health and well-being of young people and were potentially addictive.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/us/around-the-nation-surgeon-general-sees-danger-in-video-games.html | title = AROUND THE NATION; Surgeon General Sees Danger in Video Games | date = November 10, 1982 | accessdate = October 30, 2018 | agency = Associated Press | via = [[The New York Times]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180618173538/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/us/around-the-nation-surgeon-general-sees-danger-in-video-games.html | archive-date = 2018-06-18 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> However, until the 1990s, the perceived target market for video games was generally for children, and manufacturers of video games typically did not include high levels of graphic violence in their games.<ref name=\"bbc mkx\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27620071 | title = Mortal Kombat: Violent game that changed video games industry | first = Rob | last = Crossley | date = June 2, 2014 | accessdate = October 30, 2018 | work = [[BBC]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180801170514/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27620071 | archive-date = 2018-08-01 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> Most computer game software would be sold through toy stores like [[Toys 'R' Us]] or general retail outlets like [[Sears]] and [[Wal-Mart]], rather than computer stores.<ref name=\"nytimes 12-17-93\"/>\n\n===State of the industry===\nBy 1993, the video game industry had recovered from the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], and was estimated to be worth {{USD|6 billion}}.<ref name=\"nytimes 12-1993\">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/09/business/industry-set-to-issue-video-game-ratings-as-complaints-rise.html | title = Industry Set to Issue Video Game Ratings As Complaints Rise | first = Edmund | last = Andrews | date = December 9, 1993 | accessdate = October 30, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180802101810/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/09/business/industry-set-to-issue-video-game-ratings-as-complaints-rise.html | archive-date = 2018-08-02 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> Video game consoles had reached the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] with the ability to support higher resolution graphics, real-time 3D rendering, and [[full motion video]] playback.

[[Nintendo]] had been instrumental in helping to recover the North American market after the crash with the introduction of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]; in 1990, with its release of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), Nintendo sales accounted for 90% of the {{USD|3 billion}} US market.<ref name=\"bbc svn\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27373587 | title = Sega v Nintendo: Sonic, Mario and the 1990s console war | first = Leo | last = Kelion | date = May 13, 2014 | accessdate = October 30, 2018 | work = [[BBC]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180702174225/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27373587 | archive-date = 2018-07-02 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> However, to avoid repeating one of the issues that caused the crash, Nintendo took care to limit and review what third-party games could be made for its platforms to avoid a glut of poor games. Sega, which had already released its [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] in Japan, found their sales to be lagging behind Nintendo. In an aggressive campaign aimed at the United States market, the Mega Drive was renamed the Sega Genesis, and heavily pushed the game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', with its [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|titular character]] aimed to become Sega's mascot and rival that of Nintendo's [[Mario]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Les Editions Pix'n Love|title=The History Of Sonic the Hedgehog|date=2013|publisher=UDON Entertainment Corp|location=Ontario|isbn=978-1-926778-96-9|pages=20\u201333|chapter=Zone 1 Genesis}}</ref> Sega was less selective about which games it wanted for the platform, allowing many more third-party games onto the system to increase its library in contrast to Nintendo's.<ref name=\"bbc svn\"/> Further, Sega used marketing language purposely aimed at Nintendo, such as \"Sega does what Nintendon't\".<ref name=\"Retroinspection\">{{cite magazine|last=Sczepaniak|first=John|date=August 2006|year=|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2006/09/retroinspection-mega-drive/|url-status=live|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|issue=27|pages=42\u201347|doi=|pmid=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100219/http://www.sega-16.com/2006/09/retroinspection-mega-drive/|archivedate=September 24, 2015|access-date=|df=mdy-all|via=''Sega-16''}}</ref> By 1992, Sega had obtained 65% of the US gaming market, overtaking Nintendo's dominant position.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=January 2002|title=This Month in Gaming History|url=|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|volume=12|issue=105|page=117|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Subsequently, a strong rivalry between Nintendo and Sega was formed, referred as the \"Console Wars\", which continued through the next decade and into the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|fifth generation of consoles]], after which Sega dropped out of the hardware market and became principally a game developer and publisher, and at times working collaborative with Nintendo.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/22/16179048/nintendo-vs-sega-the-battle-over-being-cool | title = Nintendo vs. Sega: The battle over being cool | first = Mike | last = Scolars | date = August 22, 2017 | accessdate =October 31, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n===Existing content ratings system===\nPrior to 1994, the video game industry did not have a unified [[content rating]] system.

Despite the game's advertising indicating the game was meant for mature audiences, the perception that video games were still aimed at children caused parents and other concerned groups to criticize the violence within the game. However, at this point, ''Mortal Kombat'' was only an arcade game, making it relatively easy to segregate it from other arcade games if necessary.<ref name=\"bbc mkx\"/> [[Greg Fischbach]], the co-founder and CEO of [[Acclaim Entertainment]], the company that had secured the license for home console versions of the game, said while attention to the game from the negative press helped to boost its popularity, that \"We didn't want that press or publicity\" and recognized that the industry may need to take steps to quell similar problems in the future.<ref name=\"vice mk\">{{Cite web | url = https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/3kawp3/how-mortal-kombat-made-the-games-industry-play-politics | title = How 'Mortal Kombat' Made the Games Industry Play Politics | first = Piotr | last = Bajda | date = October 8, 2017 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref>\n\nBecause of its success in the arcade, Acclaim Entertainment started to bring ''Mortal Kombat'' to various home consoles. Both Sega and Nintendo both sought the game for their consoles, the Genesis and the SNES, respectively. Both companies recognized the issue with the level of gore in the game, but took very different approaches. Sega, staying with their attempt to capture as much of the market, went with trying to keep as much of the visual gore from the arcade game in place. While the Genesis version of ''Mortal Kombat'' as shipped eliminated the blood and fatalities, they could be activated via the use of a well-published [[cheat code]]. As the game, as shipped, did not include the blood and gore, Sega labelled it with their MA-13 VRC label.<ref name=\"1UP_MK\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3152604|title=Purple Reign: 15 Years of the Super NES|last=Barnholt|first=Ray|date=August 4, 2006|website=[[1UP.com]]|page=4|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130429211623/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3152604|archivedate=April 29, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2007}}</ref> On the other hand, Nintendo wanted to keep games on their system appropriate for families and children, and went to Acclaim and requested to change the blood from red to green, eliminate all the fatalities, and change other parts of the game's artwork to remove elements like severed heads on spikes.<ref name=\"bbc mkx\"/> Sega's version of ''Mortal Kombat'' outsold Nintendo's by a factor of five.

Subsequently, the video scenes often veered into some sexually-alluring context as well as violence with various encounters.\n\n''Night Trap'' drew criticism worldwide, but which helped to publicize it. Similar issues were brought up in the [[United Kingdom]], with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that \"''Night Trap'' got Sega an awful lot of publicity... Questions were even raised in the UK [[Parliament]] about its suitability.

[[Steven L. Kent]] writes that \"Reading the transcripts of the 1993 hearings, it is hard to believe that anybody had ever actually played ''Night Trap''. Few people bothered to acknowledge that the goal of ''Night Trap'' was not to kill women but to save them from vampires. Players did not even kill the vampires\u2014they simply trapped them in Rube Goldberg\u2013like booby traps. Nearly everyone who referred to ''Night Trap'' mentioned a scene in which a girl in a rather modest teddy is caught by the vampires and killed.

Nintendo's Lincoln had led off his part of the testimony by acknowledging Nintendo's action to remove some of the violence of ''Mortal Kombat'', which observers found gave Lincoln more respect from Lieberman than Sega's White received.<ref name=\"night trap\" /> One of White's key points was the transformation of the video game industry from primarily having a younger audience to an adult, and that ''Night Trap'' was meant only for adults. Lincoln retorted these claims, telling White, \"I can't just sit here and allow you to be told that the video game industry has been transformed from children [as primary consumers] to adults.\"<ref name=\"edweek 12-15-93\"/> White referred to statistics collected from warranty cards on hardware and game sales that Sega kept and Nintendo would have also kept to justify the older demographics of current video games.<ref name=\"night trap\" /> Further, Lincoln asserted that Sega only developed its rating system after the release of ''Night Trap'' and only started to label its games after the game was criticized by consumers.<ref name=\"night trap\" /> White responded by showing a videotape of violent video games on the SNES and stressed the importance of rating video games, which at this point, Nintendo lacked.<ref name=\"night trap\" />\n\nOf ''Lethal Enforcers'', Lieberman criticized the design of the Konami Enforcer to resemble a revolver; an infamous still of [[C-SPAN]]'s coverage of the hearings was Lieberman holding up the Enforcer to talk about its realistic nature.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/yelling-at-scumbags-inside-the-white-houses-last-gaming-violence-meeting/3/ | title = Yelling at \"scumbags\"\u2014inside the White House\u2019s last gaming violence summit | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = November 8, 2018 |work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Sega's White countered that Nintendo had a similar light gun product on the market, the [[Super Scope]], that was shaped after a [[bazooka]].

While Sega offered their existing VRC as a basis, Nintendo, among others, steadfastly refused as they did not want to have to deal with anything created by their main competitor. Instead, a vendor-independent solution was developed, the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB), with a new set of rating standards developed in conjunction with parents and educators. The ESRB ratings system was modeled after the Motion Picture Association of America, defining five age-related categories, but also adding a set of descriptive terms that would appear next to the rating to describe the specific content that would be found in the game.<ref name=\"Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29\"/>\n\nThe ESRB was formally introduced to Congress in July 1994 to show that they had met Lieberman's goal, and the Board became officially active on September 13, 1994.<ref name=\"Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29\"/> Lieberman stated in a 2017 interview that the video game industry \"actually came up with a rating system that I think at the time \u2014 I honestly haven't been back to this in a long time \u2014 was the best.

These groups developed the [[Recreational Software Advisory Council]] (RSAC) in 1994 which rated games in three areas: violence, sexual content, and language, with each being rated among five levels. The following year, the RSAC system was also developed for Internet cites under the \"RSACi\" system.

According to John Tobias, co-creator of ''Mortal Kombat'', these friendships were added due to response from the Congressional hearings.<ref name=\"night trap\"/> When the home console versions were released, after the establishment for the ESRB, Nintendo did not take issue with the amount of violence in the game, and allowed it to release without any changes on the SNES.

While ''Doom'' was not mentioned in either Senate hearing, it would come up again in 1999 following the [[Columbine High School massacre]], where the perpetrators had described their planned attack as something straight out of ''Doom''.

The hearing was a result of concerns raised by members of the public on the 1993 releases of ''[[Night Trap]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' for home consoles. Besides general concerns related to [[violence in video games]], the situation had been inflamed by a [[moral panic]] over gun violence, as well as the state of the industry and an intense rivalry between [[Sega]] and [[Nintendo]].\n\nThe hearings, led by Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Herb Kohl]], put the video game companies to task for the realistic depiction of violence in video games, and threatened that Congress would take action to regulate the industry if they did not take steps themselves. As a result, the American video game industry created the Interactive Digital Software Association (now known as the [[Entertainment Software Association]]) in July 1994 to serve as an advocacy group for the industry, and subsequently formed the [[Entertainment Software Ratings Board]] (ESRB) to provide content ratings on video games sold at retail in North America.\n\n==Background==\nSince as early as 1970s, video games have been criticized for having violent content that may influence those that play the games.

Despite the game's advertising indicating the game was meant for mature audiences, the perception that video games were still aimed at children caused parents and other concerned groups to criticize the violence within the game. However, at this point, ''Mortal Kombat'' was only an arcade game, making it relatively easy to segregate it from other arcade games if necessary.<ref name=\"bbc mkx\"/> [[Greg Fischbach]], the co-founder and CEO of [[Acclaim Entertainment]], the company that had secured the license for home console versions of the game, said while attention to the game from the negative press helped to boost its popularity, that \"We didn't want that press or publicity\" and recognized that the industry may need to take steps to quell similar problems in the future.<ref name=\"vice mk\">{{Cite web | url = https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/3kawp3/how-mortal-kombat-made-the-games-industry-play-politics | title = How 'Mortal Kombat' Made the Games Industry Play Politics | first = Piotr | last = Bajda | date = October 8, 2017 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref>\n\nBecause of its success in the arcade, Acclaim Entertainment started to bring ''Mortal Kombat'' to various home consoles.

Nintendo's Lincoln had led off his part of the testimony by acknowledging Nintendo's action to remove some of the violence of ''Mortal Kombat'', which observers found gave Lincoln more respect from Lieberman than Sega's White received.<ref name=\"night trap\" /> One of White's key points was the transformation of the video game industry from primarily having a younger audience to an adult, and that ''Night Trap'' was meant only for adults. Lincoln retorted these claims, telling White, \"I can't just sit here and allow you to be told that the video game industry has been transformed from children [as primary consumers] to adults.\"<ref name=\"edweek 12-15-93\"/> White referred to statistics collected from warranty cards on hardware and game sales that Sega kept and Nintendo would have also kept to justify the older demographics of current video games.<ref name=\"night trap\" /> Further, Lincoln asserted that Sega only developed its rating system after the release of ''Night Trap'' and only started to label its games after the game was criticized by consumers.<ref name=\"night trap\" /> White responded by showing a videotape of violent video games on the SNES and stressed the importance of rating video games, which at this point, Nintendo lacked.<ref name=\"night trap\" />\n\nOf ''Lethal Enforcers'', Lieberman criticized the design of the Konami Enforcer to resemble a revolver; an infamous still of [[C-SPAN]]'s coverage of the hearings was Lieberman holding up the Enforcer to talk about its realistic nature.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/yelling-at-scumbags-inside-the-white-houses-last-gaming-violence-meeting/3/ | title = Yelling at \"scumbags\"\u2014inside the White House\u2019s last gaming violence summit | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = November 8, 2018 |work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Sega's White countered that Nintendo had a similar light gun product on the market, the [[Super Scope]], that was shaped after a [[bazooka]].

While Sega offered their existing VRC as a basis, Nintendo, among others, steadfastly refused as they did not want to have to deal with anything created by their main competitor. Instead, a vendor-independent solution was developed, the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB), with a new set of rating standards developed in conjunction with parents and educators. The ESRB ratings system was modeled after the Motion Picture Association of America, defining five age-related categories, but also adding a set of descriptive terms that would appear next to the rating to describe the specific content that would be found in the game.<ref name=\"Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29\"/>\n\nThe ESRB was formally introduced to Congress in July 1994 to show that they had met Lieberman's goal, and the Board became officially active on September 13, 1994.<ref name=\"Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29\"/> Lieberman stated in a 2017 interview that the video game industry \"actually came up with a rating system that I think at the time \u2014 I honestly haven't been back to this in a long time \u2014 was the best.

These groups developed the [[Recreational Software Advisory Council]] (RSAC) in 1994 which rated games in three areas: violence, sexual content, and language, with each being rated among five levels. The following year, the RSAC system was also developed for Internet cites under the \"RSACi\" system.

Among other changes, the game added a variation on the \"fatalities\", called \"Friendships\", which would occur if the player performed a separate move mechanically similar to a fatality; in such a case, the winning fighter would do a non-hostile action, such as giving the defeated fighter a virtual present. According to John Tobias, co-creator of ''Mortal Kombat'', these friendships were added due to response from the Congressional hearings.<ref name=\"night trap\"/> When the home console versions were released, after the establishment for the ESRB, Nintendo did not take issue with the amount of violence in the game, and allowed it to release without any changes on the SNES.
