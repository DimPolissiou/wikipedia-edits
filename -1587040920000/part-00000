It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on the artwork by [[H. R. Giger]]. It was one of the first point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 \u00d7 350 pixels) graphics, to Giger's demand. A sequel, ''[[Dark Seed II]]'', was released in 1995.\n\n==Plot==\nMike Dawson is a successful advertising executive and writer who has recently bought an old mansion on Ventura Drive (named after [[Ventura Boulevard]]) in the small town of [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]]. On his first night at the house, Mike has a nightmare about being imprisoned by a machine that shoots an alien embryo into his brain. He wakes up with a large headache and, after taking a painkiller and a shower, explores the mansion. He finds clues about the previous owner's death, which reveal the existence of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] called the Dark World ruled by sinister aliens called the Ancients.\n\nOn the second day, he travels to that universe through the living room mirror and meets the Keeper of the Scrolls, a friendly darkworlder. She tells him that the nightmare he had on his first night was real and warns him that if the embryo\u2014the [[eponymous]] Dark Seed\u2014is born, it will kill him and all of humanity. The only way to stop this, she says, is to destroy the Ancient's Power Source.\n\nOn the third and final day, Mike executes an elaborate plan that culminates with the Ancient ship's departure on the Dark World, depriving them of their power source, and the destruction of the living room mirror, sealing the Ancients out of the Normal World. The game ends with the town librarian visiting Mike and telling him she found some pills in her purse prescribed to Mike. The medication will presumably kill the embryo inside his head. A morphing animation reveals that, unbeknownst to the librarian, she is the Keeper of the Scrolls' counterpart. Mike then states that he's just beginning to understand.\n\n==Gameplay==\nUnlike most [[Point-and-click adventure game|point-and-click]] adventure games, which give the player time to explore, many actions in ''Dark Seed'' must occur within precise time limits, or the game will end up in an [[unwinnable]] state. As a result of this, one must start over repeatedly to win without resorting to a walkthrough.{{r|miller199209}} [[Amiga Format]], in its review, stated with regards to ''Darkseed's'' gameplay: \"Too many things in the game need to be done within a specific time, or in a certain order, and you don't necessarily know when you've passed that 'critical point' after which you're fighting a lost cause. As a result, you often have to play the game several times over, going through scenes you've seen countless times before.\"<ref name=amigaformat>{{cite magazine| title = Dark Seed Amiga Review|date=March 1993| url = https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Format_Issue_044_1993-03_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n67| magazine = Amiga Format| publisher = Future plc| page = 68-69}}</ref> Certain events/puzzles rely on the player dying and then learning from there what to do: for instance, on day two, police wait outside Dawson's house in the afternoon to arrest him if he steps outside the front door, with no clue as to their presence until it's too late, resulting in a game over.<ref name=darkseeddaytwo>''Dark Seed'' (1992).

Dawson automatically goes to sleep at ten P.M. each night, regardless of where the player is.<ref name=amigaformat /> If it becomes night while Dawson is in the Dark World, he will fall asleep and die, resulting in a game over.<ref name=darkseed /> Dawson is able to access the Dark World on day two upon receiving a piece of a mirror in the mail and re-assembling it with the rest of the mirror, creating a portal to the Dark World.<ref name=darkseeddaytwo /> Every room, person and object in the normal world has a Dark World equivalent and this is often necessary for puzzle solving.\n\nWhen interacting with objects, the options available to the player include look/inquire, touch/manipulate, and move, denoted by a \"?\", a hand, and four arrows pointing inwards respectively. Looking at an object and manipulating an object are context-sensitive: the \"?\" becomes a \"!\" when the cursor is over items or areas of interest and the hand icon points upwards when the cursor is over items that can be picked up or manipulated.<ref name=quickreference>[https://archive.org/details/DARK_SEED_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD/page/n5 ''Dark Seed'' Quick Reference Guide (1993)] Cyberdreams. p. 5-6</ref> \n\n==Production==\nWhen Cyberdreams approached [[H. R. Giger]] about providing artwork for a video game, the artist disliked the proposed use of [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] [[Mode 13h]]'s 320 by 200 graphics and demanded higher resolution, calling lower resolution \"square and jagged.\"<ref name=manualcreation>[https://archive.org/details/DARK_SEED/page/n3 ''Dark Seed'' Manual (1993)] The Creation of ''Dark Seed''. Cyberdreams. p. 6-7</ref> The developers agreed to use 640 by 350 mode instead, although doing so reduced the palette from 256 to 16 colors. Cyberdreams received access to almost all of Giger's artwork. Some of the work selected for use in Dark Seed includes: \"N.Y. City III\", \"[[Isle of the Dead (painting)#Paintings|Hommage a Bocklin]]\", and \"Li II\". \"Li II\" is featured on the cover, box and manual art.<ref name=manualcreation />\n\nDevelopers used an [[Epson]] [[flatbed scanner]] to import selected body parts and landscape fragments in monochrome, then with [[Deluxe Paint]] II Enhanced for [[MS-DOS]] assembled them into single images. An Amiga and an [[S-VHS|SVHS]] camera digitized actors' poses that Cyberdreams further edited on PCs. After the company decided that the images were inadequate late in the development process, developers hand colored the art for six more months.<ref name=sears199211>{{cite magazine|author=Sears|first=David|date=November 1992|title=Dark Seed|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_106#page/n145/mode/2up|magazine=[[Compute!]]|issue=146|pages=100|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The main character, Mike Dawson, is named after the game's designer and producer.

It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on the artwork by [[H. R. Giger]]. It was one of the first point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 \u00d7 350 pixels) graphics, to Giger's demand. A sequel, ''[[Dark Seed II]]'', was released in 1995.\n\n==Plot==\nMike Dawson is a successful advertising executive and writer who has recently bought an old mansion on Ventura Drive (named after [[Ventura Boulevard]]) in the small town of [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]]. On his first night at the house, Mike has a nightmare about being imprisoned by a machine that shoots an alien embryo into his brain. He wakes up with a large headache and, after taking a painkiller and a shower, explores the mansion. He finds clues about the previous owner's death, which reveal the existence of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] called the Dark World ruled by sinister aliens called the Ancients.\n\nOn the second day, he travels to that universe through the living room mirror and meets the Keeper of the Scrolls, a friendly darkworlder. She tells him that the nightmare he had on his first night was real and warns him that if the embryo\u2014the [[eponymous]] Dark Seed\u2014is born, it will kill him and all of humanity. The only way to stop this, she says, is to destroy the Ancient's Power Source.\n\nOn the third and final day, Mike executes an elaborate plan that culminates with the Ancient ship's departure on the Dark World, depriving them of their power source, and the destruction of the living room mirror, sealing the Ancients out of the Normal World. The game ends with the town librarian visiting Mike and telling him she found some pills in her purse prescribed to Mike. The medication will presumably kill the embryo inside his head. A morphing animation reveals that, unbeknownst to the librarian, she is the Keeper of the Scrolls' counterpart. Mike then states that he's just beginning to understand.\n\n==Gameplay==\nUnlike most [[Point-and-click adventure game|point-and-click]] adventure games, which give the player time to explore, many actions in ''Dark Seed'' must occur within precise time limits, or the game will end up in an [[unwinnable]] state. As a result of this, one must start over repeatedly to win without resorting to a walkthrough.{{r|miller199209}} [[Amiga Format]], in its review, stated with regards to ''Darkseed's'' gameplay: \"Too many things in the game need to be done within a specific time, or in a certain order, and you don't necessarily know when you've passed that 'critical point' after which you're fighting a lost cause. As a result, you often have to play the game several times over, going through scenes you've seen countless times before.\"<ref name=amigaformat>{{cite magazine| title = Dark Seed Amiga Review|date=March 1993| url = https://archive.org/details/Amiga_Format_Issue_044_1993-03_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n67| magazine = Amiga Format| publisher = Future plc| page = 68-69}}</ref> Certain events/puzzles rely on the player dying and then learning from there what to do: for instance, on day two, police wait outside Dawson's house in the afternoon to arrest him if he steps outside the front door, with no clue as to their presence until it's too late, resulting in a game over.<ref name=darkseeddaytwo>''Dark Seed'' (1992).

Dawson automatically goes to sleep at ten P.M. each night, regardless of where the player is.<ref name=amigaformat /> If it becomes night while Dawson is in the Dark World, he will fall asleep and die, resulting in a game over.<ref name=darkseed /> Dawson is able to access the Dark World on day two upon receiving a piece of a mirror in the mail and re-assembling it with the rest of the mirror, creating a portal to the Dark World.<ref name=darkseeddaytwo /> Every room, person and object in the normal world has a Dark World equivalent and this is often necessary for puzzle solving.\n\nWhen interacting with objects, the options available to the player include look/inquire, touch/manipulate, and move, denoted by a \"?\", a hand, and four arrows pointing inwards respectively. Looking at an object and manipulating an object are context-sensitive: the \"?\" becomes a \"!\" when the cursor is over items or areas of interest and the hand icon points upwards when the cursor is over items that can be picked up or manipulated.<ref name=quickreference>[https://archive.org/details/DARK_SEED_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD/page/n5 ''Dark Seed'' Quick Reference Guide (1993)] Cyberdreams. p. 5-6</ref> \n\n==Production==\nWhen Cyberdreams approached [[H. R. Giger]] about providing artwork for a video game, the artist disliked the proposed use of [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] [[Mode 13h]]'s 320 by 200 graphics and demanded higher resolution, calling lower resolution \"square and jagged.\"<ref name=manualcreation>[https://archive.org/details/DARK_SEED/page/n3 ''Dark Seed'' Manual (1993)] The Creation of ''Dark Seed''. Cyberdreams. p. 6-7</ref> The developers agreed to use 640 by 350 mode instead, although doing so reduced the palette from 256 to 16 colors. Cyberdreams received access to almost all of Giger's artwork. Some of the work selected for use in Dark Seed includes: \"N.Y. City III\", \"[[Isle of the Dead (painting)#Paintings|Hommage a Bocklin]]\", and \"Li II\". \"Li II\" is featured on the cover, box and manual art.<ref name=manualcreation />\n\nDevelopers used an [[Epson]] [[flatbed scanner]] to import selected body parts and landscape fragments in monochrome, then with [[Deluxe Paint]] II Enhanced for [[MS-DOS]] assembled them into single images. An Amiga and an [[S-VHS|SVHS]] camera digitized actors' poses that Cyberdreams further edited on PCs. After the company decided that the images were inadequate late in the development process, developers hand colored the art for six more months.<ref name=sears199211>{{cite magazine|author=Sears|first=David|date=November 1992|title=Dark Seed|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_106#page/n145/mode/2up|magazine=[[Compute!]]|issue=146|pages=100|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The main character, Mike Dawson, is named after the game's designer and producer.
