For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

He is currently engaged in discussions with family members to leave the family business, Thomson Reuters, to focus on his own art and real estate activities.  \n\n\"David, my grandson, will have to take his part in the running of the Organisation and David's son, too,\" Roy Thomson wrote in his 1975 autobiography. \"With the fortune that we will leave to them go also responsibilities. These Thomson boys that come after Ken are not going to be able, even if they want to, to shrug off these responsibilities.\"<ref name=austentorch/>\n\n== Art collection ==\nThomson is a noted art collector and owns works by [[Rembrandt]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Hammershoi]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Patrick Heron]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Ernst Ludvig Kirchner|E. L. Kirchner]], and [[Egon Schiele]].  Thomson owns the world's largest collection of paintings and drawings by the English painter John Constable.  In an interview with Geraldine Norman in ''The Independent'' in 1994, Thomson said he bought his first Constable drawing at 19, giving the seller \"an oil painting in exchange and quite a lot of money\".  Norman described him as a \"fanatical collector\", and Thomson described how he \"fell in love\" with Constable's style as a young child.  In his twenties, Thomson stunned the art world with two monumental purchases.  In 1984, he acquired J. M. W. Turner's spectacular 'Seascape: Folkestone\", for a record \u00a37.3 million (\u00a321.8 million in 2017) from the sale of the collection of noted British art historian Kenneth Clark.  The following year, Thomson, 27,  broke another world record when he bought Rembrandt's monumental \"Christ Presented to the People\", from 1655, for a record \u00a3561,000 (\u00a31.7 million in 2017) at Christie's London, when the Duke of Devonshire sold the Chatsworth Collection in one of the largest auctions of the time. Thomson sold both masterpieces within a few years during the 1980s financial crisis.\n\nIn 2002, Thomson and his father paid a world record price of $76.7 million to acquire Rubens' \"[[Massacre of the Innocents (Rubens)|Massacre of the Innocents]]\", now the centrepiece of the Thomson Collection at the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]].  In 2012, Thomson shattered records buying a painting by Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershoi, \"Ida Reading a Letter\", paying the highest price ever for a Danish artist.  In 2012, Thomson broke the record for the most expensive 18th-century British watercolour when he paid \u00a32.4 million for a small landscape by John Robert Cozens.\n\nThomson is an active acquirer of Canadian art. In 2007, Thomson paid $1.8 million for a face mask, the highest price ever paid for a single piece of Native North American art. And in November, 2016 he paid a record C$11.2 million to buy a painting at auction by Group of Seven artist Lawren Harris entitled \"Mountain Forms\". \n\nThomson operates his collecting activities through his personal Thomson Works of Art. Thomson also funds the Archive of Modern Conflict, based in London.  Specialists within the archive purchase photography collections worldwide and also run a book-publishing arm, AMC Books,  which has a Canadian imprint, Bone Idle Books, based in Toronto.\n\n==Personal life==\nThomson is the father of six children from four different mothers.  With his first wife, Mary Lou La Prairie, he has two daughters:  Thyra Nicole and Tessa Lys. With his second wife, Laurie Ludwick, Thomson has one son, Benjamin, born after Thomson left the marriage. With the actress Kelly Rowan, Thomson has a daughter.  With his partner Severine Nackers, an employee of Sotheby's in London, Thomson has two daughters, Ottilie, born in 2015, and Elodie, born in 2018.  None of the children live with their father. Thomson was estranged from his eldest daughter, Thyra, for five years, with Thyra eventually suing her father over mismanagement of the family trusts.  The case was settled out of court in 2017. Thomson lives alone in a private residence that also houses an underground art gallery, in Rosedale, Toronto.  Three of his children live in London, UK, where Thomson retains several homes. \n \nThomson is a patron of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]. With the death of his father, he became the 3rd [[Baron Thomson of Fleet]] on 12 June 2006, his 49th birthday. He does not use this title in Canada. He is an avid art collector and owns the world's top collection of [[John Constable]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/06/21/billionaire_thomson_to_marry_actress.html|title=Billionaire Thomson to marry actress|author=Matthew Chung|publisher=thestar.com|location=Toronto|date=21 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nThomson has rarely given interviews to the press and maintains a low public profile. \"The only substantial interview he has given was to James FitzGerald, who wrote a book about the elite private school ([[Upper Canada College]]) they both attended in Toronto\", according to a July 3, 2006, article in ''[[The New York Times]]''. \"In his comments to Mr. FitzGerald 12 years ago, David had little positive to say about many people in the business world\".<ref name=austentorch/> In the interview, Thomson said: \"When you try to live a more balanced life, traditional businessmen think that you are not a real man.

The sanctum (''garbhagriha'') has a square plan with a dimension of {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is surmounted by a ''dvitala vimana'' (pyramidal roof), an all stone structure. The pyramidal roof is interspersed with niches with tetragonal semi-pilasters. The corner bays have octogonal bases, while the central bays having circular ones. The two circular pilasters with circular shafts on four sides of the ''vimana'' indicates the antiquity of the temple. The feature is possibly termed ''Vrittasputitas'' in ''silpa'' texts like ''[[Shilparatna]]''. Such a feature is otherwise found only in few other temples like [[Tiruttalinathar Temple]] in [[Thiruputhur]], central shrine in [[Moovar Koil]] in [[Kodumbalur]], [[Vijayalaya Choleeswaram]] in [[Narthamalai]], Anantheswara temple in Udayarkudi and [[Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam]]. In the first level of the ''vimana'', there are niches of [[Dakshinamurthy]] in the south, a seated four-armed [[Vishnu]] in the west and a seated four-armed [[Brahma]] in the north. There are a number of old images like Sattanatha, ''Devakosha'' on the ''vimana''. The niches of the ''karnakutas'' of the first ''tala'' contains images of a kneeling man on the left and a kneeling lady in the right. Such a feature is otherwise found in [[Dandeeswarar Temple]] in [[Velachery]] and [[Vadathirthesvarar Temple, Andanallur]] in [[Tiruchendurai]].{{sfn|D.|1973|p=44}}\n\nThe ''arthamandapa'', the hall preceding the sanctum has a rectangular plan and has the same style of the sanctum. The entrance of the ''arthamandapa'' houses the six-foot images of two ''dvarapalas'', the guardian deities on either sides. The hall has four pillars, with two of them being old ones with octagonal shafts. The hall in front of the ''arthamandapa'' is called the ''mahamandapa'' and has a five-aisled structure. The ''mukhamandapa'', the hall in front of the ''arthamandapa'' is five-aisled and has plain pillars. There are two pillars in the hall with fluted shafts and sedated lions at the base, an architectural feature attributed to early period.{{sfn|D.|1973|p=44}}\n\n[[File:Thillaistanam (1).jpg|650px|center|thumb|Panoramic view of the temple]]\n\n==Saptha Stanam==\n[[File:Tillaistanam palanquin.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The decorated palanquin used during the festival]]\n\n{| style=\"clear:right; float:right; background:#ffffff; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;\" class=\"toccolours\" width=\"275\" font-size : \"90%\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#A8BDEC;text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|[[Image:Hinduism symbol.png|25px|Om symbol|left]]  '''Sapthastanam'''  [[Image:Hinduism symbol.png|25px|Om symbol|right]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | The seven important temples in and around [[Thiruvaiyaru]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#A8BDEC\"|'''Temple'''||style=\"text-align:center;background:#A8BDEC\"|'''Location'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Aiyarappar temple]]||[[Thiruvaiyaru]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Apathsahayar Temple, Thirupazhanam|Apathsahayar Temple]] ||Thirupazhanam\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Odhanavaneswarar Temple, Tiruchotruturai|Odhanavaneswarar Temple]]||[[Tiruchotruturai]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Vedapuriswarar Temple, Thiruvedhikudi|Vedapuriswarar Temple]] ||[[Thiruvedhikudi]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Kandeeswarar Temple]] ||[[kandiyur|Thirukkandiyur]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Pushpavananathar Temple, Tiruppoonturutti|Puvananathar Temple]] ||Thirupanturuthi\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Neyyadiappar Temple ||[[Tillaistanam]]\n|-\n|}\nThe ''sapthasthanam'' festival is conducted at [[Tiruvaiyaru]] during April every year.

Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the [[Shaiva]] community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:30&nbsp;a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00&nbsp;a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00&nbsp;a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., and Ardha Jamam at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: ''[[abhisheka]]'' (sacred bath), ''alangaram'' (decoration), ''[[Naivedhya|naivethanam]]'' (food offering) and ''deepa aradanai'' (waving of lamps) for both Kumbeswarar and Mangalambikai. The worship is held amidst music with ''[[nagaswaram]]'' (pipe instrument) and ''[[tavil]]'' (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the [[Vedas]] (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshipers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ''{{lang|te-Latn|somavaram}}'' (Monday) and ''{{lang|te-Latn|sukravaram}}'' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like ''[[pradosha]]m'' and monthly festivals like ''[[amavasya|amavasai]]'' (new moon day), ''kiruthigai'', ''[[pournami (festival)|pournami]]'' (full moon day) and ''sathurthi''. Mahashivaratri during February - March and Thiruvadihari during December are the major festivals celebrated in the temple.<ref name=\"dinamalar\">{{cite web|title=Sri Neyyadiappar temple|publisher=Dinamalar|url=https://temple.dinamalar.com/en/new_en.php?id=382|year=2019|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Campantar|Tirugnana Sambandar]], a 7th-century Tamil ''Saivite'' poet, venerated Naganathar in ten verses in ''[[Tevaram]]'', compiled as the ''[[Tirumurai|First Tirumurai]]''.
