It supplies electricity to approximately 24,300 customers in the city of [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], the townships of [[South Glengarry, Ontario|South Glengarry]] and [[South Stormont|South Stormont,]] and a portion of the [[Mohawk Nation]] territory of [[Akwesasne]] in Eastern Ontario.  The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on July 1, 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  A year later in 1997, two additional cars were purchased.  To generate additional revenues, the company started in 1899 a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$ 4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  For the first time, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and to pay the mortgage on the city's new sports complex, the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortic Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on October 18, 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. which has its roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John Newfoundland]], is an international company which operates Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n=== LED lighting ===\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, contracted crews to convert approximate 5,000 street lamps that were using the older [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-vapour lamps]] which typically lasted six years, to the more energy efficient [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]] that could last as long as twenty years.  The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.

It supplies electricity to approximately 24,300 customers in the city of [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], the townships of [[South Glengarry, Ontario|South Glengarry]] and [[South Stormont|South Stormont,]] and a portion of the [[Mohawk Nation]] territory of [[Akwesasne]], all located in Eastern [[Ontario]].  The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].  Cornwall Electric is the only electricity distributor in the province of Ontario that obtains its electricity from the province of [[Quebec]], making it exempt from the OEB's rate regulations,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkingpower.ca/PDFs/FeaturedNews/Report%20of%20the%20Ontario%20Distribution%20Sector%20Review%20Panel.pdf|title=Report of the Ontario Distribution Sector Review Panel|last=|first=|date=December 2012|website=Thinking Power|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  and with its negotiated long-term contracts, provides electricity consumers with some of the lowest rates in Ontario.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleanairalliance.org/cornbul/|title=Why do people in Cornwall have lower electricity bills than you? {{!}} Ontario Clean Air Alliance|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oeb.ca/_html/performance/rates_chart_2016.php?class=Res|title=Electricity Distributor Performance - Rates Comparison - Estimated Total Bills for Ontario Distributors|website=www.oeb.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nThe Cornwall Electric distribution system is powered by a 72-kilometre (44.74 mi) double-circuit 120-kilovolt, 325-megawatt  interconnection line that links it to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in the province of Quebec, which also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].  Although the line currently operates at 120-kV, it was rebuilt in 2003 and is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall and its surrounding area.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after being granted a franchise from the Town of Cornwall (later the City of Cornwall) to operate a streetcar service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on July 1, 1896 using four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  A year later in 1997, two additional cars were purchased.  To generate additional revenues, the company started in 1899 a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new company called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, the company could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute that electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would generate additional revenues by providing its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility, and it was not until forty years later in 1977, did [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decide to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$ 4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors, which were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] (now Enbridge) to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity, including Cornwall.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the power dam to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires and all were weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires, allowing workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other. For the first and only time in history, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]] with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds and later in 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and for mortgage payments on the city's new sports complex the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortic Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million.

The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Contraversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to also convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.

In a 1991 interview with ''ICE'', Robert Smith, Greffen's vice president of marketing said \"It was kind of a joke for the band to do, as in we're not going to list it in the packaging, or mention it exists.

So, why not screw up their little carousel deal ?<ref name=\"Cross1\"/>\n\nWhen Cobain was young, he was a huge fan of [[the Beatles]] and loved the way they put hidden tracks in their albums like \"[[Her Majesty (song)|Her Majesty]]\".

They often ended their concert with this song, and when finished, Cobain would scream and break his guitar.\n\n==Composition==\nAfter the failure of recording \"Lithium\", Cobain decided to take a break and play random noises of guitar. Novoselic and Grohl dived right into the jam.<ref name=\"Crisafulli\"/> In the 1993 Nirvana biography, ''Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana'', author Michael Azerrad explains that during the \"Endless, Nameless.\" sessions, at the end of practice, Kurt would tune his guitar way down and he'd just bang away, making caterwauling feedback noise and occasionally drifting into the song's main riff.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Azerrad |first1=Michael |title=Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana |date=1993 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-47199-8 |page=none}}</ref>\n\nAccording to author Charles R. Cross, \"Endless, Nameless\", Cobain was yelling and smashing his guitar in the middle of the song. The band continued to play after Cobain destroyed the guitar. Around the nineteen and one half minute part of the song, Cobain runs back to the microphone and yells barley audible words. The entire recording had been done live with no overdub. Cobain's vocals and guitar were recorded in the middle of the room and Cobain used a Shure 57 microphone designed for conversation and not music.

In a 1991 interview with ''ICE'', Robert Smith, Greffen's vice president of marketing said \"It was kind of a joke for the band to do, as in we're not going to list it in the packaging, or mention it exists. It's for that person who plays the CD, it ends, they're walking around the house and ten minutes later...

It's the last song on the record and most likely to be listened to by someone who would have a carousel player. So, why not screw up their little carousel deal ?<ref name=\"Cross1\"/>\n\nWhen Cobain was young, he was a huge fan of [[the Beatles]] and loved the way they put hidden tracks in their albums like \"[[Her Majesty (song)|Her Majesty]]\". He decided to put the song as a hidden track on their second album ''Nevermind'' after \"Something in the Way\"<ref name=\"Crisafulli\">{{cite book |last1=Crisafulli |first1=Chuck|title=Teen spirit : The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song|year=1996|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|page=none}}</ref> \n\nNirvana first performed \"Endless, Nameless\" at the Library 4300, in Olympia, Washington on January 18, 1991. They often ended their concert with this song, and when finished, Cobain would scream and break his guitar.\n\n==Composition==\nAfter the failure of recording \"Lithium\", Cobain decided to take a break and play random noises of guitar. Novoselic and Grohl dived right into the jam.<ref name=\"Crisafulli\"/> In the 1993 Nirvana biography, ''Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana'', author Michael Azerrad explains that during the \"Endless, Nameless.\" sessions, at the end of practice, Kurt would tune his guitar way down and he'd just bang away, making caterwauling feedback noise and occasionally drifting into the song's main riff.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Azerrad |first1=Michael |title=Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana |date=1993 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-47199-8 |page=none}}</ref>\n\nAccording to author Charles R. Cross, \"Endless, Nameless\", Cobain was yelling and smashing his guitar in the middle of the song. The band continued to play after Cobain destroyed the guitar. Around the nineteen and one half minute part of the song, Cobain runs back to the microphone and yells barley audible words. The entire recording had been done live with no overdub. Cobain's vocals and guitar were recorded in the middle of the room and Cobain used a Shure 57 microphone designed for conversation and not music. Vig recalls that \"We had tremendous bleed from the bass and drums all pouring into Kurt's microphone.<ref name=\"Azerrad\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Endless, Nameless\" at number sixty on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shepherd |first1=Julianne Escebedo |title=No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/no-apologies-all-102-nirvana-songs-ranked-175683/breed-31904/ |accessdate=5 January 2020 |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, ''Vulture'' ranked \"Endless, Nameless\" at number 16, calling it \"A noise jam that\u2019s the bitter fruit of a prolonged \u201cLithium\u201d recording session.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Beta |first1=Andy |title=Every Nirvana Song, Ranked Thirty years after the band\u2019s debut album, we look back at their entire catalogue|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-nirvana-songs-ranked.html|accessdate=6 January 2020 |website=vulture.com |date=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and release history==\n===Studio versions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date recorded\n!Studio\n!Producer/recorder\n!Releases\n!Personnel \n|-\n| May 2\u201319, 1991\n| [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]], [[Van Nuys]], California\n| [[Butch Vig]]\n| ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991) (some CD copies only)<br>''[[Come as You Are]]'' (most international copies)\n|\n*Kurt Cobain: guitar, vocals\n*Dave Grohl: drums\n*Krist Novoselic: bass\n|-\n|September 3, 1991\n| [[Maida Vale Studios]], [[London]], [[England]]\n| [[John Peel]]\n| ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' (2004)\n|\n*Kurt Cobain: guitar, vocals\n*Dave Grohl: drums\n*Krist Novoselic: bass\n|}\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[Kurt Cobain]] \u2013 vocals, lead guitar\n*[[Krist Novoselic]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[Dave Grohl]] \u2013 drums\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Nirvana}}\n[[Category:1991 songs]]\n[[Category:Nirvana (band) songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Kurt Cobain]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Dave Grohl]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Butch Vig]]\n", "name_user": "QuintusPetillius", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless,_Nameless_(song)"}
