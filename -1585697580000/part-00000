Together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] amendment, it represents the [[U.S. healthcare system]]'s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965.<ref name=\"Oberlander2010\" /><ref name=\"Blumenthal2015\" /><ref name=\"CohenEtAl\" /><ref name=\"ReutersSCOTUS\" />\n\nPPACA's major provisions came into force in 2014.

Both received new spending, funded through a combination of new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and [[Medicare Advantage]]. Several [[Congressional Budget Office]] reports said that overall these provisions reduced the [[Government budget balance|budget deficit]], that repealing PPACA would increase the deficit,<ref name=\"CBO50252\" /><ref name=\"CBO22077\" /> and that the law reduced income inequality by taxing primarily the top 1% to fund roughly $600 in benefits on average to families in the bottom 40% of the income distribution.<ref name=\"CBO_Dist14\" /> \n\nThe act largely retained the existing structure of Medicare, Medicaid and the [[Health insurance in the United States#Employer sponsored|employer market]], but individual markets were radically overhauled.<ref name=\"Oberlander2010\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gruber |first1=Jonathan |title=The Impacts of the Affordable Care Act: How Reasonable Are the Projections? |journal=National Tax Journal |date=2011 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=893\u2013908 |url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/11416 |accessdate=23 July 2017 |doi=10.17310/ntj.2011.3.06|hdl=1721.1/72971}}</ref> Insurers were made to [[Guaranteed issue|accept all applicants]] without charging based on [[pre-existing condition]]s or demographic status (except age).

In December 1968, as a crew member of [[Apollo 8]], he was one of the first three people to leave [[low Earth orbit]] and travel to the [[Moon]]. Along with fellow astronauts [[Frank Borman]] and [[Jim Lovell]], Anders circled the Moon ten times, and broadcast live images and commentary back to Earth. During one of the mission's lunar orbits he photographed the iconic image, ''[[Earthrise]]''.<ref name=\"AmerExp\">{{cite web |title=Chasing the Moon: Transcript, Part Two |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/chasing-moon/#transcript |website=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=24 July 2019 |date=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nApart from his professional and military careers, Anders was the U.S. Ambassador to [[Norway]] from 1976 to 1977 under [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|President Gerald Ford]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAnders was born on October 17, 1933, in [[British Hong Kong]], to [[U.S. Navy]] Lieutenant Arthur Anders and his wife Muriel (n\u00e9e Adams) Anders.<ref>{{cite news|first= Eric | last= Pace| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/31/us/arthur-f-anders-96-hero-aboard-us-gunboat-in-1937.html |title=Arthur F.

After a time, the family returned to China where Anders and his mother escaped to the [[Philippines]] following the Japanese attack of [[Nanking]]. With his mother, Anders started his journey to the Philippine Islands by troop train to [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. While there, they stayed in a hotel 200 yards from a river the Japanese were bombing, the same river they were soon forced to travel in their escape.<ref name=\"airportjournals\" />\n\nWhile in the United States, Anders was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], achieving the organization's second-highest rank, [[Life Scout]]. As a teen, Anders attended St. Martin's Academy and [[Grossmont High School]] in El Cajon, [[California]] <ref>{{cite book|last=Newland|first=James|title=La Mesa|url={{Google books|PRksOR9pNHYC|page=109|plainurl=yes}}|page=109|date=2010|publisher=Arcadia Publishing}}</ref> during his sophomore and junior years.  At Grossmont High, he developed several friendships, in particular with fellow members of the tennis team. But his grades weren't good enough, so he was sent to The Boyden School, a military academy prep school near Balboa Park located at the corner of 3rd and Elm Streets in downtown San Diego.  \"It was basically a school where you spent all day taking Naval Academy tests,\" he said. Anders commuted to Boyden's from La Mesa, Calif. \"It was kind of a tough commute,\" he said. \"I had to do it by bus.\" He thought the instruction was good, but he missed his friends at Grossmont.\n\nAgain, aircraft interrupted his concentration. \"Consolidated Vultee was building the huge B-36, a 10-engine airplane,\" he said. \"They would come in from Fort Worth and fly over our school. We were right under the flight path. All the pencils would jump up and down on the desks, and that's all you could hear.\" Planes like the B-36 would fly into Lindbergh Field and The Boyden School was located right under the final glide path for planes landing there. Anders graduated from Boyden in 1951.<ref>\"Bill Anders: A Love of Afterburners\" http://airportjournals.com/bill-anders-a-love-of-afterburners/</ref>\n\nFollowing high school, he received an appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1955. Upon graduation, he chose to be commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the [[United States Air Force]]. He then continued his studies, receiving a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[nuclear engineering]] from the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]] in 1962.<ref name=\"heritageflight\">{{cite web|url=http://heritageflight.org/mission/biographies/maj-gen-william-a-anders/|title=Maj.

After a time, the family returned to China where Anders and his mother escaped to the [[Philippines]] following the Japanese attack of [[Nanking]].

At Grossmont High, he developed several friendships, in particular with fellow members of the tennis team. But his grades weren't good enough, so he was sent to The Boyden School, a military academy prep school near Balboa Park located at the corner of 3rd and Elm Streets in downtown San Diego.  \"It was basically a school where you spent all day taking Naval Academy tests,\" he said. Anders commuted to Boyden's from La Mesa, Calif. \"It was kind of a tough commute,\" he said. \"I had to do it by bus.\" He thought the instruction was good, but he missed his friends at Grossmont.\n\nAgain, aircraft interrupted his concentration. \"Consolidated Vultee was building the huge B-36, a 10-engine airplane,\" he said. \"They would come in from Fort Worth and fly over our school. We were right under the flight path. All the pencils would jump up and down on the desks, and that's all you could hear.\" Planes like the B-36 would fly into Lindbergh Field and The Boyden School was located right under the final glide path for planes landing there. Anders graduated from Boyden in 1951.<ref>\"Bill Anders: A Love of Afterburners\" http://airportjournals.com/bill-anders-a-love-of-afterburners/</ref>\n\nFollowing high school, he received an appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1955.

These enclosures used 128 [[Megabyte]]s (MB) of [[Dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) for data storage and several high-speed [[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) inputs and outputs for data transfer.

Prior to this added DSP capability, to analyze a signal, a user would have to send the signal to the SAM storage for staging, engage a separate system to perform digital signal processing, then store the result back to the SAM system for analyzing.  Adding the DSP processor into the storage system itself meant that the data could be stored, processed, and analyzed all within the SAM system itself, relieving the host systems from processing duties.  With this change in product focus, the SAM product line became known for DSP more than for SSD.

Prior to this added DSP capability, to analyze a signal, a user would have to send the signal to the SAM storage for staging, engage a separate system to perform digital signal processing, then store the result back to the SAM system for analyzing.  Adding the DSP processor into the storage system itself meant that the data could be stored, processed, and analyzed all within the SAM system itself, relieving the host systems from processing duties.  With this change in product focus, the SAM product line became known for DSP more than for SSD.  The company would release 3 more DSP systems under the SAM brand name in the 1990s: The SAM-2000 (1990), the SAM-350, and the SAM-450 (1997).<ref name=\"tms_history_of_dod\"></ref><ref name=\"time_matters\"></ref>\n\n=== XP product line ===\nWhile the company was developing SAM systems that attached to multiple hosts, it also started developing DSP solutions on PCI cards to address the single-host market.

Any residual matter should be metabolized in the course of the subsequent healing process, generally aided by regular appliance of dry heat. The excision of larger chalazia may result in visible [[hematoma]] around the lid, which will wear off within three or four days, whereas the swelling may persist for longer. Chalazion excision is an ambulant treatment and normally does not take longer than fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, owing to the risks of infection and severe damage to the eyelid, such procedures should only be performed by a medical professional.\n\nChalazia may recur, and they will usually be [[Biopsy|biopsied]] to rule out the possibility of a tumour.\n\n===Surgery===\n[[Image:Chalazion (Excised) 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A large chalazion ca. 20 minutes upon excision. This bipartite chalazion was removed via two separate incisions. Further along the lower eyelid, signs of chronic inflammation ([[Blepharitis]]) are visible.]]\n\nChalazion surgery is a simple procedure that is generally performed as a day operation, and the person does not need to remain in the hospital for further medical care. Sometimes, as a last resort, surgery is performed. The eyelid is injected with a local anesthetic, a clamp is put on the eyelid, then the eyelid is turned over, an incision is made on the inside of the eyelid, and the chalazion is drained and scraped out with a [[curette]]. A scar on the upper lid can cause discomfort as some people feel the scar as they blink. As surgeries damage healthy tissue (e.g., leaving behind scar tissue or possibly even causing [[blepharitis]]), given other options, less intrusive treatment are preferable.\n\nBlocked meibomian glands may also be treatable with hot towels, which soften the oils in the gland.\n\nChalazion removal surgery is performed under local or general [[anesthesia]]. Commonly, general anesthesia is administered in [[children]] to make sure they stay still and no [[injury]] to the eye occurs. Local anesthesia is used in adults and it is applied with a small [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] into the eyelid. The discomfort of the injection is minimized with the help of an anesthetic cream, which is applied locally.\n\nThe chalazion may be removed in two ways, depending on the size of cyst. Relatively small chalazia are removed through a small cut at the back of the eyelid.<ref name=\"Netdoctor\">{{cite web |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/surgical-procedures/removal-of-chalazion.htm |title=Removal of chalazion |accessdate=2010-04-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325221847/http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/surgical-procedures/removal-of-chalazion.htm |archivedate=2010-03-25 |date=2009-07-06 }}</ref> The surgeon lifts the eyelid to access the back of its surface and makes an incision of approximately 3mm just on top of the chalazion.

Larger chalazia usually push on the skin of the eyelid, and this is the main reason why doctors prefer removing them this way. The incision is not usually larger than 3mm and it is made on top of the chalazion. The lump is removed and then pressure is applied on the incision to prevent oozing. This type of surgery is closed with very fine stitches. They are hardly visible and are usually removed within a week after the surgery has been performed. Although chalazia are rarely dangerous, it is common to send the chalazion or part of it to a laboratory to screen for [[cancer]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhen surgery for a chalazion is considered, people who take [[aspirin]] or any other blood-thinning medications are advised to stop taking them one week prior to the procedure as they may lead to uncontrollable bleeding. There are several [[Physical fitness test|tests]] taken prior to surgery to make sure the person is in good condition for the operation.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn rare cases, people are kept overnight in the hospital after chalazion surgery. This includes cases in which [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] occurred and the person needs to be closely monitored. In most cases however, people are able to go home after the operation has ended.\n\nThe recovery process is easy and quite fast. Most people with chalazion experience some very minor [[discomfort]] in the eye, which can be easily controlled by taking painkilling medication. People are, however, recommended to avoid getting water in the eye for up to 10 days after surgery. They may wash, bathe, or shower, but they must be careful to keep the area dry and clean. [[Makeup]] may be worn after at least one month post-operatively. People are recommended to not wear [[contact lenses]] in the affected eye for at least eight weeks to prevent [[infection]]s and potential complications.\n\nCommonly, people receive [[eye drops]] to prevent infection and swelling in the eye and pain medication to help them cope with the pain and discomfort in the eyelid and eye. One can use [[paracetamol]] (acetominophen) rather than [[aspirin]] to control the pain. Also, after surgery, a pad and protective plastic shield are used to apply pressure on the eye in order to prevent leakage of blood after the operation; this may be removed 6 to 8 hours after the procedure.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nPeople who undergo chalazion surgery are normally asked to visit their eye surgeon for post-op follow-up three to four weeks after surgery has been performed. They may start driving the day after surgery and they may return to work in one or two days.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nChalazion surgery is a safe procedure and complications occur very seldomly. Serious complications that require another operation are also very rare. Among potential complications, there is infection, bleeding, or the recurrence of the chalazion.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      =

This cyst, called a [[Syrinx (medicine)|syrinx]], can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord. The damage may result in loss of feeling, [[paralysis]], weakness,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=AORN Journal |title=Neurosurgical considerations in posttraumatic syringomyelia - Home Study Program |date=January 2003 |access-date=2009-02-12 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FSL/is_1_77/ai_97058864 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708040436/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FSL/is_1_77/ai_97058864 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-08 }}</ref> and stiffness in the back, shoulders, and extremities. Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. It may also lead to a cape-like bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation along the upper chest and arms. Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms. These symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and, often more critically, on the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord.\n\nSyringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000 people,<ref>Brewis M, Poskanzer DC, Rolland C, et al., \"Neurological disease in an English city\". ''Acta Neurologica Scand Suppl'' 24:1--89, 1966.</ref> with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood. Signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing, straining, or [[myelopathy]].\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nSyringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms, due to damage to the spinal cord. Patients may experience severe chronic pain, [[paresthesia|abnormal sensations]] and loss of sensation, particularly in the hands. Some patients experience [[paralysis]] or [[paresis]], temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the [[parasympathetic]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]]s, leading to abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem, as in syringobulbia, [[Vocal cord paresis|vocal cord paralysis]], ipsilateral tongue wasting, [[trigeminal nerve]] sensory loss, and other signs may be present.<ref>Greenberg, David A, et al.: ''Clinical Neurology''. 5th ed.

[[Neuropathic arthropathy]], also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia. The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/496650_2 \"Neuropathic Arthropathy of the Shoulder (Charcot Shoulder): Clinical Commentary\"] Medscape. Accessed 9 January 2011.</ref>\n\n== Cause ==\nGenerally, there are two forms of syringomyelia: congenital and acquired. Syringomyelia is generally a chronic disorder that occurs over time, resulting in muscular atrophy. Acquired Syringomyelia can be caused by a serious physical trauma to the body such as in a road traffic accident. Syringomyelia can also be classified into communicating and noncommunicating forms. Communicating typically occurs due to lesions on the foramen magnum and noncommunicating occurring due to other spinal cord diseases.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Byrne |title=Diseases of the Spine and Spinal Cord}}</ref>\n\n===Congenital===\nThe first major form relates to an abnormality of the brain called an [[Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation]] or Chiari malformation. This is the most common cause of syringomyelia, where the anatomic abnormality, which may be due to a small posterior fossa, causes the lower part of the [[cerebellum]] to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal. A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Here, symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining, called a valsalva maneuver, or any activity that causes [[cerebrospinal fluid]] pressure to fluctuate suddenly. Some patients, however, may have long periods of stability. Some patients with this form of the disorder also have [[hydrocephalus]], in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull, or a condition called [[arachnoiditis]], in which a covering of the spinal cord\u2014the arachnoid membrane\u2014is inflamed.\n\nSome cases of syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare.\n\n===Acquired===\nThe second major form of syringomyelia occurs as a complication of [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[meningitis]], [[hemorrhage]], a [[tumor]], or [[arachnoiditis]]. Here, the syrinx or cyst develops in a segment of the spinal cord damaged by one of these conditions. The syrinx then starts to expand. This is sometimes referred to as noncommunicating syringomyelia. Symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury, starting with pain, weakness, and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma.\n\nThe primary symptom of post-traumatic syringomyelia (often referred to using the abbreviation of PTS)<ref name=\"pmid8558154\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schurch B, Wichmann W, Rossier AB |title=Post-traumatic syringomyelia (cystic myelopathy): a prospective study of 449 patients with spinal cord injury |journal=J.

Symptoms, such as pain, numbness, weakness, and disruption in temperature sensation, may be limited to one side of the body. Syringomyelia can also adversely affect sweating, sexual function, and, later, bladder and bowel control. A typical cause of PTS would be a car accident or similar trauma involving a whiplash injury.\n\nWhat can make PTS difficult to diagnose is the fact that symptoms can often first appear long after the actual cause of the syrinx occurred (e.g., a car accident occurring and then the patient first experiencing PTS symptoms such as pain, loss of sensation, and reduced ability on the skin to feel varying degrees of hot and cold a number of months after the car accident).\n\n== Pathogenesis ==\nThe pathogenesis of syringomyelia is debated. The cerebrospinal fluid also serves to cushion the [[Human brain|brain]]. Excess cerebrospinal fluid in the [[central canal]] of the [[spinal cord]] is called hydromyelia. This term refers to increased cerebrospinal fluid that is contained within the [[ependyma]] of the central canal.  When fluid dissects into the surrounding [[white matter]] forming a cystic cavity or [[Syrinx (medicine)|syrinx]], the term syringomyelia is applied.  As these conditions coexist in the majority of cases, the term syringohydromyelia is applied. The terms are used interchangeably.\n\nIt has been observed that obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces in the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation, and alleviation of the obstruction may improve symptoms.  A number of pathological conditions can cause an obstruction of the normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces. These include [[Chiari malformation]], spinal [[arachnoiditis]], [[scoliosis]], spinal [[vertebrae]] misalignment, spinal [[tumors]], [[spina bifida]], and others.  The reasons that blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid space within the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation are not fully understood although a small posterior fossa is one known cause.  It is unclear if syrinx fluid originates from bulk movement of cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal cord, from bulk transmural movement of blood fluids through the spinal [[vasculature]] into the syrinx, or from a combination of both. Recent work suggests that central nervous system compliance is the underlying problem for the central nervous system, and also that hydrocephalus and syringomyelia have related causes.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[Image:Gray 111 - Vertebral column-coloured.png|120px|thumb]]\n\nPhysicians now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose syringomyelia. The MRI radiographer takes images of body anatomy, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail. This test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor. MRI is safe, painless, and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia.\n\nThe physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. One of these is called [[electromyography]] (EMG), which show possible lower motor neuron damage. In addition, [[computed axial tomography]] (CT) scans of a patient's head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus.\n\nLike MRI and CT scans, another test, called a [[myelogram]], uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space. Since the introduction of MRI, this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia.\n\nThe possible causes are trauma, tumors, and congenital defects. It is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area. Symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and include pain, decreased sensation of touch, weakness, and loss of muscle tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal CT, myelogram or MRI of the spinal cord. The cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression.\n\nFurthermore, evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervical-located syrinx.\n\n== Treatment ==\n\n===Surgery===\nThe first step after diagnosis is finding a neurosurgeon who is experienced in the treatment of syringomyelia. [[Surgery]] is the treatment for syringomyelia. Evaluation of the condition is necessary because syringomyelia can remain stationary for long periods of time, and in some cases progress rapidly.\n\nSurgery of the spinal cord has certain characteristic risks associated with it, and the benefits of a surgical procedure on the spine have to be weighed against the possible complications associated with any procedure. Surgical treatment is aimed at correcting the condition that allowed the syrinx to form. It is vital to bear in mind that the drainage of a syrinx does not necessarily mean the elimination of the syrinx-related symptoms but rather is aimed at stopping progression. In cases involving an [[Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation]], the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the [[cerebellum]] at the base of the skull and upper [[Neck#Anatomy of the human neck|cervical spine]] without entering the brain or spinal cord. This often results in flattening or disappearance of the primary syrinx or cavity, over time, as the normal flow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] is restored. If a [[tumor]] is causing syringomyelia, removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice, if this is considered to be safe.\n\nSurgery results in stabilization or modest improvement in symptoms for most patients. Delay in treatment may result in irreversible spinal cord injury. Recurrence of syringomyelia after surgery may make additional operations necessary; these may not be completely successful over the long term.\n\nIn some patients it may also be necessary to drain the syrinx, which can be accomplished using a [[catheter]], drainage tubes, and valves. This system is also known as a [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]]. Shunts are used in both the communicating and noncommunicating forms of the disorder. First, the surgeon must locate the syrinx. Then, the shunt is placed into it with the other end draining [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) into a cavity, usually the abdomen. This type of shunt is called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and is particularly useful in cases involving [[hydrocephalus]]. By draining syrinx fluid, a shunt can arrest the progression of symptoms and relieve pain, headache, and tightness. Syringomyelia shunts are not always successful and can become blocked as with other central nervous system shunts.\n\nThe decision to use a shunt requires extensive discussion between doctor and patient, as this procedure carries with it greater risk of injury to the spinal cord, infection, blockage, or hemorrhage and may not necessarily work for all patients.  Draining the syrinx more quickly does not produce better outcomes, but a shunt may be required if the fluid in the syrinx is otherwise unable to drain.\n\nIn the case of trauma-related syringomyelia, the surgeon operates at the level of the initial injury. The syrinx collapses at surgery, but a tube or shunt is usually necessary to prevent re-expansion.\n\n===Other===\nSurgery is not always recommended for syringomyelia patients. For many patients, the main treatment is [[analgesia]]. Physicians specializing in pain management can develop a medication and treatment plan to ameliorate pain. Medications to combat any neuropathic pain symptoms such as shooting and stabbing pains (e.g. [[gabapentin]] or [[pregabalin]]) would be first-line choices. Opiates are usually prescribed for pain for management of this condition. [[Facet joint injections]] are not indicated for the treatment of syringomyelia.\n\nDrugs have no curative value as a treatment for syringomyelia. [[Radiation]] is used rarely, and is of little benefit except in the presence of a tumor. In these cases, it can halt the extension of a cavity and may help to alleviate pain.\n\nIn the absence of symptoms, syringomyelia is usually not treated. In addition, a physician may recommend not treating the condition in patients of advanced age or in cases where there is no progression of symptoms. Whether treated or not, many patients will be told to avoid activities that involve straining.\n\nSince the natural history of syringomyelia is poorly understood, a conservative approach may be recommended. When surgery is not yet advised, patients should be carefully monitored. Periodic MRI's and physical evaluations should be scheduled at the recommendation of a qualified physician.\n\n== Research ==\n[[File:Cervical MRI 120744 rgbca.png|thumb]]\nThe precise causes of syringomyelia are still unknown, although blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid has been known to be an important factor since the 1970s. Scientists in the UK and US continue to explore the mechanisms that lead to the formation of syrinxes in the spinal cord. It has been demonstrated that a block of the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Duke University in America and Warwick University are conducting research to explore genetic features of syringomyelia.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01060800 \"Information about a Genetic Research Study for Chiari Type I Malformation (CMI) with or without Syringomyelia.\"]</ref>\n\nSurgical techniques are also being refined by the neurosurgical research community. Successful procedures expand the area around the cerebellum and spinal cord, improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and thereby reducing the syrinx.\n\nIt is also important to understand the role of birth defects in the development of hindbrain malformations that can lead to syringomyelia, as syringomyelia is a feature of intrauterine life and is also associated with spina bifida. Learning when these defects occur during the development of the fetus can help with the understanding of this and similar disorders, and may lead to preventive treatment that can stop the formation of some birth abnormalities.\n\nDiagnostic technology is another area for continued research. MRI has enabled scientists to see the situation within the spine, including syringomyelia, before any symptoms appear. A new technology, known as dynamic MRI, allows investigators to view spinal fluid flow within the syrinx.

This cyst, called a [[Syrinx (medicine)|syrinx]], can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord. The damage may result in loss of feeling, [[paralysis]], weakness,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=AORN Journal |title=Neurosurgical considerations in posttraumatic syringomyelia - Home Study Program |date=January 2003 |access-date=2009-02-12 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FSL/is_1_77/ai_97058864 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708040436/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FSL/is_1_77/ai_97058864 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-08 }}</ref> and stiffness in the back, shoulders, and extremities. Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. It may also lead to a cape-like bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation along the upper chest and arms. Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms. These symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and, often more critically, on the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord.\n\nSyringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000 people,<ref>Brewis M, Poskanzer DC, Rolland C, et al., \"Neurological disease in an English city\". ''Acta Neurologica Scand Suppl'' 24:1--89, 1966.</ref> with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood. Signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing, straining, or [[myelopathy]].\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nSyringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms, due to damage to the spinal cord. Patients may experience severe chronic pain, [[paresthesia|abnormal sensations]] and loss of sensation, particularly in the hands. Some patients experience [[paralysis]] or [[paresis]], temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the [[parasympathetic]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]]s, leading to abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem, as in syringobulbia, [[Vocal cord paresis|vocal cord paralysis]], ipsilateral tongue wasting, [[trigeminal nerve]] sensory loss, and other signs may be present.<ref>Greenberg, David A, et al.: ''Clinical Neurology''. 5th ed.

[[Neuropathic arthropathy]], also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia. The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/496650_2 \"Neuropathic Arthropathy of the Shoulder (Charcot Shoulder): Clinical Commentary\"] Medscape. Accessed 9 January 2011.</ref>\n\n== Cause ==\nGenerally, there are two forms of syringomyelia: congenital and acquired. Syringomyelia is generally a chronic disorder that occurs over time, resulting in muscular atrophy. Acquired Syringomyelia can be caused by a serious physical trauma to the body such as in a road traffic accident. Syringomyelia can also be classified into communicating and noncommunicating forms. Communicating typically occurs due to lesions on the foramen magnum and noncommunicating occurring due to other spinal cord diseases.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Byrne |title=Diseases of the Spine and Spinal Cord}}</ref>\n\n===Congenital===\nThe first major form relates to an abnormality of the brain called an [[Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation]] or Chiari malformation. This is the most common cause of syringomyelia, where the anatomic abnormality, which may be due to a small posterior fossa, causes the lower part of the [[cerebellum]] to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal. A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Here, symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining, called a valsalva maneuver, or any activity that causes [[cerebrospinal fluid]] pressure to fluctuate suddenly. Some patients, however, may have long periods of stability. Some patients with this form of the disorder also have [[hydrocephalus]], in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull, or a condition called [[arachnoiditis]], in which a covering of the spinal cord\u2014the arachnoid membrane\u2014is inflamed.\n\nSome cases of syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare.\n\n===Acquired===\nThe second major form of syringomyelia occurs as a complication of [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[meningitis]], [[hemorrhage]], a [[tumor]], or [[arachnoiditis]]. Here, the syrinx or cyst develops in a segment of the spinal cord damaged by one of these conditions. The syrinx then starts to expand. This is sometimes referred to as noncommunicating syringomyelia. Symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury, starting with pain, weakness, and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma.\n\nThe primary symptom of post-traumatic syringomyelia (often referred to using the abbreviation of PTS)<ref name=\"pmid8558154\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schurch B, Wichmann W, Rossier AB |title=Post-traumatic syringomyelia (cystic myelopathy): a prospective study of 449 patients with spinal cord injury |journal=J.

Symptoms, such as pain, numbness, weakness, and disruption in temperature sensation, may be limited to one side of the body. Syringomyelia can also adversely affect sweating, sexual function, and, later, bladder and bowel control. A typical cause of PTS would be a car accident or similar trauma involving a whiplash injury.\n\nWhat can make PTS difficult to diagnose is the fact that symptoms can often first appear long after the actual cause of the syrinx occurred (e.g., a car accident occurring and then the patient first experiencing PTS symptoms such as pain, loss of sensation, and reduced ability on the skin to feel varying degrees of hot and cold a number of months after the car accident).\n\n== Pathogenesis ==\nThe pathogenesis of syringomyelia is debated. The cerebrospinal fluid also serves to cushion the [[Human brain|brain]]. Excess cerebrospinal fluid in the [[central canal]] of the [[spinal cord]] is called hydromyelia. This term refers to increased cerebrospinal fluid that is contained within the [[ependyma]] of the central canal.  When fluid dissects into the surrounding [[white matter]] forming a cystic cavity or [[Syrinx (medicine)|syrinx]], the term syringomyelia is applied.  As these conditions coexist in the majority of cases, the term syringohydromyelia is applied. The terms are used interchangeably.\n\nIt has been observed that obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces in the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation, and alleviation of the obstruction may improve symptoms.  A number of pathological conditions can cause an obstruction of the normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces. These include [[Chiari malformation]], spinal [[arachnoiditis]], [[scoliosis]], spinal [[vertebrae]] misalignment, spinal [[tumors]], [[spina bifida]], and others.  The reasons that blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid space within the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation are not fully understood although a small posterior fossa is one known cause.  It is unclear if syrinx fluid originates from bulk movement of cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal cord, from bulk transmural movement of blood fluids through the spinal [[vasculature]] into the syrinx, or from a combination of both. Recent work suggests that central nervous system compliance is the underlying problem for the central nervous system, and also that hydrocephalus and syringomyelia have related causes.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[Image:Gray 111 - Vertebral column-coloured.png|120px|thumb]]\n\nPhysicians now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose syringomyelia. The MRI radiographer takes images of body anatomy, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail. This test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor. MRI is safe, painless, and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia.\n\nThe physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. One of these is called [[electromyography]] (EMG), which show possible lower motor neuron damage. In addition, [[computed axial tomography]] (CT) scans of a patient's head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus.\n\nLike MRI and CT scans, another test, called a [[myelogram]], uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space. Since the introduction of MRI, this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia.\n\nThe possible causes are trauma, tumors, and congenital defects. It is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area. Symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and include pain, decreased sensation of touch, weakness, and loss of muscle tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal CT, myelogram or MRI of the spinal cord. The cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression.\n\nFurthermore, evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervical-located syrinx.\n\n== Treatment ==\n\n===Surgery===\nThe first step after diagnosis is finding a neurosurgeon who is experienced in the treatment of syringomyelia. [[Surgery]] is the treatment for syringomyelia. Evaluation of the condition is necessary because syringomyelia can remain stationary for long periods of time, and in some cases progress rapidly.\n\nSurgery of the spinal cord has certain characteristic risks associated with it, and the benefits of a surgical procedure on the spine have to be weighed against the possible complications associated with any procedure. Surgical treatment is aimed at correcting the condition that allowed the syrinx to form. It is vital to bear in mind that the drainage of a syrinx does not necessarily mean the elimination of the syrinx-related symptoms but rather is aimed at stopping progression. In cases involving an [[Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation]], the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the [[cerebellum]] at the base of the skull and upper [[Neck#Anatomy of the human neck|cervical spine]] without entering the brain or spinal cord.
