performances in ranking [[List of snooker tournaments|tournaments]] over a two-year rolling period. The total points from the [[Snooker world ranking points 2010/2011|2010/2011]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2011/2012|2011/2012]] seasons set the [[Snooker world rankings 2012/2013|rankings at the start of 2012/2013 season]] and were updated after every ranking tournament. As points were accrued from tournaments in the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons ago were dropped. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at four further points during the season. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings were based on all the points up to that date in the 2012/2013 season, all of the points from the 2011/2012 season, and the points from the 2010/2011 season that had not yet been dropped.

As points were accrued from tournaments in the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons ago were dropped. The total points from the [[Snooker world ranking points 2009/2010|2009/2010]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2010/2011|2010/2011]] seasons set the [[Snooker world rankings 2011/2012|rankings at the start of 2011/2012 season]] and were updated after every ranking tournament. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at three further points during the season. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings were based on all the points up to that date in the 2011/2012 season, all of the points from the 2010/2011 season, and the points from the 2009/2010 season that have not yet been dropped. The total points from the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons set the [[Snooker world rankings 2012/2013|rankings at the start of the 2012/2013 season]].\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Seeding revisions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

[[World Snooker Tour#Main Tour|World Snooker Main Tour]] in the [[Snooker season 2011/2012|2011/2012 season]] were based on performances in ranking [[List of snooker tournaments|tournaments]] over a two-year rolling period. As points were accrued from tournaments in the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons ago were dropped. The total points from the [[Snooker world ranking points 2009/2010|2009/2010]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2010/2011|2010/2011]] seasons set the [[Snooker world rankings 2011/2012|rankings at the start of 2011/2012 season]] and were updated after every ranking tournament. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at three further points during the season. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings were based on all the points up to that date in the 2011/2012 season, all of the points from the 2010/2011 season, and the points from the 2009/2010 season that have not yet been dropped. The total points from the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons set the [[Snooker world rankings 2012/2013|rankings at the start of the 2012/2013 season]].\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Seeding revisions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

The total points from the [[Snooker world ranking points 2008/2009|2008/2009]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2009/2010|2009/2010]] seasons were used to determine the [[Snooker world rankings 2010/2011|rankings at the start of 2010/2011 season]]. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at three further points during the season. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings were based on all the points from the current season, all of the points from the 2009/2010 season, and the points that were still valid from the 2008/2009 season. The total points from the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons were used to determine the [[Snooker world rankings 2011/2012|seedings at the start of the 2011/2012 season]].\n\nThe first seedings update took place on 4 October 2010, after the [[Euro Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Event 2|Brugge Open]], and points accumulated from the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]], [[2008 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] and [[2008 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] during the 2008/2009 season were dropped. The seedings were next updated on 13 December 2010, after the [[2010 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]]; the points accumulated from the [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain Championship]] and [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] during the 2008/2009 season were dropped.

[[snooker]] players in the [[Snooker season 2010/2011|2010/2011 season]] are listed below. The total points from the [[Snooker world ranking points 2008/2009|2008/2009]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2009/2010|2009/2010]] seasons were used to determine the [[Snooker world rankings 2010/2011|rankings at the start of 2010/2011 season]]. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at three further points during the season. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings were based on all the points from the current season, all of the points from the 2009/2010 season, and the points that were still valid from the 2008/2009 season. The total points from the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons were used to determine the [[Snooker world rankings 2011/2012|seedings at the start of the 2011/2012 season]].\n\nThe first seedings update took place on 4 October 2010, after the [[Euro Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Event 2|Brugge Open]], and points accumulated from the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]], [[2008 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] and [[2008 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] during the 2008/2009 season were dropped. The seedings were next updated on 13 December 2010, after the [[2010 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]]; the points accumulated from the [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain Championship]] and [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] during the 2008/2009 season were dropped. The final update occurred on 21 February 2011, after the [[2011 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]], and the points accumulated from the [[2009 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] during the 2008/2009 season were dropped.<ref name=\"cutoff points\">{{cite web |work=worldsnooker.com |title=Williams Supports Rankings Overhall |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/PTC1_news(Williams_Supports_Rankings_Overhall)-2324.htm?tid=166 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ug3NXUdO |archivedate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Seeding revisions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

{"title_page": "Gopalan", "text_new": "'''Gopalan Anish Acharya''' may refer to:\n\n \n [[File:Gopalan Anish Acharya .jpeg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Author]]\n\nAccording to the study of Ancient literature, Before any religion like Islam and Christianity. Most people believe in TENGIRSM religion which says the world is divided in three parts\n\nThree-world cosmology\nAs in most ancient beliefs, there is a \"celestial world\", the ground and an \"underworld\" in Tengrism.[78] The only connection between these realms is the \"Tree of Worlds\" that is in the center of the worlds.\n\n \n1. Sky (The father ), The God , The Place of God or Heaven. (Swarg Lok)\n2. Earth (The Mother ) The logic stands as everything we get to survive is provided by earth like a mother . ( Prithvi Lok)\n3. Inside Earth or other layer : is considered as unknown place of sinners or place of bad soul after death. Pathal Lok. \n\n So let\u2019s respect the Earth as we do to our mother and stand to save the environment ...\n\nLet\u2019s go through some interesting facts without hurting any religion.\n\nThe religion TENGIRSM \n\nTengrism also played a large role in the religion of Mongol Empires as the primary statespirituality. Genghis Khan ( Khan is considered as ruler of a place or area like sardar/Chowdhari/ Raja/ King it dose not indicate to any religion ) and several generations of his followers were Tengrian believers and \"Shaman-Kings\" until his fifth-generation descendant, Uzbeg Khan, turned to Islam in the 14th century.\n\nAccording to Hungarian archaeological research, the religion of the Magyars (Hungarians) until the end of the 10th century (before Christianity) was Tengrism.\n\nGenghis mentions both Eternal Tengri and \"heaven and earth\" when he says \"By the mercy of Eternal Tengri and the blessing of heaven and earth I have greatly increased in power, united all the great nation and brought them under my reins\" (paragraph 224). \n\nFor the first time the name Tengri recorded in Chinese chronicles from the 4th century BC as the sky god of the Xiongnu, it takes the Chinese form \u6491\u7281 (Cheng-li).\n\nGOD\nK\u00f6k Tengri (Blue Sky) is the Supreme Being, the One, the creator of everything. Usually it is understood pantheistically/panentheistically as a non-anthropomorphic Absolute, a concept identical to Taoist Tao, Indian Para Brahman, ancient Greek Apeiron, or Unified Field of modern science.[76]\n\nAll other deities are revered as Tengri's manifestations or spirits of the elements. Such, for instance, the pantheon of the ancient Turks: Yer-Sub, Umay, Erlik, Earth, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Star, Air, Clouds, Wind, Storm, Thunder and Lightning, Rain and Rainbow.[7\n\nTENGIRSM and BUDDHISM  \n\nThe 17th century Mongolian chronicle Altan Tobchi (Golden Summary) contains references to Tengri. Tengrism was assimilated into Mongolian Buddhism while surviving in purer forms only in far-northern Mongolia. Tengrist formulas and ceremonies were subsumed into the state religion. This is similar to the fusion of Buddhism and Shinto in Japan. The Altan Tobchi contains the following prayer at its very end\n\nTengrists oppose Islam, Christianity and Judaism as Semitic religions imposing a foreign religion to the Turks. And, according to some ones, by praying to the god of Islam the Turkic peoples would give their energy to the Jews and not to themselves (Aron Atabek [ru]).[56] It excludes the experiences of other nations, but offers Semitic history as if it were the history of all humanity. The principle of submission (both in Islam as well as in Christianity) is disregarded as one of the major failings. It allows rich people to abuse the ordinary people and makes human development stagnant. They advocate Turanism and abandonment of Islam as an Arab religion (Nihal Atsiz and others).[50] Prayer from the heart can only be in native language, not Arabic.[87] On the contrary, others assert that Tengri is indeed synonymous with Allah and that Turkic ancestors did not leave their former belief behind, but simply accepted Allah as new expression for Tengri.[88]\n\nTENGIRSM and CHRISTANITY\n\nHulegu Khan sent a letter in Latin to King Louis IX of France on April 10, 1262 from his capital Maragheh in Iran.[90][91] Kept in the Vienna National Library as MS 339 it is both an invitation for joint operations against the Mamluks as well as an imperious command to submit. The letter provides key insights into the Mongols' understanding of Tengrism's relationship to Christianity as well as furnishing one of the first Latin transcriptions of Tengri.\n\nAll meanings of Tengri including the sky, the most high God and \"a god\" are implied in the letter. Jesus Christ is called Misicatengrin or Messiah-Tengri in the letter. The Misica is from Syriac mshiha (Messiah, Christ) as opposed to Arabic masih. Another Syriac word in the letter is Barachmar (greetings). This points to the well-known Nestorian heritage within the Mongol Empire which used Syriac as its liturgical language.[92] The Mongolian letter of Arghun Khan to Pope Nicholas IV (1290) also uses the word Misica for Christ. William of Rubruck reported that Arig Boke, brother of Hulegu Khan, used the word Messiah near Karakorum in 1254 (Then they began to blaspheme against Christ, but Arabuccha stopped them saying: \"You must not speak so, for we know that the Messiah is God\")[93]. There are elements of syncretism between Tengrism and Nestorian Christianity with overlapping notions of monotheism and a traditional view of Christ as Misicatengrin probably dating back to the Keraite conversion in 1007. In Hulegu's letter Tengrism takes the overarching, non-dogmatic role and contains Nestorianism as a compatible subset, in line with the religious pluralism practiced by the Mongols. Hulegu himself was not strictly a Christian, although his wife, his general Kitbuqa and mother were Nestorians. He was a Tengriist whose Nestorian interests were of the Mongol, syncretic type. His successor Abaqa Khan would take part in the Ninth Crusade with the future King Edward of England in 1271 and also storm the Krak des Chevaliers in February 1281 with the Hospitallers of Margat.\n\nTENGIRSM and ISLAM\n\nTengrism is based on personal relationship with God and spirits and personal experiences, which cannot be fixiated in writings; thus there can be no a prophet, holy scripture, place of worship, clergy, dogma, rite and prayers.[82] In contrast, Islam is based on a written corpus. Doctrines and religious law derive from the Quran and are explained by hadith. In this regard, both belief systems are fundamentally distinct.[83] Turks usually encountered and assimilated their beliefs to Islam via Sufism. Turks probably identified Dervishes as something akin to shamans.[84] First contact between shamanistic Turks and Islam took place during the Battle of Talas against the Chinese Tang dynasty. Turkic Tengrism further influenced parts of Sufism and Folk Islam, especially Alevism with Bektashi Order.[11][83] Many shamanistic beliefs were considered as genuine Islamic by many average Muslims and even prevail today.[85]\n\nIt excludes the experiences of other nations, but offers Semitic history as if it were the history of all humanity. The principle of submission (both in Islam as well as in Christianity) is disregarded as one of the major failings. It allows rich people to abuse the ordinary people and makes human development stagnant. They advocate Turanism and abandonment of Islam as an Arab religion (Nihal Atsiz and others).[50] Prayer from the heart can only be in native language, not Arabic.[87] On the contrary, others assert that Tengri is indeed synonymous with Allah and that Turkic ancestors did not leave their former belief behind, but simply accepted Allah as new expression for Tengri.[88]\n\nOn a scale of complexity Tengrism lies somewhere between the Proto-Indo-European religion (a pre-state form of pastoral shamanism on the western steppe) and its later form the VEDIC religion. The eastern steppe where Tengrism developed had more centralized, hierarchical polities than the western steppe. Tengrism has been noted as more centralized, less polytheistic, less myth-intensive and more historically focused than the paganism that grew out of the western Proto-Indo-European religion. Nonetheless, the chief god Tengri (\"Heaven\") is considered strikingly similar to the Indo-European sky god *Dyeus, and the structure of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion is closer to that of the early Turks than to the religion of any people of Near Eastern or Mediterranean antiquity.[23]\n\nTENGIRSM and HINDUISM \nThere are lot many similarity found in the ideological believing of Hinduism and TENGIRSM. The people who civilised after Sindhu valley, despite of believing any god or culture were known as Hindus and the majority were the followers of Vedic science and culture. The were distributed in small small divisions on the basis of nature of work and believing of their own god. But initially all follow ultimate power of  all god as Lord shiva a final authority of god ( Devon ke Dev. Mahadev) but that also with time change the small small groups for their priorities of literature and gods. But still the experts of religions make their points clear as base of \u201cSANATAN Religion \u201c is the majority followers of Hindus it follow the 4 VEDAS \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f \n\n'''Article by .
