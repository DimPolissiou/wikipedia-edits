Written by [[Moira Walley-Beckett]] and directed by [[Bo Johan Renck|Johan Renck]], it aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and Canada on April 18, 2010.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], it is revealed that when [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] gave [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] his savings to buy an [[RV]] (in [[Pilot (Breaking Bad)|\"Pilot\"]]), he instead spent nearly all of it partying the night away at a [[strip club]] with [[Combo Ortega|Combo]] and [[Skinny Pete]]. The following morning, Jesse panics when he realizes that he only has $1,400 left to buy an RV with, but Combo bails him out by selling him his mother's RV for the remainder of the money.\n\nBack in the present, Jesse is furious that Walt received the other half of his payment for the meth, and calls him to demand it. Walt denies making any sort of deal for half of the profits, but nevertheless tells Jesse that he does not have his permission to cook his formula. Meanwhile, Hank is still searching tirelessly for the \"rolling meth lab\" RV. He learns that his friend and partner, [[Steve Gomez]], is being sent to [[El Paso]] in his stead. Hank is left dismayed by this news, but nevertheless remains committed to his work. He returns home and has an argument with [[Marie Schrader|Marie]] after she shows concern for his well-being, feeling that he is being accused by those around him for simply doing his job.\n\nWalt goes to see [[Gus Fring]] at Los Pollos Hermanos, admonishing him for giving him Jesse's half of the money in an attempt to lure Walt into Gus' employ. Gus apologizes for the transparency of the ploy, then asks Walt to take a drive with him. In a final attempt to get Walt to accept the offer, Gus drives him to his meth lab which is discreetly housed within an industrial laundry facility. Walt is impressed by the lab and the equipment within, but nevertheless declines the offer again, saying that his time in the meth business has cost him his family and he cannot afford to make another bad decision. Gus firmly tells him that a man provides for his family, regardless of whether or not his family appreciates him for it.\n\n[[Skyler White|Skyler]] speaks with her [[Divorce in the United States|divorce attorney]] and confides in her about the fact that she is currently sleeping with her boss, [[Ted Beneke]], as well as Walt keeping his drug money in the house. Her attorney encourages Skyler to leave him immediately, for the longer she stays with Walt, the more culpable she becomes towards his crimes. Skyler remains hesitant. However, when she gets home, she is surprised to find that Walt has packed his things and left, and that he has also signed the divorce contract, having finally accepted Gus' offer to continue his work in the meth business.\n\nWalt meets with Jesse in Saul's office and hands over Jesse's other half of the payment. However, he coldly tells Jesse that it will be the last money he will ever make in the meth business, as Gus was only using Jesse to get Walt working for him. Jesse is further enraged when Saul goes over to Walt's side, re-negotiating a deal to secure himself a cut of Walt's profits. Jesse tells them that this won't stop him from cooking, then leaves the office in a fury. He picks up a broken piece of a curb and tosses it into Walt's newly-replaced front windshield.\n\nHank's search for the RV leads him to the doorstep of Combo's mother, who never reported her RV stolen after Combo sold it to Jesse. Hank searches Combo's room and finds a picture of Combo and Jesse during their night at the strip club, thereby leading Hank to now set his sights on Jesse.\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was written by [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and directed by [[Bo Johan Renck|Johan Renck]];<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2JgDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT137|title=Breaking Bad 101: The Complete Critical Companion|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|date=2017-10-10|publisher=Abrams|isbn=9781683350774|pages=137|language=en}}</ref> it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on April 18, 2010.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3MtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA165|title=Breaking Bad: A Cultural History|last=Stache|first=Lara C.|date=2017-10-06|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442278271|pages=165|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nDonna Bowman of ''[[The A.V.

Their reign is considered the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of the Spanish Netherlands]].

He already had a male heir, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], but father and son had never developed a close rapport and frequently lived in conflict with one another.\n\nIsabella was baptized by [[Pope Urban VII|Juan Bautista Castaneo]], apostolic nuncio, later [[Pope]] as Urban VII. Her godfather was her uncle [[John of Austria]]. She was named after her mother, the day of her birth, and the devotion to St. Eugenio, whose body her father had transferred the year before from Saint Dionysius of Paris to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] with her mother's help through her brother, [[Charles IX of France|the King of France]].\n\nA year later, Isabella's younger sister, [[Catherine Michelle]], was born. Their parents were very close to their daughters, buying them jams, dolls, toys, and more. However, their mother miscarried a daughter in 1568 and died the same day.\n\nIsabella and Catherine grew up beloved by her father and her stepmother, [[Anna of Austria, Queen of Spain|Anna of Austria]], Philip's fourth wife. The sisters developed a close relationship. Their father ultimately fathered five children by Anna, all of whom died in early childhood except his heir, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip]]. Although he could ruthless in goverment, Philip II is frequently characterized as having been affectionate towards his daughters, there exists numerous letters which testify his deep attachment to them, each letter lovingly signed \"Your good father\".\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Sovereign of the Netherlands.jpg|thumb|left|205px| Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia in her youth, by  [[Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello]], 1585]]\nIsabella and Catherine were raised under the care of [[Margarita de Cardona]], their stepmother's lady-in-waiting, and some of their mother's own ladies-in-waiting, such as Claude de Vineulx. Both sisters were described as intelligent and well aware of their high social status.\n\nIsabella had a very good education. Her studies presumably incluided [[politics]], [[mathematics]], and the languages [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] besides her native [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Famous artist [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], who served as [[court painter]] at the time, influenced the Infanta's artistic works. Isabella was the only person whom King Philip permitted to help him with his work, sorting his papers and translating Italian documents into the [[Spanish language]] for him.\n\n===Candidate to the French throne===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Spanish Infantas as Single Women (1580-1700).svg|thumb|200px|Isabella Clara Eugenia's Coat of Arms as Infanta of Spain shows the Fluer-de-lis.]]\nAfter her maternal uncle, [[Henry III of France]], was assassinated by the fanatical young monk [[Jacques Cl\u00e9ment]] on 2&nbsp;August 1589, Philip II claimed the French crown on Isabella's behalf despite France's [[Salic law]], which forbade [[cognatic]] succession. At any rate, her mother had ceded any claim to the French crown with her marriage to the Spanish King. However, the ''[[Parlement]] de Paris'', in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella was \"the legitimate sovereign\" of France. The Huguenot leader, [[Henry III of Navarre]], the actual heir by traditional French inheritance laws, ultimately made his claim to the throne, converted to Catholicism and was crowned in 1594.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Notes and Queries, Volume s11-VI, Issue 145|last=|first=|date=October 5, 1912|page=272}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage Proposals==\n[[File:Isabella van Spanje, landvoogdes der Nederlanden.jpg|thumb|upright|205px| Isabella and her [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], c. 1599<ref>[https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/407377/the-infanta-isabella-clara-eugenia-1566-1633-archduchess-of-austria Royal Collection.]</ref>]]\nAs Infanta of Spain and Portugal, Isabella was quite eligible on the political marriage market, though she ended up marrying late for her time.\n\n===Engagement===\nAt the age of two, Isabella was promised to marry her cousin [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (18&nbsp;July 1552 \u2013 20&nbsp;January 1612), son of her aunt [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria]]. However, Isabella had to wait for more than 20 years before the eccentric Rudolf declared that he had no intention of marrying anybody. Meanwhile, she served as her father's primary caretaker during the last three years of his life, when he was plagued by [[gout]] and frequent illness.\n\n===Marriage===\n[[Image:Landvoogden Albrecht en Isabella van Oostenrijk.jpg|thumb|Isabella Clara Eugenia and Archduke Albert]]\nPhilip decided to cede the Spanish Netherlands to Isabella on condition that she marry her cousin, [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]]. He was her former fianc\u00e9's younger brother the former Viceroy. They were to reign over the Netherlands jointly and be succeeded by their descendants according to the male-preference [[primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|cognatic primogeniture]] but should a female succeed, she was required to marry the King of Spain or the person chosen by the King of Spain. It was stipulated that, should they have no children, the Netherlands would revert to the King of Spain upon the death of either spouse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isabella-Clara-Eugenia|title=Isabella Clara Eugenia, archduchess of Austria {{!}} archduchess of Austria|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs Albert was the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], he had to be released from his religious commitments by [[Pope Clement VIII]] before the wedding could take place. Shortly before Philip II died on 13 September 1598, he resigned the thrones of the Netherlands in favor of Isabella and her fianc\u00e9. The Pope celebrated the union by procuration on 15 November at Ferrera. On 18 April 1559, 33-years old Isabella married Albert in [[Valencia]]. They had three children who died at a very young age, in 1605, 1607 and 1609.\n\n==Habsburg Netherlands==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Infanta Isabella of Spain as Governor Monarch of the Low Countries.svg|thumb|210px|Isabella Clara Eugenia's Coat of Arms as Sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands]]\nBeginning in 1601, the Archduke and Archduchess ruled the [[Spanish Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands]] together. Their reign is a key period in the history of the Spanish Netherlands. After Albert's death, Isabella was appointed Governor of the Netherlands on the [[monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]'s behalf.\n<ref>{{Cite web|title=Notes and Queries, Volume s11-VI, Issue 149|last=|first=|date=November 2, 1912|page=351}}</ref> She was succeeded as Governor by [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]], the third son of her half-brother in 1633.\n\n===Foreign Policy===\nThe first half of Albert and Isabella's reign was donimated by war. After overtures to the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I of England]] proved unsuccessful, the Habsburg policy in the Low Countries aimed at regaining the military initiative and isolating the Dutch Republic. The strategy was to force its opponents to the conference table and negotiate from a position of strength.\n\nIn pursuit of that goal and to get their political agenda to all [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[social class]]es, Albert and Isabella used the most diverse media. The visual [[art]]s, with the [[baroque]] popularized in the wake of the [[Counter-Reformation]], was the perfect tool. This, coupled with the political configuration of the period, made the Archdukes' Court at Brussels one of the foremost political and artistic centers in Europe of that time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mangsen|first=S.|date=2007-05-01|title=Biagio Marini, Sonate Sinfonie: Canzoni, Passemezzi, Balletti, Correnti, Gagliarde, & Ritornelli, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 voci per ogni sorte di stromento, Opera VIII, ed.

Brussels became a vital link in the chain of Habsburg Courts and the diplomatic conduits between [[Madrid]], [[Vienna]], Paris, [[London]], [[Lisbon]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Prague]] and [[The Hague]] could be said to run through there.\n\nThe accession of [[James VI of Scotland]] as James I in England had paved the way for a separate peace with England. On 24 July 1604, England, Spain and the Archducal Netherlands signed the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]]. The return to peace was severely hampered by differences over religion. Events such as the [[Gunpowder Plot]] caused a lot of diplomatic tension between London and Brussels, but the relations between the two courts tended to be cordial on the whole.\n\nThe threat of diplomatic isolation and [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquess of Los Balbases|General Ambrogio Sp\u00ednola]]'s campaigns induced the Dutch Republic to accept a ceasefire in April 1609. The subsequent negotiations between the warring parties failed to produce a peace [[treaty]], but lead to the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in [[Antwerp]] on 9 April 1609. Under the Truce's terms, the United Provinces were to be regarded as a sovereign power for the duration of the truce. After four decades of war, the treaty brought a period of much-needed peace of the Southern Netherlands.\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Jeton Brabant Antwerpen Albert Isabella 1612.jpg|thumb|left|Jeton with portraits of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]] and Infanta Isabella of Spain, struck in Antwerp 1612.]]\nThe period of the Truce brought the Habsburg Netherlands a much-needed peace, mainly because the [[Field (agriculture)|fields]] could be again worked in safety. The archducal regime encouraged the reclaiming of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the [[Polder|impoldering]] of [[De Moeren]], a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian\u2013French border. The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population (and thus workers) after decades of demographic losses. [[Industry]] and in particular the luxury [[trade]]s likewise underwent a recovery, bringing considerable [[economy|economical]] stability and prosperity to the [[Southern Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-VII#ref150363 |title=Albert VII {{!}} archduke of Austria |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2018-06-05 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nHowever, international trade was hampered by the closure of the river [[Scheldt]]. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of [[canals]] linking [[Ostend]] via [[Bruges]] to the Scheldt in [[Ghent]] and joining the [[Meuse]] to the [[Rhine]] between [[Venlo]] and [[Rheinberg]]. In order to combat [[urban poverty]], the government supported the creation of a network of [[Mount of piety|''Monti di Piet\u00e0'']] based on the Italian model.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9258.tif|thumb|left|Engraving of Isabella Clara Eugenia dressed as a nun.]] \nThe archducal regime ensured the triumph of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Reformation]] in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. After one last execution in 1597, those that remained were no longer actively persecuted. Under the terms of legislation passed in 1609, their presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public or engage in religious. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechlin of 1607 were likewise given official sanction. \n\nThrough such measures and by the appointment of a generation of committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the catholic confessionalisation of the population. In the process of recatholisation, new and reformed religious orders enjoyed the particular support of the rulers. Even though the Archduke had certain reservations about the order, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] received the largest cash grants, allowing them to complete their ambitious building programmes in Brussels and Antwerp. The [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] were given considerable sums as well. The foundation of the first convents of [[Discalced Carmelites]] in the Southern Netherlands depended wholly on the personal initiative of the archducal couple and bore witness to the Spanish orientation of their spirituality.\n\n===Legislative System===\nThe reign of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia saw a strengthening of princely power in the Habsburg Netherlands. The [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the loyal provinces were only summoned once in 1600. Thereafter, the government preferred to deal directly with the provinces.\n\nThe years of the Truce allowed the archducal regime to promulgate legislation on a whole range of matters. The so-called [[Perpetual Edict (1611)|Eternal Edict of 1611]], for instance, reformed the judicial system and ushered in the transition from customary to written law. Other measures dealt with monetary matters, the [[nobility]], [[duels]], [[gambling]], etc.\n\n===Relationship with Spain===\nThe actions of the two rulers stimulated the growth of a separate South Netherlandish identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-VII#ref150363|title=Albert VII {{!}} archduke of Austria|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref> However, Albert and Isabella's children died a very young age and as the years passed, it became clear that they would have no more offspring and thus independence wouldn't be possible. \n\nSince then, Albert and Isabella's goal became the reincorporation of the Southern Provinces into the Spanish monarchy. They consolidated the authority of the [[House of Habsburg]] over the territory of the Southern Netherlands and largely succeeded in reconciling previous anti-Spanish sentiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19232|title=Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia (1566-1633) -...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> As a result, the States of the loyal provinces swore to accept the King as heir of the Archduke and Archduchess in a number of ceremonies between May 1616 and January 1617.\n\nAs the Spanish King's Governor since 1621, the older, widowed Isabella alternated successes, such as that of the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Capture of Breda]] in 1625, with failures and setbacks, such as the losses of Bolduque in 1625 and Mastrique in 1632.\n\n==Patronage of Arts==\n===Court of Brussels===\n[[File:Jan Brueghel the Elder - The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet - Walters 372010.jpg|thumb|Albert and Isabella visiting a [[art museum|private art gallery]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/14623\n |title= The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet}}</ref>]]\nIsabella and Albert stimulated the growth of this artistic movement, which resulted in the creation of the [[Flemish Baroque painting]]. Their patronage of such artists and architects as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (their court painter since 1609), [[Wenceslas Cobergher]], [[Jacob Franquart]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]],  the De Nole family, the [[Van Veen]]s and many others made the Court of Brussels one of the foremost artistic centers in Europe of that time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mangsen|first=S.|date=2007-05-01|title=Biagio Marini, Sonate Sinfonie: Canzoni, Passemezzi, Balletti, Correnti, Gagliarde, & Ritornelli, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 voci per ogni sorte di stromento, Opera VIII, ed.

Their once magnificent collections were scattered after 1633 and considerable parts of them have been lost. Still, the Archdukes enjoy a well merited reputation as patrons of the arts. By far, the best preserved ensemble of art from the archducal period is to be found at [[Basilica of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel|Scherpenheuvel]], where Albert and Isabella directed Cobergher, and [[Theodoor van Loon]] and the de Noles to create a pilgrimage church in a planned city.\n\n===Descalzas Reales===\n[[File:Isabella Clara Eugenia as a nun.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Isabella Clara Eugenia as a nun, 1625]]\nIsabella joined the [[Secular Franciscan Order]] and became a nun.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Notes and Queries, Volume s11-VI, Issue 149|last=|first=|date=November 2, 1912|page=351}}</ref> She was of great importance to the [[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]], where she lived with her mother-in-law Maria.

He already had a male heir, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], but father and son had never developed a close rapport and frequently lived in conflict with one another.\n\nIsabella was baptized by [[Pope Urban VII|Juan Bautista Castaneo]], apostolic nuncio, later [[Pope]] as Urban VII. Her godfather was her uncle [[John of Austria]]. She was named after her mother, the day of her birth, and the devotion to St. Eugenio, whose body her father had transferred the year before from Saint Dionysius of Paris to [[Toledo]] with her mother's help through her brother, [[Charles IX|the King of France]].\n\nA year later, Isabella's younger sister, [[Catherine Michelle]], was born. Their parents were very close to their daughters, buying them jams, dolls, toys, and more. However, their mother miscarried a daughter in 1568 and died the same day.\n\nIsabella and Catherine grew up beloved by her father and her stepmother, [[Anna of Austria, Queen of Spain|Anna of Austria]], Philip's fourth wife. The sisters developed a close relationship. Their father ultimately fathered five children by Anna, all of whom died in early childhood except his heir, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip]]. Although he could ruthless in goverment, Philip II is frequently characterized as having been affectionate towards his daughters, there exists numerous letters which testify his deep attachment to them, each letter lovingly signed \"Your good father\".\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Sovereign of the Netherlands.jpg|thumb|left|205px| Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia in her youth, by  [[Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello]], 1585]]\nIsabella and Catherine were raised under the care of [[Margarita de Cardona]], their stepmother's lady-in-waiting, and some of their mother's own ladies-in-waiting, such as Claude de Vineulx. Both sisters were described as intelligent and well aware of their high social status.\n\nIsabella had a very good education. Her studies presumably incluided [[politics]], [[mathematics]], and the languages [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] besides her native [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

At any rate, her mother had ceded any claim to the French crown with her marriage to the Spanish King. However, the ''[[Parlement]] de Paris'', in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella was \"the legitimate sovereign\" of France. The Huguenot leader, [[Henry III of Navarre]], the actual heir by traditional French inheritance laws, ultimately made his claim to the throne, converted to Catholicism and was crowned in 1594.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Notes and Queries, Volume s11-VI, Issue 145|last=|first=|date=October 5, 1912|page=272}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage Proposals==\n[[File:Isabella van Spanje, landvoogdes der Nederlanden.jpg|thumb|upright|205px| Isabella and her [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], c. 1599<ref>[https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/407377/the-infanta-isabella-clara-eugenia-1566-1633-archduchess-of-austria Royal Collection.]</ref>]]\nAs Infanta of Spain and Portugal, Isabella was quite eligible on the political marriage market, though she ended up marrying late for her time.\n\n===Engagement===\nAt the age of two, Isabella was promised to marry her cousin [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (18&nbsp;July 1552 \u2013 20&nbsp;January 1612), son of her aunt [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria]]. However, Isabella had to wait for more than 20 years before the eccentric Rudolf declared that he had no intention of marrying anybody.

He was her former fianc\u00e9's younger brother the former Viceroy. They were to reign over the Netherlands jointly and be succeeded by their descendants according to the male-preference [[primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|cognatic primogeniture]] but should a female succeed, she was required to marry the King of Spain or the person chosen by the King of Spain. It was stipulated that, should they have no children, the Netherlands would revert to the King of Spain upon the death of either spouse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isabella-Clara-Eugenia|title=Isabella Clara Eugenia, archduchess of Austria {{!}} archduchess of Austria|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs Albert was the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], he had to be released from his religious commitments by [[Pope Clement VIII]] before the wedding could take place. Shortly before Philip II died on 13 September 1598, he resigned the thrones of the Netherlands in favor of Isabella and her fianc\u00e9. The Pope celebrated the union by procuration on 15 November at Ferrera. On 18 April 1559, 33-years old Isabella married Albert in [[Valencia]]. They had three children who died at a very young age, in 1605, 1607 and 1609.\n\n==Habsburg Netherlands==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Infanta Isabella of Spain as Governor Monarch of the Low Countries.svg|thumb|210px|Isabella Clara Eugenia's Coat of Arms as Sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands]]\nBeginning in 1601, the Archduke and Archduchess ruled the [[Spanish Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands]] together. Their reign is a key period in the history of the Spanish Netherlands. After Albert's death, Isabella was appointed Governor of the Netherlands on the [[monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]'s behalf.\n<ref>{{Cite web|title=Notes and Queries, Volume s11-VI, Issue 149|last=|first=|date=November 2, 1912|page=351}}</ref> She was succeeded as Governor by [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]], the third son of her half-brother in 1633.\n\n===Foreign Policy===\nThe first half of Albert and Isabella's reign was donimated by war. After overtures to the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I of England]] proved unsuccessful, the Habsburg policy in the Low Countries aimed at regaining the military initiative and isolating the Dutch Republic. The strategy was to force its opponents to the conference table and negotiate from a position of strength.\n\nIn pursuit of that goal and to get their political agenda to all [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[social class]]es, Albert and Isabella used the most diverse media. The visual [[art]]s, with the [[baroque]] popularized in the wake of the [[Counter-Reformation]], was the perfect tool. This, coupled with the political configuration of the period, made the Archdukes' Court at Brussels one of the foremost political and artistic centers in Europe of that time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mangsen|first=S.|date=2007-05-01|title=Biagio Marini, Sonate Sinfonie: Canzoni, Passemezzi, Balletti, Correnti, Gagliarde, & Ritornelli, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 voci per ogni sorte di stromento, Opera VIII, ed.

Brussels became a vital link in the chain of Habsburg Courts and the diplomatic conduits between [[Madrid]], [[Vienna]], Paris, [[London]], [[Lisbon]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Prague]] and [[The Hague]] could be said to run through there.\n\nThe accession of [[James VI of Scotland]] as James I in England had paved the way for a separate peace with England. On 24 July 1604, England, Spain and the Archducal Netherlands signed the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]]. The return to peace was severely hampered by differences over religion. Events such as the [[Gunpowder Plot]] caused a lot of diplomatic tension between London and Brussels, but the relations between the two courts tended to be cordial on the whole.\n\nThe threat of diplomatic isolation and [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquess of Los Balbases|General Ambrogio Sp\u00ednola]]'s campaigns induced the Dutch Republic to accept a ceasefire in April 1609. The subsequent negotiations between the warring parties failed to produce a peace [[treaty]], but lead to the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in [[Antwerp]] on 9 April 1609. Under the Truce's terms, the United Provinces were to be regarded as a sovereign power for the duration of the truce. After four decades of war, the treaty brought a period of much-needed peace of the Southern Netherlands.\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Jeton Brabant Antwerpen Albert Isabella 1612.jpg|thumb|left|Jeton with portraits of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]] and Infanta Isabella of Spain, struck in Antwerp 1612.]]\nThe period of the Truce brought the Habsburg Netherlands a much-needed peace, mainly because the [[Field (agriculture)|fields]] could be again worked in safety. The archducal regime encouraged the reclaiming of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the [[Polder|impoldering]] of [[De Moeren]], a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian\u2013French border. The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population (and thus workers) after decades of demographic losses. [[Industry]] and in particular the luxury [[trades]] likewise underwent a recovery, bringing considerable [[economy|economical]] stability and prosperity to the [[Southern Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-VII#ref150363 |title=Albert VII {{!}} archduke of Austria |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2018-06-05 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nHowever, international trade was hampered by the closure of the river [[Scheldt]]. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of [[canals]] linking [[Ostend]] via [[Bruges]] to the Scheldt in [[Ghent]] and joining the [[Meuse]] to the [[Rhine]] between [[Venlo]] and [[Rheinberg]]. In order to combat [[urban poverty]], the government supported the creation of a network of [[Mount of piety|''Monti di Piet\u00e0'']] based on the Italian model.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9258.tif|thumb|left|Engraving of Isabella Clara Eugenia dressed as a nun.]] \nThe archducal regime ensured the triumph of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Reformation]] in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. After one last execution in 1597, those that remained were no longer actively persecuted. Under the terms of legislation passed in 1609, their presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public or engage in religious. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechlin of 1607 were likewise given official sanction. \n\nThrough such measures and by the appointment of a generation of committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the catholic confessionalisation of the population. In the process of recatholisation, new and reformed religious orders enjoyed the particular support of the rulers. Even though the Archduke had certain reservations about the order, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] received the largest cash grants, allowing them to complete their ambitious building programmes in Brussels and Antwerp. The [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] were given considerable sums as well. The foundation of the first convents of [[Discalced Carmelites]] in the Southern Netherlands depended wholly on the personal initiative of the archducal couple and bore witness to the Spanish orientation of their spirituality.\n\n===Legislative System===\nThe reign of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia saw a strengthening of princely power in the Habsburg Netherlands. The [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the loyal provinces were only summoned once in 1600. Thereafter, the government preferred to deal directly with the provinces.\n\nThe years of the Truce allowed the archducal regime to promulgate legislation on a whole range of matters. The so-called [[Perpetual Edict (1611)|Eternal Edict of 1611]], for instance, reformed the judicial system and ushered in the transition from customary to written law. Other measures dealt with monetary matters, the [[nobility]], [[duels]], [[gambling]], etc.\n\n===Relationship with Spain===\nThe actions of the two rulers stimulated the growth of a separate South Netherlandish identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-VII#ref150363|title=Albert VII {{!}} archduke of Austria|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref> However, Albert and Isabella's children died a very young age and as the years passed, it became clear that they would have no more offspring and thus independence wouldn't be possible. \n\nSince then, Albert and Isabella's goal became the reincorporation of the Southern Provinces into the Spanish monarchy. They consolidated the authority of the [[House of Habsburg]] over the territory of the Southern Netherlands and largely succeeded in reconciling previous anti-Spanish sentiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19232|title=Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia (1566-1633) -...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> As a result, the States of the loyal provinces swore to accept the King as heir of the Archduke and Archduchess in a number of ceremonies between May 1616 and January 1617.\n\nAs the Spanish King's Governor since 1621, the older, widowed Isabella alternated successes, such as that of the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Capture of Breda]] in 1625, with failures and setbacks, such as the losses of Bolduque in 1625 and Mastrique in 1632.\n\n==Patronage of Arts==\n===Court of Brussels===\n[[File:Jan Brueghel the Elder - The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet - Walters 372010.jpg|thumb|Albert and Isabella visiting a [[art museum|private art gallery]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/14623\n |title= The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet}}</ref>]]\nIsabella and Albert stimulated the growth of this artistic movement, which resulted in the creation of the [[Flemish Baroque painting]]. Their patronage of such artists and architects as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (their court painter since 1609), [[Wenceslas Cobergher]], [[Jacob Franquart]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]],  the De Nole family, the [[Van Veen]]s and many others made the Court of Brussels one of the foremost artistic centers in Europe of that time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mangsen|first=S.|date=2007-05-01|title=Biagio Marini, Sonate Sinfonie: Canzoni, Passemezzi, Balletti, Correnti, Gagliarde, & Ritornelli, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 voci per ogni sorte di stromento, Opera VIII, ed.

Their once magnificent collections were scattered after 1633 and considerable parts of them have been lost. Still, the Archdukes enjoy a well merited reputation as patrons of the arts. By far, the best preserved ensemble of art from the archducal period is to be found at [[Basilica of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel|Scherpenheuvel]], where Albert and Isabella directed Cobergher, and [[Theodoor van Loon]] and the de Noles to create a pilgrimage church in a planned city.\n\n===Descalzas Reales===\n[[File:Isabella Clara Eugenia as a nun.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Isabella Clara Eugenia as a nun, 1625]]\nIsabella joined the [[Secular Franciscan Order]] and became a nun.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Notes and Queries, Volume s11-VI, Issue 149|last=|first=|date=November 2, 1912|page=351}}</ref> She was of great importance to the [[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]], where she lived with her mother-in-law Maria.

In the 1960s Bharni, Kachni and Tantrik styles were mainly done by Brahman and Kayashth women, who are 'upper caste' women in India and Nepal. Their themes were mainly religious and they depicted Gods and Goddesses, plants and animals in their paintings. People of lower castes included aspects of their daily life and symbols, the story of Raja Shailesh [guard of the village] and much more, in their paintings. Nowadays Madhubani art has become a globalised art form, so there is no difference in the work on the basis of the caste system. They work in all five styles.

Shashthi Nath Jha, who runs the Gram Vikas Parishad, an NGO, started the initiative as an attempt to protect local trees that were being cut down in the name of expanding roads and development. The main reason behind this was that the trees were traditionally adorned with forms of gods and other religious and spiritual images such as those of Radha-Krishna, Rama-Sita, scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata and other mythologies.

This painting is done with a variety of tools, including fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks and using natural dyes and pigments. It is characterised by its eye-catching geometrical patterns.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as [[Holi]], Surya Shasti, [[kali puja|Kali Puja]], [[Upanayana]], and [[Durga Puja]].\n\n== Origins==\nMadhubani painting (Mithila painting) was traditionally created by the women of various communities in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar. Madhubani is also a major export center of these paintings.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UvuJyvtsCjwC&pg=PA96&dq=madhubani+art+madhubani+district#v=onepage&q=madhubani+art+madhubani+district&f=false|title=Madhubani Painting|date=30 September 2017|publisher=Abhinav Publications|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221110108/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UvuJyvtsCjwC&pg=PA96&dq=madhubani+art+madhubani+district&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8kJ761p_SAhUrIsAKHb2ZDfYQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&q=madhubani+art+madhubani+district&f=false|archivedate=21 February 2017|df=dmy-all|isbn=9788170171560}}</ref> This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that led to the term \"Madhubani art\" being used alongside \"Mithila Painting.\"<ref>Carolyn Brown Heinz, 2006, \"Documenting the Image in Mithila Art,\" Visual Anthropology Review, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 5-33</ref>\n\nThe paintings were traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and [[canvas]].<ref name=krupa>{{cite news|last=Krupa|first=Lakshmi|title=Madhubani walls|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/madhubani-walls/article4272411.ece|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129100902/http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/madhubani-walls/article4272411.ece|archivedate=29 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. Thus, Madhubani painting has received GI ([[Geographical Indication]]) status. Madhubani paintings use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants. [[Ochre]] and [[lampblack]] are used for reddish-brown and black, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nMadhubani paintings mostly depict people and their association with nature and scenes and deities from the ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, the moon, and religious plants like [[tulsi]] are also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally, no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila Region, mainly by women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/madhubani.php|title=Know India: Madhubani Painting|publisher=India.gov.in|accessdate=2013-09-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907150703/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/madhubani.php|archivedate=7 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is still practiced and kept alive in institutions spread across the Mithila region.

In the 1960s Bharni, Kachni and Tantrik styles were mainly done by Brahman and Kayashth women, who are 'upper caste' women in India and Nepal. Their themes were mainly religious and they depicted Gods and Goddesses, plants and animals in their paintings. People of lower castes included aspects of their daily life and symbols, the story of Raja Shailesh [guard of the village] and much more, in their paintings. Nowadays Madhubani art has become a globalised art form, so there is no difference in the work on the basis of the caste system. They work in all five styles. Madhubani art has received worldwide attention.<ref name=\"a-painter-from-patna-crafted-a-live-madhubani-painting-in-bangkok/\">{{cite web|url=https://www.atulyabihar.com/a-painter-from-patna-crafted-a-live-madhubani-painting-in-bangkok/ |title=\u092a\u091f\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0932\u093e\u0932 \u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u093e\u0907\u0935 \u092e\u0927\u0941\u092c\u0928\u0940 \u092a\u0947\u0902\u091f\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u092f\u0940\u0902 |language=hi |website=atulyabihar.com |date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Contributions ==\nThe Madhubani painting tradition played a key role in environmental conservation efforts in India in 2012, where there was frequent deforestation in the state of Bihar.  Shashthi Nath Jha, who runs the Gram Vikas Parishad, an NGO, started the initiative as an attempt to protect local trees that were being cut down in the name of expanding roads and development. The main reason behind this was that the trees were traditionally adorned with forms of gods and other religious and spiritual images such as those of Radha-Krishna, Rama-Sita, scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata and other mythologies. This recognition of the cultural and aesthetic significance of the trees largely prevented them from being cut.<ref name=\"Dhiraj Singh IDC IIT BOMBAY/\">{{cite web|url=https://www.craftsvilla.com/blog/history-of-madhubani-art-paintings-will-leave-you-in-awe/ |title=DHIRAJ SINGH SLIET |website=craftsvilla.com}}</ref>\n\n== Artists and awards ==\nMadhubani painting received official recognition in 1969 when [[Sita Devi (painter)|Sita Devi]] received the State award by Government of Bihar.

The scene cuts to [[Barney Stinson|Barney]] and Robin in the bathroom of [[Marshall Eriksen|Marshall]] and [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]]'s [[Long Island]] house, where Robin explains that she is a week late with her [[Menstruation|period]], and has a doctor's appointment to find out if she is [[pregnant]]. She also reveals that she and [[List of How I Met Your Mother characters#Kevin|Kevin]] have not yet had [[sexual intercourse|sex]], meaning that if she is pregnant, Barney is the father. Although Barney is giddy at the prospect of becoming a father, Robin is still firmly against having children of her own. Barney comes to share her reservations when he sees how the life of an old friend, \"Insane Duane\", has changed since marrying and having children. Both Robin and Barney are relieved when the doctor informs them that Robin is not pregnant.\n\nFor a day Robin celebrates not being pregnant, until she receives additional news from the doctor: she is [[Female infertility|unable to have children]]. Robin struggles to find a way to tell her friends, so she lies and says instead that she is disappointed at not making the Canadian women's [[pole vault]]ing team. The others notice that Robin has been acting strange lately, and try to figure out why. After [[Ted Mosby|Ted]] and Lily joke that Robin [[casual sex|hooked up]] with Barney, Ted assumes that she is [[Homesickness|homesick]] for Canada. When Ted offers her plane tickets for a Christmas visit to his home town in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Robin rejects the offer and tells him that he should not feel responsible for cheering her up. She goes for a walk in [[Central Park]], where it is revealed that the kids Robin is telling the story to exist only in her imagination, and she is only talking to herself on a [[Bench (furniture)|park bench]] as she begins to come to terms with her bad news.\n\nShe returns to the apartment to discover an intricate Christmas light display, animated and accompanied by vigorous [[AC/DC]] music, which Ted has erected. He tells her that while she does not have to tell him what happened, he will never stop trying to cheer her up. Robin dissolves into tears and is comforted by Ted, as Future Ted tells his kids that Robin never became a pole vaulter, but did become a famous journalist, traveled the world and even enjoyed a stint as a [[Torero|bullfighter]]; he also notes that she was never alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Marshall wants to have better [[Christmas]] decorations than neighborhood rival Richard Holdman.<ref>[http://www.holdman.com/christmas/ Holdman is a real person, a resident of Utah, who has an extensive Christmas-light project]</ref> He plans an entire display, which he names the \"Symphony of Illumination\" for the Long Island house, complete with [[Mannheim Steamroller]] Christmas music. When he begins the installation, he gratefully accepts an offer of assistance from a neighborhood teenager, Scott. However, Scott leaves him stranded on the roof, steals Marshall's phone and uses it to his advantage when texting Lily, and throws a party in Marshall's house. Though Marshall briefly relents, recalling his own antics when he was young, he is outraged when he sees Scott abusing a giant stocking that his late grandmother had knitted for Marshall's future child.

The scene cuts to [[Barney Stinson|Barney]] and Robin in the bathroom of [[Marshall Eriksen|Marshall]] and [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]]'s [[Long Island]] house, where Robin explains that she is a week late with her [[Menstruation|period]], and has a doctor's appointment to find out if she is [[pregnant]]. She also reveals that she and [[List of How I Met Your Mother characters#Kevin|Kevin]] have not yet had [[sexual intercourse|sex]], meaning that if she is pregnant, Barney is the father. Although Barney is giddy at the prospect of becoming a father, Robin is still firmly against having children of her own. Barney comes to share her reservations when he sees how the life of an old friend, \"Insane Duane\", has changed since marrying and having children. Both Robin and Barney are relieved when the doctor informs them that Robin is not pregnant.\n\nFor a day Robin celebrates not being pregnant, until she receives additional news from the doctor: she is [[Female infertility|unable to have children]]. Robin struggles to find a way to tell her friends, so she lies and says instead that she is disappointed at not making the Canadian women's [[pole vault]]ing team. The others notice that Robin has been acting strange lately, and try to figure out why. After [[Ted Mosby|Ted]] and Lily joke that Robin [[casual sex|hooked up]] with Barney, Ted assumes that she is [[Homesickness|homesick]] for Canada. When Ted offers her plane tickets for a Christmas visit to his home town in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Robin rejects the offer and tells him that he should not feel responsible for cheering her up. She goes for a walk in [[Central Park]], where it is revealed that the kids Robin is telling the story to exist only in her imagination, and she is only talking to herself on a [[Bench (furniture)|park bench]] as she begins to come to terms with her bad news.\n\nShe returns to the apartment to discover an intricate Christmas light display, animated and accompanied by vigorous [[AC/DC]] music, which Ted has erected. He tells her that while she does not have to tell him what happened, he will never stop trying to cheer her up. Robin dissolves into tears and is comforted by Ted, as Future Ted tells his kids that Robin never became a pole vaulter, but did become a famous journalist, traveled the world and even enjoyed a stint as a [[Torero|bullfighter]]; he also notes that she was never alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Marshall wants to have better [[Christmas]] decorations than neighborhood rival Richard Holdman.<ref>[http://www.holdman.com/christmas/ Holdman is a real person, a resident of Utah, who has an extensive Christmas-light project]</ref> He plans an entire display, which he names the \"Symphony of Illumination\" for the Long Island house, complete with [[Mannheim Steamroller]] Christmas music. When he begins the installation, he gratefully accepts an offer of assistance from a neighborhood teenager, Scott. However, Scott leaves him stranded on the roof, steals Marshall's phone and uses it to his advantage when texting Lily, and throws a party in Marshall's house. Though Marshall briefly relents, recalling his own antics when he was young, he is outraged when he sees Scott abusing a giant stocking that his late grandmother had knitted for Marshall's future child. He remains stranded on the roof until Lily arrives, unwittingly paying Scott 50 dollars for his help, and then sees the damage Scott has caused inside the house during the party.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe episode received very positive reviews, with viewers praising the Robin-centred plot.\n\nDonna Bowman of [[The A.V.

At an [[elevation]] of 1,275 m (4,180&nbsp;ft), it is the second highest village in Cyprus after [[Prodromos (Cyprus)|Prodromos]].\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:IM000476.jpg]]   --><!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DSC01725-1.JPG]] -->\n\n==Demographics==\nThe population of the village, as estimated in late 2006, was 214. In the middle of the 20th century the population was over 1,000 with a very active primary school. The primary school today is used for camping during the summer months. The small number of children still at the village use the school at a nearby village, Kyperounta.\n\n==Economy==\nMost inhabitants of the village are retired. Most of the economically active inhabitants are employed in agriculture and the local construction industry. A small minority are civil servants.\n\nVillagers work in small orchards in the surrounding valleys, tending walnut, apple, pear, peach and other fruit-bearing trees. Vines and almond trees are cultivated on the slopes of the mountain.\n[[File:Spraying an orchard in Chandria, Cyprus.jpg]]  \n[[File:chandria for wiki.jpg|thumb|View of Chandria from the east]]\n\n==History==\nAccording to local legend, during the Venetian period there was a large villa in the part of the village known as Grammata, which belonged to [[Cardinal Marcus Cornaro]], nephew of Queen [[Caterina Cornaro]]. Other locations of the area like Vassiliko, Vassilitzi and Netikos indicate that the whole region was his feudal area.\n\nThe local hero of the village is [[Stylianos Lenas]], who died in battle against the British colonial rulers during the 1955-1959 resistance. A considerable number of the village's men who took part were members of [[EOKA]], the [[anti-colonial]] organisation, which fought for the expulsion of [[United Kingdom|British]] troops from the island.\n\nThe local football club of the village is named after the local hero.\n\nAccording to Leronymos Peristianis, and to the testimonies of older members of the village, a communal school operated in a room of the church during the Turkish occupation of Cyprus. The teacher was a monk from Handria who left the monastery of Mesa Potamos after it closed down.\n\nGroups of EOKA guerillas operated within the village area during 1955-59. During the historic ambush of Chandria which took place in March 1956, Christos Chartas from Polystypos was killed in action.\n\nThe inhabitants of the village are known for their dedication to national and religious traditions. In 1870 the religious Chandria inhabitants made a donation to [[Trooditissa Monastery]] of a silver-bound bible, one of the holy heirlooms of the Monastery.\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe village is built on the south side of the Madari mountain at an altitude of 1,275m.\n\nTributaries of the [[River Limnatis]] traverse the village area, forming narrow troughs. One such tributary is the Zavos tributary which is used for much of the irrigation in the valleys below the village. Very little land around Handria is suitable for farming, and this has been painstakingly terraced.\n\n===Co-ordinates===\nUTM : VD96\n\n===Geographical coordinates in decimal degrees (WGS84)===\n*Latitude : 34.946\n*Longitude : 32.996\n\nThe Chandria climate is refreshingly cool in summer and very cold in winter, with a fair amount of rain and snow.\n\nThe village stands at the junction linking the villages of Pitsilia that belongs to the Limassol District with those of the Nicosia district. It is two kilometres from Kyperounda, six kilometres from Agros and four kilometres from Polystypos.\n\nThere is a great interest in petrologic and structural constraints on the origin of foliated [[gabbro]] near Chandria, on the Troodos [[Ophiolite]]. Geology students frequently visit to study  the intrusive igneous rocks in the road cuttings of Handria.\n\n==Local government==\nThe President of the community or ''mouktaris'' is Mr. Charilaos Socratous.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Limassol District}}\n\n[[Category:Communities in Limassol District]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n<!-- Basic info  ---------------->| official_name                   = Chandria\n| other_name                      = \n| native_name                     = \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\n| nickname                        = \n| settlement_type                 = <!--For Town or Village (Leave blank for the default City)-->\n| motto                           = <!-- images and maps  ----------->\n| image_skyline                   = View of Chandria 01.jpg\n| imagesize                       = 300\n| image_caption                   = \n| image_flag                      = \n| flag_size                       = \n| image_seal                      = \n| seal_size                       = \n| pushpin_map                     = Cyprus<!-- the name of a location map as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Location_map -->\n| pushpin_relief                  = y\n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_mapsize                 = 300\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location in Cyprus\n<!-- Location ------------------>| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|Cyprus}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Districts of Cyprus|District]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[Limassol District]]\n| subdivision_type2               = Municipality\n| subdivision_name2               = \n| subdivision_type3               = \n| subdivision_name3               = <!-- Politics ----------------->\n| government_footnotes            = \n| government_type                 = \n| leader_title                    = \n| leader_name                     = \n| established_title               = <!-- Settled -->\n| established_date                = <!-- Area    --------------------->\n| area_magnitude                  = \n| unit_pref                       = Imperial <!--Enter: Imperial, if Imperial (metric) is desired--> Metric\n| area_footnotes                  = \n| area_total_km2                  = <!-- ALL fields dealing with a measurements are subject to automatic unit conversion-->\n| area_land_km2                   = <!--See table @ Template:Infobox Settlement for details on automatic unit conversion-->\n| area_metro_km2                  = <!-- Population   ----------------------->\n| population_as_of                = 2001\n| population_footnotes            = <ref>[http://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/cystat/statistics.nsf/All/A5E0A9096615A568C2257122003FB72E/$file/POPULATION%20BY%20MUNICIPALITY_COMMUNITY-EN.xls?OpenElement Census 2001]</ref>\n| population_note                 = \n| population_total                = 205\n| population_density_km2          = <!-- General information  --------------->\n| timezone                        = [[Eastern European Time|EET]]\n| utc_offset                      = +2\n| timezone_DST                    = [[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST                  = +3\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|34|56|34|N|32|59|40|E|region:CY_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n| elevation_footnotes             = <!--for references: use <ref> </ref> tags-->\n| elevation_m                     = 1191\n| elevation_ft                    = <!-- Area/postal codes & others -------->\n| postal_code_type                = <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n| postal_code                     = \n| area_code                       = \n| blank_name                      = \n| blank_info                      = \n| blank1_name                     = \n| blank1_info                     = \n| website                         = \n| footnotes                       = \n| name                            = \n}}\n \n'''Chandria''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac) is a village in [[Cyprus]] in the [[Limassol]] administrative district and belongs to the Pitsilia group of villages.

This play revolves around two different families which will connect each other with the progression of events.\n\nZaid is living with his mother, wife and a son. His mother raises him with lots of sufferings and difficulties after the death of his father. She made sure about his quality studies despite their financial problems. Zaid met his wife (Fiza) in university and they fall in love with each other. Fiza belongs to a rich family while Zaid is just a white collar guy. Fiza's parent opposes her below standard choice and discontinues their connection with her after wedding.\n\nAnother dimension of the play is Saleem's family, who live with his wife (Amna) and a son. He is kind of short-tempered, truculent and works in a chemical factory. Once he gets ill and after a complete diagnosis, shocking news reveals that he is suffering from lungs cancer. Now Amna faces financial crises due to Saleem's illness.\n\nThe fate brings another woman in Zaid's life after the departure of Fiza. They both develop strong bonding, affection and soft corner for each other. Fiza who is busy in collecting materialistic happiness for her close ones, seems like she is losing them forever.\n\nIs it a sensible act to value our future happiness while ignoring present happiness?\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Imran Abbas (actor)|Imran Abbas]] as Zaid\n*[[Sarah Khan]] as Amna, Saleem's wife and Zaid's Second Wife\n*[[Arij Fatyma]] as Fiza, Zaid's First Wife\n*Saleem Mairaj as Saleem, Amna's First Husband\n*[[Samina Ahmed]] as Humera\n*Ray Khan\n*Saad Faridi\n*Tahir Jatao\n*Birjees Farooqui\n*Mehboob Sultan\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe [[Original Soundtrack|original soundtrack]] of Yaar-e-Bewafa is composed and sung by [[Imran Abbas]], the lead actor of the drama serial.

It originally aired on September 20, 2010.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2015}}\n[[Future Ted]] pontificates on the important days in a relationship: \"the day you meet the girl of your dreams, and the day you marry her.\" The audience is shown a church backyard, where [[Marshall Eriksen|Marshall]] brings [[Ted Mosby|Ted]] a beer, both men dressed in [[tuxedo]]s. Marshall notices Ted is nervous by his habit of ripping the beer bottle labels. Flashing back to the present day at MacLaren's, [[Barney Stinson|Barney]] notices Ted doing the same thing as he sits grading papers. Amidst his work, Ted is nervous about a blonde girl at the bar he wants to approach, and Barney boosts his confidence before calling \"[[wikt:dibs|dibs]].\"\n\nWhile they argue, [[Robin Scherbatsky|Robin]] walks into the bar, looking disheveled and holding a burger and a bag of fries. After being left by Don weeks earlier, she has sunk into a depression, neglecting to wash and completely letting herself go, even going as far as to swear Ted to not sleep with her (which he finds easier in her current state). She concurs with Ted that the girl is on a date, as she is reading a book. When Barney heckles her appearance, Robin decides to prove him wrong, so she returns to the apartment to clean up and returns to the bar in a [[sun dress]] (much to Barney's delight), before waving off a guy who hits on her.\n\nTed notices the girl ([[Kaylee DeFer]]) that he has been watching at the bar is standing next to Cindy ([[Rachel Bilson]]), the girl he had briefly dated from his school, and whose roommate Future Ted says is the eponymous mother. After their one date, Cindy had treated him badly when they met during the school day. Ted assumes that the woman at the bar is Cindy's roommate, and is determined to meet her. Cindy sees Ted and takes him aside, thanking him for helping her realize what she was looking for, and invites him to say goodbye to her before he leaves.\n\nA little later, Marshall and Lily show up at MacLaren's, arguing about trying to get pregnant. Lily had planned a romantic evening at home, with candles and banjo music, but gets angry with Marshall when she finds out that he has told his father that they are trying to have a child. Marshall argues that his father is a part of his life and deserves to know, but Lily can't stand Mr. Eriksen's constant calls and domineering personality. (Barney mentions that if he knew his father's phone number, he'd be calling him all the time, before turning his focus elsewhere.) Lily goes after Marshall, and the two reconcile, agreeing that his father is somewhat insane and very enthusiastic, just like Marshall. They both then head upstairs.\n\nTed decides he's going to go for it, so he approaches the two ladies, assuming he is going to be introduced to the woman he thinks is Cindy's roommate, but at that moment, Cindy kisses her, and Ted realizes that the blond woman is not Cindy's roommate but a girl she was dating. (Future Ted tells his kids that Cindy and the nameless blond woman ended up having a daughter together.) Then, he tells his children that he met their mother at a wedding.  The scene flashes forward to a wedding: the church backyard seen earlier in the episode with Ted and Marshall. Ted admits to Marshall that he is nervous about his toast at the wedding and he wants it to be perfect. It is also revealed that Ted is the best man, and is called in by [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]]. It starts to rain, and Ted says that he doesn't have an umbrella.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Quote box|quote=It was such an honor to be able to use music from a Beatle (and one of my favorite albums of all time&nbsp;\u2013 ''All Things Must Pass'' is definitely on my 'desert island' albums list) [\"[[Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)]]\" by [[George Harrison]]].
