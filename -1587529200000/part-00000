At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995. ''Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program: Principles and Parameters in Syntactic Theory''. Wiley-Blackwell; Uriagereka, Juan. 1998.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element withing a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant, species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained.

Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element withing a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant, species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or [[natural resource]]s in addition to skills and training and complex combinations of such assets are often important, as when multiple items of specialized equipment and skilled operators are used to produce a single product. The division of labour is the motive for [[trade]] and the source of [[economic interdependence]].\n\nAfter the [[Neolithic Revolution]], pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labour, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites.  This specialization was furthered by the process of [[industrialisation]], and [[Industrial Revolution]]-era factories.  Accordingly many [[Classical economics|classical economists]] as well as some mechanical engineers such as [[Charles Babbage]] were proponents of division of labour. Also, having workers perform single or limited tasks eliminated the long training period required to train craftsmen, who were replaced with lesser paid but more productive unskilled workers.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Exploring the Black Box: Technology, economics and history\n |url=https://archive.org/details/exploringblackbo00rose\n |url-access=registration\n |last=Rosenberg\n |first= Nathan\n|year=1993 |publisher =Cambridge University Press\n|location=\n|isbn= 0-521-459559|pages=[https://archive.org/details/exploringblackbo00rose/page/25 25], 27\u201332, 37\u20138\n}}\n</ref>\n\nHistorically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total [[Output (economics)|output]] and [[trade]], the rise of [[capitalism]], and the increasing complexity of [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient [[Sumer]]ian ([[Mesopotamia]]n) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.\n\n== Theorists ==\n\n=== Plato ===\nIn [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'', the origin of the state lies in the natural inequality of humanity, which is embodied in the division of labour.\n\n{{quote|Well then, how will our state supply these needs?

And it is impossible for a man of many trades to do all of them well. In large cities, however, because many make demands on each trade, one alone is enough to support a man, and often less than one: for instance one man makes shoes for men, another for women, there are places even where one man earns a living just by mending shoes, another by cutting them out, another just by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but assembles the parts. Of necessity, he who pursues a very specialized task will do it best.<ref>Book VIII, ch, ii, [https://archive.org/details/cyropaediaorins00xenogoog/page/n268 <!-- pg=244 quote=cyropaedia xenophon I\"in small towns\". --> 4[&#93;-6], cited in ''[[The Ancient Economy (book)|The Ancient Economy]]'' by M.

Even if we assume an absolute minimum of food...that amount of food could be obtained only after much preparation...Thus, he cannot do without a combination of many powers from among his fellow beings, if he is to obtain food for himself and for them.

Classically the workers in a [[shipyard]] would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another. But the Dutch had it organized with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships. People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on [[political economy]].\n\nPetty also applied the principle to his survey of [[Ireland]]. His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training.\n\n=== Bernard de Mandeville ===\n[[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] discusses the matter in the second volume of ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' (1714).  This elaborates many matters raised by the original poem about a 'Grumbling Hive'. He says:\n{{quote|But if one will wholly apply himself to the making of Bows and Arrows, whilst another provides Food, a third builds Huts, a fourth makes Garments, and a fifth Utensils, they not only become useful to one another, but the Callings and Employments themselves will in the same Number of Years receive much greater Improvements, than if all had been promiscuously followed by every one of the Five.}}\n\n=== David Hume ===\n\n{{quote|When every individual person labors apart, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labour being employed in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of employment, our ability increases: And by mutual succour we are less exposed to fortune and accidents. \u2019Tis by this additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes advantageous.}}\n\n=== Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau ===\n[[File:Defrance, Visiting a nail factory (18th c).jpg|thumb|''Visiting a Nail Factory'' by [[L\u00e9onard Defrance]] (18th century) ]]\n\nIn his introduction to ''The Art of the Pin-Maker'' (''Art de l'\u00c9pinglier'') (1761),<ref>R.

Like du Monceau, his example was the making of pins. Unlike [[Plato]], Smith famously argued that the difference between a street porter and a philosopher was as much a consequence of the division of labour as its cause. Therefore, while for Plato the level of specialization determined by the division of labour was externally determined, for Smith it was the dynamic engine of economic progress.  However, in a further chapter of the same book, Smith criticizes the division of labour saying it can lead to \"the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people. \u2026 unless the government takes some pains to prevent it.\"<ref>\"The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgement concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life... But in every improved and civilized society, this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall unless the government takes some pains to prevent it.\", ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]]</ref> The contradiction has led to some debate over Smith's opinion of the division of labour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rothbard|first=Murray|title=The Celebrated Adam Smith|url=https://mises.org/page/1430|website=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=2012-05-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015921/http://mises.org/page/1430|archivedate=12 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] agreed with Smith: \"Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of the faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |year= 1841 |title= Democracy in America: Volume I |location= New York, NY |publisher= J.&nbsp;& H.&nbsp;G.

Smith uses the example of a production capability of an individual pin maker compared to a manufacturing business that employed 10 men.\n\n\u201cOne man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day;\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#chap36|title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, by Adam Smith|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nSmith saw the importance of matching skills with equipment \u2013 usually in the context of an [[organization]].  For example, pin makers were organized with one making the head, another the body, each using different equipment.  Similarly, he emphasized a large number of skills, used in cooperation and with suitable equipment, were required to build a ship.\n\nIn the modern economic discussion, the term [[human capital]] would be used.  Smith's insight suggests that the huge increases in productivity obtainable from [[technology]] or technological progress are possible because human and physical capital are matched, usually in an organization. See also a short discussion of Adam Smith's theory in the context of [[Pin Factory|business processes]].\n\nBabbage wrote a seminal work \"On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures\" analyzing perhaps for the first time the division of labour in factories.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Nathan|title=Babbage: pioneer economist by Nathan Rosenberg|url=http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/babbage/rosenb.html|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Immanuel Kant ===\nIn the ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' 1785, Kant notes the value of the division of labour:<blockquote>All crafts, trades and arts have profited from the division of labour; for when each worker sticks to one particular kind of work that needs to be handled differently from all the others, he can do it better and more easily than when one person does everything. Where work is not thus differentiated and divided, where everyone is a jack-of-all-trades, the crafts remain at an utterly primitive level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5682|title=Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals by Immanuel Kant - Free Ebook|website=Project Gutenberg|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Karl Marx ===\nMarx argued that increasing the specialization may also lead to workers with poorer overall skills and a lack of enthusiasm for their work. He described the process as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]: workers become more and more specialized and work becomes repetitive, eventually leading to complete alienation from the process of production. The worker then becomes \"depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine\".<ref>Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, 1844, First Manuscript, in T.B. Bottomore, Karl Marx Early Writings, C.A. Watts and Co. Ltd., London, 1963, p.&nbsp;72</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Marx argued that the division of labour creates less-skilled workers. As the work becomes more specialized, less training is needed for each specific job, and the workforce, overall, is less skilled than if one worker did one job entirely.<ref>Wage Labor & Capital</ref>\n\nAmong Marx's theoretical contributions is his sharp distinction between the economic and the [[social division of labour]].<ref>Marx, K. (1977). ''[[Capital, Volume I|Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1.]]'' New York: Vintage Books, pp. 781\u201394.</ref> That is, some forms of labour co-operation are purely due to \"technical necessity\", but others are a result of a \"social control\" function related to a class and status hierarchy. If these two divisions are conflated, it might appear as though the existing division of labour is technically inevitable and immutable, rather than (in good part) socially constructed and influenced by [[Power (sociology)|power]] relationships. He also argues that in a [[communism|communist]] society, the division of labour is transcended, meaning that balanced human development occurs where people fully express their nature in the variety of creative work that they do.<ref>Ali Rattansi: Marx and the Division of Labor (Macmillan, 1982)</ref>\n\n=== Henry David Thoreau ===\n[[Henry David Thoreau]] criticized the division of labour in ''[[Walden]]'' (published in 1854), on the basis that it removes people from a sense of connectedness with society and with the world at large, including nature. He claimed that the average man in a civilized society is less wealthy, in practice than one in \"savage\" society. The answer he gave was that [[self-sufficiency]] was enough to cover one's basic needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThoreau's friend and mentor, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], criticized the division of labour in \"The American Scholar\"; a widely informed, holistic citizenry is vital for the spiritual and physical health of the country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scientific management : a management idea to reach a mass audience|last=Khurana, A.|date=2009|publisher=Global India Pub|isbn=978-93-80228-01-3|location=New Delhi|pages=|oclc=495418951}}</ref>\n\n=== \u00c9mile Durkheim ===\nIn his seminal work, ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]'', [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]<ref>A founding father of sociology, Emile Durkheim, best known for his 1893 seminal work, ''De La Division Du Travail Social'' (''The Division of Labor in Society''), \"dedicated himself to the establishment of sociology as a legitimate and respected science and as an instrument of rational social action.\" {{cite journal | last1 = Alpert | first1 = Harry | year = 1959 | title = Emile Durkheim: A Perspective and Appreciation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 462\u201365 | doi=10.2307/2089532| jstor = 2089532 }}</ref> observes that the division of labour appears in all societies and positively correlates with societal advancement because it increases as a society progresses. Durkheim arrived at the same conclusion regarding the positive effects of the division of labour as his theoretical predecessor, [[Adam Smith]].

It is argued that it is fully possible to achieve balanced human development within capitalism, and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] is downplayed as mere romantic fiction.\n\n=== Friedrich A.

The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labour on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the \"state\" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type.<ref>Editor/Trans.

Critics, however, allege that international specialization cannot be explained sufficiently in terms of \"the work nations do best\", rather this specialization is guided more by [[commerce|commercial]] criteria, which favour some countries over others.\n\nThe [[OECD]] recently advised (28 June 2005) that:\n\n{{quote|Efficient policies to encourage employment and combat unemployment are essential if countries are to reap the full benefits of globalization and avoid a backlash against open trade... Job losses in some sectors, along with new job opportunities in other sectors, are an inevitable accompaniment of the process of globalization... The challenge is to ensure that the adjustment process involved in matching available workers with new job openings works as smoothly as possible.}}\n\nFew studies have taken place regarding the global division of labour.  Information can be drawn from [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] and national statistical offices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn one study, [[Deon Filmer]] estimated that 2.474 billion people participated in the global non-domestic labour force in the mid-1990s. Of these,\n\n* around 15%, or 379 million people, worked in the industry,\n* a third, or 800 million worked in services, and\n* over 40%, or 1,074 million, in agriculture.\n\nThe majority of workers in industry and services were wage and salary earners \u2013 58 percent of the industrial workforce and 65 percent of the services workforce. But a big portion was self-employed or involved in family labour. Filmer suggests the total of employees worldwide in the 1990s was about 880 million, compared with around a billion working on own account on the land (mainly peasants), and some 480 million working on own account in industry and services. The 2007 ILO Global Employment Trends Report indicated that services have surpassed agriculture for the first time in human history: \"In 2006 the service sector\u2019s share of global employment overtook agriculture for the first time, increasing from 39.5 percent to 40 percent.

In view of the global extremities of the division of labour, the question is often raised about what division of labour would be most ideal, beautiful, efficient and just.\n\nTwo styles of management that are seen in modern organizations are control and commitment, the control being the division of labour style of the past and commitment being the style of the future. Control management is based on the principles of job specialization and the division of labour. This is the [[assembly line]] style of job specialization where employees are given a very narrow set of tasks or one specific task. Commitment division of labour is oriented on including the employee and building a level of internal commitment towards accomplishing tasks. Tasks include more responsibility and are coordinated based on expertise rather than formal position.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">McAlister-Kizzier, Donna. \"Division of Labor.\"  Encyclopedia of Business and Finance, 2nd ed.. 2007. Encyclopedia.com. 1 Dec. 2014 http://www.encyclopedia.com</ref>\n\nJob specialization is advantageous in developing employee expertise in a field and boosting organizational production. However, disadvantages of job specialization included limited employee skill, a dependence on entire department fluency, and employee discontent with repetitious tasks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIt is widely accepted that the division of labour is to a great extent inevitable, simply because no one can do all tasks at once. Labour hierarchy is a very common feature of the modern workplace structure, but of course, the way these hierarchies are structured can be influenced by a variety of different factors.\n\nSize, cost, and the development of new technology are factors that have influenced job specialization structures in the modern workplace. The cost of job specialization is what limits small organizations from dividing their labour responsibilities, but as organizations increase in size there is a correlation in the rise of the division of labour. Technological developments have led to a decrease in the amount of job specialization in organizations as new technology makes it easier for fewer employees to accomplish a variety of tasks and still enhance production. New technology has also been supportive in the flow of information between departments helping to reduce the feeling of department isolation.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\" />\n\nIt is often agreed{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) competency or ability. This important concept of [[meritocracy]] could be read as an [[explanation]] or as a justification of why a division of labour is the way it is.\n\nIn general, in capitalist economies, such things are not decided consciously.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Different people try different things, and that which is most effective cost-wise (produces the most and best output with the least input) will generally be adopted.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Often techniques that work in one place or time do not work as well in another.  This does not present a problem,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} as the only requirement of a capitalist system is that you turn a profit.\n\n==Limitations==\n\n[[Adam Smith]] famously said in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market. This is because it is by the exchange that each person can be specialized in their work and yet still have access to a wide range of goods and services. Hence, reductions in barriers to exchange lead to increases in the division of labour and so help to drive economic growth. Limitations to the division of labour have also been related to coordination and transportation costs.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.1956.tb02717.x | volume=9 | issue=2 | year=1956 | journal=Kyklos | pages=181\u2013189 | last1 = Houthakker | first1 = H.

''Doctoral dissertation, Harvard University''</ref> These help to explain issues in modern work organization, such as task consolidations in [[business process reengineering]] and the use of multi-skilled work teams. For instance, one stage of a production process may temporarily work at a slower pace, forcing other stages to slow down. One answer to this is to make some portion of resources mobile between stages so that those resources must be capable of undertaking a wider range of tasks. Another is to consolidate tasks so that they are undertaken one after another by the same workers and other resources. Stocks between stages can also help to reduce the problem to some extent but are costly and can hamper quality control. Modern [[flexible manufacturing system]]s require both flexible machines and flexible workers.\n\nIn project-based work, the coordination of resources is a difficult issue for the [[project manager]] as project [[Schedule (project management)|schedules]] and resulting resource bookings are based on [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of task durations and so are subject to subsequent revisions. Again, consolidating tasks so that they are undertaken consecutively by the same resources and having resources available that can be called on at short-notice from other tasks can help to reduce such problems, though at the cost of reduced specialization.\n\nThere are also advantages in a reduced division of labour where knowledge would otherwise have to be transferred between stages.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2003.07.015 | volume=161 | issue=3 | title=Activity consolidation to improve responsiveness | year=2005 | journal=European Journal of Operational Research | pages=683\u2013703 | last1 = Rummel | first1 = Jeffrey L. | last2 = Walter | first2 = Zhiping | last3 = Dewan | first3 = Rajiv | last4 = Seidman | first4 = Abraham}}</ref> For example, having a single person deal with a customer query means that only that one person has to be familiarised with the customer\u2019s details.

This type of finding has been replicated in a variety of studies, including modern industrial economies. These entailments do not restrict how much work for any given task could be done by men (e.g., in [[cooking]]) or by women (e.g., in clearing forests) but are only least-effort or role-consistent tendencies. To the extent that women clear forests for agriculture, for example, they tend to do the entire agricultural sequence of tasks on those clearings. In theory, these types of constraints could be removed by provisions of child care, but [[ethnographic]] examples are lacking.\n\n== Industrial organizational psychology ==\nJob satisfaction has been shown to improve as an employee is given the task of a specific job. Students who have received PhDs in a chosen field later report increased satisfaction compared to their previous jobs.

Division of labour, instead, refers to the allocation of tasks to individuals or organizations according to the skills and/or equipment those people or organizations possess. Often division of labour and division of work are both part of the economic activity within an industrial nation or organization.\n\n== Disaggregated work ==\nJob divided into elemental parts is sometimes called [[disaggregated work]]. The workers specializing in particular parts of the job are called specialists or [[professional]]s. The workers doing a portion of a non-recurring work may be called contractors, [[freelancer]]s or temporary workers. Modern communication technologies, in particular the internet, gave rise to [[sharing economy]] which is orchestrated by [[online marketplace]]s of various kinds of disaggregated work.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Complex society]]\n* [[Economic sector]]\n* [[Family economy]]\n* [[Fordism]]\n* [[New international division of labour]]\n* [[Productive and unproductive labour]]\n* [[Price system]]\n* [[Surplus product]]\n* [[Time use survey]]\n* [[Urbanization]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Gary S.

Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or [[natural resource]]s in addition to skills and training and complex combinations of such assets are often important, as when multiple items of specialized equipment and skilled operators are used to produce a single product. The division of labour is the motive for [[trade]] and the source of [[economic interdependence]].\n\nAfter the [[Neolithic Revolution]], pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labour, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites.  This specialization was furthered by the process of [[industrialisation]], and [[Industrial Revolution]]-era factories.  Accordingly many [[Classical economics|classical economists]] as well as some mechanical engineers such as [[Charles Babbage]] were proponents of division of labour. Also, having workers perform single or limited tasks eliminated the long training period required to train craftsmen, who were replaced with lesser paid but more productive unskilled workers.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Exploring the Black Box: Technology, economics and history\n |url=https://archive.org/details/exploringblackbo00rose\n |url-access=registration\n |last=Rosenberg\n |first= Nathan\n|year=1993 |publisher =Cambridge University Press\n|location=\n|isbn= 0-521-459559|pages=[https://archive.org/details/exploringblackbo00rose/page/25 25], 27\u201332, 37\u20138\n}}\n</ref>\n\nHistorically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total [[Output (economics)|output]] and [[trade]], the rise of [[capitalism]], and the increasing complexity of [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient [[Sumer]]ian ([[Mesopotamia]]n) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.\n\n== Theorists ==\n\n=== Plato ===\nIn [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'', the origin of the state lies in the natural inequality of humanity, which is embodied in the division of labour.\n\n{{quote|Well then, how will our state supply these needs? It will need a farmer, a builder, and a weaver, and also, I think, a shoemaker and one or two others to provide for our bodily needs. So that the minimum state would consist of four or five men.... (''The Republic'', p. 103, Penguin Classics edition.)}}\n\nSilvermintz notes that \"Historians of economic thought credit Plato, primarily on account of arguments advanced in his Republic, as an early proponent of the division of labour.\" Notwithstanding this, Silvermintz argues that \"While Plato recognizes both the economic and political benefits of the division of labour, he ultimately critiques this form of economic arrangement insofar as it hinders the individual from ordering his own soul by cultivating acquisitive motives over prudence and reason.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Silvermintz|first=Daniel|title=Plato's Supposed Defense of the Division of Labor: A Reexamination of the Role of Job Specialization in the Republic|journal=History of Political Economy|year=2010|volume=42|issue=4|pages=747\u201372|doi=10.1215/00182702-2010-036}}</ref>\n\n=== Xenophon ===\n[[Xenophon]], in the fourth century BC, makes a passing reference to division of labour in his '[[Cyropaedia]]' (a.k.a. [[Cyropaedia|Education of Cyrus]]).\n\n{{quote|Just as the various trades are most highly developed in large cities, in the same way, food at the palace is prepared in a far superior manner. In small towns, the same man makes couches, doors, ploughs and tables, and often he even builds houses, and still, he is thankful if only he can find enough work to support himself. And it is impossible for a man of many trades to do all of them well. In large cities, however, because many make demands on each trade, one alone is enough to support a man, and often less than one: for instance one man makes shoes for men, another for women, there are places even where one man earns a living just by mending shoes, another by cutting them out, another just by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but assembles the parts. Of necessity, he who pursues a very specialized task will do it best.<ref>Book VIII, ch, ii, [https://archive.org/details/cyropaediaorins00xenogoog/page/n268 <!-- pg=244 quote=cyropaedia xenophon I\"in small towns\". --> 4[&#93;-6], cited in ''[[The Ancient Economy (book)|The Ancient Economy]]'' by M.

In his [[Muqaddimah]], he states:\n{{quote|The power of the individual human being is not sufficient for him to obtain (the food) he needs, and does not provide him with as much as he requires to live. Even if we assume an absolute minimum of food...that amount of food could be obtained only after much preparation...Thus, he cannot do without a combination of many powers from among his fellow beings, if he is to obtain food for himself and for them.

Classically the workers in a [[shipyard]] would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another. But the Dutch had it organized with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships. People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on [[political economy]].\n\nPetty also applied the principle to his survey of [[Ireland]]. His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training.\n\n=== Bernard de Mandeville ===\n[[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] discusses the matter in the second volume of ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' (1714).  This elaborates many matters raised by the original poem about a 'Grumbling Hive'. He says:\n{{quote|But if one will wholly apply himself to the making of Bows and Arrows, whilst another provides Food, a third builds Huts, a fourth makes Garments, and a fifth Utensils, they not only become useful to one another, but the Callings and Employments themselves will in the same Number of Years receive much greater Improvements, than if all had been promiscuously followed by every one of the Five.}}\n\n=== David Hume ===\n\n{{quote|When every individual person labors apart, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labour being employed in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of employment, our ability increases: And by mutual succour we are less exposed to fortune and accidents. \u2019Tis by this additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes advantageous.}}\n\n=== Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau ===\n[[File:Defrance, Visiting a nail factory (18th c).jpg|thumb|''Visiting a Nail Factory'' by [[L\u00e9onard Defrance]] (18th century) ]]\n\nIn his introduction to ''The Art of the Pin-Maker'' (''Art de l'\u00c9pinglier'') (1761),<ref>R.

[...]}}\n\nBy \"division of this work\", Duhamel du Monceau is referring to the subdivisions of \nthe text describing the various trades involved in the pin making activity; this can also be described as a division of labour.\n\n=== Adam Smith ===\n\nIn the first sentence of ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]] foresaw the essence of industrialism by determining that division of labour represents a substantial increase in productivity. Like du Monceau, his example was the making of pins. Unlike [[Plato]], Smith famously argued that the difference between a street porter and a philosopher was as much a consequence of the division of labour as its cause. Therefore, while for Plato the level of specialization determined by the division of labour was externally determined, for Smith it was the dynamic engine of economic progress.  However, in a further chapter of the same book, Smith criticizes the division of labour saying it can lead to \"the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people. \u2026 unless the government takes some pains to prevent it.\"<ref>\"The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgement concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life... But in every improved and civilized society, this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall unless the government takes some pains to prevent it.\", ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]]</ref> The contradiction has led to some debate over Smith's opinion of the division of labour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rothbard|first=Murray|title=The Celebrated Adam Smith|url=https://mises.org/page/1430|website=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=2012-05-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015921/http://mises.org/page/1430|archivedate=12 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] agreed with Smith: \"Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of the faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |year= 1841 |title= Democracy in America: Volume I |location= New York, NY |publisher= J.&nbsp;& H.&nbsp;G.

For example, pin makers were organized with one making the head, another the body, each using different equipment.  Similarly, he emphasized a large number of skills, used in cooperation and with suitable equipment, were required to build a ship.\n\nIn the modern economic discussion, the term [[human capital]] would be used.  Smith's insight suggests that the huge increases in productivity obtainable from [[technology]] or technological progress are possible because human and physical capital are matched, usually in an organization. See also a short discussion of Adam Smith's theory in the context of [[Pin Factory|business processes]].\n\nBabbage wrote a seminal work \"On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures\" analyzing perhaps for the first time the division of labour in factories.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Nathan|title=Babbage: pioneer economist by Nathan Rosenberg|url=http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/babbage/rosenb.html|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Immanuel Kant ===\nIn the ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' 1785, Kant notes the value of the division of labour:<blockquote>All crafts, trades and arts have profited from the division of labour; for when each worker sticks to one particular kind of work that needs to be handled differently from all the others, he can do it better and more easily than when one person does everything. Where work is not thus differentiated and divided, where everyone is a jack-of-all-trades, the crafts remain at an utterly primitive level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5682|title=Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals by Immanuel Kant - Free Ebook|website=Project Gutenberg|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Karl Marx ===\nMarx argued that increasing the specialization may also lead to workers with poorer overall skills and a lack of enthusiasm for their work. He described the process as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]: workers become more and more specialized and work becomes repetitive, eventually leading to complete alienation from the process of production. The worker then becomes \"depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine\".<ref>Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, 1844, First Manuscript, in T.B. Bottomore, Karl Marx Early Writings, C.A. Watts and Co. Ltd., London, 1963, p.&nbsp;72</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Marx argued that the division of labour creates less-skilled workers. As the work becomes more specialized, less training is needed for each specific job, and the workforce, overall, is less skilled than if one worker did one job entirely.<ref>Wage Labor & Capital</ref>\n\nAmong Marx's theoretical contributions is his sharp distinction between the economic and the [[social division of labour]].<ref>Marx, K. (1977). ''[[Capital, Volume I|Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1.]]'' New York: Vintage Books, pp. 781\u201394.</ref> That is, some forms of labour co-operation are purely due to \"technical necessity\", but others are a result of a \"social control\" function related to a class and status hierarchy. If these two divisions are conflated, it might appear as though the existing division of labour is technically inevitable and immutable, rather than (in good part) socially constructed and influenced by [[Power (sociology)|power]] relationships. He also argues that in a [[communism|communist]] society, the division of labour is transcended, meaning that balanced human development occurs where people fully express their nature in the variety of creative work that they do.<ref>Ali Rattansi: Marx and the Division of Labor (Macmillan, 1982)</ref>\n\n=== Henry David Thoreau ===\n[[Henry David Thoreau]] criticized the division of labour in ''[[Walden]]'' (published in 1854), on the basis that it removes people from a sense of connectedness with society and with the world at large, including nature. He claimed that the average man in a civilized society is less wealthy, in practice than one in \"savage\" society. The answer he gave was that [[self-sufficiency]] was enough to cover one's basic needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThoreau's friend and mentor, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], criticized the division of labour in \"The American Scholar\"; a widely informed, holistic citizenry is vital for the spiritual and physical health of the country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scientific management : a management idea to reach a mass audience|last=Khurana, A.|date=2009|publisher=Global India Pub|isbn=978-93-80228-01-3|location=New Delhi|pages=|oclc=495418951}}</ref>\n\n=== \u00c9mile Durkheim ===\nIn his seminal work, ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]'', [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]<ref>A founding father of sociology, Emile Durkheim, best known for his 1893 seminal work, ''De La Division Du Travail Social'' (''The Division of Labor in Society''), \"dedicated himself to the establishment of sociology as a legitimate and respected science and as an instrument of rational social action.\" {{cite journal | last1 = Alpert | first1 = Harry | year = 1959 | title = Emile Durkheim: A Perspective and Appreciation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 462\u201365 | doi=10.2307/2089532| jstor = 2089532 }}</ref> observes that the division of labour appears in all societies and positively correlates with societal advancement because it increases as a society progresses. Durkheim arrived at the same conclusion regarding the positive effects of the division of labour as his theoretical predecessor, [[Adam Smith]].  In ''The Wealth of the Nations'', Smith observes the division of labour results in \"a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour.\"<ref>Smith, Adam. ''The Wealth of Nations''.  Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1970.</ref>  While they shared this belief, Durkheim believed the division of labour applied to all \"biological organisms generally\" while Smith believed this law applied \"only to human societies.\"<ref name=\"JonesRobert\">Jones, Robert. ''Emile Durkheim: An Introduction to Four Major Works.'' Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications, Inc., 1986. Print.</ref>  This difference may result from the influence of [[Charles Darwin]]\u2019s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' on Durkheim\u2019s writings.<ref name=\"JonesRobert\" />  For example, Durkheim observed an apparent relationship between \"the functional specialization of the parts of an organism\" and \"the extent of that organism's evolutionary development,\" which he believed \"extended the scope of the division of labour so as to make its origins contemporaneous with the origins of life itself\u2026implying that its conditions must be found in the essential properties of all organized matter.\"<ref name=\"JonesRobert\" />\n\nSince Durkheim\u2019s division of labour applied to all organisms, he considered it a \"[[natural law]]\"<ref name=\"JonesRobert\" /> and worked to determine whether it should be embraced or resisted by first analyzing its functions.  Durkheim hypothesized that the division of labour fosters [[social solidarity]], yielding \"a wholly moral phenomenon\" that ensures \"mutual relationships\" among individuals.<ref name=\"Durkheim Emile\">Durkheim, Emile. ''The Division of Labor in Society.''  New York: The Free Press, 1997.

''Sociology 138: Theory and Society.'' Department of Sociology, Duke University, n.d. Web. 16 November 2012.</ref>  He explains that in societies with more mechanical solidarity, the diversity and division of labour is much less, so individuals have a similar worldview.<ref name=\"Merton Robert\">{{cite journal | last1 = Merton | first1 = Robert K | year = 1994 | title = Durkheim's Division of Labor in Society | url = | journal = Sociological Forum | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 17\u201325 | doi=10.1007/bf01507702}}</ref>  Similarly, Durkheim opines that in societies with more organic solidarity, the diversity of occupations is greater, and individuals depend on each other more, resulting in greater benefits to society as a whole.<ref name=\"Merton Robert\" />\n\nDurkheim\u2019s work enabled [[social science]] to progress more efficiently \"in \u2026 the understanding of human social behavior.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alpert | first1 = Harry | year = 1959 | title = Emile Durkheim: A Perspective and Appreciation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 462\u201365 | doi=10.2307/2089532| jstor = 2089532 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ludwig von Mises ===\nMarx's theories, including the negative claims regarding the division of labour have been criticized by the [[Austrian economists]] such as [[Ludwig von Mises]].\n\nThe main argument here is the economic gains accruing from the division of labour far outweigh the costs. It is argued that it is fully possible to achieve balanced human development within capitalism, and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] is downplayed as mere romantic fiction.\n\n=== Friedrich A. Hayek ===\nIn ''[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]'', [[Friedrich A. Hayek]] states:\n\n{{quote|The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it, not only a division of labour but also a coordinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labour on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the \"state\" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type.<ref>Editor/Trans.

American Economic Association Author Hayek, Friedrich A.</ref>}}\n\n== Globalization and global division of labour ==\nThe issue reaches its broadest scope in the controversies about [[globalization]], which is often interpreted as a euphemism for the expansion of world trade based on [[comparative advantage]].\nThis would mean that countries specialize in the work they can do at the lowest relative cost measured in terms of the [[opportunity cost]] of not using resources for other work, compared to the opportunity costs experienced countries. Critics, however, allege that international specialization cannot be explained sufficiently in terms of \"the work nations do best\", rather this specialization is guided more by [[commerce|commercial]] criteria, which favour some countries over others.\n\nThe [[OECD]] recently advised (28 June 2005) that:\n\n{{quote|Efficient policies to encourage employment and combat unemployment are essential if countries are to reap the full benefits of globalization and avoid a backlash against open trade... Job losses in some sectors, along with new job opportunities in other sectors, are an inevitable accompaniment of the process of globalization... The challenge is to ensure that the adjustment process involved in matching available workers with new job openings works as smoothly as possible.}}\n\nFew studies have taken place regarding the global division of labour.  Information can be drawn from [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] and national statistical offices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn one study, [[Deon Filmer]] estimated that 2.474 billion people participated in the global non-domestic labour force in the mid-1990s. Of these,\n\n* around 15%, or 379 million people, worked in the industry,\n* a third, or 800 million worked in services, and\n* over 40%, or 1,074 million, in agriculture.\n\nThe majority of workers in industry and services were wage and salary earners \u2013 58 percent of the industrial workforce and 65 percent of the services workforce. But a big portion was self-employed or involved in family labour. Filmer suggests the total of employees worldwide in the 1990s was about 880 million, compared with around a billion working on own account on the land (mainly peasants), and some 480 million working on own account in industry and services. The 2007 ILO Global Employment Trends Report indicated that services have surpassed agriculture for the first time in human history: \"In 2006 the service sector\u2019s share of global employment overtook agriculture for the first time, increasing from 39.5 percent to 40 percent. Agriculture decreased from 39.7 percent to 38.7 percent. The industry sector accounted for 21.3 percent of total employment.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=ILO releases Global Employment Trends 2007|publisher=ILO News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006103439/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/public/releases/yr2007/pr07_02sa.htm|archivedate=6 October 2008 |location=BANGKOK|date=25 January 2007|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/public/releases/yr2007/pr07_02sa.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Modern debates ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\n{{tone|section|date=January 2020}}\nIn the modern world, those specialists most preoccupied in their work with theorizing about the division of labour are those involved in [[management]] and [[organization]]. In view of the global extremities of the division of labour, the question is often raised about what division of labour would be most ideal, beautiful, efficient and just.\n\nTwo styles of management that are seen in modern organizations are control and commitment, the control being the division of labour style of the past and commitment being the style of the future. Control management is based on the principles of job specialization and the division of labour. This is the [[assembly line]] style of job specialization where employees are given a very narrow set of tasks or one specific task. Commitment division of labour is oriented on including the employee and building a level of internal commitment towards accomplishing tasks. Tasks include more responsibility and are coordinated based on expertise rather than formal position.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">McAlister-Kizzier, Donna. \"Division of Labor.\"  Encyclopedia of Business and Finance, 2nd ed.. 2007. Encyclopedia.com. 1 Dec. 2014 http://www.encyclopedia.com</ref>\n\nJob specialization is advantageous in developing employee expertise in a field and boosting organizational production. However, disadvantages of job specialization included limited employee skill, a dependence on entire department fluency, and employee discontent with repetitious tasks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIt is widely accepted that the division of labour is to a great extent inevitable, simply because no one can do all tasks at once. Labour hierarchy is a very common feature of the modern workplace structure, but of course, the way these hierarchies are structured can be influenced by a variety of different factors.\n\nSize, cost, and the development of new technology are factors that have influenced job specialization structures in the modern workplace. The cost of job specialization is what limits small organizations from dividing their labour responsibilities, but as organizations increase in size there is a correlation in the rise of the division of labour. Technological developments have led to a decrease in the amount of job specialization in organizations as new technology makes it easier for fewer employees to accomplish a variety of tasks and still enhance production. New technology has also been supportive in the flow of information between departments helping to reduce the feeling of department isolation.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\" />\n\nIt is often agreed{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) competency or ability. This important concept of [[meritocracy]] could be read as an [[explanation]] or as a justification of why a division of labour is the way it is.\n\nIn general, in capitalist economies, such things are not decided consciously.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Different people try different things, and that which is most effective cost-wise (produces the most and best output with the least input) will generally be adopted.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Often techniques that work in one place or time do not work as well in another.  This does not present a problem,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} as the only requirement of a capitalist system is that you turn a profit.\n\n==Limitations==\n\n[[Adam Smith]] famously said in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market. This is because it is by the exchange that each person can be specialized in their work and yet still have access to a wide range of goods and services. Hence, reductions in barriers to exchange lead to increases in the division of labour and so help to drive economic growth. Limitations to the division of labour have also been related to coordination and transportation costs.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.1956.tb02717.x | volume=9 | issue=2 | year=1956 | journal=Kyklos | pages=181\u2013189 | last1 = Houthakker | first1 = H. S.| title=Economics and Biology: Specialization and Speciation }}</ref>\n\nThere can be motivational advantages to a reduced division of labour (which has been termed \u2018[[job enlargement]]\u2019 and '[[job enrichment]]').<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/096317901167460 | volume=74 | issue=4 | title=Future work design research and practice: Towards an elaborated model of work design | year=2001 | journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | pages=413\u2013440 | last1 = Parker | first1 = Sharon K. | last2 = Wall | first2 = Toby D. | last3 = Cordery | first3 = John L.| url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d6a3/f011a4dd846c8bfb99b8f7bd87f870c18a57.pdf }}</ref> Jobs that are too specialized in a narrow range of tasks are said to result in demotivation due to boredom and alienation. Hence, a [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] approach to work design contributed to worsened industrial relations.\n\nThere are also limitations to the division of labour (and the division of work) that result from work-flow variations and uncertainties.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1628/093245613X13620416111326 | volume=169 | issue=2 | title=The Division of Labour under Uncertainty | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics | pages=253\u2013274 | last1 = Wadeson | first1 = Nigel| url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/28821/6/divOfLAB.pdf }}</ref><ref>[http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12274210], Barrera, Catherine Grace (2014). Skill, Job Design, and the Labor Market under Uncertainty. ''Doctoral dissertation, Harvard University''</ref> These help to explain issues in modern work organization, such as task consolidations in [[business process reengineering]] and the use of multi-skilled work teams. For instance, one stage of a production process may temporarily work at a slower pace, forcing other stages to slow down. One answer to this is to make some portion of resources mobile between stages so that those resources must be capable of undertaking a wider range of tasks. Another is to consolidate tasks so that they are undertaken one after another by the same workers and other resources. Stocks between stages can also help to reduce the problem to some extent but are costly and can hamper quality control. Modern [[flexible manufacturing system]]s require both flexible machines and flexible workers.\n\nIn project-based work, the coordination of resources is a difficult issue for the [[project manager]] as project [[Schedule (project management)|schedules]] and resulting resource bookings are based on [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of task durations and so are subject to subsequent revisions. Again, consolidating tasks so that they are undertaken consecutively by the same resources and having resources available that can be called on at short-notice from other tasks can help to reduce such problems, though at the cost of reduced specialization.\n\nThere are also advantages in a reduced division of labour where knowledge would otherwise have to be transferred between stages.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2003.07.015 | volume=161 | issue=3 | title=Activity consolidation to improve responsiveness | year=2005 | journal=European Journal of Operational Research | pages=683\u2013703 | last1 = Rummel | first1 = Jeffrey L. | last2 = Walter | first2 = Zhiping | last3 = Dewan | first3 = Rajiv | last4 = Seidman | first4 = Abraham}}</ref> For example, having a single person deal with a customer query means that only that one person has to be familiarised with the customer\u2019s details. It is also likely to result in the query being handled faster due to the elimination of delays in passing the query between different people.\n\n== Gendered division of labour ==\n{{Main|Gender role|Women's work|Sexual division of labour|Occupational segregation}}\nThe clearest exposition of the principles of sexual division of labour across the full range of human societies can be summarized by a large number of logically complementary implicational constraints of the following form: if women of childbearing ages in a given community tend to do X (e.g., preparing soil for [[planting]]) they will also do Y (e.g., the planting) while for men the logical reversal in this example would be that if men plant they will prepare the soil. \"Entailment Theory and Method: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Sexual Division of Labor\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pub/Entail77.pdf |title=eclectic.ss.uci.edu |access-date=13 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517143452/http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pub/Entail77.pdf |archive-date=17 May 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> by White, Brudner and Burton (1977, public domain), using statistical [[entailment]] analysis, shows that tasks more frequently chosen by women in these order relations are those more convenient in relation to [[childrearing]]. This type of finding has been replicated in a variety of studies, including modern industrial economies. These entailments do not restrict how much work for any given task could be done by men (e.g., in [[cooking]]) or by women (e.g., in clearing forests) but are only least-effort or role-consistent tendencies. To the extent that women clear forests for agriculture, for example, they tend to do the entire agricultural sequence of tasks on those clearings. In theory, these types of constraints could be removed by provisions of child care, but [[ethnographic]] examples are lacking.\n\n== Industrial organizational psychology ==\nJob satisfaction has been shown to improve as an employee is given the task of a specific job. Students who have received PhDs in a chosen field later report increased satisfaction compared to their previous jobs. This can be attributed to their high levels of specialization.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Goldberg | first2 = L.

Division of labour, instead, refers to the allocation of tasks to individuals or organizations according to the skills and/or equipment those people or organizations possess. Often division of labour and division of work are both part of the economic activity within an industrial nation or organization.\n\n== Disaggregated work ==\nJob divided into elemental parts is sometimes called [[disaggregated work]]. The workers specializing in particular parts of the job are called specialists or [[professional]]s. The workers doing a portion of a non-recurring work may be called contractors, [[freelancer]]s or temporary workers. Modern communication technologies, in particular the internet, gave rise to [[sharing economy]] which is orchestrated by [[online marketplace]]s of various kinds of disaggregated work.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Complex society]]\n* [[Economic sector]]\n* [[Family economy]]\n* [[Fordism]]\n* [[New international division of labour]]\n* [[Productive and unproductive labour]]\n* [[Price system]]\n* [[Surplus product]]\n* [[Time use survey]]\n* [[Urbanization]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Gary S.

[[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]].\n\nHe had a short playing career, spent mostly as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] in non-league football. He played for a wide variety of clubs, including: [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], Barnet, [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]], [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]], [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough Town]], [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]], [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]], [[Aylesbury United F.C.|Aylesbury United]], [[Harrow Borough F.C.|Harrow Borough]], [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]], [[Molesey F.C.|Molesey]] and [[Walton & Hersham F.C.|Walton & Hersham]]. He started his managerial career at the age of 28, managing Kingstonian for five months, before spending a year in charge of Enfield. In 1999, Westley became manager of [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough Town]], guiding them to the [[Football Conference]] in 2002. He left Farnborough the following season, to become manager of [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]. He took the club to within one game of promotion to [[English Football League|the Football League]], but left the club in 2006 when his contract expired. Westley then had a brief, but successful, spell with [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]], as well as acting as [[caretaker manager]] at [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]].\n\nHe took a year out of the game, before rejoining Stevenage in May 2008. He guided the club to [[FA Trophy]] success in [[2009 FA Trophy Final|2009]], before securing promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history in April 2010, finishing the season as league champions. Westley guided the club to back-to-back promotions in his first season as a Football League manager, following Stevenage's successful [[2011 Football League Two play-off Final|2010\u201311 League Two play-off campaign]]. At the start of 2012, Westley left Stevenage to join [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. He was sacked by the club in February 2013. A month later, Westley rejoined Stevenage, his third spell at the club. He managed the club for another two years, before leaving again in May 2015. He took charge at [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] four months later, before being sacked shortly before the end of the [[2015\u201316 in English football|2015\u201316 season]]. He was appointed manager at [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in October 2016, with the club lying bottom of the [[English Football League|Football League]], and was sacked five months later after failing to turn around the club's poor form. He was appointed as head coach of Barnet in January 2018 before managing Stevenage for a fourth time for two months from December 2019.\n\n==Playing career==\nWestley was born in [[Hounslow]], [[London]] and he started his [[association football|footballing]] career as an apprentice with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].

[[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]].\n\nHe had a short playing career, spent mostly as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] in non-league football. He played for a wide variety of clubs, including: [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], Barnet, [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]], [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]], [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough Town]], [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]], [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]], [[Aylesbury United F.C.|Aylesbury United]], [[Harrow Borough F.C.|Harrow Borough]], [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting & Mitcham United]], [[Molesey F.C.|Molesey]] and [[Walton & Hersham F.C.|Walton & Hersham]]. He started his managerial career at the age of 28, managing Kingstonian for five months, before spending a year in charge of Enfield. In 1999, Westley became manager of [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough Town]], guiding them to the [[Football Conference]] in 2002. He left Farnborough the following season, to become manager of [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]. He took the club to within one game of promotion to [[English Football League|the Football League]], but left the club in 2006 when his contract expired. Westley then had a brief, but successful, spell with [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]], as well as acting as [[caretaker manager]] at [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]].\n\nHe took a year out of the game, before rejoining Stevenage in May 2008. He guided the club to [[FA Trophy]] success in [[2009 FA Trophy Final|2009]], before securing promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history in April 2010, finishing the season as league champions. Westley guided the club to back-to-back promotions in his first season as a Football League manager, following Stevenage's successful [[2011 Football League Two play-off Final|2010\u201311 League Two play-off campaign]]. At the start of 2012, Westley left Stevenage to join [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. He was sacked by the club in February 2013. A month later, Westley rejoined Stevenage, his third spell at the club. He managed the club for another two years, before leaving again in May 2015. He took charge at [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] four months later, before being sacked shortly before the end of the [[2015\u201316 in English football|2015\u201316 season]]. He was appointed manager at [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in October 2016, with the club lying bottom of the [[English Football League|Football League]], and was sacked five months later after failing to turn around the club's poor form. He was appointed as head coach of Barnet in January 2018 before managing Stevenage for a fourth time for two months from December 2019.\n\n==Playing career==\nWestley was born in [[Hounslow]], [[London]] and he started his [[association football|footballing]] career as an apprentice with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. During his time at QPR, Westley represented [[England national football team|England]] at [[England national under-18 football team|U18]] level.
