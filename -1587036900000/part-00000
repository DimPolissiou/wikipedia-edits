The child died as a result from the injury, with Chen claiming that it was an accident.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U3NT1sAlaM 2012.12.16  Court No. 52/ Six-man murder and insurance case]</ref>\n\nIn 1995, facing another financial crisis, Ruiqin targeted his own 15-year-old son.

Under the pretense of going on a trip, the two drove to [[Xingang, Chiayi|Xingang]]. Suddenly, Chen stopped the car, pulled out a wooden stick from under the driver's seat and beat his wife to death. After the murder, Ruiqin dumped her body on Shixian Road in [[Chiayi]], creating the illusion of a car accident. Since he had blood on his clothes, Ruiqin was reluctant about catching a taxi back home. In this case, not only did he obtain Wang's insurance claims of $11.37 million NT, but also continued to receive her pension.<ref>[https://news.tvbs.com.tw/other/412540 Chen Ruiqun frankly admits to killing his second wife during trial]</ref>\n\nChen's late wife often visited a clothing store owned by a woman named Yan Liqin, a widow with two children. After more than a month from his wife's death, Chen took the initiative to \"entangle\" himself around the clothing store. After strenuous pursuit, Liqin was moved, and they married in 1997. Ruiqin's vicious behavior was unchanged, however, as he tried to fraudulently clear his debts the following year. Yan's 16-year-old son was having a headache, so Ruiqin fed him sleeping pills, claiming that they were painkillers. While the son was sleeping, Ruiqin transported him to the stairs, where he dropped him on his head, creating the illusion of an accidental death. He applied for an insurance claim of $15.5 million NT, but the insurance company, which had noticed that multiple relatives had died of suspicious injuries relating to head trauma, paid only $250,000. Since Yan also believed that her son had been murdered, she continued to investigate for possible evidence to prove it. Perplexingly, Ruiqin tried to deceive his wife by putting on a condom on the boy's genitalia and explaining that he had died while having sex. Liqin remained with him for a while, but as they relationship worsened, she divorced him. During the divorce, she was intimidated by Chen to pay a $1.2 million NT \"breakup fee\", but was otherwise left unharmed.<ref name=\"\u6bd2\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Chen Ruiqin's ex-wife: He is horny and dangerous|url=https://tw.appledaily.com/headline/daily/20030526/64889/|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ6pyUCNMNw 2012.12.16 Cour No. 52/ Chen Ruiqin murdered six relatives for fraud]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, many insurance companies discovered that the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Chen's relatives, especially his three sons, whom all received \"head injuries\" and died from [[cerebral edema]], were suspicious, as all of them had been insured for millions of NT. After holding discussions with representatives of various companies, they unanimously agreed to prevent Chen Ruiqin from insuring people and reported this to the police. The then-legislator, [[Chen Chao-jung (politician)|Chen Chao-jung]], was informed of this ordeal, and soon held a press conference expressing his doubts about the suspect. Chao-jung himself would later personally go and interrogate Ruiqin, who, out of fear, hid under the table and refused to come out. The next day, he angrily announced before the media that he would \"retain the right to pursue the lawsuit against the false accusations of legislators.\"<ref name=\"\u6bd2\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, Chen Ruiqin met Chen Yiling, a female insurance saleswoman, with whom he started a romantic relationship. He noticed that she had considerable savings, and asked his new girlfriend to borrow some money for his mortgage, to which she replied that she would consider it. Although the pair only knew each other for two days, Chen planned to kill her directly and then rob her. He invited Yiling by telephone to the Wu Xian Emperor's Temple on Xiangrong Street, in West Chiayi. From there, he took her to [[Zhushan, Nantou|Zhushan]] in his black jeep. While there, he opened a capsule of sleeping Baogan Pills, and put sleeping powder in it. When Yiling fell asleep, Ruiqin tied her hands with nylon rope. When she awoke, Chen told her that he wanted to play, and so he beat and eventually strangled his girlfriend into unconsciousness. When he saw the unconscious Yiling, he suddenly felt aroused and attempted to have sex with her, but because of his [[sexual dysfunction]], he instead sexually assaulted her. After he finished, Ruiqin contemplated throwing Yiling off a cliff, but unbearing of the thought of not stealing something, he robbed her of her gold [[Rolex]] watch, [[jadeite]] necklace, rings, $1 million NT in cash, credit and ATM cards, mobile phones and two blank checks. He then hit Yiling with a stone and beat her to death, throwing her body off the mountain cliff. After disposing of the corpse he went to Taipei with his other casial girlfriend, Xiao. On the way, he gave her the Rolex. He also held onto the deceased Chen's bank cards, but couldn't take the money because he didn't know the password. The attempted theft was detected by the authorities, and Ruiqin was arrested.<ref>[http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/3/7/18/n344561.htm The murderer Chen Ruiqin was asking to be executed]</ref>\n\nFollowing his arrest, Chen confessed to the police about killing his two wives and three sons, but claimed that he had nothing to do with the disappearances of his two female friends. After his death sentence was upheld, he retracted his confession and offered to help the police in locating the missing women, but his bluff was called out, as the investigators understood that he was just trying to weasel out of his execution.<ref name=\"\u4f0f\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Chen Ruiqin layed down!

At a fifth trial the Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court reduced to sentence to a 20-year-old fixed imprisonment term, because of his cooperation with punishment regulations and the application of commutation changes in law. He still remained with a death sentence for the murder of Chen Yiling, and the appeal for it was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]].

After the murder, Ruiqin dumped her body on Shixian Road in [[Chiayi]], creating the illusion of a car accident. Since he had blood on his clothes, Ruiqin was reluctant about catching a taxi back home. In this case, not only did he obtain Wang's insurance claims of $11.37 million NT, but also continued to receive her pension.<ref>[https://news.tvbs.com.tw/other/412540 Chen Ruiqun frankly admits to killing his second wife during trial]</ref>\n\nChen's late wife often visited a clothing store owned by a woman named Yan Liqin, a widow with two children. After more than a month from his wife's death, Chen took the initiative to \"entangle\" himself around the clothing store. After strenuous pursuit, Liqin was moved, and they married in 1997. Ruiqin's vicious behavior was unchanged, however, as he tried to fraudulently clear his debts the following year. Yan's 16-year-old son was having a headache, so Ruiqin fed him sleeping pills, claiming that they were painkillers. While the son was sleeping, Ruiqin transported him to the stairs, where he dropped him on his head, creating the illusion of an accidental death. He applied for an insurance claim of $15.5 million NT, but the insurance company, which had noticed that multiple relatives had died of suspicious injuries relating to head trauma, paid only $250,000. Since Yan also believed that her son had been murdered, she continued to investigate for possible evidence to prove it. Perplexingly, Ruiqin tried to deceive his wife by putting on a condom on the boy's genitalia and explaining that he had died while having sex. Liqin remained with him for a while, but as they relationship worsened, she divorced him. During the divorce, she was intimidated by Chen to pay a $1.2 million NT \"breakup fee\", but was otherwise left unharmed.<ref name=\"\u6bd2\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Chen Ruiqin's ex-wife: He is horny and dangerous|url=https://tw.appledaily.com/headline/daily/20030526/64889/|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ6pyUCNMNw 2012.12.16 Cour No. 52/ Chen Ruiqin murdered six relatives for fraud]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, many insurance companies discovered that the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Chen's relatives, especially his three sons, whom all received \"head injuries\" and died from [[cerebral edema]], were suspicious, as all of them had been insured for millions of NT. After holding discussions with representatives of various companies, they unanimously agreed to prevent Chen Ruiqin from insuring people and reported this to the police. The then-legislator, [[Chen Chao-jung (politician)|Chen Chao-jung]], was informed of this ordeal, and soon held a press conference expressing his doubts about the suspect. Chao-jung himself would later personally go and interrogate Ruiqin, who, out of fear, hid under the table and refused to come out. The next day, he angrily announced before the media that he would \"retain the right to pursue the lawsuit against the false accusations of legislators.\"<ref name=\"\u6bd2\"/>\n\nIn May 2003, Chen Ruiqin met Chen Yiling, a female insurance saleswoman, with whom he started a romantic relationship. He noticed that she had considerable savings, and asked his new girlfriend to borrow some money for his mortgage, to which she replied that she would consider it. Although the pair only knew each other for two days, Chen planned to kill her directly and then rob her. He invited Yiling by telephone to the Wu Xian Emperor's Temple on Xiangrong Street, in West Chiayi. From there, he took her to [[Zhushan, Nantou|Zhushan]] in his black jeep. While there, he opened a capsule of sleeping Baogan Pills, and put sleeping powder in it. When Yiling fell asleep, Ruiqin tied her hands with nylon rope. When she awoke, Chen told her that he wanted to play, and so he beat and eventually strangled his girlfriend into unconsciousness. When he saw the unconscious Yiling, he suddenly felt aroused and attempted to have sex with her, but because of his [[sexual dysfunction]], he instead sexually assaulted her. After he finished, Ruiqin contemplated throwing Yiling off a cliff, but unbearing of the thought of not stealing something, he robbed her of her gold [[Rolex]] watch, [[jadeite]] necklace, rings, $1 million NT in cash, credit and ATM cards, mobile phones and two blank checks. He then hit Yiling with a stone and beat her to death, throwing her body off the mountain cliff. After disposing of the corpse he went to Taipei with his other casial girlfriend, Xiao. On the way, he gave her the Rolex. He also held onto the deceased Chen's bank cards, but couldn't take the money because he didn't know the password. The attempted theft was detected by the authorities, and Ruiqin was arrested.<ref>[http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/3/7/18/n344561.htm The murderer Chen Ruiqin was asking to be executed]</ref>\n\nFollowing his arrest, Chen confessed to the police about killing his two wives and three sons, but claimed that he had nothing to do with the disappearances of his two female friends.

At a fifth trial the Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court reduced to sentence to a 20-year-old fixed imprisonment term, because of his cooperation with punishment regulations and the application of commutation changes in law. He still remained with a death sentence for the murder of Chen Yiling, and the appeal for it was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]].

She was the youngest child among the nine children of  [[Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia]] and his wife [[Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg (1865\u20131927)|Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna]], born Princess Elizabeth of Saxe-Altenburg. She was going to be named Marianne in honor of her mother's favorite sister, [[Princess Marie Anne of Saxe-Altenburg]], but her paternal aunt [[Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia]] insisted that her niece  should be named after her.<ref name = \" Vera Constantinovna\">Vera Constantinovna, ''Kadetskaya pereklichka''</ref> Her godparents were her brother [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]]. Vera Constantinovna spent her first years in fabulous splendour during the last period of Imperial Russia. Her father, a respected poet, was a second cousin of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nPrincess Vera was eight years old when [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated]] and World War I broke out, in the summer of 1914. Vera was with her parents and her brother George in Germany visiting her maternal relatives in [[Altenburg]] at the start of the war. The conflict took them by surprise, trapping them in Germany, an enemy country. It was thanks to the intervention of the German Empress, [[Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein]] that they were allowed to return to Russia.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 154\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 154</ref>  Vera\u2019s older siblings joined the Russian army in the military effort, and her favorite brother [[Prince Oleg Constantinovich of Russia|Oleg]] was killed in action. She was considered too young and was not allowed to attend her brother's funeral. Her brother\u2019s death was just the first of many family misfortunes.\n\nThe following year, her father died of a heart attack in her presence. In a letter to her brother, she later described how she was sitting with her father in his study, when Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich began gasping. Princess Vera managed to push open a heavy door between her parents' studies, pushing aside several heavy plants that stood in front of the door, and ran to her mother crying that her father couldn't breathe. Her mother ran after her, but the grand duke had already died.<ref name = \" Zeepvat, Charlotte 185\">Zeepvat, Charlotte, ''The Camera and the Tsars'', p. 185</ref>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich 1911.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Left to right back row: Princess Tatiana; Prince Gabriel; Prince Ivan; Grand Duchess Elizabeta Mavrikievna and Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich.

They stayed in the palace until the summer of 1918, when the revolution forced them to leave it and to take an apartment in the city.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nDuring the Russian revolution, four of Vera\u2019s brothers were imprisoned by the [[Bolsheviks]]. Only [[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich of Russia|Prince Gabriel]] was eventually released. Three of her brothers ([[Prince John Constantinovich of Russia|Ivan]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Constantine]] and [[Prince Igor Constantinovich of Russia|Igor]]) were killed at [[Alapaevsk]], along with other Romanov relatives, in July 1918.\n\nInitially, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna was reluctant to leave Russia remembering her late husband's words, that if Russia was in need, it was a Romanov's duty to help. However, with their situation  becoming increasingly dangerous, she accepted an offer made by her friend, [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]], through the Swedish Ambassador Edvard Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, to travel to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFrom [[Kronstadt]] twelve-year-old Princess Vera escaped to [[Sweden]] aboard the Swedish vessel ''\u00c5ngermanland'' in October 1918 with her mother, her brother George, and her young nephews (Prince Teymuraz Constantinovich and Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia) and nieces (Princess Natalia Konstantinovna Bagration-Mukhransky and Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia) when they were permitted by the [[Bolsheviks]] to be taken by ship to [[Sweden]], via [[Tallinn]] to [[Helsinki]] and via [[Mariehamn]] to [[Stockholm]], at the invitation of [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]]. At [[Stockholm]] harbor, they met Prince [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf Adolf]], who took them to the [[Stockholm Palace|royal palace]]. Later, Vsevolod and Catherine were able to reunite to their mother.\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich in exile2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On the sofa: Princess Tatiana with her children Teymuraz and Nathalie Bagration-Mukhransky and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna.

As Sweden proved too expensive to live in, Elizabeth Mavrikievna  wrote a letter to [[Albert I of Belgium]], asking him to allow them to move to his country. In 1920 they relocated to [[Brussels]] where they were frequently ill. In 1922, Vera's uncle, Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Altenburg invited them to move to Germany.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  Elizabeth Mavrikievna settled in the ancestral castle of her family near [[Leipzig]], in the small town of [[Altenburg]]. Princess Vera followed her mother half a year later after spending sometime in [[Oberstdorf]] in the [[Allg\u00e4u]] region of the [[Bavarian Alps]] recuperating from tuberculosis.\n\nHer mother died of cancer on 24 March 1927 in Leipzig. Left alone and without sufficient means of subsistence, Vera Constantinovna moved to [[Bavaria]], with friends and shortly after relocated to London with her brother George.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  When two years later, George moved to the United States, she returned to Altenburg. Princess Vera lived there for thirty years. Prince George died in New York City in 1938. Princess Vera lived in Germany through the difficult years of World War II.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 190\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 190</ref> During the War, she worked as a translator in a camp for prisoners of war. But German officials soon removed her from that position because she had tried to help fellow prisoners.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFor many years, as she later recalled, she was haunted by the events of the Revolution.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> \"I used to have the same dream, as if I stood with my back to a pit and they were going to shoot me...my awakening was not less terrible than the dream itself, because I was constantly afraid to open my eyes and see that they had really come to take me to the execution\".<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/>\n\nAt the end of World War II, in early 1945, American troops arrived in Altenburg.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> On hearing that, according to the [[Potsdam Conference]],  Altenburg  was going to be part of the zone of Soviet occupation, Princess Vera fled on foot.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  With her cousin, Prince Ernst-Friedrich Saxe-Altenburg, she had to walk 240 kilometers in 12 days, fleeing the advancing Soviet troops.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> Once safe, Princess Vera settled in [[Hamburg]] on  5 January 1946.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> Until 1949 she worked as a translator in the British branch of the [[Red Cross]] and later in the DP Medical Center.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> When this one was closed, she worked at the reception in another British institution.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> She belonged to no country, as she only had an ambiguous [[Nansen passport]], which gave her the ability to travel but no protections of statehood.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> Despite this, she refused to take the protection offered to her by various European countries, considering herself Russian.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> \" I didn't leave Russia\", she once declared, \"Russia left me\".<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Princess Vera.gif|thumb|left|150px|Princess Vera Constantinovna in the 1970s]]\nIn 1951 she moved to the United States,<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> where her main activity was to work for the [[Tolstoy Foundation]], which provided aid to Russians in need.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  For the next decades she lived in New York, and was very active in charities.

She did not have the nostalgic idyll of many \u00e9migr\u00e9s, but rather the memories of her childhood and her lost family.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 191\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 191</ref> The constant stream of visitors she regarded with some amusement and found rather trying. She did not care for those who would speak in awe-struck tones of the late Imperial family; she would often relate stories of their humanness and misbehavior. For her, the children of the last Tsar remained her childhood playmates, not distant figures for adoration.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 191\"/>  She also regarded the canonization of the Romanovs, including her brothers and uncle, as a puzzling, peculiar move by the Church. Princess Vera wrote four short articles about her life for a magazine ''\"Kadetskaya pereklichka\"'' published by Union of the Russian Kadets in New York in 1972.\n\nPrincess Vera retained a certain aura of living history, being the last surviving member of the Romanov family who could remember Imperial Russia.<ref>{{cite web| author=Paul Theroff| year=2007| title=Russia| work=An Online Gotha| url=http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/russia.html| accessdate=4 March 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231104445/http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/russia.html| archivedate=31 December 2006| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Her two brothers and sister who managed to escape Russia all predeceased her.

She died in [[Jerusalem]] in 1979.\n\nPrincess Vera died at the [[Tolstoy Foundation]]'s [[elderly care]] home in  [[Valley Cottage, New York]], on 11 January 2001, at the age of 95.  She was buried next to her brother [[Prince Georgy Konstantinovich of Russia|Prince Georgy Konstantinovich]] at the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Monastery of [[Novo-Diveevo]] in [[Nanuet]], New York. Of all the members of the Romanov family in Imperial Russia, only her niece [[Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Princess Catherine Ivanovna]] outlived her.

She was going to be named Marianne in honor of her mother's favorite sister, [[Princess Marie Anne of Saxe-Altenburg]], but her paternal aunt [[Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia]] insisted that her niece  should be named after her.<ref name = \" Vera Constantinovna\">Vera Constantinovna, ''Kadetskaya pereklichka''</ref> Her godparents were her brother [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]]. Vera Constantinovna spent her first years in fabulous splendour during the last period of Imperial Russia. Her father, a respected poet, was a second cousin of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nPrincess Vera was eight years old when [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated]] and World War I broke out, in the summer of 1914. Vera was with her parents and her brother George in Germany visiting her maternal relatives in [[Altenburg]] at the start of the war. The conflict took them by surprise, trapping them in Germany, an enemy country. It was thanks to the intervention of the German Empress, [[Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein]] that they were allowed to return to Russia.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 154\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 154</ref>  Vera\u2019s older siblings joined the Russian army in the military effort, and her favorite brother [[Prince Oleg Constantinovich of Russia|Oleg]] was killed in action. She was considered too young and was not allowed to attend her brother's funeral. Her brother\u2019s death was just the first of many family misfortunes.\n\nThe following year, her father died of a heart attack in her presence. In a letter to her brother, she later described how she was sitting with her father in his study, when Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich began gasping. Princess Vera managed to push open a heavy door between her parents' studies, pushing aside several heavy plants that stood in front of the door, and ran to her mother crying that her father couldn't breathe. Her mother ran after her, but the grand duke had already died.<ref name = \" Zeepvat, Charlotte 185\">Zeepvat, Charlotte, ''The Camera and the Tsars'', p. 185</ref>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich 1911.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Left to right back row: Princess Tatiana; Prince Gabriel; Prince Ivan; Grand Duchess Elizabeta Mavrikievna and Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich.

They stayed in the palace until the summer of 1918, when the revolution forced them to leave it and to take an apartment in the city.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nDuring the Russian revolution, four of Vera\u2019s brothers were imprisoned by the [[Bolsheviks]]. Only [[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich of Russia|Prince Gabriel]] was eventually released. Three of her brothers ([[Prince John Constantinovich of Russia|Ivan]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Constantine]] and [[Prince Igor Constantinovich of Russia|Igor]]) were killed at [[Alapaevsk]], along with other Romanov relatives, in July 1918.\n\nInitially, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna was reluctant to leave Russia remembering her late husband's words, that if Russia was in need, it was a Romanov's duty to help. However, with their situation  becoming increasingly dangerous, she accepted an offer made by her friend, [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]], through the Swedish Ambassador Edvard Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, to travel to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFrom [[Kronstadt]] twelve-year-old Princess Vera escaped to [[Sweden]] aboard the Swedish vessel ''\u00c5ngermanland'' in October 1918 with her mother, her brother George, and her young nephews (Prince Teymuraz Constantinovich and Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia) and nieces (Princess Natalia Konstantinovna Bagration-Mukhransky and Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia) when they were permitted by the [[Bolsheviks]] to be taken by ship to [[Sweden]], via [[Tallinn]] to [[Helsinki]] and via [[Mariehamn]] to [[Stockholm]], at the invitation of [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]]. At [[Stockholm]] harbor, they met Prince [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf Adolf]], who took them to the [[Stockholm Palace|royal palace]]. Later, Vsevolod and Catherine were able to reunite to their mother.\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich in exile2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On the sofa: Princess Tatiana with her children Teymuraz and Nathalie Bagration-Mukhransky and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna.

Brussels, 1921.]]\nPrincess Vera lived with her mother and her brother George for the next two years in [[Sweden]], first in [[Stockholm]] and then in [[Saltsj\u00f6baden]].  As Sweden proved too expensive to live in, Elizabeth Mavrikievna  wrote a letter to [[Albert I of Belgium]], asking him to allow them to move to his country. In 1920 they relocated to [[Brussels]] where they were frequently ill. In 1922, Vera's uncle, Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Altenburg invited them to move to Germany.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  Elizabeth Mavrikievna settled in the ancestral castle of her family near [[Leipzig]], in the small town of [[Altenburg]]. Princess Vera followed her mother half a year later after spending sometime in [[Oberstdorf]] in the [[Allg\u00e4u]] region of the [[Bavarian Alps]] recuperating from tuberculosis.\n\nHer mother died of cancer on 24 March 1927 in Leipzig. Left alone and without sufficient means of subsistence, Vera Constantinovna moved to [[Bavaria]], with friends and shortly after relocated to London with her brother George.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  When two years later, George moved to the United States, she returned to Altenburg. Princess Vera lived there for thirty years. Prince George died in New York City in 1938. Princess Vera lived in Germany through the difficult years of World War II.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 190\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 190</ref> During the War, she worked as a translator in a camp for prisoners of war. But German officials soon removed her from that position because she had tried to help fellow prisoners.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFor many years, as she later recalled, she was haunted by the events of the Revolution.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> \"I used to have the same dream, as if I stood with my back to a pit and they were going to shoot me...my awakening was not less terrible than the dream itself, because I was constantly afraid to open my eyes and see that they had really come to take me to the execution\".<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/>\n\nAt the end of World War II, in early 1945, American troops arrived in Altenburg.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> On hearing that, according to the [[Potsdam Conference]],  Altenburg  was going to be part of the zone of Soviet occupation, Princess Vera fled on foot.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  With her cousin, Prince Ernst-Friedrich Saxe-Altenburg, she had to walk 240 kilometers in 12 days, fleeing the advancing Soviet troops.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> Once safe, Princess Vera settled in [[Hamburg]] on  5 January 1946.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> Until 1949 she worked as a translator in the British branch of the [[Red Cross]] and later in the DP Medical Center.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> When this one was closed, she worked at the reception in another British institution.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> She belonged to no country, as she only had an ambiguous [[Nansen passport]], which gave her the ability to travel but no protections of statehood.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> Despite this, she refused to take the protection offered to her by various European countries, considering herself Russian.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> \" I didn't leave Russia\", she once declared, \"Russia left me\".<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Princess Vera.gif|thumb|left|150px|Princess Vera Constantinovna in the 1970s]]\nIn 1951 she moved to the United States,<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> where her main activity was to work for the [[Tolstoy Foundation]], which provided aid to Russians in need.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  For the next decades she lived in New York, and was very active in charities.

For her, the children of the last Tsar remained her childhood playmates, not distant figures for adoration.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 191\"/>  She also regarded the canonization of the Romanovs, including her brothers and uncle, as a puzzling, peculiar move by the Church. Princess Vera wrote four short articles about her life for a magazine ''\"Kadetskaya pereklichka\"'' published by Union of the Russian Kadets in New York in 1972.\n\nPrincess Vera retained a certain aura of living history, being the last surviving member of the Romanov family who could remember Imperial Russia.<ref>{{cite web| author=Paul Theroff| year=2007| title=Russia| work=An Online Gotha| url=http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/russia.html| accessdate=4 March 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231104445/http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/russia.html| archivedate=31 December 2006| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Her two brothers and sister who managed to escape Russia all predeceased her.

{"title_page": "Airline reservations system", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}\n'''Airline reservation systems''' ('''ARS''') are part of the so-called [[passenger service system]]s (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.\n\nARS eventually evolved into the [[computer reservations system]] (CRS). A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a [[global distribution system]] (GDS) which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.\n\n== Overview ==\nAirline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, [[fare basis code|fare tariffs]], passenger reservations and ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works within their own reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications to make their own reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems, and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA's high level network (HLN). These messaging types are called Type A [usually EDIFACT format] for real time interactive communication and Type B [TTY] for informational and booking type of messages. Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.\n\nPrior to deregulation, airlines owned their own reservation systems with travel agents subscribing to them. Today, the GDS are run by independent companies with airlines and travel agencies being major subscribers.\n\nAs of February 2009, there are only four major GDS providers in the market: [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]], [[Travelport]] (which operates the Apollo, [[Worldspan]] and [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] systems), [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] and Shares. There is one major Regional GDS, Abacus, serving the Asian market and a number of regional players serving single countries, including Travelsky (China), [[Infini (CRS)|Infini]] and [[Axess (CRS)|Axess]] (both Japan) and Topas (South Korea).  Of these, Infini is hosted within the Sabre complex, Axess is in the process of moving into a partition within the Worldspan complex, and Topas agencies will be migrating into Amadeus.\n\nReservation systems may host \"ticket-less\" airlines and \"hybrid\" airlines that use [[e-ticket]]ing in addition to ticket-less to accommodate code-shares and [[interline travel|interlines]]. \n\nIn addition to these \"standardized\" GDS, some airlines have proprietary versions which they use to run their flight operations. A few examples are Delta's OSS and Deltamatic systems and EDS SHARES.  SITA Reservations remains the largest neutral multi-host airline reservations system, with over 100 airlines currently managing inventory.\n\n== Inventory management ==\nIn the airline industry, available seats are commonly referred to as inventory. The inventory of an airline is generally classified into service classes (e.g. first, business or economy class) and up to 26 [[booking class]]es, for which different prices and booking conditions apply. Inventory data is imported and maintained through a schedule distribution system over standardized interfaces. One of the core functions of inventory management is inventory control. Inventory control steers how many seats are available in the different booking classes, by opening and closing individual booking classes for sale. In combination with the fares and booking conditions stored in the Fare Quote System, the price for each sold seat is determined. In most cases, inventory control has a real time interface to an airline\u2019s [[Yield management]] system to support a permanent optimization of the offered booking classes in response to changes in demand or pricing strategies of a competitor.\n\n== Availability display and reservation (PNR) ==\nUsers access an airline\u2019s inventory through an availability display. It contains all offered flights for a particular city-pair with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending on the type of co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called [[passenger name record]] (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or special services requests (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveler systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.\n\n== Fare quote and ticketing ==\n[[File:Airline Fare Chart.png|thumb|alt=Table of Airline Fares|List of fares for travel on [[Delta Air Lines]] from San Francisco, CA to Boston, MA.  Applicable booking classes, as well as specific restrictions such as minimum stay and advance purchase can be seen.]]\nThe Fares data store contains fare tariffs, rule sets, routing maps, class of service tables, and some tax information that construct the price&nbsp;\u2013 \"the fare\". Rules like booking conditions (e.g. minimum stay, advance purchase, etc.) are tailored differently between different city pairs or zones, and assigned a class of service corresponding to its appropriate inventory bucket. Inventory control can also be manipulated manually through the availability feeds, dynamically controlling how many seats are offered for a particular price by opening and closing particular classes.\n\nThe compiled set of fare conditions is called a [[fare basis code]]. There are two systems set up for the interchange of fares data&nbsp;\u2014 [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company|ATPCO]] and SITA, plus some system to system direct connects. This system distributes the fare tariffs and rule sets to all GDSs and other subscribers. Every airline employs staff who code air fare rules in accordance with yield management intent. There are also revenue managers who watch fares as they are filed into the public tariffs and make competitive recommendations. Inventory control is typically manipulated from here, using availability feeds to open and close classes of service.\n\nThe role of the ticketing complex is to issue and store electronic ticket records and the very small number of paper tickets that are still issued. Miscellaneous charges order (MCO) is still a paper document; IATA has working groups defining the replacement document the electronic multipurpose document (EMD) as at 2010. The electronic ticket information is stored in a database containing the data that historically was printed on a paper ticket including items such as the ticket number, the fare and tax components of the ticket price or exchange rate information. In the past, airlines issued paper tickets; since 2008, IATA has been supporting a resolution to move to 100% electronic ticketing. So far, the industry has not been able to comply due to various technological and international limitations. The industry is at 98% electronic ticket issuance today, although electronic processing for MCOs was not available in time for the IATA mandate.\n\n== Notable systems ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

In the late 1950s, [[American Airlines]] wanted a system that would allow real-time access to flight details in all of its offices, and the integration and automation of its booking and ticketing processes. It introduced an electronic reservations system, [[Reservisor|Magnetronic Reservisor]], in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetronic Reservisor|url=http://airchive.com/html/museums/american-airlines-cr-smith-museum-ft-worth-texas/1950s-magentronic-reservisor-reservations-machine/845|publisher=American Airlines C.R. Smith Museum|accessdate=3 August 2014|quote=The Magnetronic Reservisor, introduced in 1952, was the first electronic reservations system in the airline industry}}</ref> In 1964, it developed the [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] (Semi-Automated Business Research Environment). Sabre's breakthrough was its ability to keep inventory correct in real time, accessible to [[travel agent|agents]] around the world.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.flattickets.com/flights/cheap-flights-domestic-india.html/ | title = Cheap Airline Reservations | work = Cheap Airline Reservations  | accessdate = Apr 16, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[deregulation]] of the airline industry, in the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], meant that airlines, which had previously operated under government-set fares ensuring airlines at least broke even, now needed to improve efficiency to compete in a [[free market]].

A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a [[global distribution system]] (GDS) which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.\n\n== Overview ==\nAirline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, [[fare basis code|fare tariffs]], passenger reservations and ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works within their own reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications to make their own reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems, and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA's high level network (HLN). These messaging types are called Type A [usually EDIFACT format] for real time interactive communication and Type B [TTY] for informational and booking type of messages. Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.\n\nPrior to deregulation, airlines owned their own reservation systems with travel agents subscribing to them. Today, the GDS are run by independent companies with airlines and travel agencies being major subscribers.\n\nAs of February 2009, there are only four major GDS providers in the market: [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]], [[Travelport]] (which operates the Apollo, [[Worldspan]] and [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] systems), [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] and Shares. There is one major Regional GDS, Abacus, serving the Asian market and a number of regional players serving single countries, including Travelsky (China), [[Infini (CRS)|Infini]] and [[Axess (CRS)|Axess]] (both Japan) and Topas (South Korea).  Of these, Infini is hosted within the Sabre complex, Axess is in the process of moving into a partition within the Worldspan complex, and Topas agencies will be migrating into Amadeus.\n\nReservation systems may host \"ticket-less\" airlines and \"hybrid\" airlines that use [[e-ticket]]ing in addition to ticket-less to accommodate code-shares and [[interline travel|interlines]]. \n\nIn addition to these \"standardized\" GDS, some airlines have proprietary versions which they use to run their flight operations. A few examples are Delta's OSS and Deltamatic systems and EDS SHARES.  SITA Reservations remains the largest neutral multi-host airline reservations system, with over 100 airlines currently managing inventory.\n\n== Inventory management ==\nIn the airline industry, available seats are commonly referred to as inventory. The inventory of an airline is generally classified into service classes (e.g. first, business or economy class) and up to 26 [[booking class]]es, for which different prices and booking conditions apply. Inventory data is imported and maintained through a schedule distribution system over standardized interfaces. One of the core functions of inventory management is inventory control. Inventory control steers how many seats are available in the different booking classes, by opening and closing individual booking classes for sale. In combination with the fares and booking conditions stored in the Fare Quote System, the price for each sold seat is determined. In most cases, inventory control has a real time interface to an airline\u2019s [[Yield management]] system to support a permanent optimization of the offered booking classes in response to changes in demand or pricing strategies of a competitor.\n\n== Availability display and reservation (PNR) ==\nUsers access an airline\u2019s inventory through an availability display. It contains all offered flights for a particular city-pair with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending on the type of co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called [[passenger name record]] (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or special services requests (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveler systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.\n\n== Fare quote and ticketing ==\n[[File:Airline Fare Chart.png|thumb|alt=Table of Airline Fares|List of fares for travel on [[Delta Air Lines]] from San Francisco, CA to Boston, MA.  Applicable booking classes, as well as specific restrictions such as minimum stay and advance purchase can be seen.]]\nThe Fares data store contains fare tariffs, rule sets, routing maps, class of service tables, and some tax information that construct the price&nbsp;\u2013 \"the fare\". Rules like booking conditions (e.g. minimum stay, advance purchase, etc.) are tailored differently between different city pairs or zones, and assigned a class of service corresponding to its appropriate inventory bucket. Inventory control can also be manipulated manually through the availability feeds, dynamically controlling how many seats are offered for a particular price by opening and closing particular classes.\n\nThe compiled set of fare conditions is called a [[fare basis code]]. There are two systems set up for the interchange of fares data&nbsp;\u2014 [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company|ATPCO]] and SITA, plus some system to system direct connects. This system distributes the fare tariffs and rule sets to all GDSs and other subscribers. Every airline employs staff who code air fare rules in accordance with yield management intent. There are also revenue managers who watch fares as they are filed into the public tariffs and make competitive recommendations. Inventory control is typically manipulated from here, using availability feeds to open and close classes of service.\n\nThe role of the ticketing complex is to issue and store electronic ticket records and the very small number of paper tickets that are still issued. Miscellaneous charges order (MCO) is still a paper document; IATA has working groups defining the replacement document the electronic multipurpose document (EMD) as at 2010. The electronic ticket information is stored in a database containing the data that historically was printed on a paper ticket including items such as the ticket number, the fare and tax components of the ticket price or exchange rate information. In the past, airlines issued paper tickets; since 2008, IATA has been supporting a resolution to move to 100% electronic ticketing. So far, the industry has not been able to comply due to various technological and international limitations. The industry is at 98% electronic ticket issuance today, although electronic processing for MCOs was not available in time for the IATA mandate.\n\n== Notable systems ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

In the late 1950s, [[American Airlines]] wanted a system that would allow real-time access to flight details in all of its offices, and the integration and automation of its booking and ticketing processes. It introduced an electronic reservations system, [[Reservisor|Magnetronic Reservisor]], in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetronic Reservisor|url=http://airchive.com/html/museums/american-airlines-cr-smith-museum-ft-worth-texas/1950s-magentronic-reservisor-reservations-machine/845|publisher=American Airlines C.R.

In this deregulated environment, the ARS and its descendants became vital to the travel industry.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|aviation}}{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[USAS (application)]]\n* [[List of global distribution systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Winston, Clifford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jCfkJUL8oV0C&printsec=frontcover \"The Evolution of the Airline Industry\"], [[Brookings Institution Press]], 1995. {{ISBN|0-8157-5843-X}}.

The country came to a stop. Hospitals had no idea what to do and began furloughing workers left and right. Staff was not allowed to wear masks, then were allowed to wear masks, ran out of masks and began to ask communities to sew masks for their staff to wear. Everyone became alcoholics because they had to homeschool their children at home and relearn elementary math. People began protesting the social distancing and stay at home orders from the comforts of their own cars, ironically enough. Donald J. Trump refused to send stimulus checks to help the middle class until his name was stamped and printed on the checks. Facebook games, Tiger Kin, and stimulus checks became the only thing keeping America alive. Lastly, for the first time in American history all the citizens agreed on one thing, we all hate Carole Baskin. \n\n==See also==\n* [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]]\n* [[U.S. state and local government response to 2020 coronavirus pandemic]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://dpbh.nv.gov/coronavirus/ Coronavirus information] from the [[Nevada Department of Health and Human Services]]\n\n{{COVID-19}}\n{{2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{Portal bar|Medicine|United States|Viruses|Coronavirus disease 2019|Pandemic}}\n\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States by state|Nevada]]\n[[Category:2020 in Nevada|coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Disasters in Nevada]]\n[[Category:Health in Nevada]]\n[[Category:March 2020 events in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:April 2020 events in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Details of ongoing viral pandemic in Nevada, United States}}\n{{Infobox pandemic\n| name            = 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Nevada\n| width           = \n| image           = \n| image_size      = \n| image_upright   = \n| alt             = \n| caption         = \n| map1            = \n| legend1         = \n| map2            = \n| legend2         = \n| map3            = \n| legend3         = \n| map4            = \n| legend4         = \n| map5            = \n| legend5         = \n| virus_strain    = [[SARS-CoV-2]]\n| disease         = [[COVID-19]]\n| location        = [[Nevada]], U.S.\n| first_case      = [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], U.S.\n| arrival_date    = March 5, 2020 (1 month and 1 week)\n| origin          =\n| confirmed_cases = 3,211\n| suspected_cases = \n| severe_cases    = \n| recovery_cases  = \n| deaths          = 137\n| territories     = \n| total_ili       = \n| website         = {{URL|http://dpbh.nv.gov/coronavirus/}}\n}}\n\nThe '''[[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]''' was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of [[Nevada]] on March 5, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Seeman |first1=Matthew |title=First death tied to coronavirus reported in Nevada, 35 cases in Clark County |url=https://news3lv.com/news/local/first-death-tied-to-coronavirus-reported-in-clark-county-case-number-up-to-35 |website=KSNV |accessdate=March 17, 2020 |date=16 March 2020}}</ref> As of April 15, 2020, 3,211 positive cases and 137 deaths have been reported in the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Covid-19(coronavirus)|url= https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjA2ZThiOWUtM2FlNS00MGY5LWFmYjUtNmQwNTQ3Nzg5N2I2IiwidCI6ImU0YTM0MGU2LWI4OWUtNGU2OC04ZWFhLTE1NDRkMjcwMzk4MCJ9 |accessdate=April 15, 2020 |date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/United States/Nevada medical cases chart}}\nOn March 5, 2020, Nevada reported the first case of [[COVID-19]].

NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor [[Rockwell International]] studied a $200\u2013300&nbsp;million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the [[National Space Society]] stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5&nbsp;million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1985|fmt=eq}}) each to fly in space on new spacecraft.

At the end of the module, students will have gained an understanding of a new framework research tool used for designing a sustainable future in the tourism industry and also valuable space tourism knowledge. \n\n===Economic potential===\nA 2010 report from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], titled \"The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U.

Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists [[Christa McAuliffe]] as a spaceflight participant (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the [[STS-51-L]] flight.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration awards the title of \"[[Commercial Astronaut]]\" to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft.

The Soviet [[Interkosmos|Intercosmos]] program included cosmonauts selected from [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) also took advantage of the program.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe US space shuttle program included [[payload Specialist]] positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional [[NASA]] astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, [[Ulf Merbold]] from ESA and [[Byron K.

NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor [[Rockwell International]] studied a $200\u2013300&nbsp;million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the [[National Space Society]] stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5&nbsp;million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1985|fmt=eq}}) each to fly in space on new spacecraft.

An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle.

Founded in 1967, it is one of London's oldest male choirs. [[Gwalia]] is an archaic Welsh name for Wales.\n\nIt meets and rehearses every week in the building in which it was formed, the [[London Welsh Centre]]. This building is a cultural and community center, officially opened in 1930 by Margaret Lloyd George, wife of former [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]].\n\nThe honorary President of the choir is singer, songwriter, author and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. In 2017 she succeeded [[BAFTA]] award-winning Welsh journalist, newsreader and presenter [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] in the role.\n\n== Performances ==\n\nSince its founding, the choir has regularly performed in venues such as the [[Houses of Parliament]], the Foreign Office, the National Liberal Club, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the Ritz Hotel, the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and many of the places of worship in the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London]]. The choir has performed at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The choir has toured widely in Europe, most recently in Lombardy, Italy. Choir members sang as part of the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.\n\nThe choir appeared on the 1973 album [[Back Into The Future]] by Welsh psychedelic/progressive rock band [[Man (band)]]. They also appear on the [[Chris De Burgh]] album ''Beautiful Dreams'' and have performed live on the [[Robert Elms]] show on [[BBC Radio London]] as part of [[Saint David's Day]] celebrations. On August 15, 2015, they took part in a Drumhead Service on Horse Guards Parade in Central London to mark the 70th Anniversary of VJ Day. The service was attended by veterans of the conflict and also by Prince Charles, The Duchess of Cornwall, and Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\n== Repertoire ==\n\nThe choir's repertoire is largely drawn from the Welsh tradition, but also includes more popular pieces, including songs from musicals and operas.\n\n== Notables ==\n\nNotable former members include the conductor/arranger and current Musical Director for the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] Dr. Haydn James and the former [[Member of Parliament]] for Monmouth Huw (William Edmund) Edwards.\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:London choirs]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from London]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=April 2015}}\n'''Gwalia Male Choir''' (''Welsh: '''C\u00f4r Meibion Gwalia''''') is a male voice choir based in [[London]].

Set in an [[alternate timeline]] of [[World War II]], players engage in side-scrolling shooter gameplay, using female [[moe anthropomorphism|moe anthropomorphic]] characters based on [[warships]] from the war's major participants. Other gameplay elements, like customizing a home and marrying in-game characters, are also present.\n\nFirst launched in China in May and in Japan in September 2017, ''Azur Lane'' has briefly become very popular, especially in Japan where the player count reached five million within four months after its release. Successive [[Comiket]] numbers have yet to confirm long-term popularity of the game in Japan, with Azur Lane ranking around 10th below franchises and genres like ''[[Fate Grand Order]]'', ''[[Kantai Collection]]'' or Virtual YouTubers. Players have voted the game among the top five on [[Google Play]]'s Best Game of 2017 list for the region. Critics have attributed the game's popularity to its original and well-designed gameplay system. An English-language version started open beta in August 2018 and was formally released in May 2019. Later, on December 18, English version was expanded to Latin American region. PWB Play simultaneously released it to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] on October 4, 2019.\n\nThe game has been adapted into several manga and novelizations. ''Azur Lane Crosswave'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] adaptation for [[PlayStation 4]], was published by [[Compile Heart]] on August 29, 2019 with mixed reception. ''Crosswave''<nowiki/>'s English localization was released on February 13, 2020 for PlayStation 4 and PC. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Bibury Animation Studio]] premiered on October 3, 2019 and aired in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] until March 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/09/15-1/ship-girl-smart-phone-game-azur-lane-sets-sail-as-a-tv-anime|title=Ship Girl Smart Phone Game Azur Lane Sets Sail as a TV Anime|access-date=April 1, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Azur Lane main screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Main interface, with the character ''[[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|Long Island]]''.

[[Destroyer]]s, [[light cruiser]]s, and [[heavy cruiser]]s can be allotted to the front row, while the back row is reserved for [[battleship]]s, [[aircraft cruiser]], [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s, [[repair ship]]s, [[battlecruiser]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. Different combinations of ships are required to achieve victory in different battle situations. Players may then select and enter a [[level (video gaming)|map]].<ref name=rpgsarticle/>\n\nOn entering a map, the player's fleet is placed on a grid-like map similar to that in the game [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]. The map contains nodes, which are either combat nodes which are enemy fleets, some immobile and others that pursue the player, or non-combat nodes which provides ammunition or mystery nodes which can provide supplies such as repair kits, upgrade materials or can spawn a special combat node called a Treasure Fleet. Players must navigate optimally and assemble their fleets tactically, to clear obstructing enemies and, using minimal movements, reach the map's [[boss (video gaming)|boss]]. When the player moves their fleet across the map, they can be ambushed in [[random encounter]]s from which they may take damage, or they can be forced to engage the enemy, using fuel and ammo. Fuel is one of the two in-game resources. Ammo points are assigned to player fleets at each map, with one ammo point deducted at each battle. Fleets that run out of ammo can still fight but may only deal half damage.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\n[[File:Azur Lane battle screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle interface of ''Azur Lane''.]]\nWhen battling an enemy, players can use a virtual [[joystick]] to control the front row, which can automatically fire shells at targets and manually launch torpedoes. While stationary, the back row can send [[Barrage (artillery)|shell barrages]] and the player can manually call in airstrikes. These will activate a bullet-clearing effect, removing all projectiles and torpedoes on screen. Players have an auto mode option to give up this control to the game's AI. Characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] is fully replenished when completing or exiting a map. Morale points are deducted for each fleet character in a battle. Should a character fall in battle, they cannot join in further action on the map and a larger number of morale points are deducted for the fallen character at the end of the battle. Sustained low morale for a character decreases their stats and affection points. Low affection points lead the character to greet the player with vocals reflecting their disappointment.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\nThe game features a [[player versus player]] mode. The player may prepare a defence fleet and organize an offence fleet to challenge opposing players' defence fleets. In this mode, battles are controlled entirely by AI, and the bullet-clearing effect of airstrikes is disabled. Tokens can be gained and the player's ranking can rise through victory in this mode. Players receive no penalty if they lose a challenge or their defence fleet is defeated by other players. Exclusive characters and other items can be obtained using tokens. The ranking is refreshed every 15 days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Exercise|title=Exercise|work=Azur Lane Wiki|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nAdditional mechanics were introduced after the game's release. [[Submarine warfare|Submarine]] and [[anti-submarine warfare]] systems were introduced in May 2018. This included anti-submarine campaign maps, and characters based on German [[U-Boat]]s, and American and Japanese submarines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inside-games.jp/article/2018/05/28/114983.html|title=\u300e\u30a2\u30ba\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u300f5\u670831\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u958b\u50ac\u306e\u91cd\u685c\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u3084\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8266\u7a2e\u300c\u6f5c\u6c34\u8266\u300d\u304c\u516c\u958b\uff01\u30a2\u30ba\u30ec\u30f3TV\u307e\u3068\u3081 {{!}} \u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|work=\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=ja}}</ref> A [[ship's cat]] system was introduced in September 2018.

Furniture and decorations raise the rate experience is gained. They can be arranged freely. Players may increase Dormitory character capacity, unlock a second floor which recovers morale, and buy special interactive furniture using the in-game currency.  As well, monuments can be awarded by clearing event stages. Players may inspect other players' Dormitories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://criticalindex.net/first-impressions-an-initial-look-at-azur-lane-31b7d2a443e|title=First Impressions: An Initial Look at Azur Lane|last=Ana|first=Ren|date=December 27, 2017|website=Critical Index|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nWhen a character's affection points are raised to 100 through battle, secretary, or Dormitory, players may choose to give a \"promise ring\" to this character. A \"promise ring\" can be obtained through quests once. Additional rings can be purchased using in-game currency in the items shop, essentially allowing [[polygamy]].<ref name=Siliconera_20171009/> Players may also give customized names to married characters but may only do so every 30 days for each character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmorpg.news/2018/09/azur-lane-oath-marriage-and-first-event.html|title=Azur Lane - Oath (Marriage) and First Event on Global|website=www.mmorpg.news|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, a few of the most popular characters will also gain unique wedding dress costumes for the wedding. They will also gain additional stat bonuses after being married.<ref name=\"Siliconera_20171009\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe start of the game features an anthropomorphic recreation of the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], where the personification of famed British battlecruiser [[HMS Hood|HMS ''Hood'']] is sunk by characters representing the German forces. The game features an eponymous military alliance, \"Azur Lane\", formed by nations of Eagle Union ([[United States]]), Royal Navy ([[United Kingdom]]), Sakura Empire ([[Empire of Japan]]) and Iron Blood ([[Nazi Germany]]).<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" /> The alliance split in two because of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien intervention]] with Iron Blood and Sakura Empire form an opposing faction, \"Crimson [[Axis powers|Axis]]\", using technology provided by the aliens to invade \"Azur Lane\" countries. The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the United States naval engagements in the [[Pacific War]]. Chapters represent several decisive battles of the war including the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]].\n\n== Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character!!Japanese<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azurlane-anime.jp/character/|title=CHARACTER|website=Azur Lane Official Website|accessdate=October 25, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>!!English<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19202/master-thread-azur-lane-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] AZUR LANE (Dubbed)|last=Funimation|first=|date=|website=www.funimation.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]||[[Yui Ishikawa]]||Rachael Messer\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]||[[Mai Nakahara]]||[[Amber Lee Connors]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Unicorn (I72)|Unicorn]]||[[Ai Kakuma]]||[[Alexis Tipton]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Javelin (F61)|Javelin]]||Nozomi Yamane||Madeleine Morris\n|-\n|[[USS Laffey (DD-459)|Laffey]]||[[Maria Naganawa]]||[[Tia Ballard]]\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]||[[Ai Kayano]]||Dawn M.

Meanwhile, [[USS Vestal|Vestal]] arrives on the base and is immediately upset at the poor state Enterprise's rig is in. Enterprise is met by Belfast and Unicorn, who convince her to attend a beach party the other shipgirls are holding. Unicorn thanks Enterprise for saving her, and Enterprise reveals she feels shipgirls are only meant to be weapons, and the ocean is only a source of conflict. As Unicorn leaves to play with Javelin and Laffey, Belfast confronts Enterprise directly, warning her that if she continues to fight like she did in the previous battle, she'll eventually forget her reason for fighting in the first place. The base then receives a distress call, with Enterprise, Cleveland, Hammann, and Belfast leaving to investigate. They find [[Chinese cruiser Ning Hai|Ning Hai]] and [[Chinese cruiser Ping Hai|Ping Hai]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Dragon Empery]]. They explain they were ambushed by Siren ships when a damaged Siren ship attacks.

When Enterprise touches it, she receives a brief vision what appears to be an alternate version of herself. Returning her attention to the base, Enterprise is surprised at how lively it is with new arrivals like Akashi, Ping Hai, and Ning Hai setting up shops. Belfast reminds Enterprise that shipgirls are humans as well, which is something she must learn to embrace. Javelin and Laffey take a bath with Unicorn, who reveals she's self conscious about her large breasts despite her small size. They reassure her that every shipgirl's body is different, and she should be proud of her own. That night, the three of them reaffirm their desire to befriend Ayanami. At the Sakura Empire, Prinz Eugen tries to sow distrust between Kaga and Akagi by suggesting to Kaga that Akagi has differing motives from hers. Akagi meanwhile expresses her desire to reunite with [[Amagi-class battlecruiser|Amagi]].\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = DEADLINE - For Determination, For Love\n| TranslitTitle       =\u3010Shisen\u3011 Ketsui to, Ai no Tame ni\n| NativeTitle         =\u3010\u6b7b\u7dda\u3011\u6c7a\u610f\u3068\u3001\u611b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|21}} (Japan)<br>{{Start date|2019|12|12}} (US)\n| ShortSummary        = Azur Lane and the Sakura Empire prepare to face each other in a decisive naval battle, sending their largest fleets.

However, Orochi is protected by an impenetrable shield, and the shipgirls are unable to inflict any damage. While unconscious, Enterprise encounters her alternate self again, who warns her conflict between shipgirls is inevitable since they are manifestations of human will like Orochi, but Enterprise decides to keep fighting to protect everybody important to her.

Set in an [[alternate timeline]] of [[World War II]], players engage in side-scrolling shooter gameplay, using female [[moe anthropomorphism|moe anthropomorphic]] characters based on [[warships]] from the war's major participants. Other gameplay elements, like customizing a home and marrying in-game characters, are also present.\n\nFirst launched in China in May and in Japan in September 2017, ''Azur Lane'' has briefly become very popular, especially in Japan where the player count reached five million within four months after its release. Successive [[Comiket]] numbers have yet to confirm long-term popularity of the game in Japan, with Azur Lane ranking around 10th below franchises and genres like ''[[Fate Grand Order]]'', ''[[Kantai Collection]]'' or Virtual YouTubers. Players have voted the game among the top five on [[Google Play]]'s Best Game of 2017 list for the region. Critics have attributed the game's popularity to its original and well-designed gameplay system. An English-language version started open beta in August 2018 and was formally released in May 2019. Later, on December 18, English version was expanded to Latin American region. PWB Play simultaneously released it to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] on October 4, 2019.\n\nThe game has been adapted into several manga and novelizations. ''Azur Lane Crosswave'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] adaptation for [[PlayStation 4]], was published by [[Compile Heart]] on August 29, 2019 with mixed reception. ''Crosswave''<nowiki/>'s English localization was released on February 13, 2020 for PlayStation 4 and PC. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Bibury Animation Studio]] premiered on October 3, 2019 and aired in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] until March 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/09/15-1/ship-girl-smart-phone-game-azur-lane-sets-sail-as-a-tv-anime|title=Ship Girl Smart Phone Game Azur Lane Sets Sail as a TV Anime|access-date=April 1, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Azur Lane main screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Main interface, with the character ''[[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|Long Island]]''.

[[Destroyer]]s, [[light cruiser]]s, and [[heavy cruiser]]s can be allotted to the front row, while the back row is reserved for [[battleship]]s, [[aircraft cruiser]], [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s, [[repair ship]]s, [[battlecruiser]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. Different combinations of ships are required to achieve victory in different battle situations. Players may then select and enter a [[level (video gaming)|map]].<ref name=rpgsarticle/>\n\nOn entering a map, the player's fleet is placed on a grid-like map similar to that in the game [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]. The map contains nodes, which are either combat nodes which are enemy fleets, some immobile and others that pursue the player, or non-combat nodes which provides ammunition or mystery nodes which can provide supplies such as repair kits, upgrade materials or can spawn a special combat node called a Treasure Fleet. Players must navigate optimally and assemble their fleets tactically, to clear obstructing enemies and, using minimal movements, reach the map's [[boss (video gaming)|boss]]. When the player moves their fleet across the map, they can be ambushed in [[random encounter]]s from which they may take damage, or they can be forced to engage the enemy, using fuel and ammo. Fuel is one of the two in-game resources. Ammo points are assigned to player fleets at each map, with one ammo point deducted at each battle. Fleets that run out of ammo can still fight but may only deal half damage.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\n[[File:Azur Lane battle screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle interface of ''Azur Lane''.]]\nWhen battling an enemy, players can use a virtual [[joystick]] to control the front row, which can automatically fire shells at targets and manually launch torpedoes. While stationary, the back row can send [[Barrage (artillery)|shell barrages]] and the player can manually call in airstrikes. These will activate a bullet-clearing effect, removing all projectiles and torpedoes on screen. Players have an auto mode option to give up this control to the game's AI. Characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] is fully replenished when completing or exiting a map. Morale points are deducted for each fleet character in a battle. Should a character fall in battle, they cannot join in further action on the map and a larger number of morale points are deducted for the fallen character at the end of the battle. Sustained low morale for a character decreases their stats and affection points. Low affection points lead the character to greet the player with vocals reflecting their disappointment.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\nThe game features a [[player versus player]] mode. The player may prepare a defence fleet and organize an offence fleet to challenge opposing players' defence fleets. In this mode, battles are controlled entirely by AI, and the bullet-clearing effect of airstrikes is disabled. Tokens can be gained and the player's ranking can rise through victory in this mode. Players receive no penalty if they lose a challenge or their defence fleet is defeated by other players. Exclusive characters and other items can be obtained using tokens.

The game features an eponymous military alliance, \"Azur Lane\", formed by nations of Eagle Union ([[United States]]), Royal Navy ([[United Kingdom]]), Sakura Empire ([[Empire of Japan]]) and Iron Blood ([[Nazi Germany]]).<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" /> The alliance split in two because of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien intervention]] with Iron Blood and Sakura Empire form an opposing faction, \"Crimson [[Axis powers|Axis]]\", using technology provided by the aliens to invade \"Azur Lane\" countries. The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the United States naval engagements in the [[Pacific War]]. Chapters represent several decisive battles of the war including the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]].\n\n== Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character!!Japanese<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azurlane-anime.jp/character/|title=CHARACTER|website=Azur Lane Official Website|accessdate=October 25, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>!!English<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19202/master-thread-azur-lane-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] AZUR LANE (Dubbed)|last=Funimation|first=|date=|website=www.funimation.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]||[[Yui Ishikawa]]||Rachael Messer\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]||[[Mai Nakahara]]||[[Amber Lee Connors]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Unicorn (I72)|Unicorn]]||[[Ai Kakuma]]||[[Alexis Tipton]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Javelin (F61)|Javelin]]||Nozomi Yamane||Madeleine Morris\n|-\n|[[USS Laffey (DD-459)|Laffey]]||[[Maria Naganawa]]||[[Tia Ballard]]\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]||[[Ai Kayano]]||Dawn M.

Enterprise remains on watch, despite her repairs only being partially complete. Akagi and Kaga are also recovering from the battle when they are met by [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]. Akagi sends [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|Shoukaku]] to ambush an Azur Lane fleet and asks Prinz Eugen to assist them. Prinz Eugen agrees, bringing [[German destroyer Z23|Z23]] and Ayanami with her.

Enterprise mobilizes to help them despite her damage, with Cleveland, Javelin, and Laffey following her. While Enterprise battles Zuikaku and Shoukaku and Cleveland assists damaged shipgirls, Javelin and Laffey remain reluctant to fight Z23 and Ayanami. As the Azur Lane and Red Axis forces battle each other, the main Royal Navy fleet led by [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|Queen Elizabeth]] arrives. Enterprise manages to gain the upper hand on Zuikaku but her unrepaired damage causes her equipment to fail at a critical moment.

Meanwhile, [[USS Vestal|Vestal]] arrives on the base and is immediately upset at the poor state Enterprise's rig is in. Enterprise is met by Belfast and Unicorn, who convince her to attend a beach party the other shipgirls are holding. Unicorn thanks Enterprise for saving her, and Enterprise reveals she feels shipgirls are only meant to be weapons, and the ocean is only a source of conflict. As Unicorn leaves to play with Javelin and Laffey, Belfast confronts Enterprise directly, warning her that if she continues to fight like she did in the previous battle, she'll eventually forget her reason for fighting in the first place. The base then receives a distress call, with Enterprise, Cleveland, Hammann, and Belfast leaving to investigate. They find [[Chinese cruiser Ning Hai|Ning Hai]] and [[Chinese cruiser Ping Hai|Ping Hai]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Dragon Empery]]. They explain they were ambushed by Siren ships when a damaged Siren ship attacks. Enterprise uses herself as a distraction to draw the Siren's attention, but ends up being saved by Belfast when her rig malfunctions again.

Javelin and Laffey take a bath with Unicorn, who reveals she's self conscious about her large breasts despite her small size.

The corridor is owned, in part, by [[Amtrak]], the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA), [[Metro-North Railroad]] (MNRR), and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (CDOT).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amtrak.com/about-amtrak/amtrak-facts/amtrak-national-facts.html |title=Amtrak National Facts |website=Amtrak |access-date=April 8, 2018}}</ref>\n*MBTA [[Providence/Stoughton Line]], Boston to [[Massachusetts]]/[[Rhode Island]] state line (dispatched and maintained by Amtrak)\n*Amtrak [[Northeast Corridor]], MA/RI state line to [[New Haven, Connecticut]]\n*[[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] to [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle, NY]]\n*Amtrak [[Northeast Corridor]], [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] to [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nSome trips diverge at New Haven and turn north to serve Springfield, Massachusetts, operating over the [[New Haven\u2013Springfield Line]] owned wholly by Amtrak. The {{lnl|Amtrak|Hartford Line}} provides supplemental service along this line, with timed connections to/from certain ''Northeast Regional'' trips.<ref name=\"BOS\u2013WAS\" />\n\nSeveral trips continue south of Washington D.C. to Virginia, running to either Roanoke, Richmond, Newport News, or Norfolk. All Virginia service uses the ex-[[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad]], now [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], between Washington and [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. South of Alexandria, trains to Roanoke use the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] (ex-[[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]], ex-Virginia Midland Railway). Trains to Richmond, Norfolk and Newport News use the following CSX tracks between Alexandria and Richmond:\n*[[RF&P Subdivision]]\n*[[Richmond Terminal Subdivision]]\n*[[Bellwood Subdivision]]\nSouth of Richmond, trains to Newport News use the CSX [[Peninsula Extension|Peninsula Subdivision]]. Trains to Norfolk use the CSX [[North End Subdivision]] and Norfolk Southern's [[List of Norfolk Southern Railway lines|Norfolk District]] (ex-[[Norfolk and Western Railway]]).\n\nUntil around 1999 some service to Springfield continued east to Boston, for an alternate [[Inland Route]] between New York and Boston. One weekend train stayed on this route until the November 1, 2004, schedule.\n\nOne train, the ''Federal'' ({{lnl|Amtrak|Twilight Shoreliner}} until 2004), formerly carried an overnight sleeper between Washington and Boston, giving the corridor 24-hour service; the ''Federal'' name (briefly resurrected in 2004) is no longer used, and an ordinary all-coach ''Northeast Regional'' runs in its place.\n\nAmtrak receives federal funding for its operations between Boston and Washington, D.C. ''Northeast Regional'' operations south of Washington are funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Operations along the New Haven\u2013Springfield Line are funded by the State of Connecticut and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n==Station

Trains generally run along the [[Northeast Corridor]] between [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], via [[New York City]]. Extensions and branches provide service to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Roanoke, Virginia]] and {{lnl|Amtrak|Hartford Line}} trains serve [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].\n\nTravel times are about 4.5 hours between Norfolk or Newport News and Washington, 5 hours between Roanoke and Washington, under two hours between Washington and Philadelphia, 1.5 hours between Philadelphia and New York, 3.5 hours between New York and Springfield, and 4 hours between New York and Boston.<ref name=\"BOS\u2013Virginia\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/timetables/Northeast-Schedule-W06-030419.pdf |title=Amtrak Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Virginia Service Timetable |date=March 4, 2019 |publisher=[[Amtrak]] |access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BOS\u2013WAS\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/timetables/Northeast-Schedule-W04-030419.pdf |title=Amtrak Northeast Corridor BOS\u2013WAS Timetable |date=March 4, 2019 |publisher=[[Amtrak]] |access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"NYP\u2013WAS\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/timetables/Northeast-Schedule-W02-030419.pdf |title=Amtrak Northeast Corridor NYP\u2013WAS Timetable |date=March 4, 2019 |publisher=[[Amtrak]] |access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref> Travel times between Washington and New York are typically slightly faster than the equivalent travel time by car.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ggwash.org/view/6023/the-eternal-question-new-york-via-train-or-bus |title=The eternal question: New York via train or bus? |date=August 3, 2010 |publisher=Greater Greater Washington |access-date=May 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Amtrak 606 entering New London Union Station, September 2014.JPG|thumb|left|A typical ''Northeast Regional'' with an ACS-64 locomotive and [[Amfleet]] passenger cars at New London Union Station]]\nTrains usually have 7 to 10 cars with one or two [[locomotive]]s pulling, although they may be as long as 14 cars during peak travel periods.<ref name=\"tw\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/usarail/regional.htm |title=Amtrak - Northeast Regional |website=TrainWeb |access-date=April 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe passenger cars are the rebuilt [[Amfleet|Amfleet I]] series passenger cars built by the [[Budd Company]] in the mid to late 1970s. Since May 2008, ''Northeast Regional'' trains have the Caf\u00e9 Car in the middle of the train. The ''Coach Class'' car adjacent to business class is designated the quiet car, where passengers are asked to refrain from loud talking and mobile phone conversations. If a second Caf\u00e9 Car is present, it is only used for passenger seating. The overnight ''Northeast Regional'' trains 65, 66, and 67 have a different configuration from the other Northeast Regional trains. These trains offer a limited number of business-class seats at the front of the Caf\u00e9 Car, instead of having a dedicated ''Business Class'' car. The overnight trains have a baggage car used for baggage service.<ref name=\"tw\" />\n\nBetween Boston and Washington, the service has overhead electric wires and largely travels over Amtrak-owned tracks. This segment reaches speeds of {{convert|125|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} with [[Siemens ACS-64]] electric locomotives built from 2012\u20132015. The ACS-64 locomotives replaced the [[EMD AEM-7|AEM-7]] locomotives in June 2016 and the [[Bombardier\u2013Alstom HHP-8|HHP-8s]] in November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.amtrak.com/blogs/blog/farewell-to-the-aem-7|title=A Fond Farewell to the AEM-7 |date=June 20, 2016 |publisher=[[Amtrak]]}}</ref>\n\n''Northeast Regional'' trains operating on the lines in Virginia and the [[New Haven\u2013Springfield Line]] use [[General Electric|GE]] [[GE Genesis|P42DC]] diesel locomotives and have lower top speeds of 110mph.

Electrification ended at [[New Haven, Connecticut]], requiring an engine change. On October 28, 1995, Amtrak introduced the \"''NortheastDirect''\" [[brand]] for all trains on the [[Northeast Corridor]] (and its extension to [[Newport News, Virginia]]) except for the express {{lnl|Amtrak|Metroliner}} and hourly {{lnl|Amtrak|Clocker}} services.

Regional service south to Newport News began on June 14, 1976, when Amtrak ended the Newport News section of the {{lnl|Amtrak|James Whitcomb Riley}} and the {{lnl|Amtrak|Colonial}} was added in its place with two daily round trips from Boston to Newport News via Alexandria, Richmond and Williamsburg.

The corridor is owned, in part, by [[Amtrak]], the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA), [[Metro-North Railroad]] (MNRR), and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (CDOT).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amtrak.com/about-amtrak/amtrak-facts/amtrak-national-facts.html |title=Amtrak National Facts |website=Amtrak |access-date=April 8, 2018}}</ref>\n*MBTA [[Providence/Stoughton Line]], Boston to [[Massachusetts]]/[[Rhode Island]] state line (dispatched and maintained by Amtrak)\n*Amtrak [[Northeast Corridor]], MA/RI state line to [[New Haven, Connecticut]]\n*[[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] to [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle, NY]]\n*Amtrak [[Northeast Corridor]], [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] to [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nSome trips diverge at New Haven and turn north to serve Springfield, Massachusetts, operating over the [[New Haven\u2013Springfield Line]] owned wholly by Amtrak. The {{lnl|Amtrak|Hartford Line}} provides supplemental service along this line, with timed connections to/from certain ''Northeast Regional'' trips.<ref name=\"BOS\u2013WAS\" />\n\nSeveral trips continue south of Washington D.C. to Virginia, running to either Roanoke, Richmond, Newport News, or Norfolk. All Virginia service uses the ex-[[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad]], now [[CSX Transportation|CSX]], between Washington and [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. South of Alexandria, trains to Roanoke use the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] (ex-[[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]], ex-Virginia Midland Railway). Trains to Richmond, Norfolk and Newport News use the following CSX tracks between Alexandria and Richmond:\n*[[RF&P Subdivision]]\n*[[Richmond Terminal Subdivision]]\n*[[Bellwood Subdivision]]\nSouth of Richmond, trains to Newport News use the CSX [[Peninsula Extension|Peninsula Subdivision]]. Trains to Norfolk use the CSX [[North End Subdivision]] and Norfolk Southern's [[List of Norfolk Southern Railway lines|Norfolk District]] (ex-[[Norfolk and Western Railway]]).\n\nUntil around 1999 some service to Springfield continued east to Boston, for an alternate [[Inland Route]] between New York and Boston. One weekend train stayed on this route until the November 1, 2004, schedule.\n\nOne train, the ''Federal'' ({{lnl|Amtrak|Twilight Shoreliner}} until 2004), formerly carried an overnight sleeper between Washington and Boston, giving the corridor 24-hour service; the ''Federal'' name (briefly resurrected in 2004) is no longer used, and an ordinary all-coach ''Northeast Regional'' runs in its place.\n\nAmtrak receives federal funding for its operations between Boston and Washington, D.C. ''Northeast Regional'' operations south of Washington are funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Operations along the New Haven\u2013Springfield Line are funded by the State of Connecticut and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n==Station
