The songs \"[[Jihad (song)|Jihad]]\", \"Flesh Storm\", \"Catalyst\", and \"Consfearacy\" were recorded in D# tuning, while \"Catatonic\", \"Eyes of the Insane\", \"Skeleton Christ\", and \"Supremist\" were recorded in Drop B tuning and \"Black Serenade\" and \"Cult\" in C# tuning.\n\nDepicting a mutilated Christ painted by longtime collaborator [[Larry Carroll (artist)|Larry Carroll]], the album's graphic artwork courted controversy; an alternative cover was issued to conservative retailers who felt uncomfortable with the original, and the band also put out a censored cover without the offensive artwork. Lyrics, particularly in the song \"Jihad\", describe the [[September 11 attacks]] from the perspective of a terrorist. Following protests, all Indian stocks of the album were recalled and destroyed by [[EMI]] India.<ref name=\"AlbumsDestroyed\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6039976.stm|title='Offensive' album pulled in India|date=October 11, 2006|work=BBC.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Christ Illusion'' received generally favorable critical reviews, and entered the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] at number 5, making it the band's second highest U.S. chart position as of 2015.

Thank you. -->'''Camden''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Ouachita County, Arkansas|Ouachita County]] in the south-central part of the [[U.S. state portals|U.S. state of Arkansas.]] The city is located about 100 miles south of Little Rock. Situated on the bluffs overlooking the Ouachita River, Camden is a city rich in history, most of which is tied to the river. The recorded history began in 1782 when a Spanish military post was established on the site of an old French trading post called Ecore \u00e0 Fabri. When Ouachita County was formed in 1842, American settlers changed the name to Camden. The city became an important port during the steamboat era when Camden became known as the \u201cQueen City\u201d of the Ouachita. In 1864, Camden became the unintended focus of the [[Red River Campaign]], a major Civil War effort resulting in several significant battles.<ref name=\"ADPT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.arkansas.com/camden |title=Camden |website=Arkansas.com |publisher=[[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism|Arkansas Department of Parks & Tourism]] |access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref><!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not change the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Camden, Arkansas]].

The Quapaw claimed the territory that included this part of the Ouachita basin, but it was also influenced by both [[Caddo]] trade and culture. The old Indian trail called the Caddo Trace, leading from the Quapaw villages on the Arkansas River to those of the Caddo on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]], crossed the Ouachita River at what is now Camden. French hunters, trappers, and traders, who were drawn to the area by the abundant game, later established a rendezvous point on the high bluff above the crossing. The place became known as Ecore a Fabri or Fabri's Bluff (later spelled Fabre).<ref name=\"EoA\">{{cite web |url=https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/camden-947/ |title=Camden (Ouachita County) |last=Milam |first=Daniel A. |publisher=[[Central Arkansas Library System]] |date=April 30, 2005 |website=[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture|Encyclopedia of Arkansas]] |access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1762, France ceded Louisiana to [[Spain]]. In 1782, the Spanish governor sent a Frenchman named Jean Baptiste Filhiol, known to him as Don Juan Filhiol, to establish a civil and military post in the Ouachita district. Filhiol first chose to locate his headquarters at Ecore a Fabri with the expectation of creating a settlement there. After about two years, he decided to move downriver to the more central site of Prairie des Canots, present-day [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. These locations were noted in 1804 by the Hunter-Dunbar Expedition that explored the Ouachita River.<ref name=\"EoA\" />\n\n=== Early Statehood ===\nBy 1819, Jesse Bowman, of future [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]] fame, was living at Ecore a Fabri, while the Tate brothers\u2014Andrew, Richard, and George\u2014came up the Ouachita on keelboats. Unable to go farther, they settled up river at a place now called [[Tates Bluff, Arkansas|Tate's Bluff]]. In 1824, John Nunn moved to Ecore a Fabri and became one of the early permanent settlers. The Nunn brothers planned to pole freight and passengers upriver toward [[Washington, Arkansas]]. Steamboats arrived at Ecore a Fabri in the 1820s and provided it with a direct link to the cotton and commercial markets in [[New Orleans]]. Because it was located at the head of practical navigation, Ecore a Fabri became a commercial center and began to grow. Residents of [[Hempstead County, Arkansas|Hempstead County]] began petitioning for a new road in 1821, and by 1828, the Camden to Washington Road was having additional work and maintenance done. By 1829, a large portion of Hempstead County, including Ecore a Fabri, was broken off by the [[Arkansas General Assembly|legislature]] to form an expanded [[Union County, Arkansas|Union County]]. In 1842, Ouachita County, named for the river, was formed from the northwest portion of Union. Ecore a Fabri was chosen as the county seat, and its name was changed to Camden at the suggestion of one of the commissioners, Thomas Woodward.<ref name=\"EoA\" />\n\nCamden soon became the second-largest city in Arkansas. It was a mercantile center and a bustling river port served by frequent scheduled steamboats carrying passengers and freight. Most traveled between Camden and [[New Orleans]]. Camden was also the headquarters for John T. Chidester's stagecoach line that served [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. Chidester's company carried the United States Mail from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] for the Butterfield stage line.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Chidester Stage Lines|last=Dillard|first=Tom|date=20 December 2015|work=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== American Civil War ===\n{{Main|Camden Expedition}}\nDuring the Civil War, Camden was the focus of [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] general [[Frederick Steele]]\u2019s Red River Campaign of 1864. Steele moved south of Little Rock toward [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], but got only as far as Camden, which he occupied while the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] pulled back to defend Washington, Arkansas. Forts [[Fort Lookout (Arkansas)|Lookout]] and [[Fort Southerland|Southerland]] were built early in 1864, and the [[Camden Water Battery]] was built later in the same year, all to protect Camden from attack. After losing the [[Battle of Poison Spring|engagement at Poison Spring]] and the [[Battle of Marks' Mills|action at Marks\u2019 Mill]], Steele had little choice but to retreat toward Little Rock. Camden and south Arkansas remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war.<ref name=\"EoA\" />\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\nBefore the steamboat era faded, Camden had become a railroad town\u2014served by the mainline of the [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|St Louis-Southwestern Railroad]] (Cotton Belt) and by branch lines of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]] and the [[Rock Island Railroad|Rock Island]] railroads. The town remained an important cotton shipping depot through the early decades of the twentieth century. The South Arkansas oil boom of the 1920s resulted in a thriving economy.\n\n[[File:Camden News, Camden, AR IMG 2233.JPG|thumb|left|''The Camden News'' headquarters 113 Madison Avenue, Northeast]]\nIn 1927, the [[International Paper]] Company built a processing mill at Camden, following development of south Arkansas' lumber industry. For several decades, Camden was the headquarters of the [[Clyde E. Palmer]] newspaper chain, which included ''[[The Camden News]]'', the ''[[Texarkana Gazette]]'', the ''Hot Springs Sentinel-Record'', and the ''Magnolia Banner News''. The daily newspaper in Camden is the original flagship publication of [[WEHCO Media]].\n\nNear the end of [[World War II]], thousands of new jobs were created with the 1944 construction of [[Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot|a naval ammunition depot]] across the Ouachita at Shumaker. The [[Korean War]] generated new jobs and activity at the depot, which closed after war's end. The city and county redeveloped its facilities and grounds into an extensive industrial area. This was the site of some major defense establishments and multiple smaller industries. [[Southern Arkansas University Tech|A technical campus]] of [[Southern Arkansas University]] is also located there.\n\nIn the 1990s, post [[Cold War]] downsizing of the defense industry brought severe job losses\u2014and resulting population decline\u2014to the Camden area.  The International Paper Company mill closed a few years later, resulting in more job losses. In recent years, however, a partial resurgence of defense contracts and the development of a diversified mixture of small business and professional activity have stabilized the town's economy.\n\n== Geography ==\nCamden is located on the Ouachita River, at the end of the navigable part of the river. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|16.5|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.36%) is water.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot summers and cool winters.

Thank you. -->'''Camden''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Ouachita County, Arkansas|Ouachita County]] in the south-central part of the [[U.S. state portals|U.S. state of Arkansas.]] The city is located about 100 miles south of Little Rock. Situated on the bluffs overlooking the Ouachita River, Camden is a city rich in history, most of which is tied to the river. The recorded history began in 1782 when a Spanish military post was established on the site of an old French trading post called Ecore \u00e0 Fabri. When Ouachita County was formed in 1842, American settlers changed the name to Camden. The city became an important port during the steamboat era when Camden became known as the \u201cQueen City\u201d of the Ouachita. In 1864, Camden became the unintended focus of the [[Red River Campaign]], a major Civil War effort resulting in several significant battles.<ref name=\"ADPT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.arkansas.com/camden |title=Camden |website=Arkansas.com |publisher=[[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism|Arkansas Department of Parks & Tourism]] |access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref><!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not change the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Camden, Arkansas]].

The Quapaw claimed the territory that included this part of the Ouachita basin, but it was also influenced by both [[Caddo]] trade and culture. The old Indian trail called the Caddo Trace, leading from the Quapaw villages on the Arkansas River to those of the Caddo on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]], crossed the Ouachita River at what is now Camden. French hunters, trappers, and traders, who were drawn to the area by the abundant game, later established a rendezvous point on the high bluff above the crossing. The place became known as Ecore a Fabri or Fabri's Bluff (later spelled Fabre).<ref name=\"EoA\">{{cite web |url=https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/camden-947/ |title=Camden (Ouachita County) |last=Milam |first=Daniel A. |publisher=[[Central Arkansas Library System]] |date=April 30, 2005 |website=[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture|Encyclopedia of Arkansas]] |access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1762, France ceded Louisiana to [[Spain]]. In 1782, the Spanish governor sent a Frenchman named Jean Baptiste Filhiol, known to him as Don Juan Filhiol, to establish a civil and military post in the Ouachita district. Filhiol first chose to locate his headquarters at Ecore a Fabri with the expectation of creating a settlement there. After about two years, he decided to move downriver to the more central site of Prairie des Canots, present-day [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. These locations were noted in 1804 by the Hunter-Dunbar Expedition that explored the Ouachita River.<ref name=\"EoA\" />\n\n=== Early Statehood ===\nBy 1819, Jesse Bowman, of future [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]] fame, was living at Ecore a Fabri, while the Tate brothers\u2014Andrew, Richard, and George\u2014came up the Ouachita on keelboats. Unable to go farther, they settled up river at a place now called [[Tates Bluff, Arkansas|Tate's Bluff]]. In 1824, John Nunn moved to Ecore a Fabri and became one of the early permanent settlers. The Nunn brothers planned to pole freight and passengers upriver toward [[Washington, Arkansas]]. Steamboats arrived at Ecore a Fabri in the 1820s and provided it with a direct link to the cotton and commercial markets in [[New Orleans]]. Because it was located at the head of practical navigation, Ecore a Fabri became a commercial center and began to grow. Residents of [[Hempstead County, Arkansas|Hempstead County]] began petitioning for a new road in 1821, and by 1828, the Camden to Washington Road was having additional work and maintenance done. By 1829, a large portion of Hempstead County, including Ecore a Fabri, was broken off by the [[Arkansas General Assembly|legislature]] to form an expanded [[Union County, Arkansas|Union County]]. In 1842, Ouachita County, named for the river, was formed from the northwest portion of Union. Ecore a Fabri was chosen as the county seat, and its name was changed to Camden at the suggestion of one of the commissioners, Thomas Woodward.<ref name=\"EoA\" />\n\nCamden soon became the second-largest city in Arkansas. It was a mercantile center and a bustling river port served by frequent scheduled steamboats carrying passengers and freight. Most traveled between Camden and [[New Orleans]]. Camden was also the headquarters for John T. Chidester's stagecoach line that served [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. Chidester's company carried the United States Mail from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] for the Butterfield stage line.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Chidester Stage Lines|last=Dillard|first=Tom|date=20 December 2015|work=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== American Civil War ===\n{{Main|Camden Expedition}}\nDuring the Civil War, Camden was the focus of [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] general [[Frederick Steele]]\u2019s Red River Campaign of 1864. Steele moved south of Little Rock toward [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], but got only as far as Camden, which he occupied while the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] pulled back to defend Washington, Arkansas. Forts [[Fort Lookout (Arkansas)|Lookout]] and [[Fort Southerland|Southerland]] were built early in 1864, and the [[Camden Water Battery]] was built later in the same year, all to protect Camden from attack. After losing the [[Battle of Poison Spring|engagement at Poison Spring]] and the [[Battle of Marks' Mills|action at Marks\u2019 Mill]], Steele had little choice but to retreat toward Little Rock. Camden and south Arkansas remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war.<ref name=\"EoA\" />\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\nBefore the steamboat era faded, Camden had become a railroad town\u2014served by the mainline of the [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|St Louis-Southwestern Railroad]] (Cotton Belt) and by branch lines of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]] and the [[Rock Island Railroad|Rock Island]] railroads. The town remained an important cotton shipping depot through the early decades of the twentieth century. The South Arkansas oil boom of the 1920s resulted in a thriving economy.\n\n[[File:Camden News, Camden, AR IMG 2233.JPG|thumb|left|''The Camden News'' headquarters 113 Madison Avenue, Northeast]]\nIn 1927, the [[International Paper]] Company built a processing mill at Camden, following development of south Arkansas' lumber industry. For several decades, Camden was the headquarters of the [[Clyde E. Palmer]] newspaper chain, which included ''[[The Camden News]]'', the ''[[Texarkana Gazette]]'', the ''Hot Springs Sentinel-Record'', and the ''Magnolia Banner News''. The daily newspaper in Camden is the original flagship publication of [[WEHCO Media]].\n\nNear the end of [[World War II]], thousands of new jobs were created with the 1944 construction of [[Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot|a naval ammunition depot]] across the Ouachita at Shumaker. The [[Korean War]] generated new jobs and activity at the depot, which closed after war's end. The city and county redeveloped its facilities and grounds into an extensive industrial area. This was the site of some major defense establishments and multiple smaller industries. [[Southern Arkansas University Tech|A technical campus]] of [[Southern Arkansas University]] is also located there.\n\nIn the 1990s, post [[Cold War]] downsizing of the defense industry brought severe job losses\u2014and resulting population decline\u2014to the Camden area.  The International Paper Company mill closed a few years later, resulting in more job losses. In recent years, however, a partial resurgence of defense contracts and the development of a diversified mixture of small business and professional activity have stabilized the town's economy.\n\n== Geography ==\nCamden is located on the Ouachita River, at the end of the navigable part of the river.

Built in 1847 by local merchant Peter McCollum, the house was purchased by John T. Chidester in 1857 and was used as a way station on his stage line. It was featured in the television series ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]''.<ref name=\"ADPT\" /> \n\nCamden has numerous historic buildings. There are two National Register districts. The Clifton and Greening Streets Historic District was created in 1997, and the Washington Street Historic District in 2010. The old Camden Post Office, built 1895, was added to the register in 1977. It is now a popular restaurant. The oldest continually running restaurant in the state of Arkansas is also located in Camden. The White House Cafe was opened in 1907 by Hristos Hodjopulas. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aymag.com/the-white-house-cafe/ |title=The White House Cafe |publisher=AY Magazine |accessdate=2020-01-11}}</ref>  \n\nAbout {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the northwest, the site of the [[Battle of Poison Springs]] is preserved at [[Poison Springs Battleground State Park]], one of three state parks commemorating the campaign. [[Oakland Cemetery (Camden, Arkansas)|Oakland Cemetery]], which is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], is the largest [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cemetery in the area. Artifacts related to two famous Camden products, Camark pottery and Grapette soft drinks, as well as Civil War and railroad relics, are exhibited at the Camden Visitors Center and Museum. Two major events held in the city are the spring Camden Daffodil Festival and autumn BPW Barn Sale. Other area attractions include [[White Oak Lake State Park]]; the [[Arkansas Museum of Natural Resources]] at [[Smackover, Arkansas|Smackover]], and [[El Dorado, Arkansas|El Dorado]].<ref name=\"ADPT\" />\n\n== Education ==\nCamden was once served by Camden School District and Fairview School District.

For other information on the region, see [[Cambridgeshire]]''.\n\n[[File:Cambridge-260x345.jpg|thumb|225px|Map of the Cambridgeshire area (1904)]]\n\nThe [[England|English]] county of '''Cambridgeshire''' has a long history.\n\n==Anglo-Saxon times==\nThe area that is now Cambridgeshire was first settled by the English at about the 6th century by bands of Angles, who pushed their way up the [[River Great Ouse|Ouse]] and the [[River Cam|Cam]], and established themselves in the [[The Fens|fen-district]], where they became known as the [[Gyrwas]], the districts corresponding to the modern counties of [[Huntingdonshire]] and Cambridgeshire being distinguished as the lands of the North Gyrwas and the South Gyrwas respectively. At this period the fen-district stretched southward as far as [[Cambridge]], and the essential unity which it preserved is illustrated later by its inclusion under one [[sheriff]], chosen in successive years from Cambridgeshire proper and the Liberty of the [[Isle of Ely]].\n\nIn 656 numerous lands in the neighbourhood of [[Wisbech]] were included in the [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of the [[abbey]] of [[Peterborough]], and in the same century religious houses were established at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] and [[Thorney, Cambridgeshire|Thorney]], both of which, however, were destroyed during the [[Vikings|Danish]] invasions of the 9th century. After the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], the district became part of the [[Danelaw]]. On the expulsion of the Danes by [[Edward the Elder]] in the 10th century it was included in [[East Anglia]], but in the 11th century was again overrun by the Danes, who in the course of their devastations burnt Cambridge.  The first mention of the shire in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records the valiant resistance which it opposed to the invaders in 1010 when the rest of East Anglia had taken ignominious flight. The shire-system of East Anglia was in all probability not definitely settled before the [[Norman conquest of England]], but during the Danish occupation of the 9th century the district possessed a certain military and political organization round Cambridge, its chief town, whence probably originated the constitution and demarcation of the later shire.\n\n==Division of Cambridgeshire==\n{{see also|Hundreds of Cambridgeshire}}\nAt the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]] the county was divided as now, except that the Isle of Ely, which then formed two [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] having their meeting-place at [[Witchford]], is now divided into the four hundreds of Ely, Wisbech, [[North Witchford]] and [[South Witchford]], while Cambridge formed a hundred by itself. The hundred of [[Flendish]] was then known as [[Flamingdike]]. Cambridgeshire was formerly included in the [[diocese of Lincoln]]. On the creation of the [[diocese of Ely]] in 1109, almost the whole county was placed in that diocese. In 1291 the whole county, with the exception of [[parish]]es in the deanery of Fordham and [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|diocese of Norwich]], constituted the [[archdeaconry of Ely]], comprising the deaneries of Ely, Wisbech, [[Chesterton, Cambridge|Chesterton]], [[Shingay]], [[Bourn, Cambridgeshire|Bourn]], [[Barton, Cambridgeshire|Barton]] and Camps.\n\n==Politics==\nThe Isle of Ely formerly constituted an independent franchise in which the [[bishop]]s exercised quasi-[[County palatine|palatinate]] rights, and offences were held to be committed against the bishop's peace. These privileges were considerably abridged in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], but the Isle still had separate civil officers, appointed by the bishop, chief among whom were the chief justice, chief [[bailiff]], deputy bailiff and two [[coroner]]s.\n\nCambridgeshire has always been remarkable for its lack of county families, and for the frequent changes in the ownership of estates. No Englishmen retained lands of any importance after the Conquest, and at the time of the [[Domesday Survey]] the chief lay proprietors were Alan, [[Earl]] of [[Brittany]], whose descendants the [[Baron Zouche|Zouches]] retained estates in the county until the 15th century; [[Picot of Cambridge|Picot the sheriff]], whose estates passed to the families of Peverell and Peche; Aubrey de Vere, whose descendants retained their estates till the 16th century; and Hardwinus de Scalariis, ancestor of the Scales of [[Whaddon, Cambridgeshire|Whaddon]].\n\nFrom the time of [[Hereward]]'s famous resistance to [[William the Conqueror]] in the fen-district, the Isle of Ely was intimately concerned with the great political struggles of the country. \n*It was defended against [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] by Bishop Nigellus of Ely, who fortified Ely and Aldreth, which in 1144 was held for the [[Empress Matilda]] by [[Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]]. \n*During the struggles between [[John of England|John]] and his barons, Faukes de Breaut was made governor of [[Cambridge Castle]], which, however, surrendered to the barons in the same year. \n*The Isle of Ely was seized by the followers of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] in 1266, but in 1267 was taken by Prince Edward. \n*At the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] period the county showed much sympathy with the Reformers, and in 1642 the [[knight]]s, gentry and commoners of Cambridgeshire petitioned for the removal of all unwarrantable orders and dignities, and the banishment of [[Pope|Popish]] [[clergy]]. \n*In the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] of the 17th century Cambridgeshire was one of the associated counties in which the [[Charles I of England|King]] had no visible party, although the [[University of Cambridge|University]] assisted him with contributions of plate and money.\n\nCambridgeshire returned three members to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1290, and in 1295 the county returned two members, the borough of Cambridge two members, and the city of Ely two members, this being the sole return for Ely. The university was summoned to return members in 1300 and again in 1603, but no returns are recorded before 1614, after which it continued to return two members. Under the [[Reform Act]] of 1832 the county returned three members.\n\n==Economy==\nCambridgeshire is historically an [[agriculture|agricultural]] county. The Domesday Survey mentions over 90 mills and numerous valuable [[fishery|fisheries]], especially [[eel]]-fisheries, and contains frequent references to [[wheat]], [[malt]] and [[honey]]. The county had a flourishing [[wool]]-industry in the 14th century, and became noted for its [[worsted]] cloths. The [[Black Death]] of 1349 and the ravages committed during the [[Wars of the Roses]] were followed by periods of severe depression, and in 1439 several Cambridgeshire towns obtained a remission of taxation on the plea of poverty. In the 16th century, [[barley]] for malt was grown in large quantities in the south, and the manufacture of [[willow]] baskets was carried on in the fen-districts. [[Saffron]] was extensively cultivated in the 18th century, and [[paper]] was manufactured near Sturbridge. [[Stourbridge Fair|Sturbridge fair]] was at this period reckoned the largest in Europe, the chief articles of merchandise being wool, [[hops]] and [[leather]]; and the [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] races and horse trade were already famous. Large waste areas were brought under cultivation in the 17th century through the drainage of the fen-district, which was brought to completion about 1652 through the labors of [[Cornelius Vermuyden]], a [[Netherlands|Dutchman]]. The [[coprolite]] industry was very profitable for a short period from 1850 to 1880, and its decline was accompanied by a general industrial and [[Great Depression of British Agriculture|agricultural depression]].\n\n==Antiquities in ecclesiastical architecture==\nCambridgeshire would be rich only in the possession of the [[Ely Cathedral|cathedral at Ely]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge|round church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] chapels, and many other examples in Cambridge. At [[Thorney, Cambridgeshire|Thorney]], a small town in the north of the county, which owes much in appearance to the 8th [[Duke of Bedford]] (d. 1872), the [[Thorney Abbey|parish church]] is actually a portion of the church of an abbey said to date originally from the 7th century, and refounded in 972 by [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester|Aethelwold]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], as a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]]. The church is partly fine [[Norman architecture|Norman]]. Another Norman building of special interest is [[Leper Chapel, Cambridge|Sturbridge chapel]] near Cambridge, which belonged to a [[leper]]s' hospital. To this foundation King John granted a fair, which became, and continued until the 18th century, one of the most important in [[England]]. At [[Swaffham Prior]] there are remains of two churches in one churchyard, the tower of one being Transitional Norman, while that of the other is [[Perpendicular]], the upper part octagonal. Among many Early English examples the church of Cherry Hinton near Cambridge may be mentioned. The churches of Trumpington and Bottisham are examples of the [[Gothic architecture|Decorated]] style; in the first is a famous brass to Sir Roger de Trumpington (1289). As Perpendicular examples the tower and spire of St Mary's, [[Whittlesey]], and the wooden roof of Outwell church, may be selected. [[Monasticism|Monastic]] remains are scanty. Excluding the city of Cambridge there are no domestic buildings, either ancient or modern, of special note, with the exception of [[Sawston Hall]], in the south of the county, a quadrangular mansion dated 1557\u20131584.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Northamptonshire]] for the [[Soke of Peterborough]]\n* [[Timeline of Cambridge history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Cambridgeshire |volume=5 |pages=97-99}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-no2010-35269 Samuel Tymms] |location=London |publisher=J.B.

{"title_page": "Modern Cambodia", "text_new": "{{History of Cambodia}}\nAfter the fall of the [[Pol Pot]] regime of [[Democratic Kampuchea]], [[Cambodia]] was under [[Vietnam]]ese occupation and a pro-[[Hanoi]] government, the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] was established. A [[civil war]] raged during the 1980s opposing the government's [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces]] against the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]], a government in exile composed of three Cambodian political factions: [[Prince Norodom Sihanouk]]'s [[Funcinpec]] party, the [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]] (often referred to as the [[Khmer Rouge]]) and the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]] (KPNLF).\n\nPeace efforts intensified in 1989 and 1991 with two international conferences in [[Paris]], and a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] mission helped maintain a ceasefire. As a part of the peace effort, [[United Nations]]-sponsored elections were held in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normality as did the rapid diminishment of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-1990s. [[Norodom Sihanouk]] was reinstated as King. A coalition government, formed after national elections in 1998, brought renewed political stability and the surrender of remaining Khmer Rouge forces in 1998.\n\n==Political aspects and elections==\n\nSince the restoration of what is referred to as [[multi-party system|multi-party democracy]] in 1993, the CPP has been in a coalition with the royalist [[Funcinpec]] party however the CPP has been the majority party following the [[1997 clashes in Cambodia|1997 Coup and purge]] against the FUNCINPEC.

This event was generally treated by the press, as well as by some scholars, as a \"bloody coup by strongman Hun Sen\",<ref>[http://www.mekong.net/Cambodia/hun_sen1.htm \"Bloody coup\" theory]</ref> without much serious and neutral investigation into its causes and its development.<ref>[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/component/option,com_jcs/Itemid,0/aid,8547/lang,en/layout,form/view,jcs/ Matthew Grainger, ''EU media guru says Ranariddh guilty'']</ref> Among the very few who  attempted to look at evidence from both sides at the time were [[Australia]]n ambassador to Cambodia Tony Kevin,<ref>[http://www.acic.info/new_article/CambodiaAndSoutheastAsia.pdf Tony Kevin, ''U.S. Errs in Cambodia Policy'', FEER 21 May 1998]</ref> and journalist Barry Wain, who wrote, \"in circumstances that remain disputed, Mr. Hun Sen's military forces... defeated Prince Ranariddh's troops in Phnom Penh\".<ref>[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/component/option,com_jcs/Itemid,49/aid,867/lang,en/layout,form/view,jcs/ Dr. Michael Vickery, ''The July 1997 shootout'']</ref> Hun Sen had alleged that Ranariddh had been planning a take-over with the help of Khmer Rouge fighters, supposedly smuggled into the capital (on the other hand, Hun Sen's army included a number of ex-Khmer rouge fighters).<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/ja/news/2007/07/27/cambodia-july-1997-shock-and-aftermath Cambodia: July 1997: Shock and Aftermath by Brad Adams]</ref> After the royalist resistance was crushed in Phnom Penh, there was indeed some FUCINPEC-Khmer Rouge in the Northern provinces, where the fighting against Hun Sen offensive lasted until August 1997.<ref>http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101221900-cambodge-les-royalistes-assiegesaides-des-khmers-rouges-ils-defendent-leur-dernier-bastion-attaque-par-hun-sen</ref>\n\nFollowing the coup Prince Ranariddh went into exile to Paris. Some FUNCINPEC leaders were forced to flee the country, many were shot and Ung Huot was elected as the new First Prime Minister. \nFUNCINPEC leaders returned to Cambodia shortly before the 1998 National Assembly elections. In those elections, the CPP received 41% of the vote, FUNCINPEC 32%, and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) 13%. Many international observers judged the elections to have been seriously flawed, claiming political violence, intimidation, and lack of media access. The CPP and FUNCINPEC formed another coalition government, with CPP the senior partner.\n\nCambodia's first commune elections were held in February 2002. These elections to select chiefs and members of 1,621 commune (municipality) councils also were marred by political violence and fell short of being free and fair by international standards. The election results were largely acceptable to the major parties, though procedures for the new local councils have not been fully implemented.\n\nA riot occurred in January 2003 in which the Embassy of [[Thailand]] and several Thai businesses were damaged. Following the incident, Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed the RGC's regret to the Thai Government and promised compensation. See [[Anti-Thai Cambodian riots of 2003]]\n\nOn July 27, 2003, elections were held and the Cambodian People's Party of Prime Minister Hun Sen won a majority, but not enough to rule outright.  The King has urged the two other parties, [[Sam Rainsy Party]] and FUNCINPEC, to accept the incumbent Hun Sen as prime minister.  In mid-2004 a coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC and the CPP.\n\nIn 2004, King Sihanouk, still in poor health, announced his abdication of the throne.  Prince Norodom Ranariddh was one of the leading candidates to succeed Sihanouk, but the Royal Council of the Throne selected Prince [[Norodom Sihamoni]], as the new king.  A sign of Cambodia's modernization is the construction of skyscrapers and Phnom Penh's satellite city, [[Camko City]].  As a result of modernization, many problems such as illegal deforestation are occurring.\n\n==Controversial resettlement of refugees==\n{{Further|Deportation of Cambodian refugees from the United States}}\nAustralia is paying Cambodia money to resettle in Cambodia, some asylum seekers who arrived by boat on Australian shores. Australia is expected to give Cambodia tens of millions of dollars for accepting the refugees who will be expected to assimilate into a society where '40 per cent of people live in poverty'. They will have no rights to be transferred to another country. That action has been met with widespread condemnation by human rights groups. Cambodia, a resource sparse country with a large number of poor people is thought to be unfit for use as a resettlement area because of its poverty and human rights abuses, also because the people being resettled are unable to do some of the most basic things like opening bank accounts. Rights groups accuse Cambodia of playing politics in the past with refugees and using them as bargaining chips in bilateral relations, pointing to the deportation of 20 ethnic [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] asylum seekers to China in 2009. [[Beijing]] announced a $1 billion aid package for Phnom Penh two days later.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cambodias-pm-hun-sen-confirms-controversial-agreement-to-resettle-refugees-from-australia-20140520-zrhz3.html#ixzz32CdXzqfv Retrieved-May-20-2014</ref>\n\n[[Sam Rainsy]] a political opposition leader commented on the refugee situation from Australia: 'Cambodia is one of the world's most corrupt countries.

This event was generally treated by the press, as well as by some scholars, as a \"bloody coup by strongman Hun Sen\",<ref>[http://www.mekong.net/Cambodia/hun_sen1.htm \"Bloody coup\" theory]</ref> without much serious and neutral investigation into its causes and its development.<ref>[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/component/option,com_jcs/Itemid,0/aid,8547/lang,en/layout,form/view,jcs/ Matthew Grainger, ''EU media guru says Ranariddh guilty'']</ref> Among the very few who  attempted to look at evidence from both sides at the time were [[Australia]]n ambassador to Cambodia Tony Kevin,<ref>[http://www.acic.info/new_article/CambodiaAndSoutheastAsia.pdf Tony Kevin, ''U.S. Errs in Cambodia Policy'', FEER 21 May 1998]</ref> and journalist Barry Wain, who wrote, \"in circumstances that remain disputed, Mr. Hun Sen's military forces... defeated Prince Ranariddh's troops in Phnom Penh\".<ref>[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/component/option,com_jcs/Itemid,49/aid,867/lang,en/layout,form/view,jcs/ Dr. Michael Vickery, ''The July 1997 shootout'']</ref> Hun Sen had alleged that Ranariddh had been planning a take-over with the help of Khmer Rouge fighters, supposedly smuggled into the capital (on the other hand, Hun Sen's army included a number of ex-Khmer rouge fighters).<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/ja/news/2007/07/27/cambodia-july-1997-shock-and-aftermath Cambodia: July 1997: Shock and Aftermath by Brad Adams]</ref> After the royalist resistance was crushed in Phnom Penh, there was indeed some FUCINPEC-Khmer Rouge in the Northern provinces, where the fighting against Hun Sen offensive lasted until August 1997.<ref>http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101221900-cambodge-les-royalistes-assiegesaides-des-khmers-rouges-ils-defendent-leur-dernier-bastion-attaque-par-hun-sen</ref>\n\nFollowing the coup Prince Ranariddh went into exile to Paris. Some FUNCINPEC leaders were forced to flee the country, many were shot and Ung Huot was elected as the new First Prime Minister. \nFUNCINPEC leaders returned to Cambodia shortly before the 1998 National Assembly elections. In those elections, the CPP received 41% of the vote, FUNCINPEC 32%, and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) 13%. Many international observers judged the elections to have been seriously flawed, claiming political violence, intimidation, and lack of media access. The CPP and FUNCINPEC formed another coalition government, with CPP the senior partner.\n\nCambodia's first commune elections were held in February 2002. These elections to select chiefs and members of 1,621 commune (municipality) councils also were marred by political violence and fell short of being free and fair by international standards. The election results were largely acceptable to the major parties, though procedures for the new local councils have not been fully implemented.\n\nA riot occurred in January 2003 in which the Embassy of [[Thailand]] and several Thai businesses were damaged. Following the incident, Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed the RGC's regret to the Thai Government and promised compensation. See [[Anti-Thai Cambodian riots of 2003]]\n\nOn July 27, 2003, elections were held and the Cambodian People's Party of Prime Minister Hun Sen won a majority, but not enough to rule outright.  The King has urged the two other parties, [[Sam Rainsy Party]] and FUNCINPEC, to accept the incumbent Hun Sen as prime minister.  In mid-2004 a coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC and the CPP.\n\nIn 2004, King Sihanouk, still in poor health, announced his abdication of the throne.  Prince Norodom Ranariddh was one of the leading candidates to succeed Sihanouk, but the Royal Council of the Throne selected Prince [[Norodom Sihamoni]], as the new king.  A sign of Cambodia's modernization is the construction of skyscrapers and Phnom Penh's satellite city, [[Camko City]].  As a result of modernization, many problems such as illegal deforestation are occurring.\n\n==Controversial resettlement of refugees==\n{{Further|Deportation of Cambodian refugees from the United States}}\nAustralia is paying Cambodia money to resettle in Cambodia, some asylum seekers who arrived by boat on Australian shores. Australia is expected to give Cambodia tens of millions of dollars for accepting the refugees who will be expected to assimilate into a society where '40 per cent of people live in poverty'. They will have no rights to be transferred to another country. That action has been met with widespread condemnation by human rights groups. Cambodia, a resource sparse country with a large number of poor people is thought to be unfit for use as a resettlement area because of its poverty and human rights abuses, also because the people being resettled are unable to do some of the most basic things like opening bank accounts. Rights groups accuse Cambodia of playing politics in the past with refugees and using them as bargaining chips in bilateral relations, pointing to the deportation of 20 ethnic [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] asylum seekers to China in 2009. [[Beijing]] announced a $1 billion aid package for Phnom Penh two days later.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cambodias-pm-hun-sen-confirms-controversial-agreement-to-resettle-refugees-from-australia-20140520-zrhz3.html#ixzz32CdXzqfv Retrieved-May-20-2014</ref>\n\n[[Sam Rainsy]] a political opposition leader commented on the refugee situation from Australia: 'Cambodia is one of the world's most corrupt countries. This government has made Cambodia one of the world's poorest countries. So any money, especially from any foreign source, would be diverted and channeled into the pocket of our corrupt leaders with very little, if any, benefit to the ordinary people.'<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2014/s4007692.htm Retrieved May-21-2014</ref>\n\n==Hun Sen's party accused of political corruption==\nHun Sen and his government have seen much controversy.

As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the population was 65,201, an increase of 8,117 from the 57,084 counted in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]]. The [[Ventura Freeway]] ([[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]]) is the city's primary thoroughfare. Camarillo is named for [[Adolfo Camarillo|Adolfo]] and [[Juan Camarillo, Jr.|Juan Camarillo]], two of the few ''[[Californio]]s'' (pre-1848 California natives of Hispanic ancestry) to preserve the city's heritage after the arrival of Anglo settlers. The [[Coast Line (UP)|railroad coast route]] came through in 1898 and built a station here. Adolfo Camarillo eventually employed 700 workers growing mainly lima beans. Walnuts and citrus were also grown on the ranch. Adolfo bred [[Camarillo White Horse]]s in the 1920s through the 1960s and was well known for riding them, dressed in colorful Spanish attire, in parades such as the Fiesta of Santa Barbara.\n\nThe city grew slowly prior to [[World War II]] but the war effort saw the construction of the [[Oxnard Air Force Base|Oxnard Army Air Field]] (later [[Oxnard Air Force Base]] in 1951, now [[Camarillo Airport]]) to the west of town. The community also grew as the new base along with nearby [[Naval Air Station Point Mugu]] and a [[Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme|Seabee base at Port Hueneme]] brought many workers and their families to the area. The grounds of [[Camarillo State Hospital]], which opened in 1936 south of town, are now the campus of [[California State University, Channel Islands]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-colonial period===\nAt the time of European contact in the 18th century, Camarillo had been inhabited by the [[Chumash Indians]] for thousands of years.<ref name=\"cityofcamarillo1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofcamarillo.org/Comm%20Dev/Projects/GPA%202016-1%20Shea/DEIR%20June%202017/Apx%206.5%20Cultural%20Resource%20Documentation.pdf |title=Cultural resources |publisher=www.cityofcamarillo.org |date=2017 |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref> Present day Camarillo and the larger [[Oxnard Plain]] were portions of a paramount Chumash capital at the village of Muwu (today's [[Point Mugu, California|Point Mugu]]).

The Mexican land grant system was liberalized in 1824, resulting in many large grants in California and the proliferation of Ranchos north of the border. One grant to Jos\u00e9 Pedro Ruiz created [[Rancho Calleguas]] in 1837, in the area that is now Camarillo. The grant was later sold to Juan Camarillo, who had arrived in 1834 as a member of the [[Hijar-Jos\u00e9 Colony|Hijar-Padres Expedition]];<ref name=\"Lees pastoral region insert page 4\">{{cite news |title=What's in a name?

The town was centered around St. Mary Magdalen Church, which was to serve as the family chapel for Adolfo Camarillo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://camarillobuilding.tripod.com/HTMLobj-241/WFultonArticle.pdf|title=Camarillo's Old Town Project May Be Model For Other Cities|last=Fulton|first=William|date=|website=www.insidevc.com|access-date=}}</ref> This area was eventually bisected by the Ventura Freeway.

Travel to and from Los Angeles was difficult, owing to the narrow, tortuous road climbing the Conejo Grade to the east of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.venturaweekly.com/history/camarillo|title=History of Camarillo|website=www.venturaweekly.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe main industry during this period was agriculture, and the area surrounding the small town was blanketed with orange, lemon and walnut groves. The State Mental hospital south of the town was the largest employer. A few houses had sprung up to the north and south of town center. The Oxnard Army Air Field, built during World War II to the west of town, the Naval Air Facility at [[Point Mugu]] and the Seabee base at [[Port Hueneme]] brought many military personnel to the area, but there was little private industry or other source of non-agricultural employment.\n\nOxnard AAF closed at the end of World War II, but the Navy facilities remained open, with the airfield upgraded to [[Naval Air Station Point Mugu]] and the Seabee base becoming [[Naval Base Ventura County|Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme and Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme]]. With the [[Korean War]] and associated [[Cold War]] tensions, the former Oxnard AAF was reactivated in 1951 as [[Oxnard Air Force Base]], an [[Air Defense Command]] / [[Aerospace Defense Command]] fighter-interceptor base, that closed again in 1970 and became the present-day [[Camarillo Airport]].\n\n===Ventura Freeway (US Route 101)===\n[[File:ConejoGrade.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Conejo Grade, southwards view]]\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[Ventura Freeway]], which bisects the town, was completed from Los Angeles to points north, making it an easy one-hour trip to Camarillo. The freeway was originally planned to follow the path of Potrero Road, south of Camarillo, which would have completely by-passed the soon-to-be city. However, after much debate, city officials persuaded [[Caltrans]] to lay the freeway parallel to Ventura Boulevard, creating the infamously steep descent from the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], known as the [[Conejo Grade]]. The grade is about {{convert|2.7|mi|km}} and posted as a 7% grade\u2014which translates as about one thousand feet of elevation change in less than three miles (70 meters per kilometer). There is a [[California Highway Patrol]] brake inspection station at the top of the grade and a stop is mandatory for all 18-wheel trucks. The completion of the freeway facilitated the growth that followed. In 1962, the population was 7,500 and [[3M]] began construction for the [[3M|Mincom]] and Magnetic Tape Divisions, which would ultimately employ 900 people, becoming the largest local employer. That plant briefly housed a factory for 3M [[corporate spin-off|spinoff]] [[Imation]] before being closed in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=IMATION ANNOUNCES FURTHER MANUFACTURING OPTIMIZATION STEPS|url=http://ir.imation.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=73967&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1177468&highlight=|publisher=Imation Corp.|accessdate=May 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630072140/http://ir.imation.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=73967&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1177468&highlight=|archivedate=June 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Incorporation in 1964===\nPlans were made for the incorporation of the city to control the rapid expansion. Camarillo became a city in 1964 and soon put into place a General Plan and building codes. In 1964 the closest traffic signal was {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the city center on the road to Point Mugu, and the first shopping center and supermarket were under construction. Because of the late date of city incorporation, the local telephone exchange is still listed as part of [[Oxnard]]. Much of the city was expected to be developed to the south of Ventura Boulevard, however the city grew to the north, and most of the land south of Ventura Boulevard remains in agricultural use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nMany of the home buyers during the 1960s were military veterans, who had been stationed at one of the local bases. The temperate climate and the living conditions lured them back. With the establishment of both the Pacific Missile Range at NAS Point Mugu and the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory at Port Hueneme many found employment that utilized their military training. Other newcomers were those who worked and lived in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and were willing to endure the commute for the opportunity to raise their families in a smog-free, semirural environment. Still others relocated here with their employers, like 3M, and [[Harbor Freight Tools]] who built facilities in and around the city to take advantage of the large workforce. [[Technicolor]] Video Services Inc. was the largest DVD duplicator in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technicolor.com/GlobalEnglish/Corporate/About/Pages/default.aspx|title=Technicolor Home Page}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the council voted against an 895-acre project that would have extended development on agricultural lands east towards the [[Conejo Grade]].<ref>Harris, Mike (September 10, 2014) [http://archive.vcstar.com/news/special/paradise/camarillo-council-kills-plans-for-large-development-ep-607165386-351245731.html \"Camarillo council kills plans for large development\"] ''[[Ventura County Star]]''</ref>\n\n===Camarillo State Hospital & CSUCI===\n{{Main|Camarillo State Mental Hospital|California State University, Channel Islands}}\n\nCamarillo State Mental Hospital was established near the city in the 1930s so that persons suffering from mental illnesses or [[tuberculosis]] could recover in Ventura County's balmy climate.

A city manager, hired by the council and answerable to it, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the city. That person is charged with overall management of the five city departments. Services such as water, sewer, trash collection, street maintenance and traffic engineering are provided by a combination of contractors and city employees.\n\nPolice services are provided by the [[Ventura County Sheriff's Department]] under contract to the city, headquartered in a police station owned by the city. The Sheriff's department helicopter fleet is hangared at [[Camarillo Airport]]. [[Ventura County Fire Department]] provides fire protection, with five stations within the city limits.\n\nThe major source of city funding is sales tax revenue. The mix of retail and commercial businesses in the city provides a stable tax base. The addition of a Factory Outlet Center and a new shopping center added significantly to the sales tax revenues.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 2000, Camarillo was a stronghold for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and had nearly twice as many Republican voters as Democratic voters.<ref>McCormack, Don (1999).

As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the population was 65,201, an increase of 8,117 from the 57,084 counted in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]]. The [[Ventura Freeway]] ([[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]]) is the city's primary thoroughfare. Camarillo is named for [[Adolfo Camarillo|Adolfo]] and [[Juan Camarillo, Jr.|Juan Camarillo]], two of the few ''[[Californio]]s'' (pre-1848 California natives of Hispanic ancestry) to preserve the city's heritage after the arrival of Anglo settlers. The [[Coast Line (UP)|railroad coast route]] came through in 1898 and built a station here. Adolfo Camarillo eventually employed 700 workers growing mainly lima beans. Walnuts and citrus were also grown on the ranch. Adolfo bred [[Camarillo White Horse]]s in the 1920s through the 1960s and was well known for riding them, dressed in colorful Spanish attire, in parades such as the Fiesta of Santa Barbara.\n\nThe city grew slowly prior to [[World War II]] but the war effort saw the construction of the [[Oxnard Air Force Base|Oxnard Army Air Field]] (later [[Oxnard Air Force Base]] in 1951, now [[Camarillo Airport]]) to the west of town. The community also grew as the new base along with nearby [[Naval Air Station Point Mugu]] and a [[Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme|Seabee base at Port Hueneme]] brought many workers and their families to the area. The grounds of [[Camarillo State Hospital]], which opened in 1936 south of town, are now the campus of [[California State University, Channel Islands]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-colonial period===\nAt the time of European contact in the 18th century, Camarillo had been inhabited by the [[Chumash Indians]] for thousands of years.<ref name=\"cityofcamarillo1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofcamarillo.org/Comm%20Dev/Projects/GPA%202016-1%20Shea/DEIR%20June%202017/Apx%206.5%20Cultural%20Resource%20Documentation.pdf |title=Cultural resources |publisher=www.cityofcamarillo.org |date=2017 |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref> Present day Camarillo and the larger [[Oxnard Plain]] were portions of a paramount Chumash capital at the village of Muwu (today\u2019s [[Point Mugu, California|Point Mugu]]).

The Mexican land grant system was liberalized in 1824, resulting in many large grants in California and the proliferation of Ranchos north of the border. One grant to Jos\u00e9 Pedro Ruiz created [[Rancho Calleguas]] in 1837, in the area that is now Camarillo. The grant was later sold to Juan Camarillo, who had arrived in 1834 as a member of the [[Hijar-Jos\u00e9 Colony|Hijar-Padres Expedition]];<ref name=\"Lees pastoral region insert page 4\">{{cite news |title=What's in a name?

Travel to and from Los Angeles was difficult, owing to the narrow, tortuous road climbing the Conejo Grade to the east of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.venturaweekly.com/history/camarillo|title=History of Camarillo|website=www.venturaweekly.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe main industry during this period was agriculture, and the area surrounding the small town was blanketed with orange, lemon and walnut groves. The State Mental hospital south of the town was the largest employer. A few houses had sprung up to the north and south of town center. The Oxnard Army Air Field, built during World War II to the west of town, the Naval Air Facility at [[Point Mugu]] and the Seabee base at [[Port Hueneme]] brought many military personnel to the area, but there was little private industry or other source of non-agricultural employment.\n\nOxnard AAF closed at the end of World War II, but the Navy facilities remained open, with the airfield upgraded to [[Naval Air Station Point Mugu]] and the Seabee base becoming [[Naval Base Ventura County|Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme and Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme]]. With the [[Korean War]] and associated [[Cold War]] tensions, the former Oxnard AAF was reactivated in 1951 as [[Oxnard Air Force Base]], an [[Air Defense Command]] / [[Aerospace Defense Command]] fighter-interceptor base, that closed again in 1970 and became the present-day [[Camarillo Airport]].\n\n===Ventura Freeway (US Route 101)===\n[[File:ConejoGrade.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Conejo Grade, southwards view]]\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[Ventura Freeway]], which bisects the town, was completed from Los Angeles to points north, making it an easy one-hour trip to Camarillo. The freeway was originally planned to follow the path of Potrero Road, south of Camarillo, which would have completely by-passed the soon-to-be city. However, after much debate, city officials persuaded [[Caltrans]] to lay the freeway parallel to Ventura Boulevard, creating the infamously steep descent from the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], known as the [[Conejo Grade]]. The grade is about {{convert|2.7|mi|km}} and posted as a 7% grade\u2014which translates as about one thousand feet of elevation change in less than three miles (70 meters per kilometer). There is a [[California Highway Patrol]] brake inspection station at the top of the grade and a stop is mandatory for all 18-wheel trucks. The completion of the freeway facilitated the growth that followed. In 1962, the population was 7,500 and [[3M]] began construction for the [[3M|Mincom]] and Magnetic Tape Divisions, which would ultimately employ 900 people, becoming the largest local employer. That plant briefly housed a factory for 3M [[corporate spin-off|spinoff]] [[Imation]] before being closed in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=IMATION ANNOUNCES FURTHER MANUFACTURING OPTIMIZATION STEPS|url=http://ir.imation.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=73967&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1177468&highlight=|publisher=Imation Corp.|accessdate=May 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630072140/http://ir.imation.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=73967&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1177468&highlight=|archivedate=June 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Incorporation in 1964===\nPlans were made for the incorporation of the city to control the rapid expansion. Camarillo became a city in 1964 and soon put into place a General Plan and building codes. In 1964 the closest traffic signal was {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the city center on the road to Point Mugu, and the first shopping center and supermarket were under construction. Because of the late date of city incorporation, the local telephone exchange is still listed as part of [[Oxnard]]. Much of the city was expected to be developed to the south of Ventura Boulevard, however the city grew to the north, and most of the land south of Ventura Boulevard remains in agricultural use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nMany of the home buyers during the 1960s were military veterans, who had been stationed at one of the local bases. The temperate climate and the living conditions lured them back. With the establishment of both the Pacific Missile Range at NAS Point Mugu and the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory at Port Hueneme many found employment that utilized their military training. Other newcomers were those who worked and lived in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and were willing to endure the commute for the opportunity to raise their families in a smog-free, semirural environment. Still others relocated here with their employers, like 3M, and [[Harbor Freight Tools]] who built facilities in and around the city to take advantage of the large workforce. [[Technicolor]] Video Services Inc. was the largest DVD duplicator in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technicolor.com/GlobalEnglish/Corporate/About/Pages/default.aspx|title=Technicolor Home Page}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the council voted against an 895-acre project that would have extended development on agricultural lands east towards the [[Conejo Grade]].<ref>Harris, Mike (September 10, 2014) [http://archive.vcstar.com/news/special/paradise/camarillo-council-kills-plans-for-large-development-ep-607165386-351245731.html \"Camarillo council kills plans for large development\"] ''[[Ventura County Star]]''</ref>\n\n===Camarillo State Hospital & CSUCI===\n{{Main|Camarillo State Mental Hospital|California State University, Channel Islands}}\n\nCamarillo State Mental Hospital was established near the city in the 1930s so that persons suffering from mental illnesses or [[tuberculosis]] could recover in Ventura County's balmy climate. Jazzman [[Charlie Parker]]'s \"Relaxin' at Camarillo,\" written while he was detoxing from heroin addiction, is a tribute to the facility. The song \"Camarillo\" by punk outfit [[Fear (band)|Fear]] is also written about the facility. The band [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]] released a song called \"Ready for Camarillo\" on their 1978 ''Life Beyond L.A.'' album. \"Ready for Camarillo\" also appeared as the single B side of their hit \"How Much I Feel.\" The former hospital is the now the site of [[California State University, Channel Islands]]. The University has retained the distinctive [[Mission Revival Style architecture]] bell tower in the South quad. The band [[Brazzaville (US band)|Brazzaville]] released a video called \"Camarillo\" in 2007, with mental hospital-like imagery and lyrics concerning lead singer David Brown's relatives' stay in the institution.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe Camarillo State Hospital was closed in the 1990s and remained vacant until the site was converted into California State University, Channel Islands (CSUCI).

During the run-up to the St. Paul referendum in 1999, an independent working group was formed by Minneapolis businessmen Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin, representatives of a group of investors which owned the Rapid Park parking lot in the [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|historic warehouse district]] on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. This group, initially known as Minnesota Urban Ballpark, and later as MN Twinsville, formed with the express purpose of bringing their land into the discussion about sites for a new Twins ballpark.\n\nAt first, the 8-acre site appeared to be an extremely unlikely location for a modern professional baseball facility. Besides being far smaller than most MLB sites (modern facilities typically require {{convert|16-20|acres}}), it was hemmed in by railroad tracks, a [[Interstate 394|freeway]], and two city streets passing on bridges. Though very near to [[Target Center]], it was also adjacent to the [http://www.hennepin.us/your-government/facilities/hennepin-energy-recovery-center Hennepin Energy Recovery Center] (HERC), more commonly known as the city's \"garbage burner,\" considered by some to be an undesirable neighbor for a ballpark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/01/29/draft-study-garbage-burner-wont-harm-fans-at-new-twins-stadium/|title=Draft study: Garbage burner won\u2019t harm fans at new Twins stadium |work=Pioneer Press|author1=Gurnon, Emily |date=29 January 2007|accessdate=20 April 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nBut the site's perceived liabilities were easily offset by significant assets.

The Metrodome was climate-controlled, and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins. However, many Twins fans and baseball purists argue that this same sterile, climate-controlled environment creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for watching baseball.

The [[Minnesota Wild]] will be hosting the game against the [[St. Louis Blues|Saint Louis Blues]].\n\n==Features==\n{{prose|section|date=December 2017}}\n\n===The stadium===\n*The popular left-field [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] roof deck features mostly standing room and the only bonfire in the Majors.\n*The bullpens are \"double-decker\" style in left-center field.  The Twins' pen is farthest from the field, with the opposing team's pen below it, closest to the field.\n*The batter's eye featured 14 young [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] trees (each about 6 feet high) the first year.  After criticism from Twins and opposing players concerning the shadows that they cast, the trees were removed prior to the second year.  Some were auctioned to fans and ticket holders while the rest were donated to [[List of Minnesota state parks|Minnesota state parks]].\n*[[Kasota limestone]] is used in much of the stadium and is from [[Kasota, Minnesota|Kasota]], near [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]].\n*The admission gates are numbered according to former Twins legends and roughly located near to the positions that they played;\n**Left field gate is #6 honoring [[Tony Oliva]] (with his bronze statue nearby)\n**Centerfield gate is #3 for [[Harmon Killebrew]]\n**Target Plaza gate (in right field) is #34 in tribute to [[Kirby Puckett]]\n**Right field gate is #29 in tribute to [[Rod Carew]]\n**Home plate gate is #14 in honor of [[Kent Hrbek]] (featuring his bronze statue)\n\n===Target Plaza===\nTarget Plaza is the gathering area behind the right field gate (Gate 34). On the wall of the adjacent parking garage facing the ballpark is a wind veil that makes waves as the wind blows.  At night, color-changing lights add to the effect. Near the wind veil there are 9 topiary frames each {{convert|40|ft|m}} high shaped like baseball bats with hops growing on them. They are lit up every night with the same color changing scheme as the veil, however, during games they are lit up red, in sequential order, to denote the current inning.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/90324237.html Visuals big part of trip to Target Field] ''[[Star Tribune]]''</ref>  In this plaza are statues of former players [[Kirby Puckett]], [[Rod Carew]], [[Kent Hrbek]] and [[Harmon Killebrew]], as well as former owners [[Calvin Griffith]], [[Carl Pohlad]] and his wife, Eloise Pohlad and Twins mascot TC Bear.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carew Supports Griffith Statue Being Placed Near His Target Field Gate|first=Paul|last=Walsh|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/101657538.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA large \"Golden Glove\" sits in the plaza in recognition of all Twins players to win the Gold Glove Award.  The statue can be sat on and is a popular photo attraction.  It is located exactly {{convert|520|ft|m}} from home plate, the distance of Harmon Killebrew's longest home run at Met Stadium (although his was hit into the left field upper deck).\n\nThere is also a monument that shows all the venues that Minnesota-based baseball teams played in. On the rails of the pedestrian skybridge are pennants that contain the rosters of all the Twins teams, and pennants of players, coaches, front office people, and other contributors who have been elected to the Twins Hall of Fame.\n\n===The field===\nThe main flagpoles are in right field near the Plaza.  The largest pole, which flies the Stars and Stripes, is the original pole used at [[Metropolitan Stadium]].  It was relocated to the Richfield Legion Post 435 after the Met was demolished, and, after being cut in half and refurbished, was re-installed for baseball at Target Field.  The first flags\u2014both US and POW/MIA\u2014donated by Post 435 were raised at the first Twins exhibition game by veteran and flagpole historian B.W. McEvers of Bloomington. On September 6, [[Jim Thome]] hit a solo home run against the [[Kansas City Royals]] that hit the flag pole.\n\nThe championship banners fly on small flagpoles located on the upper rim of the stadium beyond left field.  Each pole recognizes each division, league, and world championship since the team's arrival in {{mlby|1961}}.  On the stadium's upper rim in right-center field are small flagpoles that fly the flag for all the teams (including the Twins) in the division.  The order that the flags fly are determined by the divisional standings.\n\nHome plate is the same one used at the Metrodome.  After the Twins' final dome game (Game 3 of the [[2009 American League Division Series|2009 ALDS]]), the plate was dug up and later installed at Target Field. In addition, several handfuls of dirt were taken from the sliding pit and pitcher's mound areas from the Metrodome and scattered near their counterparts at Target Field.\n\n===Twins bars and restaurants===\nAt Target Field, there are four prominent bars and restaurants:\n\n*The Town Ball Tavern is located on the upper concourse by the left field corner, and is famous for serving the [[Jucy Lucy]] burger. The wood flooring is the same used on the basketball court at the [[Minneapolis Armory]] during the NBA [[Minneapolis Lakers]] stay, before leaving for Los Angeles.\n*Hrbek's is located on the main concourse behind home plate, and is named after former Twins [[first baseman]] [[Kent Hrbek]].\n*There are two bars located on the upper concourse behind home plate, collectively called the Two Gingers Pubs. In one of these bars, fans can watch the Target Field organist, Sue Nelson, perform during games. Out of these three bars and restaurants, the Two Gingers Pub (formerly known as the Twins Pub) is the only one that does not serve food, however it is the only one in which the field is visible from inside.\n*The former Metropolitan Club (reserved for season ticket holders) was renovated prior to the 2019 season as restaurant Bat & Barrel, along with expansion of Target Plaza by moving Gate 34 further toward 1st Ave.\n\nConcessions throughout also include several Minnesota favorites like walleye, wild rice soup, Kramarczuk's sausages, as well as a \"State Fair Foods\" stand where many items are served \"on a stick\", such as the J.D. Hoyt's pork chop.\n\nIn 2018, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] declared Target Field number one on its annual list of [[vegan]]-friendly ballparks, thanks to the availability of foods like tofu vindaloo, vegan Sriracha Brats and Italian Sausages, [[Daiya]] cheese pizza, and Field Roast burgers and dogs.<ref>Kevin Reichard, \"Target Field Leads List of Vegan-Friendly Ballparks,\" [https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/06/04/target-field-leads-list-of-vegan-friendly-ballparks/ BallparkDigest.com], 4 June 2018.</ref>\n\n===Minnie and Paul logo===\n[[File:Minnie and Paul.jpg|thumb|right|300px.|Minnie and Paul, representing the Twin Cities, is the logo for the Minnesota Twins.]]\nA large version of the Twins' original \"Minnie and Paul\" logo (designed by local artist, Ray Barton <ref>{{cite web |title=Ray Barton obituary|url=http://www.harrisfam.org/rootspersona-tree-2/ray-alphonzo-barton/|work=Harris family genealogy site|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>) stands in center field.  It shows two players wearing the uniforms of the two minor-league teams that played in the Twin Cities before the Twins' arrival, the [[Minneapolis Millers]] and [[St. Paul Saints (1901\u201360)|St. Paul Saints]], shaking hands across the [[Mississippi River]].  During various points in the game, the strobe lights surrounding the logo flash. This sign was a concept designed and illustrated by RipBang Studios but built by others.\n\nWhen the Twins score a run by any means other than a home run, the strobe lights trace the border from the bottom-left corner for each Twins player that crosses home plate, symbolizing that a Twins player rounded the bases. For each strikeout, the corners of the sign flash to portray the strike zone. The strobe lights will flash at the end of the top of an inning if the Twins do not surrender a run during the inning. After a Twins home run, the strobe lights flash, Minnie and Paul shake hands, and the Mississippi River flows. After a Twins victory, the \"T\" and \"s\" in \"Twins\" will blink to show the message \"Twins win\" in addition to the animation shown following a Twins home run.\n\n==METRO and commuter rail connections==\nThe stadium is well-connected to the city's transit network, being immediately adjacent to the \"A\" and \"B\" [[parking ramp]]s of the large ABC Ramps complex at the end of [[Interstate 394]], which include two major transit bus terminals and link to the rest of downtown Minneapolis via [[skyway]].  Over 8,000 people typically arrive to each game via the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] and [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]], both of which terminate at [[Target Field (Metro Transit station)|Target Field Station]], just 10 yards from the park's Gate 6. For fans arriving from the northwest suburbs, the [[Northstar Line]] commuter rail terminates in downtown Minneapolis with a station underneath the ballpark.\n\n==Park firsts==\nThe first \"soft event\" at Target Field was an open house held for season ticket holders on March 20 and 21, 2010.[[File:First Pitch at Target Field.jpg|thumb|First Pitch at Target Field, thrown by Jordan, Minnesota native T.J.

An additional $120 million in infrastructure costs were split between the county ($90 million), the team ($20 million), [[Target Corporation]] ($4.5 million), the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] ($3.5 million) and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority ($2 million) bringing the project's total cost to US$555 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ballparkauthority.com/Budget.html|title=Target Field Construction Budget|website= Minnesota Ballpark Authority|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Target Field.jpg|thumb|Armed Services Appreciation Day, on July 3, 2011.

During the run-up to the St. Paul referendum in 1999, an independent working group was formed by Minneapolis businessmen Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin, representatives of a group of investors which owned the Rapid Park parking lot in the [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|historic warehouse district]] on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. This group, initially known as Minnesota Urban Ballpark, and later as MN Twinsville, formed with the express purpose of bringing their land into the discussion about sites for a new Twins ballpark.\n\nAt first, the 8-acre site appeared to be an extremely unlikely location for a modern professional baseball facility. Besides being far smaller than most MLB sites (modern facilities typically require {{convert|16-20|acres}}), it was hemmed in by railroad tracks, a [[Interstate 394|freeway]], and two city streets passing on bridges.

Any additional money needed for the land would have to come out of some other piece of infrastructure. If the price set by a judge came in over their budget, they would have no funds to pay, and the project could collapse. But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.\n\nOn September 19, 2006, Hennepin County officially authorized acquisition of the land, including doing so under eminent domain proceedings, if necessary. In late October the initial county appraisal of the land came in at the same $13.5 million that had been budgeted. Eminent domain proceedings were then initiated on November 1, 2006 as a precaution in case no agreement on land value could be reached by the time construction needed to start. The county set March 1, 2007 as the target date for finalizing acquisition of the Rapid Park site. There had still been no negotiations between the county and the land owners.\n\nAfter months passed without an agreement, a harsh war of words erupted in the media in February 2007.<ref name=\":4\" /> The Twins angrily cancelled a planned unveiling of the ballpark design scheduled for February 15, declaring that the entire project was in jeopardy.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/11/land-flap-prompts-twins-to-keep-stadium-design-under-wraps/|title=Land flap prompts Twins to keep stadium design under wraps |work=Pioneer Press |date=11 February 2007 |author1=Gurnon, Emily  |accessdate=April 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jerry Bell of the Twins and Mike Opat of Hennepin County gave multiple interviews<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnvideovault.org/mvvPlayer/customPlaylist2.php?id=7626&select_index=2&popup=yes#2|title=Almanac {{!}} New Stadium Woes|website=www.mnvideovault.org |accessdate=April 22, 2017|format=Video}}</ref> in which they described the land owners as being \u201cunwilling sellers,\u201d<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=|title=A Great Divide|last=Kaszuba|first=Mike|date=February 14, 2007|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|access-date=}}</ref> \u201cgreedy,\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/19/pitch-in-twins/|title=Pitch in, Twins |website=Pioneer Press |date=19 February 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \u201clawyered-up,\u201d<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=News Report|last=|first=|date=February 11, 2007|work=KARE-11 News|accessdate=}}</ref> painted them as \u201cgreedy landowners in black hats,\u201d<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnvideovault.org/mvvPlayer/customPlaylist2.php?id=7649&select_index=4&popup=yes#4|title=Almanac {{!}} The New Twins Stadium|website=www.mnvideovault.org |accessdate=April 22, 2017|format=Video}}</ref> and as not negotiating in good faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/09/hennepin-county-land-deal-holding-up-new-twins-ballpark/|title=Hennepin County / Land deal holding up new Twins ballpark |date=9 February 2007 |author1=Gurnon, Emily |work=Pioneer Press  |accessdate=April 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Lambrecht and Pogin continued to insist that they had an obligation to their investors to secure nothing more than \u201cfair market value\u201d for the land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/02/12/no-peek-at-stadium-plan-just-yet/|title=No peek at stadium plan just yet|date=12 February 2007 |author1=  |work=Pioneer Press |accessdate=April 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They repeatedly said that they would accept whatever valuation was determined in eminent domain proceedings,<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lacrossetribune.com/news/state-and-regional/mn/site-dispute-puts-twins-stadium-in-unclear-situation/article_7d36788a-eb57-5fea-b334-36c7cc93575a.html|title=Site dispute puts Twins stadium in unclear situation|work=La Crosse Tribune|date=10 February 2007  |accessdate=April 22, 2017|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> while media reports would later reveal their internal valuation (required by eminent domain laws) to be $65 million.\n\nIn early April 2007 Hennepin County received assurances that the Twins would provide additional funds, if necessary, to cover cost overruns on infrastructure, including the land acquisition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/04/09/hennepin-county-reaches-deal-on-twins-stadium-land/|title=Hennepin County reaches deal on Twins stadium land |date=9 April 2007 |author1=Gurnon, Emily  |work=Pioneer Press |accessdate=April 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This allowed the initiation of [http://www.wtplaw.com/documents/2011/04/basics-of-condemnation \u201cquick take\u201d] proceedings, and the county gained control of the site effective May 1, 2007,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/05/01/county-takes-title-of-land-puts-twins-ballpark-closer-to-reality/|title=County takes title of land, puts Twins ballpark closer to reality |date=1 May 2007 |author1=  |work=Pioneer Press  |accessdate=April 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> with a final sale price to be determined later.

The park features a modernized version of the original \"Minnie and Paul Shaking Hands\" logo used on the team's original uniforms from 1961 until 1986 (the logo has also been on the home uniforms since 2001). When a Twins player hits a home run, the Minnie and Paul sign lights up with strobe lights surrounding the Minnesota state outline and Minnie and Paul shake hands, akin to the Liberty Bell used at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia. The original flagpole from [[Metropolitan Stadium]] \u2013 completely restored \u2013 is located on the right field plaza. The flagpole was located at the [[American Legion]] post in [[Richfield, Minnesota|Richfield]] after Metropolitan Stadium's closing, and was donated back to the Twins by the Legion as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, the Twins announced a number of upgrades to Target Field, all of which were completed in time for the 2011 season. Highlights among the upgrades included a scoreboard in right-center field and the \"Twins Tower\" (a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} tall illuminated tower), next to the new scoreboard.

The Twins' pen is farthest from the field, with the opposing team's pen below it, closest to the field.\n*The batter's eye featured 14 young [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] trees (each about 6 feet high) the first year.  After criticism from Twins and opposing players concerning the shadows that they cast, the trees were removed prior to the second year.  Some were auctioned to fans and ticket holders while the rest were donated to [[List of Minnesota state parks|Minnesota state parks]].\n*[[Kasota limestone]] is used in much of the stadium and is from [[Kasota, Minnesota|Kasota]], near [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]].\n*The admission gates are numbered according to former Twins legends and roughly located near to the positions that they played;\n**Left field gate is #6 honoring [[Tony Oliva]] (with his bronze statue nearby)\n**Centerfield gate is #3 for [[Harmon Killebrew]]\n**Target Plaza gate (in right field) is #34 in tribute to [[Kirby Puckett]]\n**Right field gate is #29 in tribute to [[Rod Carew]]\n**Home plate gate is #14 in honor of [[Kent Hrbek]] (featuring his bronze statue)\n\n===Target Plaza===\nTarget Plaza is the gathering area behind the right field gate (Gate 34). On the wall of the adjacent parking garage facing the ballpark is a wind veil that makes waves as the wind blows.  At night, color-changing lights add to the effect. Near the wind veil there are 9 topiary frames each {{convert|40|ft|m}} high shaped like baseball bats with hops growing on them. They are lit up every night with the same color changing scheme as the veil, however, during games they are lit up red, in sequential order, to denote the current inning.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/90324237.html Visuals big part of trip to Target Field] ''[[Star Tribune]]''</ref>  In this plaza are statues of former players [[Kirby Puckett]], [[Rod Carew]], [[Kent Hrbek]] and [[Harmon Killebrew]], as well as former owners [[Calvin Griffith]], [[Carl Pohlad]] and his wife, Eloise Pohlad and Twins mascot TC Bear.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carew Supports Griffith Statue Being Placed Near His Target Field Gate|first=Paul|last=Walsh|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/101657538.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA large \"Golden Glove\" sits in the plaza in recognition of all Twins players to win the Gold Glove Award.  The statue can be sat on and is a popular photo attraction.  It is located exactly {{convert|520|ft|m}} from home plate, the distance of Harmon Killebrew's longest home run at Met Stadium (although his was hit into the left field upper deck).\n\nThere is also a monument that shows all the venues that Minnesota-based baseball teams played in. On the rails of the pedestrian skybridge are pennants that contain the rosters of all the Twins teams, and pennants of players, coaches, front office people, and other contributors who have been elected to the Twins Hall of Fame.\n\n===The field===\nThe main flagpoles are in right field near the Plaza.  The largest pole, which flies the Stars and Stripes, is the original pole used at [[Metropolitan Stadium]].  It was relocated to the Richfield Legion Post 435 after the Met was demolished, and, after being cut in half and refurbished, was re-installed for baseball at Target Field.  The first flags\u2014both US and POW/MIA\u2014donated by Post 435 were raised at the first Twins exhibition game by veteran and flagpole historian B.W. McEvers of Bloomington. On September 6, [[Jim Thome]] hit a solo home run against the [[Kansas City Royals]] that hit the flag pole.\n\nThe championship banners fly on small flagpoles located on the upper rim of the stadium beyond left field.  Each pole recognizes each division, league, and world championship since the team's arrival in {{mlby|1961}}.  On the stadium's upper rim in right-center field are small flagpoles that fly the flag for all the teams (including the Twins) in the division.  The order that the flags fly are determined by the divisional standings.\n\nHome plate is the same one used at the Metrodome.  After the Twins' final dome game (Game 3 of the [[2009 American League Division Series|2009 ALDS]]), the plate was dug up and later installed at Target Field. In addition, several handfuls of dirt were taken from the sliding pit and pitcher's mound areas from the Metrodome and scattered near their counterparts at Target Field.\n\n===Twins bars and restaurants===\nAt Target Field, there are four prominent bars and restaurants:\n\n*The Town Ball Tavern is located on the upper concourse by the left field corner, and is famous for serving the [[Jucy Lucy]] burger. The wood flooring is the same used on the basketball court at the [[Minneapolis Armory]] during the NBA [[Minneapolis Lakers]] stay, before leaving for Los Angeles.\n*Hrbek's is located on the main concourse behind home plate, and is named after former Twins [[first baseman]] [[Kent Hrbek]].\n*There are two bars located on the upper concourse behind home plate, collectively called the Two Gingers Pubs. In one of these bars, fans can watch the Target Field organist, Sue Nelson, perform during games. Out of these three bars and restaurants, the Two Gingers Pub (formerly known as the Twins Pub) is the only one that does not serve food, however it is the only one in which the field is visible from inside.\n*The former Metropolitan Club (reserved for season ticket holders) was renovated prior to the 2019 season as restaurant Bat & Barrel, along with expansion of Target Plaza by moving Gate 34 further toward 1st Ave.\n\nConcessions throughout also include several Minnesota favorites like walleye, wild rice soup, Kramarczuk's sausages, as well as a \"State Fair Foods\" stand where many items are served \"on a stick\", such as the J.D. Hoyt's pork chop.\n\nIn 2018, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] declared Target Field number one on its annual list of [[vegan]]-friendly ballparks, thanks to the availability of foods like tofu vindaloo, vegan Sriracha Brats and Italian Sausages, [[Daiya]] cheese pizza, and Field Roast burgers and dogs.<ref>Kevin Reichard, \"Target Field Leads List of Vegan-Friendly Ballparks,\" [https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/06/04/target-field-leads-list-of-vegan-friendly-ballparks/ BallparkDigest.com], 4 June 2018.</ref>\n\n===Minnie and Paul logo===\n[[File:Minnie and Paul.jpg|thumb|right|300px.|Minnie and Paul, representing the Twin Cities, is the logo for the Minnesota Twins.]]\nA large version of the Twins' original \"Minnie and Paul\" logo (designed by local artist, Ray Barton <ref>{{cite web |title=Ray Barton obituary|url=http://www.harrisfam.org/rootspersona-tree-2/ray-alphonzo-barton/|work=Harris family genealogy site|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>) stands in center field.  It shows two players wearing the uniforms of the two minor-league teams that played in the Twin Cities before the Twins' arrival, the [[Minneapolis Millers]] and [[St. Paul Saints (1901\u201360)|St. Paul Saints]], shaking hands across the [[Mississippi River]].  During various points in the game, the strobe lights surrounding the logo flash. This sign was a concept designed and illustrated by RipBang Studios but built by others.\n\nWhen the Twins score a run by any means other than a home run, the strobe lights trace the border from the bottom-left corner for each Twins player that crosses home plate, symbolizing that a Twins player rounded the bases. For each strikeout, the corners of the sign flash to portray the strike zone. The strobe lights will flash at the end of the top of an inning if the Twins do not surrender a run during the inning. After a Twins home run, the strobe lights flash, Minnie and Paul shake hands, and the Mississippi River flows. After a Twins victory, the \"T\" and \"s\" in \"Twins\" will blink to show the message \"Twins win\" in addition to the animation shown following a Twins home run.\n\n==METRO and commuter rail connections==\nThe stadium is well-connected to the city's transit network, being immediately adjacent to the \"A\" and \"B\" [[parking ramp]]s of the large ABC Ramps complex at the end of [[Interstate 394]], which include two major transit bus terminals and link to the rest of downtown Minneapolis via [[skyway]].  Over 8,000 people typically arrive to each game via the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] and [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]], both of which terminate at [[Target Field (Metro Transit station)|Target Field Station]], just 10 yards from the park's Gate 6. For fans arriving from the northwest suburbs, the [[Northstar Line]] commuter rail terminates in downtown Minneapolis with a station underneath the ballpark.\n\n==Park firsts==\nThe first \"soft event\" at Target Field was an open house held for season ticket holders on March 20 and 21, 2010.[[File:First Pitch at Target Field.jpg|thumb|First Pitch at Target Field, thrown by Jordan, Minnesota native T.J.

{"title_page": "Home mortgage interest deduction", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Taxation}}\nA '''home mortgage interest deduction''' allows taxpayers who [[Owner-occupier|own their homes]] to reduce their [[taxable income]] <ref>http://www.articlesxpert.com/article/1260369/the-multiple-benefits-of-home-loan-tax-exemption/</ref> by the amount of [[interest]] paid on the [[loan]] which is secured by their principal residence (or, sometimes, a [[Vacation property|second home]]).  Most [[Developed country|developed countries]] do not allow a deduction for interest on personal loans, so countries that allow a home mortgage interest deduction have created an exception to those rules. The [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]] each allow the deduction. In [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], and [[Ireland]], only a minor part of mortgage interest is deductible.\n\n== Status in countries ==\n\n=== Canada ===\nCanadian federal income tax does not allow a deduction from taxable income for interest on loans secured by the taxpayer's personal residence, but homes used in businesses as a landlord who owns a rental residential property can deduct interest as any other reasonable business expense. The difference being the deduction is allowed only when the property is not used for the taxpayer's personal use but is used as in any other type of business.<ref>https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tax-resources/tax-deductions/is-interest-deductible.jsp</ref> However, there may be additional exclusions for [[passive activity]] losses.\n\nAn indirect method, known as the Smith Manoeuvre, for making interest on mortgage for personal residence tax deductible in Canada is through an asset swap, whereby the homebuyer sells his existing investments, purchases a house in full or in part by the sale, gets a mortgage on the house, and finally, buys back his investments with the money from the mortgage.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/mortgages-and-rates/the-smith-maneuver-a-canadian-mortgage-tax-deductible-plan/article12059456/</ref> The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled in 2001 in the Singleton v.

In 1987 it was 73%. In 1993 it was 50% and in 1998 it was 46%. From 1998 to 2001 it was reduced to 32%. It is the plan that in 2019 it will be 25,5%.\n\n=== France ===\nFrance does not allow a home mortgage interest deduction. In 2007, newly elected President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] proposed creating the deduction as part of his legislative plan for sparking the French economy.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a9OlqDLbD9sU&refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Sarkozy Defeats Royal in French Presidential Runoff (Update5) | date=6 May 2007}}</ref> In August 2007, the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], the highest court in France, struck down the mortgage interest deduction as unconstitutionally creating a tax advantage that goes far beyond its stated goal of encouraging non-homeowners to buy homes. The Court noted that the deduction would apply to people who already own homes.<ref>http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2007/2007555/2007555dc.htm (French)</ref>\n\n=== India ===\nHome loan interest portion is deductible (under section 24(b)) up to 150 000 rupees in a tax year for acquiring or constructing a property. The deduction is available only when the construction is complete or you have possession of the property. Interest of pre-construction period is deductible in five equal installments. The first installment is deductible in the year in which construction of property is completed or property acquired. The principal is deductible under section 80C, which has a limit of 150 000 rupees.<ref>''[https://www.easyfinance.com/community/the-multiple-benefits-of-home-loan-tax-exemption/]'', Benefits of Home Loan Tax Exemption</ref><ref>http://mytaxes.in/index.php?topic=9.0 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127140317/http://mytaxes.in/index.php?topic=9.0 |date=27 November 2010 }} Home Loan Deduction</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nIn the Netherlands, a part of the interest payments can be deducted for a maximum period of 30 years.

For example, taxpayers are allowed an exclusion of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of real property if the owner used it as primary residence for two of the five years before the date of sale.  Economists have demonstrated that high-cost high-income areas receive most of the tax benefit.  For example, [[San Francisco, California]] receives $26,385 per home while [[El Paso, Texas]] receives $2,153 per home, a 1,225% difference.<ref>See Table 4 in {{cite journal |first=Todd |last=Sinai |first2=Joseph |last2=Gyourko |year=2004 |title=The (Un)changing Geographical Distribution of Housing Tax Benefits: 1980\u20132000 |journal=Tax Policy and the Economy |volume=18 |pages=175\u2013208 |doi=10.1086/tpe.18.20061889 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&context=real-estate_papers }}</ref> The five highest income metros receive 87% of tax inflows, with over half going into California alone.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gyourko |first=Joseph |first2=Todd |last2=Sinai |title=The Spatial Distribution of Housing\u2010Related Ordinary Income Tax Benefits |journal=Real Estate Economics |volume=31 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=527\u2013575 |doi=10.1046/j.1080-8620.2003.00076.x |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/real-estate_papers/44 }}</ref>\n\n== Opinions about the deduction ==\nThe [[National Association of Realtors]] strongly opposes eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, claiming, \"Housing is the engine that drives the economy, and to even mention reducing the tax benefits of home ownership could endanger property values.

It is made by [[Blending (alcohol production)|blending]] young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, which is bottled for a second [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable [[sugar]]s, which allow a second fermentation to occur. \n\nSince gueuze is made by blending lambics, it tastes different from traditional [[ale]] and [[lager]] style beers.  Because aged [[hops]] are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma that can be found in most other styles of beer.  Furthermore, the wild [[yeast]]s that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, [[cider]]-like, musty, sour, [[acetic acid]], [[lactic acid]] taste. Many describe the taste as sour and \"barnyard-like\". \n\nIn modern times, some brewers have added sweeteners such as [[aspartame]] to their gueuzes to sweeten them, trying to make the beer more appealing to a wider audience. The original, unsweetened version is often referred to as \"Oude Gueuze\" (\"Old Gueuze\") and became more popular in the early 2000s. Tim Webb, a British writer on Belgian and other beers, comments on the correct use of the term \"'Oude gueuze' or 'oude geuze', now legally defined and referring to a drink made by blending two or more 100% lambic beer.\"<ref>Webb, 2010, p.19</ref>\n\nTraditionally, gueuze is served in [[Wine bottle|champagne bottles]], which hold either {{convert|375|ml|USoz|}} or {{convert|750|ml|USoz|}}. Traditionally, gueuze, and the lambics from which it is made, has been produced in the area known as [[Pajottenland]] and in Brussels. However, some non-Pajottenland/Brussels lambic brewers have sprung up and one or two also produce gueuze -- see table below. Gueuze (both 'Oude' and others) qualified for the European Union's designation 'TSG' (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) in 1997/98 -- see [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU)]].<ref>Webb, 2010, p.15</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThere is some debate on where the word gueuze originated. One theory is that it originated from ''Geysa'' (geyser), [[Old Norse]] for ''gush'', as, during times of vigorous fermentation, Gueuze will spew out of the bunghole of its enclosing oak barrel.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe most likely theory says that the name stems from the 'Geuzenstraat' ([[Geuzen]] Street) in Brussels where a lambic brewery was established. The story{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} is that when the French under Napoleon occupied Belgium and thus Brussels, a lot of [[Champagne]] was drunk in Brussels. Champagne was something rather new in Brussels in those days and had become a real hype. This beverage came in strong glass bottles (most beer at the time was supplied in barrels). One brewer, situated in the Geuzenstraat, had the idea to collect the empty Champagne bottles and to refill them with what was called [[lambic]] beer. He added a bit of sugar for a second fermentation and re-sealed the bottles with a cork which was similar to the Champagne cork. By doing so, he hoped to benefit a bit from the Champagne hype. The new beer was a success and soon obtained the name \"from the Geuzenstraat\" or gueuze. The bigger gueuze bottles are still very similar to sparkling wines bottles today.\n\n==M\u00e9thode Traditionnelle==\nSome American [[craft breweries]] have begun blending young and old [[sour beer]]s, to produce their own versions of the traditional gueuze.<ref>{{cite news|last=Borchelt|first=Nathan|title=The Bruery Rueuze Review|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/11/the-bruery-rueuze-review.html|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=Paste Magazine|date=29 November 2013}}</ref> In 2016 [[Jester King Brewery]] released a blended, spontaneously fermented beer which it labelled as \"M\u00e9thode Gueuze.\" However, ''the High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers ([[HORAL]])'' objected to the name, and the two parties arranged a meeting in Belgium. It was agreed that the American brewers would use the designation \"M\u00e9thode Traditionelle\" as a style name.<ref>[https://www.foodandwine.com/articles/belgian-brewers-object-methode-gueuze-name-american-beers Food & Wine.

It is made by [[Blending (alcohol production)|blending]] young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, which is bottled for a second [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable [[sugar]]s, which allow a second fermentation to occur. \n\nSince gueuze is made by blending lambics, it tastes different from traditional [[ale]] and [[lager]] style beers.  Because aged [[hops]] are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma that can be found in most other styles of beer.  Furthermore, the wild [[yeast]]s that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, [[cider]]-like, musty, sour, [[acetic acid]], [[lactic acid]] taste. Many describe the taste as sour and \"barnyard-like\". \n\nIn modern times, some brewers have added sweeteners such as [[aspartame]] to their gueuzes to sweeten them, trying to make the beer more appealing to a wider audience. The original, unsweetened version is often referred to as \"Oude Gueuze\" (\"Old Gueuze\") and has become more popular in the early 2000s. Tim Webb, a British writer on Belgian and other beers, comments on the correct use of the term \"'Oude gueuze' or 'oude geuze', now legally defined and referring to a drink made by blending two or more 100% lambic beer.\"<ref>Webb, 2010, p.19</ref>\n\nTraditionally, gueuze is served in [[Wine bottle|champagne bottles]], which hold either {{convert|375|ml|USoz|}} or {{convert|750|ml|USoz|}}. Traditionally, gueuze, and the lambics from which it is made, has been produced in the area known as [[Pajottenland]] and in Brussels. However, some non-Pajottenland/Brussels lambic brewers have sprung up and one or two also produce gueuze - see table below. Gueuze (both 'Oude' and others) qualified for the European Union's designation 'TSG' (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) in 1997/98 - see [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU)]].<ref>Webb, 2010, p.15</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThere is some debate on where the word gueuze originated. One theory is that it originated from ''Geysa'' (geyser), [[Old Norse]] for ''gush'', as, during times of vigorous fermentation, Gueuze will spew out of the bunghole of its enclosing oak barrel.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe most likely theory says that the name stems from the 'Geuzenstraat' ([[Geuzen]] Street) in Brussels where a lambic brewery was established. The story{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} is that when the French under Napoleon occupied Belgium and thus Brussels, a lot of [[Champagne]] was drunk in Brussels. Champagne was something rather new in Brussels in those days and had become a real hype. This beverage came in strong glass bottles (most beer at the time was supplied in barrels). One brewer, situated in the Geuzenstraat, had the idea to collect the empty Champagne bottles and to refill them with what was called [[lambic]] beer. He added a bit of sugar for a second fermentation and re-sealed the bottles with a cork which was similar to the Champagne cork. By doing so, he hoped to benefit a bit from the Champagne hype. The new beer was a success and soon obtained the name \"from the Geuzenstraat\" or gueuze. The bigger gueuze bottles are still very similar to sparkling wines bottles today.\n\n==M\u00e9thode Traditionnelle==\nSome American [[craft breweries]] have begun blending young and old [[sour beer]]s, to produce their own versions of the traditional gueuze.<ref>{{cite news|last=Borchelt|first=Nathan|title=The Bruery Rueuze Review|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/11/the-bruery-rueuze-review.html|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=Paste Magazine|date=29 November 2013}}</ref> In 2016 [[Jester King Brewery]] released a blended, spontaneously fermented beer which it labelled as \"M\u00e9thode Gueuze.\" However, ''the High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers ([[HORAL]])'' objected to the name, and the two parties arranged a meeting in Belgium. It was agreed that the American brewers would use the designation \"M\u00e9thode Traditionelle\" as a style name.<ref>[https://www.foodandwine.com/articles/belgian-brewers-object-methode-gueuze-name-american-beers Food & Wine.
