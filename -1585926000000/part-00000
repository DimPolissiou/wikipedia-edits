H. Arnold High School) is an American high school located in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and is a part of the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]], the 9th largest United States School System. Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities.\n\n==History==\n\n==== 1940s ====\nWiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt]]. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949\u201350, the school was named '''General H.H. Arnold High School''' after [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] and [[General of the Air Force]] during and immediately after [[World War II]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden <ref>http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp</ref> coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students\u2019 parents involved. \n\n==== 1950s ====\nIn January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra\u00dfe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from [[Rhein Main Air Base]] and the [[Darmstadt]] Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. \n\n==== 1960s / 1970s ====\nBy the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/about.cfm|title=About Our School|last=Communications|first=DoDEA|website=www.dodea.edu|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> \n\n==== 1980s / 1990s ====\nAt the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army [[Military dependent|dependents]], few others were children of [[United States federal civil service|DoD civilians]] or [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Soviet Union]], the [[Cold War]] effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]], Mainz Army Depot, [[Lee Barracks]], and Camp Pieri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Wikipedia%20Articles/Warriors%20newsletterWinter2018.pdf|title=Warrior Gazzette, December 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden High School / Gen.

Arnold High School  Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> In 1995, following the closure of the [[Frankfurt American High School]], Frankfurt-area students were bused to Wiesbaden, bringing enrollment to around 430 students.\n\n==== 2000s ====\nImmediately after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on 9/11]], the school heightened its security, erecting fencing and posting armed US soldiers on its perimeter. The campus has remained behind enhanced [[physical security]] measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005.<ref name=\":4\" />  In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen. H. H. Arnold High School, is still widely used by tens of thousands of alumni, former faculty and community members. The school's post-[[Cold War]] transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army [[Military dependent|dependents]] becoming the school's majority and Air Force [[Military dependent|dependents]] in the minority. This reality led to a change of the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program, which transitioned from Air Force to Army in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/wiesbadens-jrotc-warrior-battalion-pursues-designation-of-distinction/|title=Wiesbaden\u2019s JROTC Warrior Battalion pursues designation of distinction|date=2017-02-01|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/75663/masters_of_drill_wiesbaden_warrior_drill_team_defends_title_farewells_air_force_competition|title=Masters of drill: Wiesbaden Warrior drill team defends title, farewells Air Force competition|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe.     \n\n==== 2010s ====\nBy 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year-old campus had already begun. Demolition began with the iconic space station-like Dependent Youth Activities (DYA) building, who's futuristic profile stood prominently next to the football field. It was a recreational facility that provided a lunchtime hangout and alternative eatery to the cafeteria. From 2011 to 2014, select buildings were eliminated and added, ushering the new gym, a specialized curriculum building, and multi-purpose building.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://wiesbadenhigh.com/WiesbadenWarriors/Newsletters/July2012WarriorNewsletterSample.pdf|title=Wiesbaden Warriors Newsletter, July 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden Warriors Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> By summer of 2017, the three-story main building was completed, making Wiesbaden High School the first 21st century-designed High School in DoDEA-Europe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/dodea-s-first-21st-century-school-gets-kudos-at-official-opening-1.487609|title=DODEA\u2019s first \u201821st-century school\u2019 gets kudos at official opening|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/new-wiesbaden-high-school-opens-aug-28/|title=New Wiesbaden High School opens Aug. 28|date=2017-08-25|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":6\" /> The graduating class of 2018 was the first to graduate using the fully-completed facility.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it. This 'rule' was essential because 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if anyone were to walk on it, his spirit would turn over. If that occurred, it was considered bad luck and the probable cause of losing any football game. During some periods of the school's history, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest, a earned privilege.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/strong-family-base-at-home-important-for-deployed-troops-first-lady-tells-students-1.29799|title=Strong family base at home important for deployed troops, first lady tells students|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>     \n\nThe crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer amidst the early phases of school's construction.<ref name=\":2\" /> It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with [[War bonnet|headdress]] and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School). The entire inlay (with border frame) is approximately 4' x 5'. The crest was carefully removed during the 2010-2017 campus transformation. The crest has been prominently displayed in the school's new facilities since 2017.    \n\n'''Graduating in the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]''' is a special honor for those who earn a diploma from this school. Graduates have had the privilege of celebrating their milestone within the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]' palace-like splendor, a tradition carried almost as long as the school has existed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/22385/wiesbaden_high_graduates_mark_rite_of_passage_in_historic_german_kurhaus|title=Wiesbaden High graduates mark rite of passage in historic German Kurhaus|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187346-d191088-r411696603-Kurhaus-Wiesbaden_Hesse.html|title=High School Graduation Ceremony - Review of Kurhaus, Wiesbaden, Germany|website=Tripadvisor|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/whs-warriors-graduate/|title=WHS Warriors graduate|date=2015-06-17|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/congratulations-whs-class-of-2017/|title=Congratulations WHS Class of 2017!|date=2017-06-15|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>  \n\n'''The homecoming Bonfire''' was an anticipated feature of homecoming weekends, thought to recharge the spirit of the Warriors' teams. The well-attended spectacle made an impression upon author, [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]], who included a description of the event in his 1989 fictional spy novel, ''Maze''.  \n\n'''The school colors''' are royal blue and gold. They were adopted from [[Wiesbaden]]'s city flag when the school was established in 1948. It has been a tradition to wear the colors on Fridays and for special events.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Feeder schools ==\nAukamm Elementary School\n\nHainerberg Elementary School\n\nWiesbaden Middle School\n\n==Notable alumni==\nNumerous distinguished alumni have been enrolled at the school, including:\n\n*[https://www.amazon.com/James-Olson/e/B002BLY3WC/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0 James R.

H. Arnold High School) is an American high school located in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and is a part of the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]], the 9th largest United States School System. Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities.\n\n==History==\n\n==== 1940s ====\nWiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt]]. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949\u201350, the school was named '''General H.H. Arnold High School''' after [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] and [[General of the Air Force]] during and immediately after [[World War II]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden <ref>http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp</ref> coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students\u2019 parents involved. \n\n==== 1950s ====\nIn January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra\u00dfe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from [[Rhein Main Air Base]] and the [[Darmstadt]] Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. \n\n==== 1960s / 1970s ====\nBy the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/about.cfm|title=About Our School|last=Communications|first=DoDEA|website=www.dodea.edu|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> \n\n==== 1980s / 1990s ====\nAt the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army [[Military dependent|dependents]], few others were children of [[United States federal civil service|DoD civilians]] or [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Soviet Union]], the [[Cold War]] effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]], Mainz Army Depot, [[Lee Barracks]], and Camp Pieri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Wikipedia%20Articles/Warriors%20newsletterWinter2018.pdf|title=Warrior Gazzette, December 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden High School / Gen.

Arnold High School  Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> In 1995, following the closure of the [[Frankfurt American High School]], Frankfurt-area students were bused to Wiesbaden, bringing enrollment to around 430 students.\n\n==== 2000s ====\nImmediately after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on 9/11]], the school heightened its security, erecting fencing and posting armed US soldiers on its perimeter. The campus has remained behind enhanced [[physical security]] measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005.<ref name=\":4\" />  In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen. H. H. Arnold High School, is still widely used by tens of thousands of alumni, former faculty and community members. The school's post-[[Cold War]] transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army [[Military dependent|dependents]] becoming the school's majority and Air Force [[Military dependent|dependents]] in the minority. This reality led to a change of the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program, which transitioned from Air Force to Army in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/wiesbadens-jrotc-warrior-battalion-pursues-designation-of-distinction/|title=Wiesbaden\u2019s JROTC Warrior Battalion pursues designation of distinction|date=2017-02-01|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/75663/masters_of_drill_wiesbaden_warrior_drill_team_defends_title_farewells_air_force_competition|title=Masters of drill: Wiesbaden Warrior drill team defends title, farewells Air Force competition|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe.     \n\n==== 2010s ====\nBy 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year-old campus had already begun. Demolition began with the iconic space station-like Dependent Youth Activities (DYA) building, who's futuristic profile stood prominently next to the football field. It was a recreational facility that provided a lunchtime hangout and alternative eatery to the cafeteria. From 2011 to 2014, select buildings were eliminated and added, ushering the new gym, a specialized curriculum building, and multi-purpose building.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://wiesbadenhigh.com/WiesbadenWarriors/Newsletters/July2012WarriorNewsletterSample.pdf|title=Wiesbaden Warriors Newsletter, July 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden Warriors Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> By summer of 2017, the three-story main building was completed, making Wiesbaden High School the first 21st century-designed High School in DoDEA-Europe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/dodea-s-first-21st-century-school-gets-kudos-at-official-opening-1.487609|title=DODEA\u2019s first \u201821st-century school\u2019 gets kudos at official opening|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/new-wiesbaden-high-school-opens-aug-28/|title=New Wiesbaden High School opens Aug. 28|date=2017-08-25|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":6\" /> The graduating class of 2018 was the first to graduate using the fully-completed facility.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it. This 'rule' was essential because 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if anyone were to walk on it, his spirit would turn over. If that occurred, it was considered bad luck and the probable cause of losing any football game. During some periods of the school's history, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest, a earned privilege.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/strong-family-base-at-home-important-for-deployed-troops-first-lady-tells-students-1.29799|title=Strong family base at home important for deployed troops, first lady tells students|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>     \n\nThe crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer amidst the early phases of school's construction.<ref name=\":2\" /> It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with [[War bonnet|headdress]] and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School). The entire inlay (with border frame) is approximately 4' x 5'. The crest was carefully removed during the 2010-2017 campus transformation. The crest has been prominently displayed in the school's new facilities since 2017.    \n\n'''Graduating in the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]''' is a special honor for those who earn a diploma from this school. Graduates have had the privilege of celebrating their milestone within the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]' palace-like splendor, a tradition carried almost as long as the school has existed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/22385/wiesbaden_high_graduates_mark_rite_of_passage_in_historic_german_kurhaus|title=Wiesbaden High graduates mark rite of passage in historic German Kurhaus|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187346-d191088-r411696603-Kurhaus-Wiesbaden_Hesse.html|title=High School Graduation Ceremony - Review of Kurhaus, Wiesbaden, Germany|website=Tripadvisor|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/whs-warriors-graduate/|title=WHS Warriors graduate|date=2015-06-17|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/congratulations-whs-class-of-2017/|title=Congratulations WHS Class of 2017!|date=2017-06-15|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>  \n\n'''The homecoming Bonfire''' was an anticipated feature of homecoming weekends, thought to recharge the spirit of the Warriors' teams. The well-attended spectacle made an impression upon author, [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]], who included a description of the event in his 1989 fictional spy novel, ''Maze''.  \n\n'''The school colors''' are royal blue and gold. They were adopted from [[Wiesbaden]]'s city flag when the school was established in 1948.

Sibalis, who notes a twelfth-century poet's description of the city as full of \"the vice of Sodom\".\nThroughout the Middle Ages however, poor Parisian artisans were regularly convicted and sometimes executed for engaging in [[sodomy]] and other same-sex activities.  Historian Maurice Lever notes that by the eighteenth century,  various subcultures had developed into a  \"homosexual world\" in Paris, \"with its own language, rules, codes, rivalries and clans.\"  There is also historical evidence that lesbian relationships occurred among aristocratic women of that century, as well as lesbian subcultures among the city's prostitutes.<ref name=\"glbtqarchive.com\">http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/paris_S.pdf</ref>\n\nAmong the 17th century male aristocracy, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00f4me]] were known to have relationships with men.

They were allowed to continue on condition that they remain private and discreet.  The booming economic expansion of the [[Belle \u00c9poque]] during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries brought Paris a reputation as the bohemian and erotic capital of the West, which allowed queer cultures in Paris to flourish.  A network of still relatively underground venues for LGBT people emerged, including, salons, bars, cafes and bathhouses, particularly in the [[Montmartre]] and [[Les Halles]].<ref name=\"glbtqarchive.com\"/> Gay men would also meet in the gardens by the Carrousel du Louvre, along the Champs Elys\u00e9es, by the Bourse, and elsewhere.<ref name=\"thelocal.fr\"/>\n\n[[File:Barney, Flanner and Barnes.jpg|thumb|[[Natalie Barney]],(l) pictured here with [[Janet Flanner]] and [[Djuna Barnes]] was one of several lesbians who hosted 20th century artistic salons in Paris]]\n\nLesbians and bisexual women in particular saw increased visibility during this period, both in the public sphere and in representations in art and literature. [[Fin de si\u00e8cle]]  society in Paris included bars, restaurants and cafes frequented and owned by lesbians, such as ''Le Hanneton'' and le ''Rat Mort''.  Private salons in the early 20th century,  like the ones hosted by the American expatriates [[Nathalie Barney]], and [[Gertrude Stein]] drew LGBT and heterosexual artists and writers of the era, including [[Romaine Brooks]], [[Ren\u00e9e Vivien]], [[Colette]], [[Djuna Barnes]], [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]], [[Truman Capote]],  and [[Radclyffe Hall]]. One of Barney's lovers, the courtesan [[Liane de Pougy]], published a best-selling novel based on their romance called l\u2019Idylle Saphique (1901). Many of the more visible lesbians and bisexual women were entertainers and actresses. Some, like the writer [[Colette]] and her lover [[Mathilde de Morny]], performed lesbian theatrical scenes in Paris cabarets that drew outrage and censorship.  Descriptions of lesbian salons, cafes and restaurants were included in tourist guides and journalism of the era, as well as mention of houses of prostitution that were uniquely for lesbians.<ref>Nicole G.

Sibalis, who notes a twelfth-century poet's description of the city as full of \"the vice of Sodom\".\nThroughout the Middle Ages however, poor Parisian artisans were regularly convicted and sometimes executed for engaging in [[sodomy]] and other same-sex activities.  Historian Maurice Lever notes that by the eighteenth century,  various subcultures had developed into a  \"homosexual world\" in Paris, \"with its own language, rules, codes, rivalries and clans.\"  There is also historical evidence that lesbian relationships occurred among aristocratic women of that century, as well as lesbian subcultures among the city's prostitutes.<ref name=\"glbtqarchive.com\">http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/paris_S.pdf</ref>\n\nAmong the 17th century male aristocracy, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00f4me]] were known to have relationships with men.

They were allowed to continue on condition that they remain private and discreet.  The booming economic expansion of the [[Belle \u00c9poque]] during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries brought Paris a reputation as the bohemian and erotic capital of the West, which allowed queer cultures in Paris to flourish.  A network of still relatively underground venues for LGBT people emerged, including, salons, bars, cafes and bathhouses, particularly in the [[Montmartre]] and [[Les Halles]].<ref name=\"glbtqarchive.com\"/> Gay men would also meet in the gardens by the Carrousel du Louvre, along the Champs Elys\u00e9es, by the Bourse, and elsewhere.<ref name=\"thelocal.fr\"/>\n\n[[File:Barney, Flanner and Barnes.jpg|thumb|[[Natalie Barney]],(l) pictured here with [[Janet Flanner]] and [[Djuna Barnes]] was one of several lesbians who hosted 20th century artistic salons in Paris]]\n\nLesbians and bisexual women in particular saw increased visibility during this period, both in the public sphere and in representations in art and literature. [[Fin de si\u00e8cle]]  society in Paris included bars, restaurants and cafes frequented and owned by lesbians, such as ''Le Hanneton'' and le ''Rat Mort''.  Private salons in the early 20th century,  like the ones hosted by the American expatriates [[Nathalie Barney]], and [[Gertrude Stein]] drew LGBT and heterosexual artists and writers of the era, including [[Romaine Brooks]], [[Ren\u00e9e Vivien]], [[Colette]], [[Djuna Barnes]], [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]], [[Truman Capote]],  and [[Radclyffe Hall]]. One of Barney's lovers, the courtesan [[Liane de Pougy]], published a best-selling novel based on their romance called l\u2019Idylle Saphique (1901). Many of the more visible lesbians and bisexual women were entertainers and actresses. Some, like the writer [[Colette]] and her lover [[Mathilde de Morny]], performed lesbian theatrical scenes in Paris cabarets that drew outrage and censorship.  Descriptions of lesbian salons, cafes and restaurants were included in tourist guides and journalism of the era, as well as mention of houses of prostitution that were uniquely for lesbians.<ref>Nicole G.

It is located {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} south west of [[Preston, Lancashire]], in [[Hutton, Lancashire|Hutton]], England. It provides education for boys from the age of 11 to 16 and helps life get 'better', in the [[Sixth Form]], both [[mixed-sex education|boys and girls]]. The school no longer offers [[boarding school|boarding]]. The school is ranked 5th in the league tables in the [[North West England|North-West]] and 2nd place for [[GCE Advanced Level|AS-A2]] results. It was also the ''[[rugby football|Lancashire Rugby School of the Year]]'', for two years running, for 2007 and 2008. Hutton has also achieved [[Ofsted|Specialist Schools Status]] accreditation in [[Mathematics]] and [[Computing]].<ref>[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_providers/full/%28urn%29/119794/ Inspection Reports]</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe [[high school|school]] can trace its [[antecedent (genealogy)|antecedents]] back to 1517, with the school building site being personally approved by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in that year. In 1520, the school was [[confirmed|granted permission]], by William Walton, a former priest of [[Longton, Lancashire|Longton]], to all [[men|boys]] in [[South Ribble|the area]]. It was William's personal investment, to [[income|provide]] for his family and give the local children a [[chantry]]-school to attend.\n\nIn 1545, when William Walton, the co-founder of the chantry had died, Henry VIII, near to death, ordered the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of all chantries]] and the confiscation of their property. The desired building, in Hutton, was, at the time, even though confirmed by Henry VIII, 28 years before, would be [[demolition|demolished]] if it was reported to be still standing. However, the man appointed to supervise the dissolution of the [[Lancashire]] chantries was [[High Sheriff of Lancashire#House of Tudor|Sir Henry Farington]], a former [[investor|benefactor]] of [[St. Andrew|St. Andrews Church]] in Longton. He [[Lie|falsely reported]] that he could find no [[chantry|chantries]] in that part of the county, in order to save the demolition of various buildings in the [[Amounderness|area]].\n\nTo avoid suspicion of using a [[priory|chantry]] for a school, although the [[lie|false statement]] was given, they started to use a small [[cottage]] down School Lane, in [[Longton, Lancashire|Longton]] to educate the local children.\n\nIn 1552, William's nephew Christopher Walton of [[Little Hoole]], used a part of the original endowment to found the [[Grammar School|grammar school]], down School Lane in Longton. According to the [[English law|law]] at the time, a priest must be in charge of a school, traveling [[inspector]]s could have closed it down they saw that a commoner was in charge. Therefore, in 1554, [[Garstang|Ralph Garstang]], priest of St. Andrews Church, was appointed as the [[headmaster|schoolmaster]] of the school.\n\nFor the next few centuries, from 1560 to 1746, it was known as ''Longton Free School''. It was not until 1747 that the roles of [[headmaster|schoolmaster]] and priest were finally disconnected, though many subsequent headmasters were also priests (vide infra). The school was then rebuilt, at [[Hutton, Lancashire|Hutton]] on its present site, built on land that had been a part of William Walton's original [[Conveyancing|grant]].  Henceforth, it became known as Hutton Grammar School (often the ''Free Grammar School'' according to many references) and, by 1891, it had become an [[single-sex school|all-boys]] school. In 1881 there were 22 boarders and 30 day boys, the 1901 census lists 35 boarders, the 1911 census lists 41 boarders. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were 57 boarders in addition to the day boys.<ref> Censuses of Great Britain, 1881, 1901, 1911</ref><ref>School lists, Hutton Grammar School</ref>\n\nThe original building, built around 1750 was extended in the late 19th Century. In the early 20th Century there were further extensions and additional buildings were added. In the 1920s a fine headmaster's house was built by Lt Col Reverend Charles P. Hines. A first floor was added to one extension in 1923, such was the demand for extra space. The indoor swimming pool was added by  1935.<ref>Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, maps, various 1848 to 1938</ref> A large new block was opened in October 1931, consisting of a large assembly hall, 7 classrooms, laboratories and staff facilities, allowing pupil numbers to increase from 121 to 270 boys.<ref>Lancashire Evening Post. 19 October 1931.</ref> This was extended in 1957 with the addition of a larger library, sixth form, chemistry laboratory and classrooms.<ref>The Huttonian, The Magazine of Hutton Grammar School and the Old Huttonian Association. No 37, December 1957. The Guardian Press, Fishergate, Preston, Lancashire, England</ref> This allowed 3 form entry and the number of pupils increased to 450, rising to over 500 by 1961. The original 18th Century school building had to be demolished and rebuilt in 1965. Some of the late 19th and early 20th-century buildings are still in use.\n\nThe School had an established [[House System]] with, by 1957, Breakell-Moss House, Henry Hibbert House, Hines House (to which all boarders belonged), Penwortham House, Rawstorne House and Walton House. The Houses were particularly competitive in inter-house school sports.<ref>The Huttonian, The Magazine of Hutton Grammar School and the Old Huttonian Association. No 37, December 1957. The Guardian Press, Fishergate, Preston, Lancashire, England</ref>\n\nAlthough now a comprehensive, the school to this day still retains its grammar school [[ethos]], enabling it to produce results which are amongst the highest in the area. Sports such as [[Rugby Union|rugby]] and [[cross-country running]] play a serious role at Hutton, with Hutton sometimes defeating local independent schools such as [[Arnold School]], [[Kirkham Grammar School]], [[Rossall School]] and [[Stonyhurst College]].\n\n==List of Headmasters==\n* 1805.

It has a history of well above average [[review|reports]] and has been considered one of the top places for [[boy|local males]] to attend. Since 1989, it has had a huge increase of students coming from inner-city [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and travelling from further afield to attend. This is due to its good reputation, compared to that of other local education services.\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Main School===\nThe main school features students from Years 7 to 11. It combines [[GCSE]]s through the following subjects: [[English Literature|English Language]], [[Mathematics]], [[American English|Modern Language]], Sciences and [[Religious Studies|Religion]], with  additional subjects, including History, [[Geography]], Economics, Art, [[Graphic Design|Design]], Music and [[Theatre|Theatre Arts]].\n\n===Sixth Form===\nThe school's Sixth form allows students to take a number of the following subjects: [[English language|English Language & Literature]], [[English literature|English Literature]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Economics]], [[Business|Business Studies]], [[Information and communication technology|Information Technology]], [[Computing]], [[Religious Studies]], [[Art]], [[Music]],  [[Sports]], [[Mathematics]], [[Psychology]], [[Criminal law|Law]], [[General knowledge|General Studies]], [[Drama]] and [[Dance]].\n\nThe Sixth Form is a [[Logical possibility|key part]] of the school and is a [[quango|quasi-autonomous]] body within Hutton Grammar School.\n\n==Sports==\nThe school offers over 15 different types of sport to take part in. Over the years, the amount of sports has increased dramatically. The main sports at the school are [[rugby union|rugby]] in the winter term and [[cricket]] in the summer term. The following is a list of sports the school offers:\n\nAthletics, Aussie Rules, Badminton, Basketball, [[Chess]], [[Cricket]], [[Cross country running]], Dance, [[Association football|Football]], Gaelic Football, Gymnastics, Handball, [[Hockey]],  [[Rugby Union]], Swimming, Table Tennis, Tennis and  Volleyball.\n\n==Houses==\nHutton consists of five [[House system|houses]], paying respect through names, to the history in the area and to ancient noble families. They include:\n\n* [[Fleetwood baronets|Fleetwood]] \u2013 In 1535, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] saw [[Penwortham Priory]] dissolve. '''Sir Henry Fleetwood''' was one of [[Henry VIII|Henry VIII's]] commissioners, foresees the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] reformation. Fleetwood made sure Hutton Grammar was a fully instated [[Church of England]] school and had a house named after him.\n* [[Hines (surname)|Hines]] \u2013 Named in honour of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Reverend]] '''C.P. Hines'''. He was a headmaster at Hutton from 1920 to 1938, local [[Church of England]] promoter and a [[nobleman]] with strong relations to the early builders of the school.\n* [[Penwortham Priory#Mansion|Rawsthorne]] \u2013 Named in honour of the '''Rawsthorne Family''', who once occupied [[Penwortham Priory]] before it was demolished to make way for new housing in the 1920s. They contributed the money they made from sales of land and their house prior to destruction, to the school and grounds. They rebuilt their house to the road behind where the grammar school stands today.\n* [[Walton (surname)|Walton]] \u2013 Named in honour of '''William Walton''', the co-founder of the school. The coat of arms were adopted by the school in 1905, originally devised by a member of the Walton family from [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], who believed that he was a descendant of the founding family of the school, the three swans were derived from an early medieval coat of arms for the same surname.\n*[[Pearson (surname)|Pearson]] - Named in honour of the previous Head Teacher, '''David Pearson'''. \"I took up the post in April 2005 and the headship at Hutton has been the defining chapter of my career. At that time, the school was ready to enter a new phase in its long history and there have been significant changes in all aspects of the provision over the last ten years. The school has considerable strengths for the next head teacher to build on, and a staff with the creativity to work with a new leader in building the next phase of development.\"- Mr D Pearson\n\n==Facilities==\nUnder headmaster David Pearson the school had been redeveloped, with facilities such as a new [[gym]]nasium and [[Information and communication technology|I.T]] and [[Mathematics|Mathematics suites]] installed in 2004. The [[Music|Music Department]] now has recording studios and [[computer lab|technology suites]].\n\nIn September 2005, new [[mathematics|maths]] facilities were opened. Following the opening of the new maths suites in the Autumn of 2005, the buildings were used for housing of the [[metals|resistant materials]] and art until the end of the academic year of 2006, while the departments were being [[renovation|refurbished]].\n\nThe old buildings were demolished in the months of July and August 2006 and then in July 2006, the new music and drama suites were opened. Following a large interest in the [[Sixth Form]], due to outstanding results, the Sixth Form was relocated to a new building in September 2010.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nHutton has many internal and external [[extracurricular activity|organisations]], one of these being the ''Old Huttonians Association'' which is open to all [[graduates|previous attendees]] of the school. The association organises dinners and [[class reunion|reunions]] on a semi regular basis.\n\nThere is also a well established [[Masonic Lodge]] which meets at the school.

It provides education for boys from the age of 11 to 16 and helps life get 'better', in the [[Sixth Form]], both [[mixed-sex education|boys and girls]]. The school no longer offers [[boarding school|boarding]]. The school is ranked 5th in the league tables in the [[North West England|North-West]] and 2nd place for [[GCE Advanced Level|AS-A2]] results. It was also the ''[[rugby football|Lancashire Rugby School of the Year]]'', for two years running, for 2007 and 2008. Hutton has also achieved [[Ofsted|Specialist Schools Status]] accreditation in [[Mathematics]] and [[Computing]].<ref>[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_providers/full/%28urn%29/119794/ Inspection Reports]</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe [[high school|school]] can trace its [[antecedent (genealogy)|antecedents]] back to 1517, with the school building site being personally approved by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in that year. In 1520, the school was [[confirmed|granted permission]], by William Walton, a former priest of [[Longton, Lancashire|Longton]], to all [[men|boys]] in [[South Ribble|the area]]. It was William's personal investment, to [[income|provide]] for his family and give the local children a [[chantry]]-school to attend.\n\nIn 1545, when William Walton, the co-founder of the chantry had died, Henry VIII, near to death, ordered the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of all chantries]] and the confiscation of their property. The desired building, in Hutton, was, at the time, even though confirmed by Henry VIII, 28 years before, would be [[demolition|demolished]] if it was reported to be still standing. However, the man appointed to supervise the dissolution of the [[Lancashire]] chantries was [[High Sheriff of Lancashire#House of Tudor|Sir Henry Farington]], a former [[investor|benefactor]] of [[St. Andrew|St. Andrews Church]] in Longton. He [[Lie|falsely reported]] that he could find no [[chantry|chantries]] in that part of the county, in order to save the demolition of various buildings in the [[Amounderness|area]].\n\nTo avoid suspicion of using a [[priory|chantry]] for a school, although the [[lie|false statement]] was given, they started to use a small [[cottage]] down School Lane, in [[Longton, Lancashire|Longton]] to educate the local children.\n\nIn 1552, William's nephew Christopher Walton of [[Little Hoole]], used a part of the original endowment to found the [[Grammar School|grammar school]], down School Lane in Longton. According to the [[English law|law]] at the time, a priest must be in charge of a school, traveling [[inspector]]s could have closed it down they saw that a commoner was in charge. Therefore, in 1554, [[Garstang|Ralph Garstang]], priest of St. Andrews Church, was appointed as the [[headmaster|schoolmaster]] of the school.\n\nFor the next few centuries, from 1560 to 1746, it was known as ''Longton Free School''. It wasn't until 1747 that the roles of [[headmaster|schoolmaster]] and priest were finally disconnected, though many subsequent headmasters were also priests (vide infra). The school was then rebuilt, at [[Hutton, Lancashire|Hutton]] on its present site, built on land that had been a part of William Walton's original [[Conveyancing|grant]].  Henceforth, it became known as Hutton Grammar School (often the ''Free Grammar School'' according to many references) and, by 1891, it had become an [[single-sex school|all-boys]] school. In 1881 there were 22 boarders and 30 day boys, the 1901 census lists 35 boarders, the 1911 census lists 41 boarders. In the 1950s and 1960s there were 57 boarders in addition to the day boys.<ref> Censuses of Great Britain, 1881, 1901, 1911</ref><ref>School lists, Hutton Grammar School</ref>\n\nThe original building, built around 1750 was extended in the late 19th Century. In the early 20th Century there were further extensions and additional buildings were added. In the 1920s a fine headmaster's house was built by Lt Col Reverend Charles P. Hines. A first floor was added to one extension in 1923, such was the demand for extra space. The indoor swimming pool was added by  1935.<ref>Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, maps, various 1848 to 1938</ref> A large new block was opened in October 1931, consisting of a large assembly hall, 7 classrooms, laboratories and staff facilities, allowing pupil numbers to increase from 121 to 270 boys.<ref>Lancashire Evening Post. 19 October 1931.</ref> This was extended in 1957 with the addition of a larger library, sixth form, chemistry laboratory and classrooms.<ref>The Huttonian, The Magazine of Hutton Grammar School and the Old Huttonian Association. No 37, December 1957. The Guardian Press, Fishergate, Preston, Lancashire, England</ref> This allowed 3 form entry and the number of pupils increased to 450, rising to over 500 by 1961. The original 18th Century school building had to be demolished and rebuilt in 1965. Some of the late 19th and early 20th Century buldings are still in use.\n\nThe School had an established [[House System]] with, by 1957, Breakell-Moss House, Henry Hibbert House, Hines House (to which all boarders belonged), Penwortham House, Rawstorne House and Walton House. The Houses were particularly competitive in inter-house school sports.<ref>The Huttonian, The Magazine of Hutton Grammar School and the Old Huttonian Association. No 37, December 1957. The Guardian Press, Fishergate, Preston, Lancashire, England</ref>\n\nAlthough now a comprehensive, the school to this day still retains its grammar school [[ethos]], enabling it to produce results which are amongst the highest in the area. Sports such as [[Rugby Union|rugby]] and [[cross-country running]] play a serious role at Hutton, with Hutton sometimes defeating local independent schools such as [[Arnold School]], [[Kirkham Grammar School]], [[Rossall School]] and [[Stonyhurst College]].\n\n==List of Headmasters==\n* 1805.

It has a history of well above average [[review|reports]] and has been considered one of the top places for [[boy|local males]] to attend. Since 1989, it has had a huge increase of students coming from inner-city [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and travelling from further afield to attend. This is due to its good reputation, compared to that of other local education services.\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Main School===\nThe main school features students from Years 7 to 11. It combines [[GCSE]]s through the following subjects: [[English Literature|English Language]], [[Mathematics]], [[American English|Modern Language]], Sciences and [[Religious Studies|Religion]], with  additional subjects, including History, [[Geography]], Economics, Art, [[Graphic Design|Design]], Music and [[Theatre|Theatre Arts]].\n\n===Sixth Form===\nThe school's Sixth form allows students to take a number of the following subjects: [[English language|English Language & Literature]], [[English literature|English Literature]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Economics]], [[Business|Business Studies]], [[Information and communication technology|Information Technology]], [[Computing]], [[Religious Studies]], [[Art]], [[Music]],  [[Sports]], [[Mathematics]], [[Psychology]], [[Criminal law|Law]], [[General knowledge|General Studies]], [[Drama]] and [[Dance]].\n\nThe Sixth Form is a [[Logical possibility|key part]] of the school and is a [[quango|quasi-autonomous]] body within Hutton Grammar School.\n\n==Sports==\nThe school offers over 15 different types of sport to take part in. Over the years, the amount of sports has increased dramatically. The main sports at the school are [[rugby union|rugby]] in the winter term and [[cricket]] in the summer term.

They include:\n\n* [[Fleetwood baronets|Fleetwood]] \u2013 In 1535, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] saw [[Penwortham Priory]] dissolve. '''Sir Henry Fleetwood''' was one of [[Henry VIII|Henry VIII's]] commissioners, foresees the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] reformation. Fleetwood made sure Hutton Grammar was a fully instated [[Church of England]] school and had a house named after him.\n* [[Hines (surname)|Hines]] \u2013 Named in honour of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Reverend]] '''C.P. Hines'''. He was a headmaster at Hutton from 1920 to 1938, local [[Church of England]] promoter and a [[nobleman]] with strong relations to the early builders of the school.\n* [[Penwortham Priory#Mansion|Rawsthorne]] \u2013 Named in honour of the '''Rawsthorne Family''', who once occupied [[Penwortham Priory]] before it was demolished to make way for new housing in the 1920s. They contributed the money they made from sales of land and their house prior to destruction, to the school and grounds. They rebuilt their house to the road behind where the grammar school stands today.\n* [[Walton (surname)|Walton]] \u2013 Named in honour of '''William Walton''', the co-founder of the school. The coat of arms were adopted by the school in 1905, originally devised by a member of the Walton family from [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], who believed that he was a descendant of the founding family of the school, the three swans were derived from an early medieval coat of arms for the same surname.\n*[[Pearson (surname)|Pearson]] - Named in honour of the previous Head Teacher, '''David Pearson'''. \"I took up the post in April 2005 and the headship at Hutton has been the defining chapter of my career. At that time, the school was ready to enter a new phase in its long history and there have been significant changes in all aspects of the provision over the last ten years. The school has considerable strengths for the next head teacher to build on, and a staff with the creativity to work with a new leader in building the next phase of development.\"- Mr D Pearson\n\n==Facilities==\nUnder headmaster David Pearson the school had been redeveloped, with facilities such as a new [[gym]]nasium and [[Information and communication technology|I.T]] and [[Mathematics|Mathematics suites]] installed in 2004. The [[Music|Music Department]] now has recording studios and [[computer lab|technology suites]].\n\nIn September 2005, new [[mathematics|maths]] facilities were opened. Following the opening of the new maths suites in the Autumn of 2005, the buildings were used for housing of the [[metals|resistant materials]] and art until the end of the academic year of 2006, while the departments were being [[renovation|refurbished]].\n\nThe old buildings were demolished in the months of July and August 2006 and then in July 2006, the new music and drama suites were opened. Following a large interest in the [[Sixth Form]], due to outstanding results, the Sixth Form was relocated to a new building in September 2010.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nHutton has many internal and external [[extracurricular activity|organisations]], one of these being the ''Old Huttonians Association'' which is open to all [[graduates|previous attendees]] of the school. The association organises dinners and [[class reunion|reunions]] on a semi regular basis.\n\nThere is also a well established [[Masonic Lodge]] which meets at the school. ''Old Huttonian Lodge'' [[Freemasonry|no. 7614]] is part of the ''Leyland Group of Lodges and Chapters'' and meets 5 times a year.
