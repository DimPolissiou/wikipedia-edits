This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=keegan48-49>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already unravelling in what was known as \"the [[powder keg of Europe]]\".<ref name=keegan48-49 />\n[[File:TelegramWW1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Austro-Hungarian government's declaration of war in a telegram sent to the government of Serbia on 28 July 1914, signed by Imperial Foreign Minister [[Count Leopold Berchtold]].]]\nIn 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], and [[Montenegro]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire by creating an independent [[Principality of Albania]] and enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of its Macedonian region to those countries, and additionally the [[Southern Dobruja]] region to Romania and Adrianople (the present-day city of [[Edirne]]) to Turkey in the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], which further destabilized the region.<ref name=Willmott22-23>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=2\u201323}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] student and member of a multi-ethnic organisation of national revolutionaries called [[Young Bosnia]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia.<ref name=Willmott26>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}</ref>\nThe political objective of the assassination was the independence of the southern Austro-Hungarian provinces mainly populated by Slavs from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, though it also inadvertently triggered a chain of events that embroiled Russia and the major European powers. This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring among Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Austria-Hungary delivered the [[July Ultimatum of 1914|July Ultimatum]] to Serbia, a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable in order to provoke a war with Serbia.<ref name=Willmott27>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}</ref> When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914.\n\nThe dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia escalated into what is now known as World War I, and drew in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], France, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Within a week, Austria-Hungary had to face a war with Russia, Serbia's patron, which had the largest army in the world at the time. The result was that Serbia became a subsidiary front in the massive fight that started to unfold along Austria-Hungary's border with Russia. Serbia had an experienced army, but it was also exhausted from the conflicts of the Balkan Wars and poorly equipped, which led the Austro-Hungarians to believe that it would fall in less than a month. Serbia's strategy was to hold on as long as it could and hope the Russians could defeat the main [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], with or without the help of other allies. Serbia constantly had to worry about its hostile neighbor to the east, [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]], with which it had fought several wars, most recently in the Second Balkan War of 1913.\n\n== Military forces ==\n\n=== Austro-Hungarian ===\n{{also|Alfred Redl}}\nThe standing peacetime Austro-Hungarian army had some 36,000 officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s and 414,000 enlisted personnel. During the mobilization, this number was increased to a total of 3,350,000 men of all ranks. The operational army had over 1,420,000 men, and a further 600,000 were allocated to support and logistic units (train, munition and supply columns, etc.) while the rest \u2013 around 1,350,000 \u2013 were reserve troops available for replacing losses and the formation of new units.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> This vast manpower allowed the Austro-Hungarian army to replace its losses regularly and keep units at their formation strength. According to some sources, during 1914 there were on average 150,000 men per month sent to replace the losses in the field army. During 1915 these numbers rose to 200,000 per month.<ref>http://digi.landesbibliothek.at/viewer/image/AC03568741/1/LOG_0003/\nDie Entwicklung der \u00f6st.-ung.

However, with the beginning of the Russian general mobilization, ''Armeeoberkommando'' (AOK, Austro-Hungarian Supreme Command) decided to move the 2nd Army to [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] to counter Russian forces. Due to the congestion of railroad lines towards Galicia, the 2nd Army could only start its departure on 18 August, which allowed AOK to assign some units of the 2nd Army to take part in operations in Serbia before that date. Eventually, AOK allowed General [[Oskar Potiorek]] to deploy a significant part of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) in fighting against Serbia, which caused a delay of transport of these troops to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]] for more than a week. Furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian defeats suffered during the first invasion of Serbia forced AOK to transfer two divisions from the 2nd Army permanently to Potiorek's force. By 12 August, Austria-Hungary had amassed over 500,000 soldiers on Serbian frontiers, including some 380,000 operational troops. With the departure of the major part of the 2nd Army to the Russian front, this number fell to some 285,000 of operational troops, including garrisons.<ref>http://honsi.org/literature/svejk/dokumenty/oulk/band1.html \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> Apart from land forces, Austria-Hungary also deployed its Danube River flotilla of six monitors and six patrol boats.\n\nMany Austro-Hungarian soldiers were not of good quality.<ref name=Jordan20>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=20}}</ref> About one-quarter of them were illiterate, and most of the conscripts from the empire's subject nationalities did not speak or understand German or Hungarian.

By 30 July, the mobilization was completed and the troops began to be deployed according to the war plan. Deployments were completed by 9 August, when all of the troops had arrived at their designated strategic positions. During mobilization, Serbia raised approximately 450,000 men of three age-defined classes or bans called ''poziv'', which comprised all able-bodied men between 21 and 45 years of age.\n\nThe operational army consisted of 11 and 1/2 infantry (six of 1st and five of the 2nd ban) and 1 cavalry division. Aged men of the 3rd ban were organized in 15 infantry regiments with some 45\u201350,000 men designated for use in rear and line of communications duties, however some of them were by necessity used as part of operational army as well, bringing its strength up to around 250,000 men.<ref>James Lyon, A peasant mob: The Serbian army in the eve of the Great War, JMH 61, 1997, p501</ref> Serbia was in a much more disadvantageous position when compared with Austria-Hungary with regard to human reserves and replacement troops, as its only source of replacements were new recruits reaching the age of military enlistment. Their maximum annual number was theoretically around 60,000, which was insufficient to replace the losses of more than 132,000 sustained during operations from August to December 1914. This shortage of manpower forced the Serbian army to recruit under- and over-aged men to make up for losses in the opening phase of the war.\n\nBecause of the poor financial state of the Serbian economy and losses in the recent Balkan Wars, the Serbian army lacked much of the modern weaponry and equipment necessary to engage in combat with their larger and wealthier adversaries. There were only 180,000 modern rifles available for the operational army, which meant that the Serbian Army lacked between one-quarter to one-third of the rifles necessary to fully equip even their front line units, let alone reserve forces.<ref>James Lyon, p496</ref> Although Serbia tried to remedy this deficit by ordering 120,000 rifles from Russia in 1914, the weapons did not begin to arrive until the second half of August. Only 1st ban troops had complete grey-green M1908 uniforms, 2nd ban troops often wore the obsolete dark blue M1896 issue while the 3rd ban had no proper uniforms at all and were reduced to wearing their civilian clothes with military greatcoats and caps.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Thomas|page=38|title=Armies in the Balkans 1914-18|ISBN=1-84176-194-X}}</ref> The Serbian troops did not have service issued boots at all, and the vast majority of them wore everyday footwear made of pig skin called ''[[opanak]]''.\n\nAmmunition reserves were also insufficient for sustained field operations as most of it had been used in the 1912\u201313 Balkan wars. Artillery ammunition was sparse and only amounted to several hundred shells per unit. Because Serbia lacked a significant domestic military-industrial complex, its army was completely dependent on imports of ammunition and arms from France and Russia, which themselves were chronically short of supplies. The inevitable shortages of ammunition, which later would include a complete lack of artillery ammunition, reached their peak during decisive moments of the Austro-Hungarian invasion.\n\n=== Comparative strength ===\n\nThese figures detail the number of all Austro-Hungarian troops concentrated on the southern (Serbian) theater of war at the beginning of August 1914 and the resources of the entire Serbian army (the number of troops actually available for the operations on both sides was however somewhat less):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

However, since the railroad lines leading to Galicia were busy with transport of other troops, the 2nd Army could only start its departure northward on 18 August. In order to make use of the temporary presence of the 2nd Army, AOK allowed parts of it to be used in the Serbian campaign until that date. Eventually, AOK directed significant parts of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) to assist General [[Oskar Potiorek|Potiorek]]'s main force and postponed their transportation to Russia until the last week of August. Defeats suffered in the first invasion of Serbia eventually forced AOK to transfer two divisions from 2nd Army to Potiorek's army permanently.\n\nThe V and VI Austro-Hungarian Armies had about 270,000 men who were much better equipped than the Serbs. Overall, Austro-Hungarian command was in the hands of General Potiorek. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had the third largest population in Europe in 1914, behind Russia and Germany (almost twelve times the population of the Kingdom of Serbia), giving it an enormous manpower advantage.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1915, the Serbian campaign resulted in crimes against the Muslim population, mostly Albanians. Some people were converted to Eastern Orthodox Church and ethnically cleansed with \"great savagery\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=William W. |first1=Hagen |title=The Balkans' Lethal Nationalisms.

The Second Army was due to be transported to Galicia to face the Russians at the end of August, but he made use of it until then. The Sixth was positioning itself in southern Bosnia and was not yet able to commence offensive operations. Potiorek's desire was to win a victory before Emperor Franz Joseph's birthday and to knock Serbia out as soon as possible. Thus he made two grave strategic errors by attacking with only just over half of his strength and attacking hilly western Serbia instead of the open plains of the north. This move surprised Marshal [[Radomir Putnik|Putnik]], who expected attack from the north and initially believed that it was a feint. Once it became clear that it was the main thrust, the strong Second Army under the command of General [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]] was sent to join the small Third Army under [[Pavle Juri\u0161i\u0107 \u0160turm]] already facing the Austro-Hungarians and expel the invaders. After a fierce four-day battle, the Austro-Hungarians were forced to retreat, marking the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory of the war over the [[Central Powers]] led by Germany and Austria-Hungary. Casualties numbered 23,000 for the Austro-Hungarians (of whom 4,500 were captured) and 16,500 for the Serbs.\n\n=== Battle of Drina ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Drina}}\n[[File:Maxim \u041c.1909 of Serbian Royal Army.jpg|thumb|right|Maxim \u041cG 10 of Serbian Royal Army]]\nUnder pressure from its allies, Serbia conducted a limited offensive across the [[Sava]] river into the Austro-Hungarian region of Syrmia with its [[First Army (Serbia)|Serbian First Army]]. The main operational goal was to delay the transport of the Austro-Hungarian Second Army to the Russian front. The objective was shown to be futile as forces of the Second Army were already in transport. Meanwhile, the Timok division I of the Serbian Second Army suffered a heavy defeat in a diversionary crossing, suffering around 6,000 casualties while inflicting only 2,000.\n\nWith most of his forces in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], Potiorek decided that the best way to stop the Serbian offensive was to launch another invasion into Serbia to force the Serbs to recall their troops to defend their much smaller homeland.\n\n{{Quote box|width=38%|align=left|quote=\"The Serbians, seasoned, war-hardened men, inspired by the fiercest patriotism, the result of generations of torment and struggle, awaited undaunted whatever fate might bestow.\"|source=[[Winston Churchill]], ''The Great War''.<ref name=Jordan25>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\n7 September brought a renewed Austro-Hungarian attack from the west, across the river Drina, this time with both the Fifth Army in [[Ma\u010dva]] and the Sixth further south.<ref name=Jordan31>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=31}}</ref> The initial attack by the Fifth Army was repelled by the Serbian Second Army, with 4,000 Austro-Hungarian casualties, but the stronger Sixth Army managed to surprise the Serbian Third Army and gain a foothold. After some units from the Serbian Second Army were sent to bolster the Third, the Austro-Hungarian Fifth Army also managed to establish a bridgehead with a renewed attack. At that time, Marshal Putnik withdrew the First Army from Syrmia (against much popular opposition) and used it to deliver a fierce counterattack against the Sixth Army that initially went well, but finally bogged down in a bloody four-day fight for a peak of the Jagodnja mountain called Ma\u010dkov Kamen, in which both sides suffered horrendous losses in successive frontal attacks and counterattacks. Two Serbian divisions lost around 11,000 men, while Austro-Hungarian losses were probably comparable.\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered a retreat into the surrounding hills and the front settled into a month and a half of trench warfare, which was highly unfavourable to the Serbs, who had little in the way of an industrial base and were deficient in heavy artillery, ammunition stocks, shell production and footwear, since the vast majority of infantry wore the traditional (though state-issued) [[opanak]]s,<ref name=Jordan20/> while the Austro-Hungarians had waterproof leather boots. Most of their war material was supplied by the Allies, who were short of such materials themselves. In such a situation, Serbian artillery quickly became almost silent, while the Austro-Hungarians steadily increased their fire. Serbian casualties reached 100 soldiers a day from all causes in some divisions.\n\nDuring the first weeks of trench warfare, the Serbian U\u017eice Army (first strengthened division) and the Montenegrin Sanjak Army (roughly a division) conducted an abortive offensive into Bosnia. In addition, both sides conducted a few local attacks, most of which were soundly defeated. In one such attack, the Serbian Army used [[Mining (military)|mine warfare]] for the first time: the Combined Division dug tunnels beneath the Austro-Hungarian trenches (that were only 20\u201330 meters away from the Serbian ones on this sector), planted mines and set them off just before an infantry charge.\n\n=== Battle of Kolubara ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Kolubara}}\n[[File:Battle of Kolubara.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Later Operations in Serbia, 1914]]\nHaving thus weakened the Serbian army, the Austro-Hungarian Army launched another massive attack on 5 November. The Serbs withdrew step by step, offering strong resistance at the [[Kolubara]] River, but to no avail, due to the lack of artillery ammunition. It was at that time that General [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] was made commander of the battered First Army, replacing the wounded Petar Bojovi\u0107. He insisted on a deep withdrawal in order to give the troops some much-needed rest and to shorten the front. Marshal Putnik finally relented, but the consequence was the abandonment of the capital city of Belgrade. After suffering heavy losses, the Austro-Hungarian Army entered the city on 2 December. This action led Potiorek to move the whole Fifth Army into the Belgrade area and use it to crush the Serbian right flank. This, however, left the Sixth alone for a few days to face the whole Serbian army.\n\nAt this point, artillery ammunition finally arrived from France and Greece. In addition, some replacements were sent to the units and Marshal Putnik correctly sensed that the Austro-Hungarian forces were dangerously overstretched and weakened in the previous offensives, so he ordered a full-scale counterattack with the entire Serbian Army on 3 December against the Sixth Army. The Fifth hurried its flanking maneuver, but it was already too late \u2013 with the Sixth Army broken, the Second and Third Serbian Armies overwhelmed the Fifth. Finally, Potiorek lost his nerve and ordered yet another retreat back across the rivers into Austria-Hungary's territory. The Serbian Army recaptured Belgrade on 15 December.\n\nThe first phase of the war against Serbia had ended with no change in the border, but casualties were enormous compared to earlier wars, albeit comparable to other campaigns of World War I. The Serbian army suffered 170,000 men killed, wounded, captured or missing. Austro-Hungarian losses were approaching 215,000 men killed, wounded or missing.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Austro-Hungarian General Potiorek was removed from command and replaced by [[Archduke Eugen of Austria]] (C. Falls p.&nbsp;54). On the Serbian side, a deadly [[typhus]] epidemic killed hundreds of thousands of Serb civilians during the winter. \n\nAfter the Battle of Kolubara, the Serbian Parliament adopted the Ni\u0161 Declaration (7 December 1914) on the war goals of Serbia:\n\"Convinced that the entire Serbian nation is determined to persevere in the holy struggle for the defense of their homesteads and their freedom, the government of the Kingdom (of Serbia) considers that, in these fateful times, its main and only task is to ensure the successful completion of this great warfare which, at the moment when it started, also became a struggle for the liberation and unification of all our unliberated Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian brothers. The great success which is to crown this warfare will make up for the extremely bloody sacrifices which this generation of Serbs is making\". This amounted to announcing Serbia's intention to annex extensive amounts of Austria-Hungary's Balkan provinces.\n\n== 1915 ==\n\n=== Prelude ===\n\n[[File:Nikola Pasic 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, Serbian prime minister in 1915]]\n[[File:Fl\u00fcchtlingstransport Leibnitz - k.k. Innenministerium - 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Refugee Transport from Serbia 1914/15 in [[Leibnitz]], [[Styria]]]]\nEarly in 1915, with Ottoman defeats at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] and in the [[First Suez Offensive]], the German [[Chief of the General Staff (Germany)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] tried to convince the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff, [[Franz Graf Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf|Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], of the importance of conquering Serbia. If Serbia were taken, then the Germans would have a direct rail link from Germany through Austria-Hungary, then down to [[Istanbul]] and beyond. This would allow the Germans to send military supplies and even troops to help the [[Ottoman Empire]]. While this was hardly in Austria-Hungary's interests, the Austro-Hungarians did want to defeat Serbia. However, Russia was the more dangerous enemy, and furthermore, with the entry of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] into the war on the Allied side, the Austro-Hungarians had their hands full (see [[Italian Front (World War I)]]).\n\nBoth the Allies and the Central Powers tried to get Bulgaria to pick a side in the Great War. Bulgaria and Serbia had fought two wars in the last 30 years: the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] in 1885, and the Second Balkan War in 1913. The result was that the Bulgarian government and people felt that Serbia was in possession of lands to which Bulgaria was entitled, and when the Central Powers offered to give them what they claimed, the Bulgarians entered the war on their side. With the Allied loss in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] and the Russian defeat at [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice]], King [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] signed a treaty with Germany and on 23 September 1915, Bulgaria began mobilizing for war.\n\n[[Jevto Dedijer]] stated in 1915 that \u201cthe occupation of Kosovo and Methoija gives Serbia a favourable position in occupying the rest of the Balkans\u201d.<ref>Abdullai Fejuzallhu, \"Albanofobia\", 2019. {{ISBN|9780359952373}} (p. 106)</ref>\n\n=== Opposing forces ===\nDuring the preceding nine months, the Serbs had tried and failed to rebuild their battered armies and improve their supply situation. Despite their efforts, the Serbian Army was only about 30,000 men stronger than at the start of the war (around 225,000) and was still badly equipped. Although Britain and France had talked about sending serious military forces to Serbia, nothing was done until it was too late. When Bulgaria began mobilizing, the French and British sent two divisions, but they arrived late in the [[Greece|Greek]] town of [[Salonika]]. Part of the reason for the delay was the [[National schism]] in Greek politics of the time that generating conflicting views about the war.\n\nAgainst Serbia were marshalled the Bulgarian [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]] commanded by [[Kliment Boyadzhiev]], the German [[11th Army (German Empire)|Eleventh Army]] commanded by [[Max von Gallwitz]] and the Austro-Hungarian [[3rd Army (Austria-Hungary)|Third Army]] commanded by [[Hermann K\u00f6vess von K\u00f6vessh\u00e1za]], all under the control of Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]]. In addition the Bulgarian [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]] commanded by ([[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]), which remained under the direct control of the Bulgarian high command, was deployed against [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\n=== Course of the campaign ===\n{{see also|Great Retreat (Serbian){{!}}Great Retreat}}\nThe Austro-Hungarians and Germans began their attack on 7 October with their troops crossing the Drina and Sava rivers, covered by heavy artillery fire. Once they crossed the Danube, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians moved on Belgrade itself. Vicious street fighting ensued,<ref name=\"Jordan53\">{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=53}}</ref> and the Serbs' resistance in the city was finally crushed on 9 October.<ref name=\"Willmott120\">{{harvnb|Willmott|2008|p=120}}</ref>\n\nThen, on 14 October, the Bulgarian Army attacked from the north of Bulgaria towards [[Ni\u0161]] and from the south towards [[Skopje]] (see map). The Bulgarian First Army defeated the Serbian Second Army at the [[Battle of Morava]], while the Bulgarian Second Army defeated the Serbians at the [[Battle of Ovche Pole]]. With the Bulgarian breakthrough, the Serbian position became untenable; the main army in the north (around Belgrade) could either retreat or be surrounded and forced to surrender. In the [[battle of Kosovo (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]], the Serbs made a last and desperate attempt to join the two incomplete Allied divisions that made a limited advance from the south, but were unable to gather enough forces due to the pressure from the north and east. They were halted by the Bulgarians under General Todorov and had to pull back.\n\n[[File:Serbian retreat WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian Army during its retreat towards Albania]]\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|Great Retreat]], a full retreat south and west through Montenegro and into Albania. The weather was terrible, the roads poor, and the army had to help the tens of thousands of civilians who retreated with them with almost no supplies or food left. But the bad weather and poor roads worked for the refugees as well, as the Central Powers forces could not press them hard enough, so they evaded capture. Many of the fleeing soldiers and civilians did not make it to the coast, though \u2013 they were lost to hunger, disease, and attacks by enemy forces and Albanian tribal bands<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1075\u20136}}</ref>, due to the memory of suppressed rebellions and [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DiNardo |first1=Richard L. |title=Invasion: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915 |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-0093-1 |pages=117-118 |edition=\"The Muslim population of Serbia had been subjekt to all manner of mistreatment oat the hands of the Serbian Orthodox majority during the Balkan Wars.\" |url=https://books.google.se/books?id=6ZeIBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=Serbian+retreat+1915+Albanians&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU9f2JzbzoAhUjxKYKHRz7AqYQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Lieberman |first1=Benjamin |title=Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe |date=2013 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4422-3038-5 |pages=83-84 |edition=\"Driven out of the north and east, the Serb retreat ended up in Kosovo in November 1915.

All told, only some 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reached the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and embarked on Allied transport ships that carried the army to various Greek islands (many to [[Corfu]]) before being sent to Salonika. The evacuation of the Serbian army from Albania was completed on 10 February 1916. The survivors were so weakened that thousands of them died from sheer exhaustion in the weeks after their rescue. Marshal Putnik had to be carried during the whole retreat and he died around fifteen months later in a hospital in France.\n\nThe French and British divisions had marched north from Thessaloniki in October 1915 under the command of French General [[Maurice Sarrail]]. The War Office in London was reluctant to advance too deep into Serbia, so the French divisions advanced on their own up the [[Vardar]] River. This advance gave some limited help to the retreating Serbian Army, as the Bulgarians had to concentrate larger forces on their southern flank to deal with the threat, which led to the [[Battle of Krivolak]] (October\u2013November 1915). By the end of November, General Sarrail had to retreat in the face of massive Bulgarian assaults on his positions. During his retreat, the British at the [[Battle of Kosturino]] were also forced to retreat. By 12 December, all allied forces were back in Greece.\n\n[[File:QG Triplice Macedoine.jpg|thumb|German and Bulgarian commanders in Serbia on 16 November 1915.

The Austrian-Hungarians launched their [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|Montenegrin campaign]] on 5 January 1916 and despite some success of The Montenegrins in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]], they were completely defeated within 2 weeks.\n\nThis was a nearly complete victory for the Central Powers at a cost of around 67,000 casualties as compared to around 94,000 Serbs killed or wounded and 174,000 captured, of which 70,000 were wounded.{{sfn|DiNardo|2015|p=122}} The railroad from Berlin to Istanbul was finally opened. The only flaw in the victory was that much of the Serbian Army had successfully retreated, although it was left very disorganized and required rebuilding.\n\n== 1916\u20131918 ==\n{{Main article|Macedonian Front|Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)}}\nThe Serbian army was evacuated to Greece and joined up with the [[Allied Army of the Orient]]. They then fought a trench war against the Bulgarians on the Macedonia Front. The Macedonian Front in the beginning was mostly static. French and Serbian forces re-took limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 as a result of the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilization of the front.\n\nFrench and Serbian troops finally made a breakthrough in the [[Vardar Offensive]] in 1918, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. This breakthrough was significant in defeating Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary, which led to the final victory of World War I. After the Allied breakthrough, Bulgaria capitulated on 29 September 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}</ref> Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and insisted on an immediate peace settlement during a meeting with government officials a day after the Bulgarian collapse.<ref name=\"Doughty\">{{cite book|author=Robert A.

They pushed forward in September 1918, forced Bulgaria to leave the war and eventually managed to liberate Serbia two weeks before the end of World War I.\n\n== End of the War ==\nThe ramifications of the war were manifold. When World War I ended, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] awarded [[Western Thrace]] to Greece, whereas Serbia received some minor territorial concessions from Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary was broken apart, and Hungary lost much land to both Yugoslavia and Romania in the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Serbia assumed the leading position in the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], joined by its old ally, [[Montenegro]]. Meanwhile, Italy established a quasi-protectorate over Albania and Greece re-occupied Albania's southern part, which was autonomous under a local Greek provisional government (see [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]), despite Albania's neutrality during the war.\n\n== Casualties ==\n[[File:WorldWarI-MilitaryDeaths-EntentePowers-Piechart.svg|thumb|left|The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] casualties]]\n\nBefore the war, the Kingdom of Serbia had 4,500,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWinSerbia.htm|title=Serbia in 1914|publisher=}}</ref> According to the [[New York Times]], 150,000 people are estimated to have died in 1915 alone during the worst [[typhus|typhus epidemic]] in world history.

This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=keegan48-49>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already unravelling in what was known as \"the [[powder keg of Europe]]\".<ref name=keegan48-49 />\n[[File:TelegramWW1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Austro-Hungarian government's declaration of war in a telegram sent to the government of Serbia on 28 July 1914, signed by Imperial Foreign Minister [[Count Leopold Berchtold]].]]\nIn 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], and [[Montenegro]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire by creating an independent [[Principality of Albania]] and enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of its Macedonian region to those countries, and additionally the [[Southern Dobruja]] region to Romania and Adrianople (the present-day city of [[Edirne]]) to Turkey in the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], which further destabilized the region.<ref name=Willmott22-23>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=2\u201323}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] student and member of a multi-ethnic organisation of national revolutionaries called [[Young Bosnia]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia.<ref name=Willmott26>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}</ref>\nThe political objective of the assassination was the independence of the southern Austro-Hungarian provinces mainly populated by Slavs from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, though it also inadvertently triggered a chain of events that embroiled Russia and the major European powers. This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring among Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Austria-Hungary delivered the [[July Ultimatum of 1914|July Ultimatum]] to Serbia, a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable in order to provoke a war with Serbia.<ref name=Willmott27>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}</ref> When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914.\n\nThe dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia escalated into what is now known as World War I, and drew in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], France, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Within a week, Austria-Hungary had to face a war with Russia, Serbia's patron, which had the largest army in the world at the time. The result was that Serbia became a subsidiary front in the massive fight that started to unfold along Austria-Hungary's border with Russia. Serbia had an experienced army, but it was also exhausted from the conflicts of the Balkan Wars and poorly equipped, which led the Austro-Hungarians to believe that it would fall in less than a month. Serbia's strategy was to hold on as long as it could and hope the Russians could defeat the main [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], with or without the help of other allies. Serbia constantly had to worry about its hostile neighbor to the east, [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]], with which it had fought several wars, most recently in the Second Balkan War of 1913.\n\n== Military forces ==\n\n=== Austro-Hungarian ===\n{{also|Alfred Redl}}\nThe standing peacetime Austro-Hungarian army had some 36,000 officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s and 414,000 enlisted personnel. During the mobilization, this number was increased to a total of 3,350,000 men of all ranks. The operational army had over 1,420,000 men, and a further 600,000 were allocated to support and logistic units (train, munition and supply columns, etc.) while the rest \u2013 around 1,350,000 \u2013 were reserve troops available for replacing losses and the formation of new units.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> This vast manpower allowed the Austro-Hungarian army to replace its losses regularly and keep units at their formation strength. According to some sources, during 1914 there were on average 150,000 men per month sent to replace the losses in the field army. During 1915 these numbers rose to 200,000 per month.<ref>http://digi.landesbibliothek.at/viewer/image/AC03568741/1/LOG_0003/\nDie Entwicklung der \u00f6st.-ung.

However, with the beginning of the Russian general mobilization, ''Armeeoberkommando'' (AOK, Austro-Hungarian Supreme Command) decided to move the 2nd Army to [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] to counter Russian forces. Due to the congestion of railroad lines towards Galicia, the 2nd Army could only start its departure on 18 August, which allowed AOK to assign some units of the 2nd Army to take part in operations in Serbia before that date. Eventually, AOK allowed General [[Oskar Potiorek]] to deploy a significant part of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) in fighting against Serbia, which caused a delay of transport of these troops to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]] for more than a week. Furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian defeats suffered during the first invasion of Serbia forced AOK to transfer two divisions from the 2nd Army permanently to Potiorek's force. By 12 August, Austria-Hungary had amassed over 500,000 soldiers on Serbian frontiers, including some 380,000 operational troops. With the departure of the major part of the 2nd Army to the Russian front, this number fell to some 285,000 of operational troops, including garrisons.<ref>http://honsi.org/literature/svejk/dokumenty/oulk/band1.html \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 - 1918, vol. 1, Wienn 1930, p68</ref> Apart from land forces, Austria-Hungary also deployed its Danube River flotilla of six monitors and six patrol boats.\n\nMany Austro-Hungarian soldiers were not of good quality.<ref name=Jordan20>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=20}}</ref> About one-quarter of them were illiterate, and most of the conscripts from the empire's subject nationalities did not speak or understand German or Hungarian.

By 30 July, the mobilization was completed and the troops began to be deployed according to the war plan. Deployments were completed by 9 August, when all of the troops had arrived at their designated strategic positions. During mobilization, Serbia raised approximately 450,000 men of three age-defined classes or bans called ''poziv'', which comprised all able-bodied men between 21 and 45 years of age.\n\nThe operational army consisted of 11 and 1/2 infantry (six of 1st and five of the 2nd ban) and 1 cavalry division. Aged men of the 3rd ban were organized in 15 infantry regiments with some 45-50,000 men designated for use in rear and line of communications duties, however some of them were by necessity used as part of operational army as well, bringing its strength up to around 250,000 men.<ref>James Lyon, A peasant mob: The Serbian army in the eve of the Great War, JMH 61, 1997, p501</ref> Serbia was in a much more disadvantageous position when compared with Austria-Hungary with regard to human reserves and replacement troops, as its only source of replacements were new recruits reaching the age of military enlistment. Their maximum annual number was theoretically around 60,000, which was insufficient to replace the losses of more than 132,000 sustained during operations from August to December 1914. This shortage of manpower forced the Serbian army to recruit under- and over-aged men to make up for losses in the opening phase of the war.\n\nBecause of the poor financial state of the Serbian economy and losses in the recent Balkan Wars, the Serbian army lacked much of the modern weaponry and equipment necessary to engage in combat with their larger and wealthier adversaries. There were only 180,000 modern rifles available for the operational army, which meant that the Serbian Army lacked between one-quarter to one-third of the rifles necessary to fully equip even their front line units, let alone reserve forces.<ref>James Lyon, p496</ref> Although Serbia tried to remedy this deficit by ordering 120,000 rifles from Russia in 1914, the weapons did not begin to arrive until the second half of August. Only 1st ban troops had complete grey-green M1908 uniforms, 2nd ban troops often wore the obsolete dark blue M1896 issue while the 3rd ban had no proper uniforms at all and were reduced to wearing their civilian clothes with military greatcoats and caps.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Thomas|page=38|title=Armies in the Balkans 1914-18|ISBN=1-84176-194-X}}</ref> The Serbian troops did not have service issued boots at all, and the vast majority of them wore everyday footwear made of pig skin called ''[[opanak]]''.\n\nAmmunition reserves were also insufficient for sustained field operations as most of it had been used in the 1912\u201313 Balkan wars. Artillery ammunition was sparse and only amounted to several hundred shells per unit. Because Serbia lacked a significant domestic military-industrial complex, its army was completely dependent on imports of ammunition and arms from France and Russia, which themselves were chronically short of supplies. The inevitable shortages of ammunition, which later would include a complete lack of artillery ammunition, reached their peak during decisive moments of the Austro-Hungarian invasion.\n\n=== Comparative strength ===\n\nThese figures detail the number of all Austro-Hungarian troops concentrated on the southern (Serbian) theater of war at the beginning of August 1914 and the resources of the entire Serbian army (the number of troops actually available for the operations on both sides was however somewhat less):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

However, since the railroad lines leading to Galicia were busy with transport of other troops, the 2nd Army could only start its departure northward on 18 August. In order to make use of the temporary presence of the 2nd Army, AOK allowed parts of it to be used in the Serbian campaign until that date. Eventually, AOK directed significant parts of the 2nd Army (around four divisions) to assist General [[Oskar Potiorek|Potiorek]]'s main force and postponed their transportation to Russia until the last week of August. Defeats suffered in the first invasion of Serbia eventually forced AOK to transfer two divisions from 2nd Army to Potiorek's army permanently.\n\nThe V and VI Austro-Hungarian Armies had about 270,000 men who were much better equipped than the Serbs. Overall, Austro-Hungarian command was in the hands of General Potiorek. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had the third largest population in Europe in 1914, behind Russia and Germany (almost twelve times the population of the Kingdom of Serbia), giving it an enormous manpower advantage.\n\nBetween 1914-1915, the Serbian campaign resulted in crimes against the Muslim population, mostly Albanians.

The Second Army was due to be transported to Galicia to face the Russians at the end of August, but he made use of it until then. The Sixth was positioning itself in southern Bosnia and was not yet able to commence offensive operations. Potiorek's desire was to win a victory before Emperor Franz Joseph's birthday and to knock Serbia out as soon as possible. Thus he made two grave strategic errors by attacking with only just over half of his strength and attacking hilly western Serbia instead of the open plains of the north. This move surprised Marshal [[Radomir Putnik|Putnik]], who expected attack from the north and initially believed that it was a feint. Once it became clear that it was the main thrust, the strong Second Army under the command of General [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]] was sent to join the small Third Army under [[Pavle Juri\u0161i\u0107 \u0160turm]] already facing the Austro-Hungarians and expel the invaders. After a fierce four-day battle, the Austro-Hungarians were forced to retreat, marking the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory of the war over the [[Central Powers]] led by Germany and Austria-Hungary. Casualties numbered 23,000 for the Austro-Hungarians (of whom 4,500 were captured) and 16,500 for the Serbs.\n\n=== Battle of Drina ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Drina}}\n[[File:Maxim \u041c.1909 of Serbian Royal Army.jpg|thumb|right|Maxim \u041cG 10 of Serbian Royal Army]]\nUnder pressure from its allies, Serbia conducted a limited offensive across the [[Sava]] river into the Austro-Hungarian region of Syrmia with its [[First Army (Serbia)|Serbian First Army]]. The main operational goal was to delay the transport of the Austro-Hungarian Second Army to the Russian front. The objective was shown to be futile as forces of the Second Army were already in transport. Meanwhile, the Timok division I of the Serbian Second Army suffered a heavy defeat in a diversionary crossing, suffering around 6,000 casualties while inflicting only 2,000.\n\nWith most of his forces in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], Potiorek decided that the best way to stop the Serbian offensive was to launch another invasion into Serbia to force the Serbs to recall their troops to defend their much smaller homeland.\n\n{{Quote box|width=38%|align=left|quote=\"The Serbians, seasoned, war-hardened men, inspired by the fiercest patriotism, the result of generations of torment and struggle, awaited undaunted whatever fate might bestow.\"|source=[[Winston Churchill]], ''The Great War''.<ref name=Jordan25>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\n7 September brought a renewed Austro-Hungarian attack from the west, across the river Drina, this time with both the Fifth Army in [[Ma\u010dva]] and the Sixth further south.<ref name=Jordan31>{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=31}}</ref> The initial attack by the Fifth Army was repelled by the Serbian Second Army, with 4,000 Austro-Hungarian casualties, but the stronger Sixth Army managed to surprise the Serbian Third Army and gain a foothold. After some units from the Serbian Second Army were sent to bolster the Third, the Austro-Hungarian Fifth Army also managed to establish a bridgehead with a renewed attack. At that time, Marshal Putnik withdrew the First Army from Syrmia (against much popular opposition) and used it to deliver a fierce counterattack against the Sixth Army that initially went well, but finally bogged down in a bloody four-day fight for a peak of the Jagodnja mountain called Ma\u010dkov Kamen, in which both sides suffered horrendous losses in successive frontal attacks and counterattacks. Two Serbian divisions lost around 11,000 men, while Austro-Hungarian losses were probably comparable.\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered a retreat into the surrounding hills and the front settled into a month and a half of trench warfare, which was highly unfavourable to the Serbs, who had little in the way of an industrial base and were deficient in heavy artillery, ammunition stocks, shell production and footwear, since the vast majority of infantry wore the traditional (though state-issued) [[opanak]]s,<ref name=Jordan20/> while the Austro-Hungarians had waterproof leather boots. Most of their war material was supplied by the Allies, who were short of such materials themselves. In such a situation, Serbian artillery quickly became almost silent, while the Austro-Hungarians steadily increased their fire. Serbian casualties reached 100 soldiers a day from all causes in some divisions.\n\nDuring the first weeks of trench warfare, the Serbian U\u017eice Army (first strengthened division) and the Montenegrin Sanjak Army (roughly a division) conducted an abortive offensive into Bosnia. In addition, both sides conducted a few local attacks, most of which were soundly defeated. In one such attack, the Serbian Army used [[Mining (military)|mine warfare]] for the first time: the Combined Division dug tunnels beneath the Austro-Hungarian trenches (that were only 20\u201330 meters away from the Serbian ones on this sector), planted mines and set them off just before an infantry charge.\n\n=== Battle of Kolubara ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Kolubara}}\n[[File:Battle of Kolubara.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Later Operations in Serbia, 1914]]\nHaving thus weakened the Serbian army, the Austro-Hungarian Army launched another massive attack on 5 November. The Serbs withdrew step by step, offering strong resistance at the [[Kolubara]] River, but to no avail, due to the lack of artillery ammunition. It was at that time that General [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] was made commander of the battered First Army, replacing the wounded Petar Bojovi\u0107. He insisted on a deep withdrawal in order to give the troops some much-needed rest and to shorten the front. Marshal Putnik finally relented, but the consequence was the abandonment of the capital city of Belgrade. After suffering heavy losses, the Austro-Hungarian Army entered the city on 2 December. This action led Potiorek to move the whole Fifth Army into the Belgrade area and use it to crush the Serbian right flank. This, however, left the Sixth alone for a few days to face the whole Serbian army.\n\nAt this point, artillery ammunition finally arrived from France and Greece. In addition, some replacements were sent to the units and Marshal Putnik correctly sensed that the Austro-Hungarian forces were dangerously overstretched and weakened in the previous offensives, so he ordered a full-scale counterattack with the entire Serbian Army on 3 December against the Sixth Army. The Fifth hurried its flanking maneuver, but it was already too late \u2013 with the Sixth Army broken, the Second and Third Serbian Armies overwhelmed the Fifth. Finally, Potiorek lost his nerve and ordered yet another retreat back across the rivers into Austria-Hungary's territory. The Serbian Army recaptured Belgrade on 15 December.\n\nThe first phase of the war against Serbia had ended with no change in the border, but casualties were enormous compared to earlier wars, albeit comparable to other campaigns of World War I. The Serbian army suffered 170,000 men killed, wounded, captured or missing. Austro-Hungarian losses were approaching 215,000 men killed, wounded or missing.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Austro-Hungarian General Potiorek was removed from command and replaced by [[Archduke Eugen of Austria]] (C. Falls p.&nbsp;54). On the Serbian side, a deadly [[typhus]] epidemic killed hundreds of thousands of Serb civilians during the winter. \n\nAfter the Battle of Kolubara, the Serbian Parliament adopted the Ni\u0161 Declaration (7 December 1914) on the war goals of Serbia:\n\"Convinced that the entire Serbian nation is determined to persevere in the holy struggle for the defense of their homesteads and their freedom, the government of the Kingdom (of Serbia) considers that, in these fateful times, its main and only task is to ensure the successful completion of this great warfare which, at the moment when it started, also became a struggle for the liberation and unification of all our unliberated Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian brothers. The great success which is to crown this warfare will make up for the extremely bloody sacrifices which this generation of Serbs is making\". This amounted to announcing Serbia's intention to annex extensive amounts of Austria-Hungary's Balkan provinces.\n\n== 1915 ==\n\n=== Prelude ===\n\n[[File:Nikola Pasic 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, Serbian prime minister in 1915]]\n[[File:Fl\u00fcchtlingstransport Leibnitz - k.k. Innenministerium - 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Refugee Transport from Serbia 1914/15 in [[Leibnitz]], [[Styria]]]]\nEarly in 1915, with Ottoman defeats at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] and in the [[First Suez Offensive]], the German [[Chief of the General Staff (Germany)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] tried to convince the Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff, [[Franz Graf Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf|Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], of the importance of conquering Serbia. If Serbia were taken, then the Germans would have a direct rail link from Germany through Austria-Hungary, then down to [[Istanbul]] and beyond. This would allow the Germans to send military supplies and even troops to help the [[Ottoman Empire]]. While this was hardly in Austria-Hungary's interests, the Austro-Hungarians did want to defeat Serbia. However, Russia was the more dangerous enemy, and furthermore, with the entry of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] into the war on the Allied side, the Austro-Hungarians had their hands full (see [[Italian Front (World War I)]]).\n\nBoth the Allies and the Central Powers tried to get Bulgaria to pick a side in the Great War. Bulgaria and Serbia had fought two wars in the last 30 years: the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] in 1885, and the Second Balkan War in 1913. The result was that the Bulgarian government and people felt that Serbia was in possession of lands to which Bulgaria was entitled, and when the Central Powers offered to give them what they claimed, the Bulgarians entered the war on their side. With the Allied loss in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] and the Russian defeat at [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice]], King [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] signed a treaty with Germany and on 23 September 1915, Bulgaria began mobilizing for war.\n\n[[Jevto Dedijer]] stated in 1915 that \u201cthe occupation of Kosovo and Methoija gives Serbia a favourable position in occupying the rest of the Balkans\u201d.<ref>Abdullai Fejuzallhu, \"Albanofobia\", 2019. {{ISBN|9780359952373}} (p. 106)</ref>\n\n=== Opposing forces ===\nDuring the preceding nine months, the Serbs had tried and failed to rebuild their battered armies and improve their supply situation. Despite their efforts, the Serbian Army was only about 30,000 men stronger than at the start of the war (around 225,000) and was still badly equipped. Although Britain and France had talked about sending serious military forces to Serbia, nothing was done until it was too late. When Bulgaria began mobilizing, the French and British sent two divisions, but they arrived late in the [[Greece|Greek]] town of [[Salonika]]. Part of the reason for the delay was the [[National schism]] in Greek politics of the time that generating conflicting views about the war.\n\nAgainst Serbia were marshalled the Bulgarian [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]] commanded by [[Kliment Boyadzhiev]], the German [[11th Army (German Empire)|Eleventh Army]] commanded by [[Max von Gallwitz]] and the Austro-Hungarian [[3rd Army (Austria-Hungary)|Third Army]] commanded by [[Hermann K\u00f6vess von K\u00f6vessh\u00e1za]], all under the control of Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]]. In addition the Bulgarian [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]] commanded by ([[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]), which remained under the direct control of the Bulgarian high command, was deployed against [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\n=== Course of the campaign ===\n{{see also|Great Retreat (Serbian){{!}}Great Retreat}}\nThe Austro-Hungarians and Germans began their attack on 7 October with their troops crossing the Drina and Sava rivers, covered by heavy artillery fire. Once they crossed the Danube, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians moved on Belgrade itself. Vicious street fighting ensued,<ref name=\"Jordan53\">{{harvnb|Jordan|2008|p=53}}</ref> and the Serbs' resistance in the city was finally crushed on 9 October.<ref name=\"Willmott120\">{{harvnb|Willmott|2008|p=120}}</ref>\n\nThen, on 14 October, the Bulgarian Army attacked from the north of Bulgaria towards [[Ni\u0161]] and from the south towards [[Skopje]] (see map). The Bulgarian First Army defeated the Serbian Second Army at the [[Battle of Morava]], while the Bulgarian Second Army defeated the Serbians at the [[Battle of Ovche Pole]]. With the Bulgarian breakthrough, the Serbian position became untenable; the main army in the north (around Belgrade) could either retreat or be surrounded and forced to surrender. In the [[battle of Kosovo (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]], the Serbs made a last and desperate attempt to join the two incomplete Allied divisions that made a limited advance from the south, but were unable to gather enough forces due to the pressure from the north and east. They were halted by the Bulgarians under General Todorov and had to pull back.\n\n[[File:Serbian retreat WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian Army during its retreat towards Albania]]\n\nMarshal Putnik ordered the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|Great Retreat]], a full retreat south and west through Montenegro and into Albania. The weather was terrible, the roads poor, and the army had to help the tens of thousands of civilians who retreated with them with almost no supplies or food left. But the bad weather and poor roads worked for the refugees as well, as the Central Powers forces could not press them hard enough, so they evaded capture. Many of the fleeing soldiers and civilians did not make it to the coast, though \u2013 they were lost to hunger, disease, and attacks by enemy forces and Albanian tribal bands<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1075\u20136}}</ref>, due to the memory of suppressed rebellions and [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DiNardo |first1=Richard L. |title=Invasion: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915 |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-0093-1 |pages=117-118 |edition=\"The Muslim population of Serbia had been subjekt to all manner of mistreatment oat the hands of the Serbian Orthodox majority during the Balkan Wars.\" |url=https://books.google.se/books?id=6ZeIBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=Serbian+retreat+1915+Albanians&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU9f2JzbzoAhUjxKYKHRz7AqYQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Lieberman |first1=Benjamin |title=Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe |date=2013 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4422-3038-5 |pages=83-84 |edition=\"Driven out of the north and east, the Serb retreat ended up in Kosovo in November 1915.

All told, only some 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reached the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and embarked on Allied transport ships that carried the army to various Greek islands (many to [[Corfu]]) before being sent to Salonika. The evacuation of the Serbian army from Albania was completed on 10 February 1916. The survivors were so weakened that thousands of them died from sheer exhaustion in the weeks after their rescue. Marshal Putnik had to be carried during the whole retreat and he died around fifteen months later in a hospital in France.\n\nThe French and British divisions had marched north from Thessaloniki in October 1915 under the command of French General [[Maurice Sarrail]]. The War Office in London was reluctant to advance too deep into Serbia, so the French divisions advanced on their own up the [[Vardar]] River. This advance gave some limited help to the retreating Serbian Army, as the Bulgarians had to concentrate larger forces on their southern flank to deal with the threat, which led to the [[Battle of Krivolak]] (October\u2013November 1915). By the end of November, General Sarrail had to retreat in the face of massive Bulgarian assaults on his positions. During his retreat, the British at the [[Battle of Kosturino]] were also forced to retreat. By 12 December, all allied forces were back in Greece.\n\n[[File:QG Triplice Macedoine.jpg|thumb|German and Bulgarian commanders in Serbia on 16 November 1915.

The Austrian-Hungarians launched their [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|Montenegrin campaign]] on 5 January 1916 and despite some success of The Montenegrins in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]], they were completely defeated within 2 weeks.\n\nThis was a nearly complete victory for the Central Powers at a cost of around 67,000 casualties as compared to around 94,000 Serbs killed or wounded and 174,000 captured, of which 70,000 were wounded.{{sfn|DiNardo|2015|p=122}} The railroad from Berlin to Istanbul was finally opened. The only flaw in the victory was that much of the Serbian Army had successfully retreated, although it was left very disorganized and required rebuilding.\n\n== 1916\u20131918 ==\n{{Main article|Macedonian Front|Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)}}\nThe Serbian army was evacuated to Greece and joined up with the [[Allied Army of the Orient]]. They then fought a trench war against the Bulgarians on the Macedonia Front. The Macedonian Front in the beginning was mostly static. French and Serbian forces re-took limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 as a result of the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilization of the front.\n\nFrench and Serbian troops finally made a breakthrough in the [[Vardar Offensive]] in 1918, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. This breakthrough was significant in defeating Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary, which led to the final victory of World War I. After the Allied breakthrough, Bulgaria capitulated on 29 September 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}</ref> Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and insisted on an immediate peace settlement during a meeting with government officials a day after the Bulgarian collapse.<ref name=\"Doughty\">{{cite book|author=Robert A.

They pushed forward in September 1918, forced Bulgaria to leave the war and eventually managed to liberate Serbia two weeks before the end of World War I.\n\n== End of the War ==\nThe ramifications of the war were manifold. When World War I ended, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] awarded [[Western Thrace]] to Greece, whereas Serbia received some minor territorial concessions from Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary was broken apart, and Hungary lost much land to both Yugoslavia and Romania in the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Serbia assumed the leading position in the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], joined by its old ally, [[Montenegro]]. Meanwhile, Italy established a quasi-protectorate over Albania and Greece re-occupied Albania's southern part, which was autonomous under a local Greek provisional government (see [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]), despite Albania's neutrality during the war.\n\n== Casualties ==\n[[File:WorldWarI-MilitaryDeaths-EntentePowers-Piechart.svg|thumb|left|The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] casualties]]\n\nBefore the war, the Kingdom of Serbia had 4,500,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWinSerbia.htm|title=Serbia in 1914|publisher=}}</ref> According to the [[New York Times]], 150,000 people are estimated to have died in 1915 alone during the worst [[typhus|typhus epidemic]] in world history.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a similarly strong ability with [[The Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only two characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received an overwhelmingly positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has claimed the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same alien species as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly [[arm wrestling]] match.

Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance.<ref name=\"Miller1218\" /> One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past ''Star Wars'' work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Master and Apprentice]]'' (2019), says: \"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in ''The Mandalorian''.<ref name=\"Abdulbaki0106\" /> Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the Dark Side of the Force,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /> or for use as a weapon.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \"You may think you have some idea what you\u2019re in possession of, but you do not.\" Peter Foy of ''Comic Book Resources'' suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" />\n\nCaitlin Gallagher of ''[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]]'' suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.<ref name=\"Milner1222\">{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda Learns About Good & Bad In A Powerful Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 22, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223125659/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> For example, ''Vulture'' writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \"look of wonder\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\".<ref name=\"Phipps1227\" /> Some writers applied a [[nature versus nurture]] argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /><ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a similarly strong ability with [[The Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only two characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received an overwhelmingly positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has claimed the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same alien species as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly [[arm wrestling]] match.

Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance.<ref name=\"Miller1218\" /> One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past ''Star Wars'' work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Master and Apprentice]]'' (2019), says: \"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in ''The Mandalorian''.<ref name=\"Abdulbaki0106\" /> Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the Dark Side of the Force,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /> or for use as a weapon.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \"You may think you have some idea what you\u2019re in possession of, but you do not.\" Peter Foy of ''Comic Book Resources'' suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" />\n\nCaitlin Gallagher of ''[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]]'' suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.<ref name=\"Milner1222\">{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda Learns About Good & Bad In A Powerful Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 22, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223125659/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> For example, ''Vulture'' writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \"look of wonder\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\".<ref name=\"Phipps1227\" /> Some writers applied a [[nature versus nurture]] argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /><ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.

At the age of 16, she lost both her parents and her infant brother in the [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|1878 yellow fever epidemic]]. She went to work and kept the rest of the family together with the help of her grandmother. Later moving with some of her siblings to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], she found better pay as a teacher. Soon, Wells co-owned and wrote for the ''Memphis Free Speech and Headlight'' newspaper. Her reporting covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wells documented [[lynching in the United States]] through her indictment called \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases,\" investigating frequent claims of whites that lynchings were reserved for black criminals only. Wells exposed lynching as a barbaric practice of whites in the South used to intimidate and oppress African Americans who created economic and political competition\u2014and a subsequent threat of loss of power\u2014for whites. A white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses as her investigative reporting was carried nationally in black-owned newspapers.\n\nSubjected to continued threats, Wells left Memphis for [[Chicago]]. She married and had a family, while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women's movement for the rest of her life. Wells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)|civil rights movement]] and the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].

Her paternal grandmother, Peggy Wells, along with other friends and relatives, stayed with her siblings and cared for them during the week while Wells was teaching.\n\nBut when Peggy Wells died from a stroke and her sister Eugenia died, Wells accepted the invitation of her aunt Fanny and moved with her two youngest sisters to Memphis in 1883.\n\n==Early career and anti-segregation activism==\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#F3F0FD|salign=right|It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed ...

The previous year, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled against the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] (which had banned racial discrimination in public accommodations). This verdict supported railroad companies that chose to racially segregate their passengers. When Wells refused to give up her seat, the conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. Wells gained publicity in Memphis when she wrote a newspaper article for ''The Living Way'', a black church weekly, about her treatment on the train.

Black economic progress was a contemporary issue in the South, and in many states whites worked to suppress black progress. In this period at the turn of the century, Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed laws and/or new constitutions to [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise most black people and many poor white people]] through use of [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]] and other devices. Wells-Barnett recommended that black people use arms to defend against lynching.<ref name=\"Southern Horrors\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14975/14975-h/14975-h.htm ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases''.]</ref>\n\nShe followed-up with greater research and detail in ''The Red Record'' (1895), a 100-page pamphlet describing lynching in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. It also covered black peoples' struggles in the South since the Civil War. ''The Red Record'' explored the alarmingly high rates of lynching in the United States (which was at a peak from 1880 to 1930). Wells-Barnett said that during Reconstruction, most Americans outside the South did not realize the growing rate of violence against black people in the South. She believed that during slavery, white people had not committed as many attacks because of the economic labour value of slaves. Wells noted that, since slavery time, \"ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, [through lynching] without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution.\"\n\n[[Frederick Douglass]] had written an article noting three eras of \"Southern barbarism\" and the excuses that whites claimed in each period.\n\nWells-Barnett explored these in detail in her ''The Red Record''.\n* During slavery time, she noted that whites worked to \"repress and stamp out alleged 'race riots{{'\"}} or suspected slave rebellions, usually killing black people in far higher proportions than any white casualties. Once the Civil War ended, white people feared black people, who were in the majority in many areas. White people acted to control them and suppress them by violence.\n* During the [[Reconstruction Era]] white people lynched black people as part of mob efforts to suppress black political activity and re-establish [[white supremacy]] after the war. They feared \"Negro Domination\" through voting and taking office. Wells-Barnett urged black people in high-risk areas to move away to protect their families.\n* She noted that whites frequently claimed that black men had \"to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women\". She noted that white people assumed that any relationship between a white woman and a black man was a result of rape. But, given power relationships, it was much more common for white men to take sexual advantage of poor black women. She stated: \"Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that black men rape white women.\" Wells connected lynching to sexual violence, showing how the myth of the black man's lust for white women led to murder of African-American men.\n\nWells-Barnett gave 14 pages of statistics related to lynching cases committed from 1892 to 1895; she also included pages of graphic accounts detailing specific lynchings. She notes that her data was taken from articles by white correspondents, white press bureaus, and white newspapers. ''The Red Record'' was a huge pamphlet, and had far-reaching influence in the debate about lynching. ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'' and ''The Red Record'''s accounts of these lynchings grabbed the attention of Northerners who knew little about lynching or accepted the common explanation that black men deserved this fate. Generally southern states and white juries refused to indict any perpetrators for lynching, although they were frequently known and sometimes shown in the photographs being made more frequently of such events.\n\nDespite Wells-Barnett's attempt to garner support among white Americans against lynching, she believed that her campaign could not overturn the economic interests whites had in using lynching as an instrument to maintain Southern order and discourage Black economic ventures. Ultimately, Wells-Barnett concluded that appealing to reason and compassion would not succeed in gaining criminalization of lynching by Southern whites.<ref name=\"curry\"/>\n\nWells-Barnett concluded that perhaps armed resistance was the only defense against lynching. Meanwhile, she extended her efforts to gain support of such powerful white nations as Britain to shame and sanction the racist practices of America.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Tommy J.|title=The Fortune of Wells: Ida B.

She and her supporters in America saw these tours as an opportunity for her to reach larger, white audiences with her anti-lynching campaign, something she had been unable to accomplish in America.

Mayo was a well-known writer and poet who wrote under the name of Edward Garrett. Both women had read of the particularly gruesome lynching of Henry Smith in Texas and wanted to organize a speaking tour to call attention to American lynchings. They asked Frederick Douglass to make the trip, but citing his age and health, he declined.

A prominent attorney, Barnett was a civil rights activist and journalist in Chicago. Like Wells, he spoke widely against lynchings and for the civil rights of African Americans. Wells and Barnett had met in 1893, working together on a pamphlet protesting the lack of Black representation at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893. Barnett founded ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the first Black newspaper in Chicago, in 1878. Wells began writing for the paper in 1893, later acquired a partial ownership interest, and after marrying Barnett, assumed the role of editor.\n\nWells' marriage to Barnett was a legal union as well as a partnership of ideas and actions. Both were journalists, and both were established activists with a shared commitment to civil rights. In an interview, Wells' daughter Alfreda said that the two had \"like interests\" and that their journalist careers were \"intertwined.\" This sort of close working relationship between a wife and husband was unusual at the time, as women often played more traditional domestic roles in a marriage.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

In the chapter of her ''Crusade For Justice'' autobiography called \"A Divided Duty,\" Wells described the difficulty she had splitting her time between her family and her work. She continued to work after the birth of her first child, traveling and bringing the infant Charles with her. Although she tried to balance her roles as a mother and as a national activist, she was not always successful. [[Susan B.

When he died in 1895, Wells was perhaps at the height of her notoriety, but many men and women were ambivalent or against a woman taking the lead in black civil rights at a time when women were not seen as, and often not allowed to be, leaders by the wider society.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=african+american+history+oxford#v=onepage&q=african%2520american%2520history%2520oxford&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass |last=Seymour Jr. |first= James B. |work=Well-Barnett, Ida |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780195167771 |editor-last=Finkelman |editor-first=Paul |volume=3 |page=333 |language=en}}</ref>  For the new leading voices, [[Booker T.

For example, there are differing in accounts for why Wells' name was excluded from the original list of founders of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. In his autobiography ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', Du Bois implied that Wells chose not to be included.<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 1940, p. 224.</ref> However, in her autobiography, Wells stated that Du Bois deliberately excluded her from the list.<ref>Duster (1970), ''Crusade for Justice'', p. 322.</ref>\n\n==Organizing in Chicago==\nHaving settled in Chicago, Wells continued her anti-lynching work while becoming more focused on the civil rights of African Americans. She worked with national civil rights leaders to protest a major exhibition, she was active in the national women's club movement, and she ultimately ran for the Illinois State Senate. She also was passionate about women\u2019s rights and suffrage. She was a spokeswomen and an advocate for women being successful in the workplace, having &nbsp;equal opportunities, and creating a name for themselves\n\n=== World's Columbian Exposition ===\nIn 1893, the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was held in Chicago. Together with [[Frederick Douglass]] and other black leaders, Wells organized a black boycott of the fair, for its exclusion of African Americans from the exhibits. Wells, Douglass, [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and Wells' future husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, wrote sections of the pamphlet ''The Reason Why: The Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition'', which detailed the progress of blacks since their arrival in America and also exposed the basis of Southern lynchings. Wells later reported to [[Albion W. Tourg\u00e9e]] that copies of the pamphlet had been distributed to more than 20,000 people at the fair.<sup>[44]</sup> That year she started work with ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the oldest African-American newspaper in the city.\n\n=== Women's Clubs ===\nLiving in Chicago in the late 19th century, Wells was very active in the national [[Woman's club movement]]. In 1893, she organized ''The Women's Era Club'', a first-of-its-kind civic club for African-American women in Chicago. It would later be renamed the Ida B. Wells Club in her honor.<sup>[46]</sup> In 1894 she helped found two Chicago clubs in response to a new state law that gave women the right to vote in certain national and state offices and to run for the elective office of Trustee of the University of Illinois.<sup>[47]</sup> While being involved the women\u2019s suffrage movement, Wells endured opposition from many people, including other women. To support the Republican Party nomination of Lucy L. Flower as a University Trustee, Wells helped organize the Republican Women's Club in Illinois. Flower was eventually elected.<sup>[48]</sup> That same year, Wells was part of a group of women who formed the Alpha Suffrage Club to encourage women's participation in Chicago politics. On a national level, Wells sought to organize African-American groups across the United States. In 1896, Wells, working with [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]], [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Mary Church Terrell]] and others, helped found the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]]. She also helped organize the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Afro-American Council]].\n\nWells received much support from other social activists and her fellow club women. Frederick Douglass praised her work: \"You have done your people and mine a service ... What a revelation of existing conditions your writing has been for me.\"<sup>[49]</sup>\n\nDespite Douglass' praise, Wells was becoming a controversial figure among local and national women's clubs. This was evident when in 1899 the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs intended to meet in Chicago. Writing to the president of the association, Mary Terrell, Chicago organizers of the event stated that they would not cooperate in the meeting if it included Wells. When Wells learned that Terrell had agreed to exclude Wells, she called it \"a staggering blow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d3bRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Crusade+for+justice;+the+autobiography+of+Ida+B.+Wells%22#v=onepage&q=%22staggering%20blow%22&f=false|title=Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B.

Given her experience as a school teacher in segregated systems in the South, she wrote to the publisher on the failures of segregated school systems and the successes of integrated public schools. She then went to his office and lobbied him. Unsatisfied, she enlisted the social reformer [[Jane Addams]] in her cause. Wells and the pressure group she put together with Addams are credited with stopping the adoption of an officially segregated school system.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Worldliness of a Cosmopolitan Education: Passionate Lives in Public Service |last=Pinar |first=William F. |publisher=Routledge |pages=77\u201379|year=2009 |isbn=9781135844851}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture |last=Davies |first=Carole Boyce |authorlink=Carole Boyce Davies|publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=977|year=2008 |isbn=9781851097005 }}</ref>\n\n== Suffrage ==\n\n=== Willard controversy ===\nWells' role in the U.S. suffrage movement was inextricably linked to her lifelong crusade against racism, violence and discrimination towards African Americans.

Perhaps the most notable example of this conflict was her very public disagreement with [[Frances Willard]], the first President of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/willard-and-wells/introduction |title=Truth-Telling: Frances Willard and Ida B.

With roots in the call for temperance and sobriety, the organization later became a powerful advocate of suffrage in the U.S.\n\nIn 1893 Wells and Willard travelled separately to Britain on lecture tours. Willard was promoting temperance as well as suffrage for women, and Wells was calling attention to lynching in the U.S. The basis of their dispute was Wells' public statements that Willard was silent on the issue of lynching.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crusade for Justice|last=Duster|year=1970|isbn=|location=Chicago}} Chapters 18, 19 and 20.</ref> She referred to an interview Willard had conducted during her tour of the American South, in which she had blamed African Americans' behavior for the defeat of temperance legislation. \"The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,\" she had said, and \"the grog shop is its center of power. ... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.\"[63]\n\nAlthough Willard and her prominent supporter Lady Somerset attempted to limit press coverage of Wells' comments, newspapers in Britain in fact provided details of the dispute.\n\nWells also dedicated a chapter of her 1895 pamphlet ''A Red Record'' to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter titled \"Miss Willard's Attitude\" condemned Willard for using rhetoric that she thought promoted violence and other crimes against African Americans in America.\n\n=== Alpha Suffrage Club ===\nIn the years following her dispute with Willard, Wells continued her Anti- Lynching campaign and organizing in Chicago. She focused her work on black women's suffrage in the city following the enactment of a new state law enabling partial women's suffrage. The Illinois Presidential and Municipal Suffrage Bill of 1913 gave women in the state the right to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices; but not for governor, state representatives or members of Congress. Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi to give women these voting rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-per-flash-women-voter-0623-new-20130623-story.html|title=Illinois Women Win the Right To Vote|last=Grossman|first=Ron|date=June 23, 2013|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 17, 2018}}</ref>During the membership of Ida B.

At the age of 16, she lost both her parents and her infant brother in the [[History of yellow fever#Lower Mississippi Valley: 1878|1878 yellow fever epidemic]]. She went to work and kept the rest of the family together with the help of her grandmother. Later moving with some of her siblings to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], she found better pay as a teacher. Soon, Wells co-owned and wrote for the ''Memphis Free Speech and Headlight'' newspaper. Her reporting covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wells documented [[lynching in the United States]] through her indictment called \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases,\" investigating frequent claims of whites that lynchings were reserved for black criminals only. Wells exposed lynching as a barbaric practice of whites in the South used to intimidate and oppress African Americans who created economic and political competition\u2014and a subsequent threat of loss of power\u2014for whites. A white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses as her investigative reporting was carried nationally in black-owned newspapers.\n\nSubjected to continued threats, Wells left Memphis for [[Chicago]]. She married and had a family, while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women's movement for the rest of her life. Wells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)|civil rights movement]] and the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].

Her paternal grandmother, Peggy Wells, along with other friends and relatives, stayed with her siblings and cared for them during the week while Wells was teaching.\n\nBut when Peggy Wells died from a stroke and her sister Eugenia died, Wells accepted the invitation of her aunt Fanny and moved with her two youngest sisters to Memphis in 1883.\n\n==Early career and anti-segregation activism==\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#F3F0FD|salign=right|It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed ...

The previous year, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled against the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] (which had banned racial discrimination in public accommodations). This verdict supported railroad companies that chose to racially segregate their passengers . When Wells refused to give up her seat, the conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. Wells gained publicity in Memphis when she wrote a newspaper article for ''The Living Way'', a black church weekly, about her treatment on the train.

Black economic progress was a contemporary issue in the South, and in many states whites worked to suppress black progress. In this period at the turn of the century, Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed laws and/or new constitutions to [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise most black people and many poor white people]] through use of [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]] and other devices. Wells-Barnett recommended that black people use arms to defend against lynching.<ref name=\"Southern Horrors\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14975/14975-h/14975-h.htm ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases''.]</ref>\n\nShe followed-up with greater research and detail in ''The Red Record'' (1895), a 100-page pamphlet describing lynching in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. It also covered black peoples' struggles in the South since the Civil War. ''The Red Record'' explored the alarmingly high rates of lynching in the United States (which was at a peak from 1880 to 1930). Wells-Barnett said that during Reconstruction, most Americans outside the South did not realize the growing rate of violence against black people in the South. She believed that during slavery, white people had not committed as many attacks because of the economic labour value of slaves. Wells noted that, since slavery time, \"ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, [through lynching] without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution.\"\n\n[[Frederick Douglass]] had written an article noting three eras of \"Southern barbarism\" and the excuses that whites claimed in each period.\n\nWells-Barnett explored these in detail in her ''The Red Record''.\n* During slavery time, she noted that whites worked to \"repress and stamp out alleged 'race riots{{'\"}} or suspected slave rebellions, usually killing black people in far higher proportions than any white casualties. Once the Civil War ended, white people feared black people, who were in the majority in many areas. White people acted to control them and suppress them by violence.\n* During the [[Reconstruction Era]] white people lynched black people as part of mob efforts to suppress black political activity and re-establish [[white supremacy]] after the war. They feared \"Negro Domination\" through voting and taking office. Wells-Barnett urged black people in high-risk areas to move away to protect their families.\n* She noted that whites frequently claimed that black men had \"to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women\". She noted that white people assumed that any relationship between a white woman and a black man was a result of rape. But, given power relationships, it was much more common for white men to take sexual advantage of poor black women. She stated: \"Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that black men rape white women.\" Wells connected lynching to sexual violence, showing how the myth of the black man's lust for white women led to murder of African-American men.\n\nWells-Barnett gave 14 pages of statistics related to lynching cases committed from 1892 to 1895; she also included pages of graphic accounts detailing specific lynchings. She notes that her data was taken from articles by white correspondents, white press bureaus, and white newspapers. ''The Red Record'' was a huge pamphlet, and had far-reaching influence in the debate about lynching. ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'' and ''The Red Record'''s accounts of these lynchings grabbed the attention of Northerners who knew little about lynching or accepted the common explanation that black men deserved this fate. Generally southern states and white juries refused to indict any perpetrators for lynching, although they were frequently known and sometimes shown in the photographs being made more frequently of such events.\n\nDespite Wells-Barnett's attempt to garner support among white Americans against lynching, she believed that her campaign could not overturn the economic interests whites had in using lynching as an instrument to maintain Southern order and discourage Black economic ventures. Ultimately, Wells-Barnett concluded that appealing to reason and compassion would not succeed in gaining criminalization of lynching by Southern whites.<ref name=\"curry\"/>\n\nWells-Barnett concluded that perhaps armed resistance was the only defense against lynching. Meanwhile, she extended her efforts to gain support of such powerful white nations as Britain to shame and sanction the racist practices of America.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Tommy J.|title=The Fortune of Wells: Ida B.

Both women had read of the particularly gruesome lynching of Henry Smith in Texas and wanted to organize a speaking tour to call attention to American lynchings. They asked Frederick Douglass to make the trip, but citing his age and health, he declined.

A prominent attorney, Barnett was a civil rights activist and journalist in Chicago. Like Wells, he spoke widely against lynchings and for the civil rights of African Americans. Wells and Barnett had met in 1893, working together on a pamphlet protesting the lack of Black representation at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893. Barnett founded ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the first Black newspaper in Chicago, in 1878. Wells began writing for the paper in 1893, later acquired a partial ownership interest, and after marrying Barnett, assumed the role of editor.\n\nWells' marriage to Barnett was a legal union as well as a partnership of ideas and actions. Both were journalists, and both were established activists with a shared commitment to civil rights. In an interview, Wells' daughter Alfreda said that the two had \"like interests\" and that their journalist careers were \"intertwined.\" This sort of close working relationship between a wife and husband was unusual at the time, as women often played more traditional domestic roles in a marriage.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Ida B.

In the chapter of her ''Crusade For Justice'' autobiography called \"A Divided Duty,\" Wells described the difficulty she had splitting her time between her family and her work. She continued to work after the birth of her first child, traveling and bringing the infant Charles with her. Although she tried to balance her roles as a mother and as a national activist, she was not always successful. [[Susan B.

When he died in 1895, Wells was perhaps at the height of her notoriety, but many men and women were ambivalent or against a woman taking the lead in black civil rights at a time when women were not seen as, and often not allowed to be, leaders by the wider society.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=african+american+history+oxford#v=onepage&q=african%2520american%2520history%2520oxford&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass |last=Seymour Jr. |first= James B. |work=Well-Barnett, Ida |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780195167771 |editor-last=Finkelman |editor-first=Paul |volume=3 |page=333 |language=en}}</ref>  For the new leading voices, [[Booker T.

For example, there are differing in accounts for why Wells' name was excluded from the original list of founders of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. In his autobiography ''[[Dusk of Dawn]]'', Du Bois implied that Wells chose not to be included.<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 1940, p. 224.</ref> However, in her autobiography, Wells stated that Du Bois deliberately excluded her from the list.<ref>Duster (1970), ''Crusade for Justice'', p. 322.</ref>\n\n==Organizing in Chicago==\nHaving settled in Chicago, Wells continued her anti-lynching work while becoming more focused on the civil rights of African Americans. She worked with national civil rights leaders to protest a major exhibition, she was active in the national women's club movement, and she ultimately ran for the Illinois State Senate. She also was passionate about women\u2019s rights and suffrage. She was a spokeswomen and an advocate for women being successful in the workplace, having &nbsp;equal opportunities, and creating a name for themselves\n\n=== World's Columbian Exposition ===\nIn 1893, the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] was held in Chicago. Together with [[Frederick Douglass]] and other black leaders, Wells organized a black boycott of the fair, for its exclusion of African Americans from the exhibits. Wells, Douglass, [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and Wells' future husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, wrote sections of the pamphlet ''The Reason Why: The Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition'', which detailed the progress of blacks since their arrival in America and also exposed the basis of Southern lynchings. Wells later reported to [[Albion W. Tourg\u00e9e]] that copies of the pamphlet had been distributed to more than 20,000 people at the fair.<sup>[44]</sup> That year she started work with ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'', the oldest African-American newspaper in the city.\n\n=== Women's Clubs ===\nLiving in Chicago in the late 19th century, Wells was very active in the national [[Woman's club movement]]. In 1893, she organized ''The Women's Era Club'', a first-of-its-kind civic club for African-American women in Chicago. It would later be renamed the Ida B. Wells Club in her honor.<sup>[46]</sup> In 1894 she helped found two Chicago clubs in response to a new state law that gave women the right to vote in certain national and state offices and to run for the elective office of Trustee of the University of Illinois.<sup>[47]</sup> While being involved the women\u2019s suffrage movement, Wells endured opposition from many people, including other women. To support the Republican Party nomination of Lucy L. Flower as a University Trustee, Wells helped organize the Republican Women's Club in Illinois. Flower was eventually elected.<sup>[48]</sup> That same year, Wells was part of a group of women who formed the Alpha Suffrage Club to encourage women's participation in Chicago politics. On a national level, Wells sought to organize African-American groups across the United States. In 1896, Wells, working with [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]], [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Mary Church Terrell]] and others, helped found the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]]. She also helped organize the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Afro-American Council]].\n\nWells received much support from other social activists and her fellow club women. Frederick Douglass praised her work: \"You have done your people and mine a service ... What a revelation of existing conditions your writing has been for me.\"<sup>[49]</sup>\n\nDespite Douglass' praise, Wells was becoming a controversial figure among local and national women's clubs. This was evident when in 1899 the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs intended to meet in Chicago. Writing to the president of the association, Mary Terrell, Chicago organizers of the event stated that they would not cooperate in the meeting if it included Wells. When Wells learned that Terrell had agreed to exclude Wells, she called it \"a staggering blow.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d3bRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Crusade+for+justice;+the+autobiography+of+Ida+B.+Wells%22#v=onepage&q=%22staggering%20blow%22&f=false|title=Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B.

Given her experience as a school teacher in segregated systems in the South, she wrote to the publisher on the failures of segregated school systems and the successes of integrated public schools. She then went to his office and lobbied him. Unsatisfied, she enlisted the social reformer [[Jane Addams]] in her cause. Wells and the pressure group she put together with Addams are credited with stopping the adoption of an officially segregated school system.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Worldliness of a Cosmopolitan Education: Passionate Lives in Public Service |last=Pinar |first=William F. |publisher=Routledge |pages=77\u201379|year=2009 |isbn=9781135844851}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture |last=Davies |first=Carole Boyce |authorlink=Carole Boyce Davies|publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=977|year=2008 |isbn=9781851097005 }}</ref>\n\n== Suffrage ==\n\n=== Willard controversy ===\nWells' role in the U.S. suffrage movement was inextricably linked to her lifelong crusade against racism, violence and discrimination towards African Americans.

Perhaps the most notable example of this conflict was her very public disagreement with [[Frances Willard]], the first President of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/willard-and-wells/introduction |title=Truth-Telling: Frances Willard and Ida B. Wells, Introduction |editor=Ella Wagner |display-editors=etal |date=March 14, 2019 |website=Frances Willard House Museum |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe WCTU was a predominantly white women's organization, with branches in every state and a growing membership. With roots in the call for temperance and sobriety, the organization later became a powerful advocate of suffrage in the U.S.\n\nIn 1893 Wells and Willard travelled separately to Britain on lecture tours. Willard was promoting temperance as well as suffrage for women, and Wells was calling attention to lynching in the U.S. The basis of their dispute was Wells' public statements that Willard was silent on the issue of lynching.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crusade for Justice|last=Duster|year=1970|isbn=|location=Chicago}} Chapters 18, 19 and 20.</ref> She referred to an interview Willard had conducted during her tour of the American South, in which she had blamed African Americans' behavior for the defeat of temperance legislation. \"The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,\" she had said, and \"the grog shop is its center of power. ... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.\"[63]\n\nAlthough Willard and her prominent supporter Lady Somerset attempted to limit press coverage of Wells' comments, newspapers in Britain in fact provided details of the dispute.\n\nWells also dedicated a chapter of her 1895 pamphlet ''A Red Record'' to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter titled \"Miss Willard's Attitude\" condemned Willard for using rhetoric that she thought promoted violence and other crimes against African Americans in America.\n\n=== Alpha Suffrage Club ===\nIn the years following her dispute with Willard, Wells continued her Anti- Lynching campaign and organizing in Chicago. She focused her work on black women's suffrage in the city following the enactment of a new state law enabling partial women's suffrage. The Illinois Presidential and Municipal Suffrage Bill of 1913 gave women in the state the right to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices; but not for governor, state representatives or members of Congress. Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi to give women these voting rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-per-flash-women-voter-0623-new-20130623-story.html|title=Illinois Women Win the Right To Vote|last=Grossman|first=Ron|date=June 23, 2013|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 17, 2018}}</ref>During the membership of Ida B.
