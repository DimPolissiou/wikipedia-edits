Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton).

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

Larger civil airports include [[Danbury Municipal Airport]] and [[Waterbury-Oxford Airport]] in western Connecticut, [[Hartford\u2013Brainard Airport]] in central Connecticut, and [[Groton-New London Airport]] in eastern Connecticut. [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation.\n\n===Ferry===\n\nThe [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] travels between [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] and [[Port Jefferson, New York]] by crossing [[Long Island Sound]]. Ferry service also operates out of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] to [[Orient, New York]]; [[Fishers Island, New York]]; and [[Block Island, Rhode Island]], which are popular tourist destinations. Small local services operate the [[Rocky Hill\u2013Glastonbury Ferry]] and the [[Chester\u2013Hadlyme Ferry]] which cross the Connecticut River.\n\n==Law and government==\n\n{{Main|Law of Connecticut|Administrative divisions of Connecticut}}\n{{ct law}}\n[[File:Connecticut State Capitol, February 24, 2008.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[Connecticut State Capitol]] in downtown Hartford]]\n\n[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] has been the sole capital of Connecticut since 1875. Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Department-and-Agencies/ |title=Departments and Agencies |website=Portal.CT.gov |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House.<ref name=\"CT_CONST\">{{cite web |title=Constitution of the State of Connecticut |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?A=3188&Q=392288 |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109004649/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392288 |archive-date=November 9, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> {{As of|2017}}, [[Joe Aresimowicz]] is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, Connecticut's [[United States Senators]] are [[Richard Blumenthal]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] (Democrat).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/states/CT/intro.htm | title=Connecticut | publisher=U.S. Senate | website=States in the Senate | access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref> Connecticut has five [[U.S. Congressional Delegations from Connecticut|representatives in the U.S. House]], all of whom are Democrats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/representatives/#state_ct | title=Connecticut | publisher=U.S. House of Representatives | website=Directory of Representatives | access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocally elected representatives also develop [[Local ordinance]]s to govern cities and towns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/ordinances.htm |title=Connecticut Ordinances and Charters by Town |website=Judicial Branch Law Libraries |publisher=State of Connecticut |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref> The town ordinances often include [[noise pollution#Human|noise control]] and [[zoning]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/NewtownCT_Police/Ord%20Folder/Ordinances/262 |title=Newtown Noise Control Ordinance |website=Town of Newtown |date=August 20, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511122630/http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/NewtownCT_Police/Ord%20Folder/Ordinances/262 |archivedate=May 11, 2013 }}</ref> However, the State of Connecticut does also provide statewide ordinances for noise control as well.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sec. 22a-69-1 to 22a-69-7.4: Control of Noise |website=Department of Environmental Protection |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/regulations/title_22a/069.pdf |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231223637/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/regulations/title_22a/069.pdf |archive-date=December 31, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Judicial===\n\nThe highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut.

It symbolises the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|V\u00f6lkisch]] ideology to be traditionally conventional, demonstrating the idea that a woman's main purpose was to produce \u2018true\u2019 German children, and not be individualistic or sexually sinful.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=8}}</ref>  It represents that if you vary from the traditional German life then the consequences could be dire, possibly leading to death. This can relate to the Nazi fear policy, by which people who opposed the regime or were seen as asocial, were punished and it could have eventually lead to their death. The film also indirectly contains [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] through the character of the cunning fox.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe scene begins with the mother goose and her four children imprisoned in a wooden cart traveling to the countryside.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=191|edition=1st}}</ref> While on their journey they pass a vibrant city which includes urban glamour shops influenced by international fashion, an exotic parrot and lively music. The mother goose and the other three siblings are frightened, meanwhile the silly goose is mesmerised by the bright lights and people dancing. The mother drags the goose back away from the urban city surroundings and drops her. Meanwhile, a passing cart is carrying a fox stole. The silly goose touches it when again the mother drags her back. When approaching the countryside the other geese are happy, while the silly goose seems bored with her rural surroundings, at which the mother looks perplexed as to why. A train passes by which quickly shifts this arrangement as the silly goose is excited to see something unnatural, whereas the mother pulls the other siblings back in fear. When they arrive at the farm they are released from the wooden box and allowed to be free in their rural environment.\n\nThe silly goose then begins to admire herself in the reflection of the water, while the mother teaches the other geese how to drink. It is repeatedly shown in different scenes how the three geese march after their mother and learn from her, whereas the silly goose mocks them. The silly goose then tries to make luxury items out of ordinary things. For example, she uses a caterpillar as a scarf, corks as heels, straw hats and makes eyelashes from pig hairs. The other animals on the farm shake their heads in disapproval. The goose admires herself in a mirror, then her mother smashes the glass and tries to teach her how to lay an egg. After this, a traditional German male goose approaches the silly goose with the intention to court her, however she turns him away.\n\nFollowing this, the goose is approached by a sly fox, shown as peering through the fence and creeping up on her. After stealing a scarecrows clothes, the fox then charms her back to his lair. When entering the lair the fox lets out a sinister laugh. Inside the lair there are geese locked up, a slave cat making music on a xylophone of bones and ants turning a spit roast. The goose then tries to escape and is trapped in the mouth of the fox running through the forest. Eventually she is rescued by all the animals on the farm. After this, the silly goose is with the normal male goose and their four children, which she keeps in line and doesn't allow them to behave in her previous \u2018silly\u2019 ways.\n\n==Historical Context==\n\nThe animation's main purpose was to instill Nazi ideology onto the public, specifically to indoctrinate the German youth. The underlining theme is to live the \u2018traditional German life\u2019 and not variate towards adventure or luxury, with the animation grounded in nature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animates bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=190|edition=1st}}</ref> It was produced in 1944 when censorship of all media, including child short films, had to go through [[Joseph Goebbels]] who was the leader of the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] from 13 March 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema, 1933\u20131945|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=VII|edition=Rev}}</ref> The totalitarian state wanted to have absolute control of media in an attempt to control the masses, and Goebbels himself claimed: \u2018German cinema had the mission of conquering the world as the vanguard of the Nazi troops\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema, 1933\u20131945|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=1|edition=Rev}}</ref> The principle of the cartoon was to keep the German population in line and implant the idea that if someone was to variate from what they were told, the consequences could be fatal. Between 1939 and 1941, film propaganda would have been less effective because public opinion regarding the war did not need influencing as much. However, from 1941 onwards when German defeats began, tales such as these became valuable to keep the public in order and keep support for the government strong.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|last2=Cull|first2=Nicholas|last3=Culbert|first3=David|title=Propaganda and mass persuasion: A historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present.|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|page=35}}</ref> [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe#Political influence.2C World War I home front|Lord Northcliffe]] claimed that \u2018The bombardment of the German mind was almost as important as the bombardment by cannon\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Antony|last2=Margolin|first2=Victor|title=Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II|date=1976|publisher=Angus an Robertson|location=London|page=11}}</ref> The ministry recognised that to reach the maximum target audience, their propaganda must be intellectually slower so more people could understand the basic concepts, and to offer escapism from the serious social and political problems without the audience being aware it was propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|last2=Cull|first2=Nicholas|last3=Culbert|first3=David|title=Propaganda and mass persuasion: A historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenstone|first1=Robert|title=History on Film Film on History|date=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|page=2|edition=2nd}}</ref> In [[Mein Kampf]] it recognised that \u2018propaganda must be addressed to the emotions and not to intelligence\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Antony|last2=Margolin|first2=Victor|title=Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II|date=1976|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=London|page=12}}</ref> This led to many children's animations being produced, leading to film being one type of media which helped to crush [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] opposition in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|last2=Cull|first2=Nicholas|last3=Culbert|first3=David|title=Propaganda and mass persuasion: A historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present.|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|page=11}}</ref> This animation includes four main aspects: the role of the mother, being asocial, anti-Semitism and showing Fischerkoesen subtle resistance to some of the Nazi policies.\n\n==Role of the mother==\n\nOne of the main V\u00f6lkisch ideologies was the role of the traditional German mother that would produce many children to fulfil their biological obligation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=9}}</ref> This is represented in the Kinderreich (with many children) policy, which rewarded women who had four or more children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=88}}</ref> The animation demonstrates this ideology by showing the mother and the silly goose eventually having four children each, despite previously not learning how to lay an egg. In addition, with the silly goose turning away the normal German goose and being charmed by the fox, can relate to the other tropes in Nazi ideology, such as inter-racial marriages being prohibited between people of \u2018true\u2019 German blood and Jews, with the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Law]] for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour in September 1935 enforcing this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rippon|first1=Anton|title=Hitler's Olympics: The story of the 1936 Nazi games|url=https://archive.org/details/hitlersolympicss0000ripp|url-access=registration|date=2006|publisher=Pen & Sword|location=Barnsley|page=[https://archive.org/details/hitlersolympicss0000ripp/page/12 12]}}</ref>\n\n==Being Asocial==\n\nThe animation shows the silly goose in some aspects to be what Nazis would define as \u2018asocial\u2019. The definition of asocial is very elastic and could range from being a thief, alcoholic, prostitute or anyone that resisted the Nazi authority and ideals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|pages=117\u2013119}}</ref> With the silly goose consumed by luxury and embracing the facets of Parisian fashion is criticised in many areas in the animation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Guenther|first1=Irene|title=Nazi chic? Fashioning women in the third Reich|date=2004|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=100}}</ref> The most obvious example being when she uses natural aspects to dress and look differently, such as using pig hairs as eyelashes. This was condemned by the Nazi party for two reasons. Firstly, it went against their ideal for a traditional [[Aryan race|Aryan]] German race, with women wearing no makeup, being natural and physically healthy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ascheid|first1=Antje|title=Hitler's heroines: Stardom and womanhood in Nazi cinema|date=2003|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia; Great Britain|page=1}}</ref> Secondly, with the war affecting the German economy, propaganda was aimed at preventing people buying international goods in order to keep money in the country. Goebbels announced that propaganda for merchandise such as clothes had to be discontinued in 1941, because no one could afford them and it would \u2018draw blood\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=112}}</ref> Therefore, the ideal to create a united German nation was achievable by no individuals varying from the country look.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Guenther|first1=Irene|title=Nazi chic? Fashioning women in the third Reich|date=2004|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=131}}</ref> This concept is displayed in the animation towards the beginning, where the cart drives past the glamorous urban city and the silly goose is pulled away by her mother and dropped. This represents the first symbol of hurt from embracing the urban city life, reflecting it back to if someone went against V\u00f6lkisch ideology there could be fatal circumstances, with two thirds of non-Jews in concentration camps, during 1933 to 1943, being defined as asocials.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi family policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=119}}</ref> Therefore, the motive to influence the audience to be natural and not be taken to urbanite glamour underlines the animation and can reinforce the idea that the animation was in fact propaganda to indoctrinate the youth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Antony|last2=Margolin|first2=Victor|title=Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II|date=1976|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=London|page=21}}</ref>\n\n==Anti-Semitic influences==\n\nThe character of the fox represented in the cartoon can be symbolic of anti-Semitism during Hitler's dictatorship. Stereotypes of the Jewish population were at their height in 1944, for example being cunning and having large noses, and of course, many factors played into part to alienate and exterminate them from society. Therefore, with the master Aryan race being part of Nazi ideology they used propaganda as a tool for exclusion, with Jews becoming the central characters of many films from 1939 onwards.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Taithe|first1=Bertrand|last2=Thornton|first2=Tim|title=Propaganda: Political rhetoric and identity, 1300\u20132000|date=1999|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Cloucestershire|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Nicholas|title=The power of film propaganda: Myth or reality?|date=1999|publisher=Cassell|location=New York; London|page=111|edition=1st}}</ref> Although the animation does not directly link the character of the fox to Jews, background of other instances doing this using foxes, rats and pests, can suggest its message was to exterminate them as a necessity and not a crime.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=252|edition=Rev}}</ref> An example of this can be ''Der St\u00f6renfried,'' which was a German animation produced in 1940. Its content includes Nazi forces fighting against and eventually beating the fox, with the German people rejoicing at the end.<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Storenfried \u2013 German Cartoon 1940 (Nazi propaganda)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8MUYCVD-VM|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> The animation indirectly instils the concept of the corrupt \u2018Jew in disguise\u2019, with an international conspiracy to take over the world, such as in [[Jud S\u00fc\u00df (1940 film)|''Jud S\u00fcss'']].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema, 1933\u20131945|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=241|edition=Rev}}</ref> Another example of this can be from a booklet for the German youth called \u2018The German National Catechism\u2019, where it includes \u2018the goal of the Jew is to make himself the ruler of humanity\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=The German National Catechism|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/catech.htm|website=German propaganda archive|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> The first representation of the fox in the animation is at the beginning with the fox stole on a passing cart. By the silly goose being drawn to it, and the mother goose pulling her away can show the idea that Germans should stay away from Jews. Furthermore, the most prominent representation of the Jew in the animation is the character of the fox that charms the silly goose back to his lair. The method the fox follows to bring her back can be seen as ritualistic and reiterates the theme of a Jewish conspiracy to conquer the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=192|edition=1st}}</ref> Therefore, it can be said that the animation was subtly alienating the Jewish population and to some extent trying to justify the exclusion of Jews through the mass killings which began from March 1942.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Nicholas|title=The power of film propaganda: Myth or reality?|date=1999|publisher=Cassell|location=New York; London|page=111|edition=1st}}</ref> In addition, the way in which the fox is defeated can tell a lot about attitudes towards Jews. With all the farm coming together to chase him away could signify that the Germans needed to be united in their \u2018fight\u2019 against the Jewish population.\n\n[[William Moritz]] argues that Hans Fischerkoesen is in fact subverting the ideology of nazi-ism through the silly goose, pointing that the symbolism being used within the film pushes more against the ideology of fascism and nazi-propaganda.\n\n==Hans Fischerkoesen\u2019s Personal Beliefs==\n\nWith the animation being in close contact with Goebbels it clearly had hints of typical Nazi propaganda aspects as stated above. However Fischerkoesen's own personal beliefs on Nazi policies could have been quite different. There are a few aspects within the animation which suggest Fischerkoesen himself did not agree with Nazi policies, such as the concentration camps. For example, the animation shows animal entrapment, brutality and exploitation which could reflect how people were treated in the camps.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=191}}</ref> These could show Fischerkoesen had a humanitarian perspective and did not agree with some of the Nazi's actions, with him working front line in World War One.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=191}}</ref>  However, he made the animation to fit into the circumstance as he didn't want to oppose the regime.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=153}}</ref>\n\n==Links to other animations==\n\nWhen Hans Fischerkoesen produced this short animation he also produced two others (as a trio) with the same underlining concept: adventure and luxury would eventually lead to personal downfall. These shorts are: [[Der Schneemann|''Der Schneemann'' (The Snowman, 1944)]] and [[Verwitterte Melodie|''Verwitterte Melodie'' (Weather-beaten melody, 1942-43)]], which were both ideas from [[Horst von M\u00f6llendorff]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=113}}</ref> Der Schneemann is particularly interesting because it represents the idea that if one were trapped in a given environment, they must be functional to survive, presented in the snowman leaving his environment and having a fatal end.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=117}}</ref> This links to German society, where people would have been expected to stay in their environment and not be adventurous, emphasising the fear policy the Nazis held. Also, there is another animation called Armer Hansi produced in 1943 with a similar concept.\n\nQuality of animation to the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda became very important, which is demonstrated in these shorts. As stated by Hans Steinback in 1937, they used film as a messenger of V\u00f6lkisch ideology, and with the war ongoing Goebbels wanted to represent Germany as growing industrially just as in peacetime, and to be able to compete with the rival; America.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=5|edition=Rev}}</ref> To improve the quality for this trio of shorts Fischerkoesen used a combination of 2D and 3D, using the stereo animation stand.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=110}}</ref> When released, the animation became well known for its quality.

It is a tale of a female goose consumed by adventure and urban glamour in her countryside life, who had to be saved from a cunning fox by her friends and family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The Animated Bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and cultre|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=192 |edition=1st}}</ref> The moral of the tale was not be extravagant and adventurous due to its consequences and it not being what one would expect, and promoting that people should live a \u2018normal\u2019 German family life. The animation has an underling theme of [[Nazi]] propaganda. It symbolises the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|V\u00f6lkisch]] ideology to be traditionally conventional, demonstrating the idea that a woman's main purpose was to produce \u2018true\u2019 German children, and not be individualistic or sexually sinful.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=8}}</ref>  It represents that if you vary from the traditional German life then the consequences could be dire, possibly leading to death. This can relate to the Nazi fear policy, by which people who opposed the regime or were seen as asocial, were punished and it could have eventually lead to their death. The film also indirectly contains [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] through the character of the cunning fox.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe scene begins with the mother goose and her four children imprisoned in a wooden cart traveling to the countryside.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=191|edition=1st}}</ref> While on their journey they pass a vibrant city which includes urban glamour shops influenced by international fashion, an exotic parrot and lively music. The mother goose and the other three siblings are frightened, meanwhile the silly goose is mesmerised by the bright lights and people dancing. The mother drags the goose back away from the urban city surroundings and drops her. Meanwhile, a passing cart is carrying a fox stole. The silly goose touches it when again the mother drags her back. When approaching the countryside the other geese are happy, while the silly goose seems bored with her rural surroundings, at which the mother looks perplexed as to why. A train passes by which quickly shifts this arrangement as the silly goose is excited to see something unnatural, whereas the mother pulls the other siblings back in fear. When they arrive at the farm they are released from the wooden box and allowed to be free in their rural environment.\n\nThe silly goose then begins to admire herself in the reflection of the water, while the mother teaches the other geese how to drink. It is repeatedly shown in different scenes how the three geese march after their mother and learn from her, whereas the silly goose mocks them. The silly goose then tries to make luxury items out of ordinary things. For example, she uses a caterpillar as a scarf, corks as heels, straw hats and makes eyelashes from pig hairs. The other animals on the farm shake their heads in disapproval. The goose admires herself in a mirror, then her mother smashes the glass and tries to teach her how to lay an egg. After this, a traditional German male goose approaches the silly goose with the intention to court her, however she turns him away.\n\nFollowing this, the goose is approached by a sly fox, shown as peering through the fence and creeping up on her. After stealing a scarecrows clothes, the fox then charms her back to his lair. When entering the lair the fox lets out a sinister laugh. Inside the lair there are geese locked up, a slave cat making music on a xylophone of bones and ants turning a spit roast. The goose then tries to escape and is trapped in the mouth of the fox running through the forest. Eventually she is rescued by all the animals on the farm. After this, the silly goose is with the normal male goose and their four children, which she keeps in line and doesn't allow them to behave in her previous \u2018silly\u2019 ways.\n\n==Historical Context==\n\nThe animation's main purpose was to instill Nazi ideology onto the public, specifically to indoctrinate the German youth. The underlining theme is to live the \u2018traditional German life\u2019 and not variate towards adventure or luxury, with the animation grounded in nature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animates bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=190|edition=1st}}</ref> It was produced in 1944 when censorship of all media, including child short films, had to go through [[Joseph Goebbels]] who was the leader of the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] from 13 March 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema, 1933\u20131945|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=VII|edition=Rev}}</ref> The totalitarian state wanted to have absolute control of media in an attempt to control the masses, and Goebbels himself claimed: \u2018German cinema had the mission of conquering the world as the vanguard of the Nazi troops\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema, 1933\u20131945|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=1|edition=Rev}}</ref> The principle of the cartoon was to keep the German population in line and implant the idea that if someone was to variate from what they were told, the consequences could be fatal. Between 1939 and 1941, film propaganda would have been less effective because public opinion regarding the war did not need influencing as much. However, from 1941 onwards when German defeats began, tales such as these became valuable to keep the public in order and keep support for the government strong.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|last2=Cull|first2=Nicholas|last3=Culbert|first3=David|title=Propaganda and mass persuasion: A historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present.|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|page=35}}</ref> [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe#Political influence.2C World War I home front|Lord Northcliffe]] claimed that \u2018The bombardment of the German mind was almost as important as the bombardment by cannon\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Antony|last2=Margolin|first2=Victor|title=Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II|date=1976|publisher=Angus an Robertson|location=London|page=11}}</ref> The ministry recognised that to reach the maximum target audience, their propaganda must be intellectually slower so more people could understand the basic concepts, and to offer escapism from the serious social and political problems without the audience being aware it was propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|last2=Cull|first2=Nicholas|last3=Culbert|first3=David|title=Propaganda and mass persuasion: A historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenstone|first1=Robert|title=History on Film Film on History|date=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|page=2|edition=2nd}}</ref> In [[Mein Kampf]] it recognised that \u2018propaganda must be addressed to the emotions and not to intelligence\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Antony|last2=Margolin|first2=Victor|title=Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II|date=1976|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=London|page=12}}</ref> This led to many children's animations being produced, leading to film being one type of media which helped to crush [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] opposition in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|last2=Cull|first2=Nicholas|last3=Culbert|first3=David|title=Propaganda and mass persuasion: A historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present.|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|page=11}}</ref> This animation includes four main aspects: the role of the mother, being asocial, anti-Semitism and showing Fischerkoesen subtle resistance to some of the Nazi policies.\n\n==Role of the mother==\n\nOne of the main V\u00f6lkisch ideologies was the role of the traditional German mother that would produce many children to fulfil their biological obligation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=9}}</ref> This is represented in the Kinderreich (with many children) policy, which rewarded women who had four or more children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=88}}</ref> The animation demonstrates this ideology by showing the mother and the silly goose eventually having four children each, despite previously not learning how to lay an egg. In addition, with the silly goose turning away the normal German goose and being charmed by the fox, can relate to the other tropes in Nazi ideology, such as inter-racial marriages being prohibited between people of \u2018true\u2019 German blood and Jews, with the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Law]] for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour in September 1935 enforcing this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rippon|first1=Anton|title=Hitler's Olympics: The story of the 1936 Nazi games|url=https://archive.org/details/hitlersolympicss0000ripp|url-access=registration|date=2006|publisher=Pen & Sword|location=Barnsley|page=[https://archive.org/details/hitlersolympicss0000ripp/page/12 12]}}</ref>\n\n==Being Asocial==\n\nThe animation shows the silly goose in some aspects to be what Nazis would define as \u2018asocial\u2019. The definition of asocial is very elastic and could range from being a thief, alcoholic, prostitute or anyone that resisted the Nazi authority and ideals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|pages=117\u2013119}}</ref> With the silly goose consumed by luxury and embracing the facets of Parisian fashion is criticised in many areas in the animation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Guenther|first1=Irene|title=Nazi chic? Fashioning women in the third Reich|date=2004|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=100}}</ref> The most obvious example being when she uses natural aspects to dress and look differently, such as using pig hairs as eyelashes. This was condemned by the Nazi party for two reasons. Firstly, it went against their ideal for a traditional [[Aryan race|Aryan]] German race, with women wearing no makeup, being natural and physically healthy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ascheid|first1=Antje|title=Hitler's heroines: Stardom and womanhood in Nazi cinema|date=2003|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia; Great Britain|page=1}}</ref> Secondly, with the war affecting the German economy, propaganda was aimed at preventing people buying international goods in order to keep money in the country. Goebbels announced that propaganda for merchandise such as clothes had to be discontinued in 1941, because no one could afford them and it would \u2018draw blood\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=112}}</ref> Therefore, the ideal to create a united German nation was achievable by no individuals varying from the country look.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Guenther|first1=Irene|title=Nazi chic? Fashioning women in the third Reich|date=2004|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=131}}</ref> This concept is displayed in the animation towards the beginning, where the cart drives past the glamorous urban city and the silly goose is pulled away by her mother and dropped. This represents the first symbol of hurt from embracing the urban city life, reflecting it back to if someone went against V\u00f6lkisch ideology there could be fatal circumstances, with two thirds of non-Jews in concentration camps, during 1933 to 1943, being defined as asocials.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=Lisa|title=Nazi family policy, 1933\u20131945|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=119}}</ref> Therefore, the motive to influence the audience to be natural and not be taken to urbanite glamour underlines the animation and can reinforce the idea that the animation was in fact propaganda to indoctrinate the youth.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Antony|last2=Margolin|first2=Victor|title=Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II|date=1976|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=London|page=21}}</ref>\n\n==Anti-Semitic influences==\n\nThe character of the fox represented in the cartoon can be symbolic of anti-Semitism during Hitler's dictatorship. Stereotypes of the Jewish population were at their height in 1944, for example being cunning and having large noses, and of course, many factors played into part to alienate and exterminate them from society. Therefore, with the master Aryan race being part of Nazi ideology they used propaganda as a tool for exclusion, with Jews becoming the central characters of many films from 1939 onwards.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Taithe|first1=Bertrand|last2=Thornton|first2=Tim|title=Propaganda: Political rhetoric and identity, 1300\u20132000|date=1999|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Cloucestershire|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Nicholas|title=The power of film propaganda: Myth or reality?|date=1999|publisher=Cassell|location=New York; London|page=111|edition=1st}}</ref> Although the animation does not directly link the character of the fox to Jews, background of other instances doing this using foxes, rats and pests, can suggest its message was to exterminate them as a necessity and not a crime.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=252|edition=Rev}}</ref> An example of this can be ''Der St\u00f6renfried,'' which was a German animation produced in 1940. Its content includes Nazi forces fighting against and eventually beating the fox, with the German people rejoicing at the end.<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Storenfried \u2013 German Cartoon 1940 (Nazi propaganda)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8MUYCVD-VM|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> The animation indirectly instils the concept of the corrupt \u2018Jew in disguise\u2019, with an international conspiracy to take over the world, such as in [[Jud S\u00fc\u00df (1940 film)|''Jud S\u00fcss'']].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema, 1933\u20131945|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=241|edition=Rev}}</ref> Another example of this can be from a booklet for the German youth called \u2018The German National Catechism\u2019, where it includes \u2018the goal of the Jew is to make himself the ruler of humanity\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=The German National Catechism|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/catech.htm|website=German propaganda archive|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> The first representation of the fox in the animation is at the beginning with the fox stole on a passing cart. By the silly goose being drawn to it, and the mother goose pulling her away can show the idea that Germans should stay away from Jews. Furthermore, the most prominent representation of the Jew in the animation is the character of the fox that charms the silly goose back to his lair. The method the fox follows to bring her back can be seen as ritualistic and reiterates the theme of a Jewish conspiracy to conquer the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=192|edition=1st}}</ref> Therefore, it can be said that the animation was subtly alienating the Jewish population and to some extent trying to justify the exclusion of Jews through the mass killings which began from March 1942.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Nicholas|title=The power of film propaganda: Myth or reality?|date=1999|publisher=Cassell|location=New York; London|page=111|edition=1st}}</ref> In addition, the way in which the fox is defeated can tell a lot about attitudes towards Jews. With all the farm coming together to chase him away could signify that the Germans needed to be united in their \u2018fight\u2019 against the Jewish population.\n\n[[William Moritz]] argues that Hans Fischerkoesen is in fact subverting the ideology of nazi-ism through the silly goose, pointing that the symbolism being used within the film pushes more against the ideology of fascism and nazi-propaganda.\n\n==Hans Fischerkoesen\u2019s Personal Beliefs==\n\nWith the animation being in close contact with Goebbels it clearly had hints of typical Nazi propaganda aspects as stated above. However Fischerkoesen's own personal beliefs on Nazi policies could have been quite different. There are a few aspects within the animation which suggest Fischerkoesen himself did not agree with Nazi policies, such as the concentration camps. For example, the animation shows animal entrapment, brutality and exploitation which could reflect how people were treated in the camps.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=191}}</ref> These could show Fischerkoesen had a humanitarian perspective and did not agree with some of the Nazi's actions, with him working front line in World War One.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Paul|title=The animated bestiary: Animals, cartoons, and culture|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=London; New Brunswick|page=191}}</ref>  However, he made the animation to fit into the circumstance as he didn't want to oppose the regime.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=153}}</ref>\n\n==Links to other animations==\n\nWhen Hans Fischerkoesen produced this short animation he also produced two others (as a trio) with the same underlining concept: adventure and luxury would eventually lead to personal downfall. These shorts are: [[Der Schneemann|''Der Schneemann'' (The Snowman, 1944)]] and [[Verwitterte Melodie|''Verwitterte Melodie'' (Weather-beaten melody, 1942-43)]], which were both ideas from [[Horst von M\u00f6llendorff]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=113}}</ref> Der Schneemann is particularly interesting because it represents the idea that if one were trapped in a given environment, they must be functional to survive, presented in the snowman leaving his environment and having a fatal end.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=117}}</ref> This links to German society, where people would have been expected to stay in their environment and not be adventurous, emphasising the fear policy the Nazis held. Also, there is another animation called Armer Hansi produced in 1943 with a similar concept.\n\nQuality of animation to the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda became very important, which is demonstrated in these shorts. As stated by Hans Steinback in 1937, they used film as a messenger of V\u00f6lkisch ideology, and with the war ongoing Goebbels wanted to represent Germany as growing industrially just as in peacetime, and to be able to compete with the rival; America.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=David|title=Propaganda and the german cinema|date=2001|publisher=Tauris|location=New York; London|page=5|edition=Rev}}</ref> To improve the quality for this trio of shorts Fischerkoesen used a combination of 2D and 3D, using the stereo animation stand.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=110}}</ref> When released, the animation became well known for its quality. Emil Reinegger, head of Paris Film Distributors, claimed that it was surprisingly favourable and better than the bulk of American trick films.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giesen|first1=Rolf|last2=Storm|first2=J|title=Animation Under the Swastika: A History of trickfilm in Nazi Germany, 1933\u20131945|date=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson; North Carolina|page=116}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Ascheid, A.

Goat breeds (especially [[dairy]] goats) are some of the oldest defined animal breeds for which [[breed standard]]s and production records have been kept. [[Selective breeding]] of goats generally focuses on improving production of [[fiber]], meat, dairy products or [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]].

The act was introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Parliament, on 19 July 2019 by the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Thawar Chand Gehlot]], in light of the lapse of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018. The 2019 act and the immediately preceding 2018 bill, were both preceded by a 2016 version. They were met with protests and criticism by transgender persons, lawyers, and activists in India. The 2016 bill was sent to a [[Standing committee (India)|standing committee]] which submitted its report in July  2017. Following this, the Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill in December 2018. However, it did not incorporate many of the committee's recommendations. Although members of the opposition criticised the 2019 act and assured transgender persons of not voting in favour of it, it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019 and by the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of the Parliament, on 26 November 2019. The [[President of India|president]] assented to it on 5 December 2019, upon which the act was notified in the ''[[Gazette of India]]''. It was brought into effect from 10 January 2020 onwards vide a notification in the ''Gazette'' on the same day.\n\nFollowing protests by the [[LGBT|queer community]] against the 2016 and 2018 bills, the 2019 act has done away with few of the severely criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as criminalisation of begging and the establishment of a district screening committee to process applications for issuance of transgender person certificates. However, it fails to incorporate yet other principles in line with the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judgment in ''[[National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India]]'' (''NALSA v. UOI'') in 2014, such as the right of transgender persons to self-perceived gender identity without undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], and mandatory reservations in jobs and educational institutions. The act has also been criticised for the lesser punishment for crimes against transgender persons compared with punishment for crimes against [[cisgender|cisgender persons]]. On 27 January 2020, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the central government in a petition filed challenging the constitutionality of the 2019 legislation.\n\nIn January 2014, while judicial pronouncement in the ''NALSA'' petition was pending, the ministry had published an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender persons, after consultations with transgender persons. [[Tiruchi Siva]], of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party, had introduced the [[Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014|Rights of Transgender Persons Bill]] in 2014, in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the house in 2015. The 2014 bill contains provisions progressive to those in the bills introduced in between 2016 and 2019, but has been pending in the Lok Sabha since 2015. Prior to the [[Indian general elections, 2019|2019 general elections]], parties such as the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] had promised in their respective electoral manifestoes to, respectively, withdraw the 2018 bill \u2014 while introducing a new one consulting members of the queer community \u2014 and pass the 2014 bill.\n\n==History and background==\n[[File:Hijra and companions in Eastern Bengal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hijras in eastern Bengal, ''circa'' 1860]]\n{{LGBT rights}}\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in ''National Legal Services Authority v.

(law)|act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] with the objective to provide for protection of rights of [[Transgender|transgender persons]], their welfare, and other related matters. The act was introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Parliament, on 19 July 2019 by the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Thawar Chand Gehlot]], in light of the lapse of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018. The 2019 act and the immediately preceding 2018 bill, were both preceded by a 2016 version,. They were met with protests and criticism by transgender persons, lawyers, and activists in India. The 2016 bill was sent to a [[Standing committee (India)|standing committee]] which submitted its report in July  2017. Following this, the Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill in December 2018. However, it did not incorporate many of the committee's recommendations. Although members of the opposition criticised the 2019 act and assured transgender persons of not voting in favour of it, it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019 and by the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of the Parliament, on 26 November 2019. The [[President of India|president]] assented to it on 5 December 2019, upon which the act was notified in the ''[[Gazette of India]]''. It was brought into effect from 10 January 2020 onwards vide a notification in the ''Gazette'' on the same day.\n\nFollowing protests by the [[LGBT|queer community]] against the 2016 and 2018 bills, the 2019 act has done away with few of the severely criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as criminalisation of begging and the establishment of a district screening committee to process applications for issuance of transgender person certificates. However, it fails to incorporate yet other principles in line with the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judgment in ''[[National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India]]'' (''NALSA v. UOI'') in 2014, such as the right of transgender persons to self-perceived gender identity without undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], and mandatory reservations in jobs and educational institutions. The act has also been criticised for the lesser punishment for crimes against transgender persons compared with punishment for crimes against [[cisgender|cisgender persons]]. On 27 January 2020, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the central government in a petition filed challenging the constitutionality of the 2019 legislation\n\nIn January 2014, while judicial pronouncement in the ''NALSA'' petition was pending, the ministry had published an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender persons, after consultations with transgender persons. [[Tiruchi Siva]], of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party, had introduced the [[Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014|Rights of Transgender Persons Bill]] in 2014, in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the house in 2015. The 2014 bill contains provisions progressive to those in the bills introduced in between 2016 and 2019, but has been pending in the Lok Sabha since 2015.
