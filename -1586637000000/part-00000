Similarly, an '''Eulerian circuit''' or '''Eulerian cycle''' is an Eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]]. They were first discussed by [[Leonhard Euler]] while solving the famous [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]] problem in 1736. The problem can be stated mathematically like this:\n\n:Given the graph in the image, is it possible to construct a path (or a [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]; i.e., a path starting and ending on the same vertex) that visits each edge exactly once?\n\nEuler proved that a necessary condition for the existence of Eulerian circuits is that all vertices in the graph have an even [[degree (graph theory)|degree]], and stated without proof that connected graphs with all vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit. The first complete proof of this latter claim was published posthumously in 1873 by [[Carl Hierholzer]].<ref>N. L. Biggs, E. K. Lloyd and R. J. Wilson, Graph Theory 1736\u20131936, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1976, 8\u20139, {{ISBN|0-19-853901-0}}.</ref> This is known as '''Euler's Theorem:'''\n\n:A connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree.\n\nThe term '''Eulerian graph''' has two common meanings in graph theory. One meaning is a graph with an Eulerian circuit, and the other is a graph with every vertex of even degree.

If there are no vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian trails are circuits. If there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian trails start at one of them and end at the other. A graph that has an Eulerian trail but not an Eulerian circuit is called '''semi-Eulerian'''.\n\n==Definition==\nAn '''Eulerian trail''',<ref name=\"pathcycle\">Some people reserve the terms ''path'' and ''cycle'' to mean ''non-self-intersecting'' path and cycle.  A (potentially) self-intersecting path is known as a '''trail''' or an '''open walk'''; and a (potentially) self-intersecting cycle, a '''circuit''' or a '''closed walk'''. This ambiguity can be avoided by using the terms Eulerian trail and Eulerian circuit when self-intersection is allowed.</ref>  or '''Euler walk''' in an [[undirected graph]] is a walk that uses each edge exactly once. If such a walk exists, the graph is called '''traversable''' or '''semi-eulerian'''.<ref>Jun-ichi Yamaguchi, [http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680/Yamaguchi/emat6690/essay1/GT.html Introduction of Graph Theory].</ref>\n\nAn '''Eulerian cycle''',<ref name=\"pathcycle\"/> '''Eulerian circuit''' or '''Euler tour''' in an undirected graph is a [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] that uses each edge exactly once.

So, a graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles and its nonzero-degree vertices belong to a single connected component.\n*An undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.\n*A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has equal [[in degree (graph theory)|in degree]] and [[out degree (graph theory)|out degree]], and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single [[strongly connected component]].

The algorithm starts at a vertex of odd degree, or, if the graph has none, it starts with an arbitrarily chosen vertex. At each step it chooses the next edge in the path to be one whose deletion would not disconnect the graph, unless there is no such edge, in which case it picks the remaining edge left at the current vertex. It then moves to the other endpoint of that edge and deletes the edge. At the end of the algorithm there are no edges left, and the sequence from which the edges were chosen forms an Eulerian cycle if the graph has no vertices of odd degree, or an Eulerian trail if there are exactly two vertices of odd degree.\n\nWhile the ''graph traversal'' in Fleury's algorithm is linear in the number of edges, i.e. ''O''(|''E''|), we also need to factor in the complexity of detecting [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridge]]s. If we are to re-run [[Robert Tarjan|Tarjan]]'s linear time bridge-finding algorithm after the removal of every edge,  Fleury's algorithm will have a time complexity of ''O''(|''E''|<sup>2</sup>). A dynamic bridge-finding algorithm of {{harvtxt|Thorup|2000}} allows this to be improved to <math>O(|E|(\\log|E|)^3\\log\\log|E|),</math> but this is still significantly slower than alternative algorithms.\n\n=== Hierholzer's algorithm ===\n[[Carl Hierholzer|Hierholzer]]'s 1873 paper provides a different method for finding Euler cycles that is more efficient than Fleury's algorithm:\n*Choose any starting vertex ''v'', and follow a trail of edges from that vertex until returning to ''v''. It is not possible to get stuck at any vertex other than ''v'', because the even degree of all vertices ensures that, when the trail enters another vertex ''w'' there must be an unused edge leaving ''w''. The tour formed in this way is a closed tour, but may not cover all the vertices and edges of the initial graph.\n*As long as there exists a vertex ''u'' that belongs to the current tour but that has adjacent edges not part of the tour, start another trail from ''u'', following unused edges until returning to ''u'', and join the tour formed in this way to the previous tour.\n*Since we assume the original graph is [[connected graph|connected]], repeating the previous step will exhaust all edges of the graph.\nBy using a data structure such as a [[doubly linked list]] to maintain the set of unused edges incident to each vertex, to maintain the list of vertices on the current tour that have unused edges, and to maintain the tour itself, the individual operations of the algorithm (finding unused edges exiting each vertex, finding a new starting vertex for a tour, and connecting two tours that share a vertex) may be performed in constant time each, so the overall algorithm takes [[linear time]], <math>O(|E|)</math>.<ref>{{citation|title=Eulerian Graphs and Related Topics: Part 1, Volume 2|volume=50|series=Annals of Discrete Mathematics|first=Herbert|last=Fleischner|publisher=Elsevier|year=1991|isbn=978-0-444-89110-5|contribution=X.1 Algorithms for Eulerian Trails|pages=[https://archive.org/details/euleriangraphsre0001flei/page/ X.1\u201313]|url=https://archive.org/details/euleriangraphsre0001flei/page/}}.</ref>\n\nThis algorithm may also be implemented with a [[Queue_(abstract_data_type)|queue]]. Because it is only possible to get stuck when the queue represents a closed tour, one should rotate the queue (remove an element from the head and add it to the tail) until unstuck, and continue until all edges are accounted for. This also takes linear time, as the number of rotations performed is never larger than <math>|E|</math>.\n\n==Counting Eulerian circuits==\n\n=== Complexity issues ===\nThe number of Eulerian circuits in ''[[Directed graph|digraphs]]'' can be calculated using the so-called '''[[BEST theorem]]''', named after [[N. G. de Bruijn|de '''B'''ruijn]], [[Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest|van Aardenne-'''E'''hrenfest]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|'''S'''mith]] and [[W. T. Tutte|'''T'''utte]].  The formula states that the number of Eulerian circuits in a digraph is the product of certain degree factorials and the number of rooted [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescences]].  The latter can be computed as a [[determinant]], by the [[matrix tree theorem]], giving a polynomial time algorithm.\n\nBEST theorem is first stated in this form in a \"note added in proof\" to the Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn paper (1951).  The original proof was [[bijective proof|bijective]] and generalized the [[de Bruijn sequence]]s.  It is a variation on an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941).\n\nCounting the number of Eulerian circuits on ''undirected'' graphs is much more difficult. This problem is known to be [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]].<ref>Brightwell and [[Peter Winkler|Winkler]], \"[http://www.cdam.lse.ac.uk/Reports/Files/cdam-2004-12.pdf Note on Counting Eulerian Circuits]\", 2004.</ref> In a positive direction, a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] approach, via the ''Kotzig transformations'' (introduced by [[Anton Kotzig]] in 1968) is believed to give a sharp approximation for the number of Eulerian circuits in a graph, though as yet there is no proof of this fact (even for graphs of bounded degree).\n\n=== Special cases ===\nThe [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic formula]] for the number of Eulerian circuits in the [[complete graph]]s was determined by [[Brendan McKay|McKay]] and Robinson (1995):<ref>[[Brendan McKay]] and Robert W.

If we are to re-run [[Robert Tarjan|Tarjan]]'s linear time bridge-finding algorithm after the removal of every edge,  Fleury's algorithm will have a time complexity of ''O''(|''E''|<sup>2</sup>). A dynamic bridge-finding algorithm of {{harvtxt|Thorup|2000}} allows this to be improved to <math>O(|E|(\\log|E|)^3\\log\\log|E|),</math> but this is still significantly slower than alternative algorithms.\n\n=== Hierholzer's algorithm ===\n[[Carl Hierholzer|Hierholzer]]'s 1873 paper provides a different method for finding Euler cycles that is more efficient than Fleury's algorithm:\n*Choose any starting vertex ''v'', and follow a trail of edges from that vertex until returning to ''v''. It is not possible to get stuck at any vertex other than ''v'', because the even degree of all vertices ensures that, when the trail enters another vertex ''w'' there must be an unused edge leaving ''w''. The tour formed in this way is a closed tour, but may not cover all the vertices and edges of the initial graph.\n*As long as there exists a vertex ''u'' that belongs to the current tour but that has adjacent edges not part of the tour, start another trail from ''u'', following unused edges until returning to ''u'', and join the tour formed in this way to the previous tour.\n*Since we assume the original graph is [[connected graph|connected]], repeating the previous step will exhaust all edges of the graph.\nBy using a data structure such as a [[doubly linked list]] to maintain the set of unused edges incident to each vertex, to maintain the list of vertices on the current tour that have unused edges, and to maintain the tour itself, the individual operations of the algorithm (finding unused edges exiting each vertex, finding a new starting vertex for a tour, and connecting two tours that share a vertex) may be performed in constant time each, so the overall algorithm takes [[linear time]], <math>O(|E|)</math>.<ref>{{citation|title=Eulerian Graphs and Related Topics: Part 1, Volume 2|volume=50|series=Annals of Discrete Mathematics|first=Herbert|last=Fleischner|publisher=Elsevier|year=1991|isbn=978-0-444-89110-5|contribution=X.1 Algorithms for Eulerian Trails|pages=[https://archive.org/details/euleriangraphsre0001flei/page/ X.1\u201313]|url=https://archive.org/details/euleriangraphsre0001flei/page/}}.</ref>\n\nThis algorithm may also be implemented with a [[Queue_(abstract_data_type)|queue]]. Because it is only possible to get stuck when the queue represents a closed tour, one should rotate the queue (remove an element from the head and add it to the tail) until unstuck, and continue until all edges are accounted for. This also takes linear time, as the number of rotations performed is never larger than <math>|E|</math>.\n\n==Counting Eulerian circuits==\n\n=== Complexity issues ===\nThe number of Eulerian circuits in ''[[Directed graph|digraphs]]'' can be calculated using the so-called '''[[BEST theorem]]''', named after [[N. G. de Bruijn|de '''B'''ruijn]], [[Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest|van Aardenne-'''E'''hrenfest]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|'''S'''mith]] and [[W. T. Tutte|'''T'''utte]].  The formula states that the number of Eulerian circuits in a digraph is the product of certain degree factorials and the number of rooted [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescences]].  The latter can be computed as a [[determinant]], by the [[matrix tree theorem]], giving a polynomial time algorithm.\n\nBEST theorem is first stated in this form in a \"note added in proof\" to the Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn paper (1951).  The original proof was [[bijective proof|bijective]] and generalized the [[de Bruijn sequence]]s.  It is a variation on an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941).\n\nCounting the number of Eulerian circuits on ''undirected'' graphs is much more difficult. This problem is known to be [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]].<ref>Brightwell and [[Peter Winkler|Winkler]], \"[http://www.cdam.lse.ac.uk/Reports/Files/cdam-2004-12.pdf Note on Counting Eulerian Circuits]\", 2004.</ref> In a positive direction, a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] approach, via the ''Kotzig transformations'' (introduced by [[Anton Kotzig]] in 1968) is believed to give a sharp approximation for the number of Eulerian circuits in a graph, though as yet there is no proof of this fact (even for graphs of bounded degree).\n\n=== Special cases ===\nThe [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic formula]] for the number of Eulerian circuits in the [[complete graph]]s was determined by [[Brendan McKay|McKay]] and Robinson (1995):<ref>[[Brendan McKay]] and Robert W.

It was notable for the destruction of five German [[U-boat]]s (the true total was not known to the British until after the war). Two [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] long-range reconnaissance aircraft were shot down by [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlet]] fighters. The fighter cover was provided by the  escort carrier {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}, which was sunk during the voyage along with a destroyer and two merchant ships. Despite the loss of the escort carrier, it was regarded as the first big convoy victory for the Allies in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\n==Background==\nThe attack on HG 76 was the last in a series of U-boat pack attacks on Gibraltar convoys which had started in the summer of 1941.\n\nPrior to this the U-boat Arm had only enough boats operational to form a single patrol line at any one time, and their focus was on the North Atlantic convoy route. Gibraltar convoys had suffered only occasional adventitious attacks by individual U-boats that had chanced on meeting one while transitting their route.\nBy summer 1941 U-boat Command ([[BdU]]) had sufficient boats to form multiple patrol lines, but this coincided with Hitler\u2019s insistence that the UBW give support to the Axis forces operating in North Africa, by sending boats into the Mediterranean and by attacking the Gibraltar traffic. This phase of the campaign had commenced with a pack attack on [[Convoy OG 69|OG 69]].\n\nFor the Allies the introduction of stable escort groups had allowed the development of convoy protection tactics, giving a measure of success in countering the wolfpack threat. However it was recognized that air cover was needed, to counter shadowing aircraft and to seek out approaching U-boats, and for reinforcement to convoys under attack to provide sufficient ships to hunt U-boats to destruction rather than simply driving them off, as so often happened. The first requirement was met with the commissioning of HMS ''Audacity'', the first in a series of merchant aircraft carriers, and the second by reinforcing the escort, and by the formation of an ASW Strike Force at Gibraltar, which would sweep ahead of a homebound convoy, to attack and destroy patrolling U boats found. By the time came for HG 76 to sail, all these measures were in place.\n\n==Forces involved==\n\n===HMS ''Audacity''===\n\n{{main article|HMS Audacity (D10)|l1=HMS Audacity}}\n''Audacity'' participated in the escort of convoy OG 76 of twenty merchant ships, which sailed from Liverpool for Gibraltar on 31 October. The escort carrier embarked [[802 Naval Air Squadron]] (802 NAS) of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] with eight [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlets]] and ten pilots.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}{{efn|The fighters were usually split into standing patrols of two aircraft, which flew over the convoy for about two hours, searching for U-boats and Condors, the danger mainly coming from deck landings.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}}} The weather was atrocious and at times pitched the flight deck {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rolled it {{nowrap|16\u00b0, with}} spray sweeping over the deck. Two Martlets took off on patrol and one managed a safe landing but the other touched down when the stern was rising and was thrown overboard, the pilot being rescued just before the Martlet sank.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\nOn 8 November, [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (''KG'' 40) sent six [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] aircraft to locate convoy SL 91, from [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]] bound for Liverpool.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}} Near noon, the radar on ''Audacity'' detected two of the Condors and a Martlet patrol was sent to intercept. One Condor escaped in cloud but two Martlets caught the second, which shot down one Martlet before the other Martlet shot it down. About three hours later, another Condor was shot down by a head-on attack and a fourth Condor escaped. ''KG'' 40 had lost a third of its operational aircraft and failed to direct any U-boats onto either convoy, OG 76 making a safe arrival at Gibraltar late on 11 November. The presence of ''Audacity'' was now known to ''KG'' 40 and to U-boat Command ([[BdU]]).{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\n===HG 76===\n\n[[File:HMS Audacity (D10).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|HMS ''Audacity'', after conversion to an [[escort carrier]]}}]]\nHG 76 comprised 32 ships homeward bound from [[Gibraltar]], many in ballast or carrying trade goods. The [[Convoy Commodore]] was Vice-Admiral R. Fitzmaurice in the steamship ''Spero''. The convoy had a strong escort, consisting of [[36th Escort Group (Royal Navy)|36th Escort Group]] ([[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] [[Frederic John Walker|F. J. \"Johnnie\" Walker]]), usually composed of two {{sclass-|Bittern|sloop|0}} sloops ({{HMS|Stork|L81|6}} and {{HMS|Deptford|U53|2}}) and seven [[corvette]]s (''Convolvulus'', ''Gardenia'', ''Marigold'', ''Pentstemon'', ''Rhodedendron'', ''Samphire'' and ''Vetch'').{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=396}} Walker, a skilled anti-submarine warfare expert, had taken command of EG 36 in October and  brought the group down to Gibraltar in November with OG 76. He had exercised the group there in anti-submarine patrols that had resulted in the destruction of ''U-433'' by ''Marigold''.{{sfn|Wemyss|2003|pp=19\u201321}} This force was augmented by the new [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Audacity||2}} and her three escorting [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Blankney|L30|2}}, {{HMS|Stanley|I73|2}} and {{HMS|Exmoor|L08|2}}, plus the sloops {{HMS|Fowey|L15|2}}, {{HMS|Black Swan|L57|2}} and the corvettes ''Carnation'' and ''La Malouine'', also at Gibraltar. This made a total escort of 17 warships.{{sfn|Kaplan|2014|p=120}} A group of destroyers from Force H in Gibraltar, comprising {{HMS|Croome|L62|6}}, {{HMS|Gurkha|G63|2}}, {{HMS|Foxhound|H69|2}} and {{HMAS|Nestor|G02|2}} sailed as an independent U-boat hunting force.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=108}}\n\n===''Seer\u00e4uber''===\n{{main article|Wolfpack (naval tactic)|l1=''Rudeltaktik'' (Wolfpack)}}\n\nSince August 1940, D\u00f6nitz had ended the practice of U-boats freelancing and sending only one report per day. U-boat commanders were ordered to signal whenever they found a convoy and shadow it rather than attack. The commander was to send short homing signals every thirty minutes, to guide other U-boats to the convoy. When the pack had assembled, D\u00f6nitz gave the order to attack, usually at night, so that the U-boats could fire their torpedoes on the surface. For the tactic to work, U-boats had to signal their positions to D\u00f6nitz at Kerneval (across the river from [[Keroman Submarine Base]] at [[Lorient]] in [[Brittany]]).{{sfn|Sebag|2001|pp=106\u2013108}}{{efn|If the British could break into [[Enigma machine|naval Enigma]], the position reports would be read.{{sfn|Sebag|2001|p=108}}}} Closer to land, when Condors on {{lang|de|F\u00fchlungshalter}} patrol sighted a convoy, the wireless operator reported its position and course to the BdU and relays of Condors remained over the convoy.{{sfn|Air|2001|p=107}} When the position of a convoy was established, the information was passed to the senior officer of a group of U-boats organised for pack attacks, who ordered the boat nearest to the convoy to shadow it and guide the rest by wireless. When the pack had rendezvoused near the convoy, surface attacks would be made on successive nights, the U-boats withdrawing during the day.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=354\u2013355}}\n\nIn mid December U boat Command was informed that a convoy was assembling at Gibraltar. German agents stationed in the Spanish city of [[Algeciras]], in neutral Spain, were able to overlook the harbour and report any and all activity there, without hindrance from the Axis-friendly Spanish authorities.\nBdU began to assemble a patrol line, code-named ''Seerauber'' (\"Pirate\"), preparatory to launching a pack attack.  Seerauber was an ''ad hoc'' group, as the previous patrol group, code-named ''Steuben'', had disbanded following a fruitless pursuit of\u00a0south-bound OS 12.\n''Seerauber'', comprised seven U-boats: One (''[[German submarine U-67 (1940)|U-67]]'') already in position after a failed attack on OG 77; two from Group ''Steuben'', (''[[German submarine U-434|U-434]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-574|U-574]]'') that had refueled from a clandestine depot ship in [[Vigo]] harbour: two boats (''[[German submarine U-127 (1941)|U-127]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-131 (1941)|U-131]]'') newly arrived from Germany, and two boats (''[[German submarine U-107 (1940)|U-107]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-108 (1940)|U-108]]'') out from bases in France. The group was less than ideal: Five of the seven were Type IX boats, which D\u00f6nitz considered unsuitable for wolfpack attacks, and five of the seven were inexperienced, being on their first patrols <ref>Blair p409</ref>\nThe pack had orders to sink ''Audacity'' at all costs; the pack was reinforced later by three more boats.

The first sightings of HG 76 were made by [[German submarine U-74 (1940)|''U-74'']] and [[German submarine U-77 (1940)|''U-77'']], both ''en route'' to the Mediterranean and about to transit the Straits.<ref>Blair p 410</ref> ''U-77'' sank one ship from the Cape Town convoy, but ''U-74'' was unable to attack HG 76; [[Fairey Swordfish]] aircraft of [[RAF Gibraltar|RAF Gibraltar Command]] were escorting the convoy and on three occasions during the night of {{nowrap|14/15 December,}} drove off the U-boats.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=725}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|p=351}} The ''Seerauber'' boats formed a patrol line south of [[Cape St Vincent]] but HG 76 passed through the line without detection.

It was notable for the destruction of five German [[U-boat]]s (the true total was not known to the British until after the war). Two [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] long-range reconnaissance aircraft were shot down by [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlet]] fighters. The fighter cover was provided by the  escort carrier {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}, which was sunk during the voyage along with a destroyer and two merchant ships. Despite the loss of the escort carrier, it was regarded as the first big convoy victory for the Allies in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\n==Background==\nThe attack on HG 76 was the last in a series of U-boat pack attacks on Gibraltar convoys which had started in the summer of 1941.\n\nPrior to this the U-boat Arm had only enough boats operational to form a single patrol line at any one time, and their focus was on the North Atlantic convoy route. Gibraltar convoys had suffered only occasional adventitious attacks by individual U-boats that had chanced on meeting one while transitting their route. \nBy summer 1941 U-boat Command ([[BdU]]) had sufficient boats to form multiple patrol lines, but this coincided with Hitler\u2019s insistence that the UBW give support to the Axis forces operating in North Africa, by sending boats into the Mediterranean and by attacking the Gibraltar traffic. This phase of the campaign had commenced with a pack attack on [[Convoy OG 69|OG 69]].\n\nFor the Allies the introduction of stable escort groups had allowed the development of convoy protection tactics, giving a measure of success in countering the wolfpack threat. However it was recognized that air cover was needed, to counter shadowing aircraft and to seek out approaching U-boats, and for reinforcement to convoys under attack to provide sufficient ships to hunt U-boats to destruction rather than simply driving them off, as so often happened. The first requirement was met with the commissioning of HMS ''Audacity'', the first in a series of merchant aircraft carriers, and the second by reinforcing the escort, and by the formation of an ASW Strike Force at Gibraltar, which would sweep ahead of a homebound convoy, to attack and destroy patrolling U boats found. By the time came for HG 76 to sail, all these measures were in place.\n\n==Forces involved==\n\n===HMS ''Audacity''===\n\n{{main article|HMS Audacity (D10)|l1=HMS Audacity}}\n''Audacity'' participated in the escort of convoy OG 76 of twenty merchant ships, which sailed from Liverpool for Gibraltar on 31 October. The escort carrier embarked [[802 Naval Air Squadron]] (802 NAS) of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] with eight [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlets]] and ten pilots.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}{{efn|The fighters were usually split into standing patrols of two aircraft, which flew over the convoy for about two hours, searching for U-boats and Condors, the danger mainly coming from deck landings.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}}} The weather was atrocious and at times pitched the flight deck {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rolled it {{nowrap|16\u00b0, with}} spray sweeping over the deck. Two Martlets took off on patrol and one managed a safe landing but the other touched down when the stern was rising and was thrown overboard, the pilot being rescued just before the Martlet sank.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\nOn 8 November, [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (''KG'' 40) sent six [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] aircraft to locate convoy SL 91, from [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]] bound for Liverpool.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}} Near noon, the radar on ''Audacity'' detected two of the Condors and a Martlet patrol was sent to intercept. One Condor escaped in cloud but two Martlets caught the second, which shot down one Martlet before the other Martlet shot it down. About three hours later, another Condor was shot down by a head-on attack and a fourth Condor escaped. ''KG'' 40 had lost a third of its operational aircraft and failed to direct any U-boats onto either convoy, OG 76 making a safe arrival at Gibraltar late on 11 November. The presence of ''Audacity'' was now known to ''KG'' 40 and to U-boat Command ([[BdU]]).{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\n===HG 76===\n\n[[File:HMS Audacity (D10).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|HMS ''Audacity'', after conversion to an [[escort carrier]]}}]]\nHG 76 comprised 32 ships homeward bound from [[Gibraltar]], many in ballast or carrying trade goods. The [[Convoy Commodore]] was Vice-Admiral R. Fitzmaurice in the steamship ''Spero''. The convoy had a strong escort, consisting of [[36th Escort Group (Royal Navy)|36th Escort Group]] ([[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] [[Frederic John Walker|F. J. \"Johnnie\" Walker]]), usually composed of two {{sclass-|Bittern|sloop|0}} sloops ({{HMS|Stork|L81|6}} and {{HMS|Deptford|U53|2}}) and seven [[corvette]]s (''Convolvulus'', ''Gardenia'', ''Marigold'', ''Pentstemon'', ''Rhodedendron'', ''Samphire'' and ''Vetch'').{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=396}} Walker, a skilled anti-submarine warfare expert, had taken command of EG 36 in October and  brought the group down to Gibraltar in November with OG 76. He had exercised the group there in anti-submarine patrols that had resulted in the destruction of ''U-433'' by ''Marigold''.{{sfn|Wemyss|2003|pp=19\u201321}} This force was augmented by the new [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Audacity||2}} and her three escorting [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Blankney|L30|2}}, {{HMS|Stanley|I73|2}} and {{HMS|Exmoor|L08|2}}, plus the sloops {{HMS|Fowey|L15|2}}, {{HMS|Black Swan|L57|2}} and the corvettes ''Carnation'' and ''La Malouine'', also at Gibraltar. This made a total escort of 17 warships.{{sfn|Kaplan|2014|p=120}} A group of destroyers from Force H in Gibraltar, comprising {{HMS|Croome|L62|6}}, {{HMS|Gurkha|G63|2}}, {{HMS|Foxhound|H69|2}} and {{HMAS|Nestor|G02|2}} sailed as an independent U-boat hunting force.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=108}}\n\n===''Seer\u00e4uber''===\n{{main article|Wolfpack (naval tactic)|l1=''Rudeltaktik'' (Wolfpack)}}\n\nSince August 1940, D\u00f6nitz had ended the practice of U-boats freelancing and sending only one report per day. U-boat commanders were ordered to signal whenever they found a convoy and shadow it rather than attack. The commander was to send short homing signals every thirty minutes, to guide other U-boats to the convoy. When the pack had assembled, D\u00f6nitz gave the order to attack, usually at night, so that the U-boats could fire their torpedoes on the surface. For the tactic to work, U-boats had to signal their positions to D\u00f6nitz at Kerneval (across the river from [[Keroman Submarine Base]] at [[Lorient]] in [[Brittany]]).{{sfn|Sebag|2001|pp=106\u2013108}}{{efn|If the British could break into [[Enigma machine|naval Enigma]], the position reports would be read.{{sfn|Sebag|2001|p=108}}}} Closer to land, when Condors on {{lang|de|F\u00fchlungshalter}} patrol sighted a convoy, the wireless operator reported its position and course to the BdU and relays of Condors remained over the convoy.{{sfn|Air|2001|p=107}} When the position of a convoy was established, the information was passed to the senior officer of a group of U-boats organised for pack attacks, who ordered the boat nearest to the convoy to shadow it and guide the rest by wireless. When the pack had rendezvoused near the convoy, surface attacks would be made on successive nights, the U-boats withdrawing during the day.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=354\u2013355}}\n\nIn mid December U boat Command was informed that a convoy was assembling at Gibraltar. German agents stationed in the Spanish city of [[Algeciras]], in neutral Spain, were able to overlook the harbour and report any and all activity there, without hindrance from the Axis-friendly Spanish authorities.\nBdU began to assemble a patrol line, code-named ''Seerauber'' (\"Pirate\"), preparatory to launching a pack attack.  Seerauber was an ''ad hoc'' group, as the previous patrol group, code-named ''Steuben'', had disbanded following a fruitless pursuit of\u00a0south-bound OS 12.\n''Seerauber'', comprised seven U-boats: One (''[[German submarine U-67 (1940)|U-67]]'') already in position after a failed attack on OG 77; two from Group ''Steuben'', (''[[German submarine U-434|U-434]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-574|U-574]]'') that had refueled from a clandestine depot ship in [[Vigo]] harbour: two boats (''[[German submarine U-127 (1941)|U-127]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-131 (1941)|U-131]]'') newly arrived from Germany, and two boats (''[[German submarine U-107 (1940)|U-107]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-108 (1940)|U-108]]'') out from bases in France. The group was less than ideal: Five of the seven were Type IX boats, which D\u00f6nitz considered unsuitable for wolfpack attacks, and five of the seven were inexperienced, being on their first patrols <ref>Blair p409</ref>\nThe pack had orders to sink ''Audacity'' at all costs; the pack was reinforced later by three more boats. ''U-108'' sank a Portuguese freighter sailing independently on 14 December.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=396}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=108}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===14\u201315 December===\n[[File:Portugal topographic map-pt.png|thumb|{{centre|Topographic map showing Cape St Vincent ({{lang|pt|Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}) at the south-west extremity}}]]\nHG 76 sailed from Gibraltar on 14 December 1941, in company with a small convoy bound for Cape Town, and was reported almost immediately by German agents across the bay in neutral [[Spain]], who reported the composition, escort strength and departure time of the convoy; BdU was confused by an agent report that the convoy had returned to port. The first sightings of HG 76 were made by [[German submarine U-74 (1940)|''U-74'']] and [[German submarine U-77 (1940)|''U-77'']], both ''en route'' to the Mediterranean and about to transit the Straits.<ref>Blair p 410</ref> ''U-77'' sank one ship from the Cape Town convoy, but ''U-74'' was unable to attack HG 76; [[Fairey Swordfish]] aircraft of [[RAF Gibraltar|RAF Gibraltar Command]] were escorting the convoy and on three occasions during the night of {{nowrap|14/15 December,}} drove off the U-boats.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=725}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|p=351}} The ''Seerauber'' boats formed a patrol line south of [[Cape St Vincent]] but HG 76 passed through the line without detection.

During the night of {{nowrap|16/17 December,}} the wolf pack closed in and ''[[German submarine U-574|U-574]]'' was ordered to the area; by morning on 17 December, the convoy had passed beyond the range of Gibraltar-based aircraft and four U-boats made contact, U-67 and U-108 being forced away from the convoy.
