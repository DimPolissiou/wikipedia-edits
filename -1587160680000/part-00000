The venues were [[FM Mattsson Arena]] in Mora, and [[Ejendals Arena]] in Leksand.  The total attendance was a significant drop off from the 325,000-plus visitors at the previous World Juniors in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].\n\nFor 2007, the tournament round-robin format was changed from previous years to resemble more closely the format used in the [[National Hockey League]]. Teams would receive three points for a win in regulation, while teams winning in overtime would receive two points.  Teams losing in overtime would receive one point.  During the round-robin portion of the tournament, a five-minute, four-on-four sudden-victory overtime would be played, while the knockout games and the gold medal game would use full-strength, ten- and twenty-minute sudden-victory overtimes, respectively.  If the game remained tied after overtime, an NHL-style shootout (with three skaters instead of five, as per other international competitions) would be held.\n\nTeam [[Canada]] won its third consecutive gold medal, capping an undefeated tournament with a 4\u20132 victory over [[Russia]] in the gold medal game. The world championship for Canada was also their first on European ice in a decade; the Canadians had not won a World Junior gold medal in Europe since 1997 in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], when they defeated the [[United States]] in the gold medal game.\n\nCanadian goaltender [[Carey Price]] was named tournament MVP, garnering a 1.14 [[goals against average]] (GAA).<ref name=\"tournament_awards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/world_jrs/news_story/?ID=190989&hubname= |publisher=tsn.ca |accessdate=2007-01-05 |date=2007-01-05 |author=TSN |title=Canada beats Russia in Gold Medal Game |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108090019/http://www.tsn.ca/world_jrs/news_story/?ID=190989&hubname= |archivedate=2007-01-08 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"goaltenders\">{{cite web | title = Goalkeepers | publisher = iihf.com | author = International Ice Hockey Federation | accessdate = 2007-01-05 | date =2007-01-05 | url = http://www.iihf.com/Hydra/Tournaments_07/output/w20/hydra.iihf.com/data/iihf/output/xml/96/IHM096Z11_85A_1_0.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Venues==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

World Junior Championship]] and was held in [[Mora Municipality, Sweden|Mora]] and [[Leksand]], [[Sweden]] between December 26, 2006 and January 5, 2007. The venues were [[FM Mattsson Arena]] in Mora, and [[Ejendals Arena]] in Leksand.  The total attendance was a significant drop off from the 325,000-plus visitors at the previous World Juniors in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].\n\nFor 2007, the tournament round-robin format was changed from previous years to resemble more closely the format used in the [[National Hockey League]]. Teams would receive three points for a win in regulation, while teams winning in overtime would receive two points.  Teams losing in overtime would receive one point.  During the round-robin portion of the tournament, a five-minute, four-on-four sudden-victory overtime would be played, while the knockout games and the gold medal game would use full-strength, ten- and twenty-minute sudden-victory overtimes, respectively.  If the game remained tied after overtime, an NHL-style shootout (with three skaters instead of five, as per other international competitions) would be held.\n\nTeam [[Canada]] won its third consecutive gold medal, capping an undefeated tournament with a 4\u20132 victory over [[Russia]] in the gold medal game.

It was a wealthy town, enjoying many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and works of art which were the main attractions for the early excavators.

Like the Greeks, the Etruscans did not conquer the city militarily, but simply controlled it and Pompeii enjoyed a sort of autonomy.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/>{{RP|63}} Nevertheless, Pompeii became a member of the [[Etruscan cities|Etruscan League of cities]].<ref>W.

Graduate School of The University of Texas, p. 56</ref>\n\nThe [[Samnites]], people from the areas of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]], and allies of the Romans, conquered Greek Cumae between 423 and 420 BC and it is likely that all the surrounding territory, including Pompeii, was already conquered around 424 BC. The new rulers gradually imposed their architecture and enlarged the town.\n\nFrom 343\u2013341 BC in the [[Samnite Wars]], the first Roman army entered the Campanian plain bringing with it the customs and traditions of Rome, and in the Roman [[Latin War]] from 340 BC the Samnites were faithful to Rome. Pompeii, although governed by the Samnites, entered the Roman orbit, to which it remained faithful even during the third Samnite war and in the war against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. In the late 4th century BC the city began to expand from its nucleus and into the open walled area. The street plan of the new areas was more regular and more conformal to [[Hippodamus]]'s street plan. The city walls were reinforced in [[Sarno]] stone in the early 3rd century BC (the limestone ''enceinte'', or the \"first Samnite wall\"). It formed the basis for the currently visible walls with an outer wall of rectangular limestone blocks as a terrace wall supporting a large ''[[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]'', or earth embankment, behind it.\n\nAfter the [[Samnite Wars]] from 290 BC, Pompeii was forced to accept the status of ''[[socii]]'' of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy.\n\nFrom the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201 BC) in which Pompeii remained faithful to Rome, an additional internal wall was built of [[tufa]] and the internal ''agger'' and outer fa\u00e7ade raised resulting in a double parapet with wider wall-walk.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/> Despite the political uncertainty of these events and the progressive migration of wealthy men to quieter cities in the eastern Mediterranean, Pompeii continued to flourish due to the production and trade of wine and oil with places like [[Provence]] and Spain,<ref>Paul Zanker, ''Pompeii: society, urban images and forms of living'', Turin, Giulio Einaudi Editore, 1993. {{ISBN|88-06-13282-2}} p. 60</ref> as well as to intensive agriculture on farms around the city.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, Pompeii enriched itself by taking part in Rome's conquest of the east as shown by a statue of Apollo in the Forum erected by [[Lucius Mummius]] in gratitude for their support in the sack of [[Corinth]] and the eastern campaigns. These riches enabled Pompeii to bloom and expand to its ultimate limits. The [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] and many public and private buildings of high architectural quality were built, including the large theatre, the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, the Stabian Baths and a new two-story portico.<ref>ecolo a.C.\" In Sicilia ellenistica, consuetudo italica.

Many nearby buildings inside the walls were also destroyed.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W.

Many of Sulla's veterans were given land and property in and around the city, while many of those who opposed Rome were dispossessed of their property. Despite this, the Pompeians were granted [[Roman citizenship]] and they were quickly assimilated into the Roman world. The main language in the city became Latin,<ref name=\"Pompeii\">{{cite book |last = Beard |first = Mary |title = Pompeii |publisher = Profile Books LTD|isbn = 978-1-86197-596-6|date = 2008}}</ref> and many of Pompeii's old aristocratic families Latinized their names as a sign of assimilation.<ref name=\"Pompeii-The Living City\">{{cite book|last = Butterworth|first = Alex|title = Pompeii \u2013 The Living City|publisher = St Martin's Press; 1st edition|isbn = 978-0-312-35585-2|date = 2005|url = https://archive.org/details/pompeiilivingcit00alex}}</ref> \n\nThe city became an important passage for goods that arrived by sea and had to be sent toward Rome or [[southern Italy]] along the nearby [[Appian Way]]. Many public buildings were built or refurbished and improved under the new order; new buildings included the amphitheatre in 70 BC,   the Forum Baths and the ''theatrum tectum'' while the forum was embellished with the colonnade of Popidius before 80 BC.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 172</ref> These buildings raised the status of Pompeii as a cultural centre in the region as it outshone its neighbours in the number of places for entertainment which significantly enhanced the social and economic development of the city.\n\nUnder [[Augustus]] from about 30 BC a major expansion in new public buildings, as in the rest of the empire, included the Eumachia building, the Sanctuary of Augustus and the [[Macellum]]. From about 20 BC, Pompeii was fed with running water by a spur from the Serino aqueduct or [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)]] built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].\n\nIn AD 59, there was a serious riot and bloodshed in the amphitheatre between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]ns (which is recorded in a fresco) and which led the Roman senate to send the [[Praetorian Guard]] to restore order and to ban further events for a period of ten years.<ref>Tacitus: Ann. 14.17</ref><ref>See W.

Chaos followed the earthquake; fires caused by oil lamps that had fallen during the quake added to the panic. The nearby cities of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Nuceria]] were also affected.<ref name=\"archaeology1\"/>\n\nBetween 62 and the eruption in 79 most rebuilding was done in the private sector and older, damaged frescoes were often covered with newer ones, for example. In the public sector the opportunity was taken to improve buildings and the city plan e.g. in the forum.<ref>''The World of Pompeii'', Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 173</ref> \n\nAn important field of current research concerns structures that were restored between the earthquake of 62 and the eruption. It was thought until recently that some of the damage had still not been repaired at the time of the eruption but this has been shown to be doubtful as the evidence of missing forum statues and marble wall-veneers are most likely due to robbers after the city's burial.<ref>Dobbins, J.

The new baths took over a whole ''insula'' by demolishing houses, which may have been made easier by the earthquake that had damaged these houses. This shows that the city was still flourishing rather than struggling to recover from the earthquake.<ref>John J. Dobbins, Pedar W.

By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nA multidisciplinary [[Vulcanology|volcanological]] and [[Biological anthropology|bio-anthropological]] study<ref>{{Harvnb|Mastrolorenzo|Petrone|Pappalardo|Guarino|2010|p=e11127}}.</ref> of the eruption products and victims, merged with numerical simulations and experiments, indicates that at Pompeii and surrounding towns [[heat]] was the main cause of death of people, previously believed to have died by ash [[suffocation]]. The results of the study, published in 2010, show that exposure to at least {{convert|250|C|F|-1}} hot [[pyroclastic flows]] at a distance of {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the vent was sufficient to cause instant death, even if people were sheltered within buildings. The people and buildings of Pompeii were covered in up to 12 different layers of [[tephra]], in total up to {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} deep.\n\n[[Pliny the Younger]] provided a first-hand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from his position across the [[Bay of Naples]] at [[Misenum]] but written 25 years after the event. His uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], with whom he had a close relationship, died while attempting to rescue stranded victims. As admiral of the fleet, Pliny the Elder had ordered the ships of the Imperial Navy stationed at Misenum to cross the bay to assist evacuation attempts. Volcanologists have recognised the importance of Pliny the Younger's account of the eruption by calling similar events \"[[Plinian eruption|Plinian]]\".

The land on which Pompeii lies was expropriated and up to 700 workers were used in the excavations. The excavated areas in the north and south were connected. Parts of the Via dell'Abbondanza were also exposed in west\u2013east direction and for the first time an impression of the size and appearance of the ancient town could be appreciated. In the following years, the excavators struggled with lack of money and excavations progressed slowly, but with significant finds such as the houses of the [[House of the Faun|Faun]], of [[Meleager]], the [[House of the Tragic Poet|Tragic Poet]] and the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]].\n\n[[Giuseppe Fiorelli]] took charge of the excavations in 1863 and made greater progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/pompeii_rediscovery_01.shtml#two |title=Pompeii: Its Discovery and Preservation |first=Salvatore Ciro |last=Nappo |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |website=BBC |quote=Giuseppe Fiorelli directed the Pompeii excavation from 1863 to 1875 }}</ref> During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains.

This technique is still in use today, with a clear [[resin]] now used instead of plaster because it is more durable, and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pompeionline.net/edifici/regione-i/pompei-orto-dei-fuggiaschi|last=Gracco|first=Tiberio|title=Orto dei Fuggiaschi|website=Pompei Online|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFiorelli also introduced scientific documentation. He divided the city into the present nine areas (''regiones'') and blocks (''insulae'') and numbered the entrances of the individual houses (''domus''), so that each is identified by these three numbers. Fiorelli also published the first periodical with excavation reports. Under Fiorelli's successors the entire west of the city was exposed.\n\n===Modern archaeology===\n\nIn the 1920s [[Amedeo Maiuri]] excavated for the first time in older layers than that of 79 AD in order to learn about the settlement history. Maiuri made the last excavations on a grand scale in the 1950s, and the area south of the Via dell'Abbondanza and the city wall was almost completely uncovered, but they were poorly documented scientifically. Preservation was haphazard and presents today's archaeologists with great difficulty. Questionable reconstruction was done in the 1980s and 1990s after the severe earthquake of 1980, which caused great destruction. Since then, except for targeted soundings and excavations, work was confined to the excavated areas. Further excavations on a large scale are not planned and today archaeologists try to reconstruct, to document and, above all, to stop the ever faster decay.\n\nUnder the ''Great Pompeii Project'' over 2.5&nbsp;km of ancient walls are being relieved of danger of collapse by treating the unexcavated areas behind the street fronts in order to increase drainage and reduce the pressure of ground water and earth on the walls, a problem especially in the rainy season. As of August 2019, these excavations have resumed on unexcavated areas of ''Regio V''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pompeiisites.org/en/press-kit-en/discoveries-continue-at-the-regio-v-site/ |title=Discoveries Continue at the Regio V Site |website=Archaeological Park of Pompeii |access-date=August 20, 2019 |date=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation ===\n{{Main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}\n\nObjects buried beneath Pompeii were well-preserved for almost 2,000 years as the lack of air and moisture allowed little to no deterioration. However, once exposed, Pompeii has been subject to both natural and man-made forces, which have rapidly increased deterioration.\n\nWeathering, erosion, light exposure, water damage, poor methods of excavation and reconstruction, introduced plants and animals, tourism, vandalism and theft have all damaged the site in some way. The lack of adequate weather protection of all but the most interesting and important buildings has allowed original interior decoration to fade or be lost. Two-thirds of the city has been excavated, but the remnants of the city are rapidly deteriorating.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/ashes-to-ashes-the-latter-day-ruin-of-pompeii |last=Popham |first=Peter |title=Ashes to ashes: the latter-day ruin of Pompeii |journal=Prospect Magazine |date=May 2010 |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, during [[World War II]] many buildings were badly damaged or destroyed by bombs dropped in several raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/destruction.html |title=The Last Days of Pompeii: Destruction in World War II |access-date=August 27, 2019 |website=The J.

Agricultural policymaker [[Columella]] suggested that each vineyard in Rome produced a quota of three [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|cullei]] of wine per [[jugerum]], otherwise the vineyard would be uprooted. The nutrient-rich lands near Pompeii were extremely efficient at this and were often able to exceed these requirements by a steep margin, therefore providing the incentive for local wineries to establish themselves.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> While wine was exported for Pompeii's economy, the majority of the other agricultural goods were likely produced in quantities sufficient for the city's consumption.\n\nRemains of large formations of constructed wineries were found in the ''[[Forum Boarium]]'', covered by cemented casts from the eruption of Vesuvius.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> It is speculated that these historical vineyards are strikingly similar in structure to the modern day vineyards across Italy.\n\nCarbonised food plant remains, roots, seeds and pollens, have been found from gardens in Pompeii, Herculaneum and from the Roman villa at [[Torre Annunziata]].

It was a wealthy town, enjoying many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and works of art which were the main attractions for the early excavators.

Like the Greeks, the Etruscans did not conquer the city militarily, but simply controlled it and Pompeii enjoyed a sort of autonomy.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/>{{RP|63}} Nevertheless, Pompeii became a member of the [[Etruscan cities|Etruscan League of cities]].<ref>W.

Graduate School of The University of Texas, p. 56</ref>\n\nThe [[Samnites]], people from the areas of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]], and allies of the Romans, conquered Greek Cumae between 423 and 420 BC and it is likely that all the surrounding territory, including Pompeii, was already conquered around 424 BC. The new rulers gradually imposed their architecture and enlarged the town.\n\nFrom 343\u2013341 BC in the [[Samnite Wars]], the first Roman army entered the Campanian plain bringing with it the customs and traditions of Rome, and in the Roman [[Latin War]] from 340 BC the Samnites were faithful to Rome. Pompeii, although governed by the Samnites, entered the Roman orbit, to which it remained faithful even during the third Samnite war and in the war against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. In the late 4th century BC the city began to expand from its nucleus and into the open walled area. The street plan of the new areas was more regular and more conformal to [[Hippodamus]]'s street plan. The city walls were reinforced in [[Sarno]] stone in the early 3rd century BC (the limestone ''enceinte'', or the \"first Samnite wall\"). It formed the basis for the currently visible walls with an outer wall of rectangular limestone blocks as a terrace wall supporting a large ''[[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]'', or earth embankment, behind it.\n\nAfter the [[Samnite Wars]] from 290 BC, Pompeii was forced to accept the status of ''[[socii]]'' of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy.\n\nFrom the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201 BC) in which Pompeii remained faithful to Rome, an additional internal wall was built of [[tufa]] and the internal ''agger'' and outer fa\u00e7ade raised resulting in a double parapet with wider wall-walk.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/> Despite the political uncertainty of these events and the progressive migration of wealthy men to quieter cities in the eastern Mediterranean, Pompeii continued to flourish due to the production and trade of wine and oil with places like [[Provence]] and Spain,<ref>Paul Zanker, ''Pompeii: society, urban images and forms of living'', Turin, Giulio Einaudi Editore, 1993. {{ISBN|88-06-13282-2}} p. 60</ref> as well as to intensive agriculture on farms around the city.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, Pompeii enriched itself by taking part in Rome's conquest of the east as shown by a statue of Apollo in the Forum erected by [[Lucius Mummius]] in gratitude for their support in the sack of [[Corinth]] and the eastern campaigns. These riches enabled Pompeii to bloom and expand to its ultimate limits. The [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] and many public and private buildings of high architectural quality were built, including the large theatre, the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, the Stabian Baths and a new two-story portico.<ref>ecolo a.C.\" In Sicilia ellenistica, consuetudo italica.

Many nearby buildings inside the walls were also destroyed.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W.

Many of Sulla's veterans were given land and property in and around the city, while many of those who opposed Rome were dispossessed of their property. Despite this, the Pompeians were granted [[Roman citizenship]] and they were quickly assimilated into the Roman world. The main language in the city became Latin,<ref name=\"Pompeii\">{{cite book |last = Beard |first = Mary |title = Pompeii |publisher = Profile Books LTD|isbn = 978-1-86197-596-6|date = 2008}}</ref> and many of Pompeii's old aristocratic families Latinized their names as a sign of assimilation.<ref name=\"Pompeii-The Living City\">{{cite book|last = Butterworth|first = Alex|title = Pompeii \u2013 The Living City|publisher = St Martin's Press; 1st edition|isbn = 978-0-312-35585-2|date = 2005|url = https://archive.org/details/pompeiilivingcit00alex}}</ref> \n\nThe city became an important passage for goods that arrived by sea and had to be sent toward Rome or [[southern Italy]] along the nearby [[Appian Way]]. Many public buildings were built or refurbished and improved under the new order; new buildings included the amphitheatre in 70 BC,   the Forum Baths and the ''theatrum tectum'' while the forum was embellished with the colonnade of Popidius before 80 BC.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 172</ref> These buildings raised the status of Pompeii as a cultural centre in the region as it outshone its neighbours in the number of places for entertainment which significantly enhanced the social and economic development of the city.\n\nUnder [[Augustus]] from about 30 BC a major expansion in new public buildings, as in the rest of the empire, included the Eumachia building, the Sanctuary of Augustus and the [[Macellum]]. From about 20 BC, Pompeii was fed with running water by a spur from the Serino aqueduct or [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)]] built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].\n\nIn AD 59, there was a serious riot and bloodshed in the amphitheatre between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]ns (which is recorded in a fresco) and which led the Roman senate to send the [[Praetorian Guard]] to restore order and to ban further events for a period of ten years.<ref>Tacitus: Ann. 14.17</ref><ref>See W.

Chaos followed the earthquake; fires caused by oil lamps that had fallen during the quake added to the panic. The nearby cities of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Nuceria]] were also affected.<ref name=\"archaeology1\"/>\n\nBetween 62 and the eruption in 79 most rebuilding was done in the private sector and older, damaged frescoes were often covered with newer ones, for example. In the public sector the opportunity was taken to improve buildings and the city plan e.g. in the forum.<ref>''The World of Pompeii'', Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 173</ref> \n\nAn important field of current research concerns structures that were restored between the earthquake of 62 and the eruption. It was thought until recently that some of the damage had still not been repaired at the time of the eruption but this has been shown to be doubtful as the evidence of missing forum statues and marble wall-veneers are most likely due to robbers after the city's burial.<ref>Dobbins, J.

The new baths took over a whole ''insula'' by demolishing houses, which may have been made easier by the earthquake that had damaged these houses. This shows that the city was still flourishing rather than struggling to recover from the earthquake.<ref>John J. Dobbins, Pedar W.

By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nA multidisciplinary [[Vulcanology|volcanological]] and [[Biological anthropology|bio-anthropological]] study<ref>{{Harvnb|Mastrolorenzo|Petrone|Pappalardo|Guarino|2010|p=e11127}}.</ref> of the eruption products and victims, merged with numerical simulations and experiments, indicates that at Pompeii and surrounding towns [[heat]] was the main cause of death of people, previously believed to have died by ash [[suffocation]]. The results of the study, published in 2010, show that exposure to at least {{convert|250|C|F|-1}} hot [[pyroclastic flows]] at a distance of {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the vent was sufficient to cause instant death, even if people were sheltered within buildings. The people and buildings of Pompeii were covered in up to 12 different layers of [[tephra]], in total up to {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} deep.\n\n[[Pliny the Younger]] provided a first-hand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from his position across the [[Bay of Naples]] at [[Misenum]] but written 25 years after the event. His uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], with whom he had a close relationship, died while attempting to rescue stranded victims. As admiral of the fleet, Pliny the Elder had ordered the ships of the Imperial Navy stationed at Misenum to cross the bay to assist evacuation attempts. Volcanologists have recognised the importance of Pliny the Younger's account of the eruption by calling similar events \"[[Plinian eruption|Plinian]]\".

The land on which Pompeii lies was expropriated and up to 700 workers were used in the excavations. The excavated areas in the north and south were connected. Parts of the Via dell'Abbondanza were also exposed in west\u2013east direction and for the first time an impression of the size and appearance of the ancient town could be appreciated. In the following years, the excavators struggled with lack of money and excavations progressed slowly, but with significant finds such as the houses of the [[House of the Faun|Faun]], of [[Meleager]], the [[House of the Tragic Poet|Tragic Poet]] and the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]].\n\n[[Giuseppe Fiorelli]] took charge of the excavations in 1863 and made greater progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/pompeii_rediscovery_01.shtml#two |title=Pompeii: Its Discovery and Preservation |first=Salvatore Ciro |last=Nappo |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |website=BBC |quote=Giuseppe Fiorelli directed the Pompeii excavation from 1863 to 1875 }}</ref> During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains.

This technique is still in use today, with a clear [[resin]] now used instead of plaster because it is more durable, and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pompeionline.net/edifici/regione-i/pompei-orto-dei-fuggiaschi|last=Gracco|first=Tiberio|title=Orto dei Fuggiaschi|website=Pompei Online|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFiorelli also introduced scientific documentation. He divided the city into the present nine areas (''regiones'') and blocks (''insulae'') and numbered the entrances of the individual houses (''domus''), so that each is identified by these three numbers. Fiorelli also published the first periodical with excavation reports. Under Fiorelli's successors the entire west of the city was exposed.\n\n===Modern archaeology===\n\nIn the 1920s [[Amedeo Maiuri]] excavated for the first time in older layers than that of 79 AD in order to learn about the settlement history. Maiuri made the last excavations on a grand scale in the 1950s, and the area south of the Via dell'Abbondanza and the city wall was almost completely uncovered, but they were poorly documented scientifically. Preservation was haphazard and presents today's archaeologists with great difficulty. Questionable reconstruction was done in the 1980s and 1990s after the severe earthquake of 1980, which caused great destruction. Since then, except for targeted soundings and excavations, work was confined to the excavated areas. Further excavations on a large scale are not planned and today archaeologists try to reconstruct, to document and, above all, to stop the ever faster decay.\n\nUnder the ''Great Pompeii Project'' over 2.5&nbsp;km of ancient walls are being relieved of danger of collapse by treating the unexcavated areas behind the street fronts in order to increase drainage and reduce the pressure of ground water and earth on the walls, a problem especially in the rainy season. As of August 2019, these excavations have resumed on unexcavated areas of ''Regio V''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pompeiisites.org/en/press-kit-en/discoveries-continue-at-the-regio-v-site/ |title=Discoveries Continue at the Regio V Site |website=Archaeological Park of Pompeii |access-date=August 20, 2019 |date=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation ===\n{{Main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}\n\nObjects buried beneath Pompeii were well-preserved for almost 2,000 years as the lack of air and moisture allowed little to no deterioration. However, once exposed, Pompeii has been subject to both natural and man-made forces, which have rapidly increased deterioration.\n\nWeathering, erosion, light exposure, water damage, poor methods of excavation and reconstruction, introduced plants and animals, tourism, vandalism and theft have all damaged the site in some way. The lack of adequate weather protection of all but the most interesting and important buildings has allowed original interior decoration to fade or be lost. Two-thirds of the city has been excavated, but the remnants of the city are rapidly deteriorating.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/ashes-to-ashes-the-latter-day-ruin-of-pompeii |last=Popham |first=Peter |title=Ashes to ashes: the latter-day ruin of Pompeii |journal=Prospect Magazine |date=May 2010 |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, during [[World War II]] many buildings were badly damaged or destroyed by bombs dropped in several raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/destruction.html |title=The Last Days of Pompeii: Destruction in World War II |access-date=August 27, 2019 |website=The J.

Agricultural policymaker [[Columella]] suggested that each vineyard in Rome produced a quota of three [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|cullei]] of wine per [[jugerum]], otherwise the vineyard would be uprooted. The nutrient-rich lands near Pompeii were extremely efficient at this and were often able to exceed these requirements by a steep margin, therefore providing the incentive for local wineries to establish themselves.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> While wine was exported for Pompeii's economy, the majority of the other agricultural goods were likely produced in quantities sufficient for the city's consumption.\n\nRemains of large formations of constructed wineries were found in the ''[[Forum Boarium]]'', covered by cemented casts from the eruption of Vesuvius.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> It is speculated that these historical vineyards are strikingly similar in structure to the modern day vineyards across Italy.\n\nCarbonised food plant remains, roots, seeds and pollens, have been found from gardens in Pompeii, Herculaneum and from the Roman villa at [[Torre Annunziata]].

Most of the show alternates between [[Aerobatic maneuver|maneuver]]s performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400&nbsp;mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. The highest speed flown during an air show is 700&nbsp;mph (just under Mach 1) and the lowest speed is 120&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back, belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the [[Delta Formation]].\n\nThe parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime: in clear weather the ''high'' show is performed; in overcast conditions a ''low'' show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the ''flat'' show is presented.

The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC [[Naval Aviator]]s. Pilots serve two to three years,<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members. Other officers in the squadron include a [[Naval Flight Officer]] who serves as the Events Coordinator, three USMC C-130 pilots, an Executive Officer, a Maintenance Officer, a Supply Officer, a Public Affairs Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a [[Flight Surgeon]]. Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9 and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. They serve three to four years in the squadron.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> After serving with the squadron, members return to fleet assignments.\n\nThe officer selection process requires pilots and support officers (flight surgeon, events coordinator, maintenance officer, supply officer, and public affairs officer) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain-of-command, with a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and flight records. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified. Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.gosportpensacola.com/gosport-03-02-2012.pdf |title=Gosport article, March 02, 2012, \"Blue Angels Seek Officer Applicants\", page 2 |publisher=Gosport NAS Pensacola Base Newspaper}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nApplicants \"rush\" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs, post-show activities, and social events.

During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in [[Pensacola]], Florida, in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting \"circle and arrival\" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a \"practice\" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is an off day for the Blues' demonstration pilots and road crew. Extensive aircraft maintenance is performed on Sunday evening and Monday by maintenance team members.\n\nPilots maneuver the flight stick with their right hand and operate the throttle with their left. They do not wear [[G-suit]]s because the air bladders inside repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with that stability. To prevent blood from pooling in their legs, Blue Angel pilots have developed a method for tensing their muscles to prevent blood from pooling in their lower extremities, possibly rendering them unconscious.<ref name=\"ba_faq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|title=Blue Angels Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=United States Navy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404171459/http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Blue Angels Vinage Insignia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|The original team insignia]]\n\nThe Blue Angels were originally formed in April 1946 as the ''Navy Flight Exhibition Team''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blueangelsassociation.org/flight-teams/ |title=Flight Teams, 1946 |publisher=Blue Angels Association |accessdate=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Flight Exhibition Team was first introduced as the ''Blue Angels'' during an air show in July 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first Blue Angels demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering.

Mel Cassidy, Left Wing]]\n\nThe Blue Angels were established as a Navy flight exhibition team on 24 April 1946 by order of Chief of Naval Operations [[Admiral Chester Nimitz]] to generate greater public support of naval aviation. To boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. Rear Admiral [[Ralph E. Davison|Ralph Davison]] personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin \"Butch\" Voris]], a World War II [[fighter ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, \"if anything happened, just the alligators would know\". The first four pilots and those after them, were and are some of the best and most experienced aviators in the Navy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:F8F-1 Blue Angels 1946.jpg|thumb|right|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat]]s in \"diamond\" formation, 1947]]\n\nThe team's first demonstration with [[Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat]] aircraft took place before Navy officials on 10 May 1946, and was met with enthusiastic approval. The Blue Angels performed their first public flight demonstration from their first training base and team headquarters at [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville]], Florida, on 15 and 16 June 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref> with three F6F-5 Hellcats (a fourth F6F-5 was held in reserve). On 15 June, Voris led the three Hellcats (numbered 1\u20133), specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance.<ref name=\"OFFICIAL\" /> The team employed a [[North American T-6 Texan|North American SNJ Texan]], painted and configured to simulate a [[Japanese Zero]], to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the \"Beetle Bomb\". This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the [[Spike Jones#Murdering the Classics|Spike Jones]]' ''Murdering the Classics'' series of musical satires, set to the tune (in part) of the [[William Tell Overture]] as a thoroughbred horse race scene, with \"Beetle Bomb\" being the \"trailing horse\" in the lyrics.\n\nThe team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by \"keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career.\" The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]]. During an air show at [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on 19\u201321 July 1946, the Navy Flight Exhibition Team was introduced as the ''Blue Angels''.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\">{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> The name had originated through a suggestion by Right Wing Pilot Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, after he had read about the Blue Angel nightclub in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. After ten appearances with the Hellcats, the Hellcats were replaced by the lighter, faster, and more powerful F8F-1 Bearcats on 25 August.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\"/> By the end of the year the team consisted of four Bearcats numbered 1\u20134 on the tail sections.\n\nIn May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team. The team with an additional fifth pilot, relocated to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi]], Texas. On 7 June at [[Birmingham, Alabama]], four F8F-1 Bearcats (numbered 1\u20134) flew in [[diamond formation]] for the first time which is now considered the Blue Angels' trademark. A fifth Bearcat was also added that year. A SNJ was used as a Japanese Zero for dogfights with the Bearcats in air shows.\n\nIn January 1948, Lt. Cmdr. Raleigh \" Dusty\" Rhodes took command of the Blue Angels team which was flying four Bearcats and a yellow painted SNJ with USN markings dubbed \"Beetle Bomb\"; the SNJ represented a Japanese Zero for the air show dogfights with the Bearcats. The name \"Blue Angels\" also was painted on the Bearcats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://photorecon.net/seventy-years-strong-the-u-s-navys-blue-angels/ |title=Seventy Years Strong: The U.S. Navy's Blue Angels |first=Ken (24 March 2019) |last=Kula |publisher=PHOTORECON, online Magazine |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the team acquired a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas R4D Skytrain]] for logistics to and from show sites.

The highest speed flown during an air show is 700&nbsp;mph (just under Mach 1) and the lowest speed is 120&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back, belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the [[Delta Formation]].\n\nThe parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime: in clear weather the ''high'' show is performed; in overcast conditions a ''low'' show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the ''flat'' show is presented. The ''high'' show requires at least an {{convert|8000|ft|m|-2|adj=on}} [[Ceiling (cloud)|ceiling]] and visibility of at least {{convert|3|nmi|km|0}} from the show's centerpoint.

The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC [[Naval Aviator]]s. Pilots serve two to three years,<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members. Other officers in the squadron include a [[Naval Flight Officer]] who serves as the Events Coordinator, three USMC C-130 pilots, an Executive Officer, a Maintenance Officer, a Supply Officer, a Public Affairs Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a [[Flight Surgeon]]. Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9 and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. They serve three to four years in the squadron.<ref name=\"Blueangels.navy.mil\" /> After serving with the squadron, members return to fleet assignments.\n\nThe officer selection process requires pilots and support officers (flight surgeon, events coordinator, maintenance officer, supply officer, and public affairs officer) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain-of-command, with a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and flight records. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified. Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.gosportpensacola.com/gosport-03-02-2012.pdf |title=Gosport article, March 02, 2012, \"Blue Angels Seek Officer Applicants\", page 2 |publisher=Gosport NAS Pensacola Base Newspaper}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nApplicants \"rush\" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs, post-show activities, and social events.

During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in [[Pensacola]], Florida, in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting \"circle and arrival\" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a \"practice\" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is an off day for the Blues' demonstration pilots and road crew. Extensive aircraft maintenance is performed on Sunday evening and Monday by maintenance team members.\n\nPilots maneuver the flight stick with their right hand and operate the throttle with their left. They do not wear [[G-suit]]s because the air bladders inside repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with that stability. To prevent blood from pooling in their legs, Blue Angel pilots have developed a method for tensing their muscles to prevent blood from pooling in their lower extremities, possibly rendering them unconscious.<ref name=\"ba_faq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|title=Blue Angels Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=United States Navy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404171459/http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Blue Angels Vinage Insignia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|The original team insignia]]\n\nThe Blue Angels were originally formed in April 1946 as the ''Navy Flight Exhibition Team''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blueangelsassociation.org/flight-teams/ |title=Flight Teams, 1946 |publisher=Blue Angels Association |accessdate=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Flight Exhibition Team was first introduced as the ''Blue Angels'' during an air show in July 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first Blue Angels demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering.

To boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. Rear Admiral [[Ralph E. Davison|Ralph Davison]] personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin \"Butch\" Voris]], a World War II [[fighter ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, \"if anything happened, just the alligators would know\". The first four pilots and those after them, were and are some of the best and most experienced aviators in the Navy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:F8F-1 Blue Angels 1946.jpg|thumb|right|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat]]s in \"diamond\" formation, 1947]]\n\nThe team's first demonstration with [[Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat]] aircraft took place before Navy officials on 10 May 1946, and was met with enthusiastic approval. The Blue Angels performed their first public flight demonstration from their first training base and team headquarters at [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville]], Florida, on 15 and 16 June 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blueangels.org/NANews/Articles/Aug55/Aug55.htm |title=Blue Angels Article, August 1955 |publisher=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref> with three F6F-5 Hellcats (a fourth F6F-5 was held in reserve). On 15 June, Voris led the three Hellcats (numbered 1\u20133), specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance.<ref name=\"OFFICIAL\" /> The team employed a [[North American T-6 Texan|North American SNJ Texan]], painted and configured to simulate a [[Japanese Zero]], to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the \"Beetle Bomb\". This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the [[Spike Jones#Murdering the Classics|Spike Jones]]' ''Murdering the Classics'' series of musical satires, set to the tune (in part) of the [[William Tell Overture]] as a thoroughbred horse race scene, with \"Beetle Bomb\" being the \"trailing horse\" in the lyrics.\n\nThe team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by \"keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career.\" The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]]. During an air show at [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on 19\u201321 July 1946, the Navy Flight Exhibition Team was introduced as the ''Blue Angels''.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\">{{cite web |url=https://aerobaticteams.net/en/resources/i39/Blue-Angels-History.html |title=Blue Angels History |publisher=Aerobatic Teams |accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> The name had originated through a suggestion by Right Wing Pilot Lt. Maurice \"Wick\" Wickendoll, after he had read about the Blue Angel nightclub in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. After ten appearances with the Hellcats, the Hellcats were replaced by the lighter, faster, and more powerful F8F-1 Bearcats on 25 August.<ref name=\"Blue Angels History\"/> By the end of the year the team consisted of four Bearcats numbered 1\u20134 on the tail sections.\n\nIn May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team. The team with an additional fifth pilot, relocated to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|Naval Air Station (NAS) Corpus Christi]], Texas. On 7 June at [[Birmingham, Alabama]], four F8F-1 Bearcats (numbered 1\u20134) flew in [[diamond formation]] for the first time which is now considered the Blue Angels' trademark. A fifth Bearcat was also added that year. A SNJ was used as a Japanese Zero for dogfights with the Bearcats in air shows.\n\nIn January 1948, Lt. Cmdr. Raleigh \" Dusty\" Rhodes took command of the Blue Angels team which was flying four Bearcats and a yellow painted SNJ with USN markings dubbed \"Beetle Bomb\"; the SNJ represented a Japanese Zero for the air show dogfights with the Bearcats.
