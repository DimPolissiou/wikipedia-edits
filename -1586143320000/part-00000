Helmets are not legally required, but recommended.\n\n====United States====\nIn many areas in the United States, motorized scooters are not [[Street-legal vehicle|street legal]], as they cannot be tagged, titled, insured, and do not meet federal requirements for lights or mirrors. Particular localities may have further ordinances that limit the use of motorized scooters. The top speed of the average motorized scooter is around 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour). Due to their small wheels, motorized scooters are not typically safe for street use as even the smallest bumps can cause an accident.\n\nCalifornia requires that a person riding a motorized scooter on a street be 16 years of age or older, have a valid driver's license, be wearing a bicycle helmet, have no passengers, and otherwise follow the same rules of the road the same as cars do. The motorized scooter must have brakes, may not have handlebars raised above the operator's shoulders, and if ridden at night must have a headlight, a taillight, and side reflectors. A motorized scooter may not be operated on sidewalks or on streets if the posted speed limit is over 25&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h) unless in a Class II bicycle lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |title=Scooter and Go-Ped Guidelines |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311235350/http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |archivedate=2011-03-11 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>\n\nMichigan laws treat motorized scooters similarly to bicycles.

This means there is no inspection, license, insurance, or registration required. Additionally, this means that motorized scooters are allowed on the sidewalks, and helmets are not required.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dmv.dc.gov/publication/non-traditional-motor-vehicles-and-dc-law |title=Non-Traditional Motor Vehicles and DC Law {{!}} dmv |website=dmv.dc.gov |access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nIn Atlanta, motorized scooters are considered Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, meaning they can be used on sidewalks and highways where the speed limit is at most 35 miles per hour, or in the bike lane. The law also specifies that users of Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, including motorized scooter riders, \"have the same rights and duties as prescribed for pedestrians\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dps.georgia.gov/georgia-code-low-speed-vehicles |title=Georgia Code: Low Speed Vehicles {{!}} Georgia Department of Public Safety |website=dps.georgia.gov |access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\nScooter sharing companies have rules for operation printed on both the scooter and in the app, which includes instructions to not ride on the sidewalk. Given that the laws regarding motorized scooters vary from state to state, the scooter sharing instructions can differ from the local law.\n\n==Mechanics==\n===Wheels and tires===\nThere are two general categories of tires on which stand-up scooters travel\u2014hard tires and air tires. Hard tires are generally {{convert|6|in|mm}} in diameter and constructed of a hard-plastic insert surrounded by a solid rubber tire. Air tires are most often {{convert|10|in|mm}} in diameter. They are constructed of a steel or aluminum split rim, an [[inner tube]] and rubber tire. Other, less common wheel and tire types include {{convert|8|in|mm}} and {{convert|13|in|mm}} air tires.\n\n===Transmissions===\nThe most simplistic drive mechanism of stand-up scooters is the \"spindle\" drive. This drive mechanism puts an extension of the engine's output shaft, the spindle, in direct contact with the rear tire of the scooter. In order to function correctly, the tire must have a clean, dry surface which the spindle will be able to effectively interact with. Scooters with this type of direct transmission can be pull-started with the rear wheel off the ground, or [[bump start|\"bump\"-started]] by forcefully pushing the scooter with the rear tire in contact with the ground. [[File:T3_Patroller_electric_stand-up_trike.jpg|thumb|upright|T3 Patroller electric stand-up [[tricycle]]]]\n\nSimple [[chain drive|chain reduction drives]] are also used to transfer energy to the rear wheel from the engine.  These generally incorporate a type of [[centrifugal clutch]] to allow the engine to idle independently.\n\n[[Belt (mechanical)|Belt]] reduction drives use the combination of wide flat \"cog\" belts and pulleys to transfer power to the rear wheel. Like chain drives, belt drives include a centrifugal clutch. Belt drives are more susceptible to breakage in off-road conditions.\n\n===Suspension===\nThe suspension systems of stand-up scooters range from simplistic spring based [[Suspension fork|fork systems]] to the complicated, dampened cam-link and C.I.D.L.I<ref>Cantilevered Independent Dynamic Linkless Indespension</ref> suspension mechanisms or a hybrid combination of wooden deck, coil spring, and dampers.\n\n=== Brakes ===\nBrake systems of kick scooters can range from [[Disc Brake]] system, [[Magnetic braking|magnetic brake]] (used for energy consumption), or the less efficient [[Hydraulic brake|Hydraulic Brakes]], where brakes can be placed on either -or both- the front and back wheel(s). Many newer models of e-scooter also have Kinetic Energy Regeneration System (KERS), which also acts as an E-ABS on many models.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Scooters.Assisi028.jpg|Photo on exhibition in the private scootermuseum, Assisi, Italy\n|File:Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke 1922.jpg|1922 Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke\n|File:Gsr40.jpg|Example of a Go-Ped.|File:ZUKBOARD CITY.jpg|Zukboard City\n\n}}\n\n==Companies==\n{{expand list|date=September 2019}}\n* [[Lime (transportation company)]]\n* [[Razor (scooter)|Razor]]\n* [[Segway Inc.]] / Ninebot \n* [[Xiaomi]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Motorized kick scooters}}\n* [[Scooter-sharing system]]\n* [[Bicycle-sharing system]]\n* [[Segway PT]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Motor scooters| ]]\n[[Category:Personal transporters]]\n\n[[fr:Trottinette \u00e9lectrique]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|powered scooters ridden standing up|scooters with seats|Scooter (motorcycle)|other uses|Scooter (disambiguation){{!}}Scooter}}\n[[File:An electric kick scooter in Germany .jpg|thumb|An electric scooter]]\n[[File:Vosh, Stockholm ( 1090722).jpg|thumb|Scooters of several operators in Stockholm]]\nA '''motorized scooter''' is a powered stand-up [[Kick scooter|scooter]] using a small utility [[internal combustion engine]] or, more commonly, an [[electric motor]].

However, it is currently not possible to tax or insure e-scooters or electric skateboards.\n\nIn March 2019, electric scooter owners started reporting that the Irish police force, the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]], had begun regularly seizing electric scooters on the grounds that the owner did not have insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gardai-confiscate-electric-scooters-because-law-is-vague-owners-claim-5jjwwl3px |title=Garda\u00ed confiscate electric scooters |date=23 April 2019 |website=www.thetimes.co.uk |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> The owner groups, such as eScoot.ie, have been publicly vocal, attracting media attention and urging electric scooter owners to sign a petition for lawmakers to legalize the public use of \"electric rideables\" in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.escoot.ie/legalization-of-escooters-in-ireland/ |title=Petition to legalize the public use of electric rideables in Ireland |date=19 April 2019 |website=www.escoot.ie |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> Under growing pressure, the Minister for Transport [[Shane Ross]] asked the [[Road Safety Authority]] to research how e-scooters are regulated in other countries, particularly other EU member states. A decision is to be taken on whether or not to amend existing legislation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/law-means-electric-scooters-are-a-non-starter-on-irish-roads-1.3819528 |title=Law means electric scooters are a non-starter on Irish roads |date=9 March 2019 |website=www.irishtimes.com |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn August 2019 the [[Road Safety Authority|RSA]] submitted a report on the use of electric scooters to the Minister for Transport [[Shane Ross]]. The report is broadly in favour of e-scooters, however a number of significant safety concerns were raised. The Minister have announced a two-month public consultation starting on 1 September 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.ie/en/consultation/d1531c-public-consultation-on-personal-powered-transport/ |title=Public consultation on Personal Powered Transport |date=1 September 2019 |website=www.gov.ie |access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> The main areas of the consultation cover what personal protective equipment should be used, what training should be provided, what safety or certification standards devices should meet, what age restrictions should apply and where the devices can be used publicly.\n\n====Netherlands====\nThe use of electric scooters remains illegal after a fatal [[electric cart]] incident in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45586492 |title=Four children killed in electric cart |date=20 September 2018 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=25 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Poland====\nFollowing a court case, a new provision of the Road Traffic Act came into force as of 21 April 2019, whereby an electric scooter falls under the definition of a moped<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvnwarszawa.tvn24.pl/r/news,289251.html |title=S\u0105d uzna\u0142, \u017ce jad\u0105cy na hulajnodze elektrycznej nie jest pieszym |website=tvnwarszawa.tvn24.pl |access-date=24 April 2019 |language=pl}}</ref> (power up to 4&nbsp;kW, max speed 45&nbsp;km/h). Therefore, such vehicles are not allowed to ride on the sidewalks as well as bicycle lanes. However, due to the lack of homologation, it is not possible to register electric scooter as a road vehicle, which makes it illegal for the use on the road. The legislators are now working on changes to the law to introduce the definition of the Personal Transport Device, which would allow electric scooters to be used on the sidewalks and bicycle lanes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prawodrogowe.pl/informacje/kronika-legislacyjna/urzadzenia-transportu-osobistego-czekalismy-na-odpowiedz-resortu |title=zenia transportu osobistego.

There have been reported 273 accidents, three of which were fatal in 2018. Spanish legislators are working on a regulation banning scooters from pavements and limiting their speed to 25&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"politico.eu\"/>\n\nThe first ever person hit by electric scooter died in Spain in August 2019. A 92-year-old woman fell and struck her head to the pavement when an electric scooter hit her, travelling at less than 10&nbsp;km/h.<ref>{{cite news |title=No jail for man who caused first electric scooter death |url=http://www.catalannews.com/society-science/item/no-jail-for-man-who-caused-first-electric-scooter-death |date=1 August 2019 |website= CatalanNews |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\nIt is illegal to ride a motorized scooter on either the public road, the cycleway or the pavement unless the motorized scooter is electric and conforms to the European EAPC rules. Even then the rider must be at least 14 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/603646/eapc-e-bike-qualification-guidance.pdf|title=EAPC Rules}}</ref>\n\nIn theory, it would be legal to ride any motorized scooter if the rider possessed a category AM UK driving license (for Mopeds) plus number plates; insurance; test certificate; road tax; crash helmet etc. In practice, it remains illegal because a motorized scooter will not meet the requirements of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, so they can only be used on private land.\n\nOn 12 July 2019 the first UK fatality involving an e-scooter occurred. A 35-year-old YouTube personality, [[Emily Hartridge]], was killed in [[Battersea]], [[London]] in a collision on a roundabout with a truck. London's cycling commissioner said that \"new regulations must be put forward quickly\" as e-scooters are \"currently not safe \u2013 with no restrictions on speeds, no mandatory brakes and lights, and no rules on who can ride them and where\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-49002636 |title=E-scooter crashes spark call for new rules |date=16 July 2019 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other regions===\n\n====Australia====\nIn Queensland, the laws around the use of electric scooters and other personal mobility devices are made and enforced by the state government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled-devices/personal-mobility-devices|title=Rules for personal mobility devices {{!}} Bicycles, skateboards, foot scooters and similar|last=Queensland;|first=c=AU; o=The State of|website=www.qld.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref><ref>https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/wheeled%20-devices%20/%20personal-mobility-devices{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile some local governments in Queensland have not allowed Lime scooter trials, Brisbane City Council is currently undertaking a Lime Scooter trial and has invited tenders for two scooter contracts in the city.\n\nIn the ACT, the framework for personal mobility devices was amended to include e-scooters and other similar devices from 20 December 2019, permitting use on footpaths, shared paths, bicycle paths and the bicycle side of separated paths. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1881/~/personal-mobility-device-use-in-the-act|title=Personal mobility device use in the ACT|last=Canberra|first=Access Canberra; PositionTitle=Manager; SectionName=Access Canberra; CorporateName=Access|website=www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nElectric scooters in New Zealand are classed as a 'Low-powered vehicle that does not require registration', provided that the output power is under 300 watts<ref>{{cite web |title=Low-powered vehicles |url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicles/vehicle-types/low-powered-vehicles/ |website=New Zealand Transport Agency |accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref>. They can therefore be ridden on footpaths, roads and separated cycleways. They cannot be ridden on paint-defined cycleways on the road. Helmets are not legally required, but recommended.\n\n====United States====\nIn many areas in the United States, motorized scooters are not [[Street-legal vehicle|street legal]], as they cannot be tagged, titled, insured, and do not meet federal requirements for lights or mirrors. Particular localities may have further ordinances that limit the use of motorized scooters. The top speed of the average motorized scooter is around 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour). Due to their small wheels, motorized scooters are not typically safe for street use as even the smallest bumps can cause an accident.\n\nCalifornia requires that a person riding a motorized scooter on a street be 16 years of age or older, have a valid driver's license, be wearing a bicycle helmet, have no passengers, and otherwise follow the same rules of the road the same as cars do. The motorized scooter must have brakes, may not have handlebars raised above the operator's shoulders, and if ridden at night must have a headlight, a taillight, and side reflectors. A motorized scooter may not be operated on sidewalks or on streets if the posted speed limit is over 25&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h) unless in a Class II bicycle lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |title=Scooter and Go-Ped Guidelines |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311235350/http://www.ci.brea.ca.us/article.cfm?id=1272 |archivedate=2011-03-11 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>\n\nMichigan laws treat motorized scooters similarly to bicycles.

This means there is no inspection, license, insurance, or registration required. Additionally, this means that motorized scooters are allowed on the sidewalks, and helmets are not required.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dmv.dc.gov/publication/non-traditional-motor-vehicles-and-dc-law |title=Non-Traditional Motor Vehicles and DC Law {{!}} dmv |website=dmv.dc.gov |access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nIn Atlanta, motorized scooters are considered Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, meaning they can be used on sidewalks and highways where the speed limit is at most 35 miles per hour, or in the bike lane. The law also specifies that users of Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices, including motorized scooter riders, \"have the same rights and duties as prescribed for pedestrians\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dps.georgia.gov/georgia-code-low-speed-vehicles |title=Georgia Code: Low Speed Vehicles {{!}} Georgia Department of Public Safety |website=dps.georgia.gov |access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\nScooter sharing companies have rules for operation printed on both the scooter and in the app, which includes instructions to not ride on the sidewalk. Given that the laws regarding motorized scooters vary from state to state, the scooter sharing instructions can differ from the local law.\n\n==Mechanics==\n===Wheels and tires===\nThere are two general categories of tires on which stand-up scooters travel\u2014hard tires and air tires. Hard tires are generally {{convert|6|in|mm}} in diameter and constructed of a hard-plastic insert surrounded by a solid rubber tire. Air tires are most often {{convert|10|in|mm}} in diameter. They are constructed of a steel or aluminum split rim, an [[inner tube]] and rubber tire. Other, less common wheel and tire types include {{convert|8|in|mm}} and {{convert|13|in|mm}} air tires.\n\n===Transmissions===\nThe most simplistic drive mechanism of stand-up scooters is the \"spindle\" drive. This drive mechanism puts an extension of the engine's output shaft, the spindle, in direct contact with the rear tire of the scooter. In order to function correctly, the tire must have a clean, dry surface which the spindle will be able to effectively interact with. Scooters with this type of direct transmission can be pull-started with the rear wheel off the ground, or [[bump start|\"bump\"-started]] by forcefully pushing the scooter with the rear tire in contact with the ground. [[File:T3_Patroller_electric_stand-up_trike.jpg|thumb|upright|T3 Patroller electric stand-up [[tricycle]]]]\n\nSimple [[chain drive|chain reduction drives]] are also used to transfer energy to the rear wheel from the engine.  These generally incorporate a type of [[centrifugal clutch]] to allow the engine to idle independently.\n\n[[Belt (mechanical)|Belt]] reduction drives use the combination of wide flat \"cog\" belts and pulleys to transfer power to the rear wheel. Like chain drives, belt drives include a centrifugal clutch. Belt drives are more susceptible to breakage in off-road conditions.\n\n===Suspension===\nThe suspension systems of stand-up scooters range from simplistic spring based [[Suspension fork|fork systems]] to the complicated, dampened cam-link and C.I.D.L.I<ref>Cantilevered Independent Dynamic Linkless Indespension</ref> suspension mechanisms or a hybrid combination of wooden deck, coil spring, and dampers.\n\n=== Brakes ===\nBrake systems of kick scooters can range from [[Disc Brake]] system, [[Magnetic braking|magnetic brake]] (used for energy consumption), or the less efficient [[Hydraulic brake|Hydraulic Brakes]], where brakes can be placed on either -or both- the front and back wheel(s). Many newer models of e-scooter also have Kinetic Energy Regeneration System (KERS), which also acts as an E-ABS on many models.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Scooters.Assisi028.jpg|Photo on exhibition in the private scootermuseum, Assisi, Italy\n|File:Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke 1922.jpg|1922 Austro Motorette 82 cc two stroke\n|File:Gsr40.jpg|Example of a Go-Ped.|File:ZUKBOARD CITY.jpg|Zukboard City\n\n}}\n\n==Companies==\n{{expand list|date=September 2019}}\n* [[Lime (transportation company)]]\n* [[Razor (scooter)|Razor]]\n* [[Segway Inc.]] / Ninebot \n* [[Xiaomi]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Motorized kick scooters}}\n* [[Scooter-sharing system]]\n* [[Bicycle-sharing system]]\n* [[Segway PT]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Motor scooters| ]]\n[[Category:Personal transporters]]\n\n[[fr:Trottinette \u00e9lectrique]]\n", "name_user": "124.157.106.1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_scooter"}

As a singer, she placed 30 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart, was a [[Grand Ole Opry]] member and was nominated for several major awards. As a writer, she wrote poems and published an autobiography. Additionally, she was married to American country songwriter [[Harlan Howard]].\n\nHoward was mostly raised in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. The family moved to various homes during her childhood. Marrying in her teens, Howard and her husband relocated various times. This included [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]] and Missouri. She took several part-time jobs to support her growing family, which now included three children. Howard would divorce her first husband in 1953. She met and married her second husband the same year. Moving to his military base, the couple and her three children lived a suburban lifestyle. In 1955, Howard discovered that he was a [[bigamist]] and she resettled with her children in [[Los Angeles]], California. \n\nIn 1957, she met and married Harlan Howard. Early in their marriage, he discovered that she could sing. Impressed by her voice, Harlan arranged for her to record [[demo (music)|demonstration tapes]]. These tapes were heard by other country artists and led to her first recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Howard had her first major country hit in 1960 with \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\". As her husband's songwriting became more successful, Howard's recording career followed suit. She had her biggest success after signing with [[Decca Records]]. Howard had major hits with the singles \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\" (1966) and \"[[My Son (song)|My Son]]\" (1968). She also had several hits after teaming up with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], including the number 1 hit \"[[For Loving You]]\" (1967). The pair continued recording and touring together until the mid 1970s.\n\nBy 1973, two of Howard's children had died and she divorced Harlan Howard. In a depressive state, she nearly gave up her career. Upon the encouragement of other performers, she released several more albums and singles into the 1980s. At the same time, she began devoting time to other interests including writing. In 1987, Howard published her best-selling autobiography entitled ''Sunshine and Shadow''. She also started writing poems and short stories and remained active in other ways. This included making regular appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]].

From interacting with other country artists at clubs, Jan was presented with performance opportunities of her own. Among her first engagements was singing on the regional television show ''[[Town Hall Party]]''. However, Jan had fears about performing.

At Capitol, it was suggested that she would be marketed as towards [[pop music|pop]] rather than country. This prompted Nelson to have her record a mix of pop standards and country covers.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=207}} From the sessions, Howard's debut studio album was released in 1962, ''[[Sweet and Sentimental]]''.

He also owned his own business and became a real estate broker in Nashville.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\"/>\n\n===Other personal challenges and death===\nThe psychological trauma of Howard's childhood affected her as she entered her adult years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} After giving birth to her third child, she would cry uncontrollably. \"There were many times my heart would pound so hard I thought it would pop out of my chest,\" Howard commented. Howard's sister took her to see a doctor who explained that she was having a \"[[nervous breakdown]]\". To calm her anxieties, he prescribed Howard a strong pharmaceutical drug that she was told take four times per day.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=86}} In the early 1960s, she was rushed to the hospital after experiencing intense bleeding. Doctors told her that after giving birth to a stillborn baby and a previous operation, Howard had a strong possibility of developing [[cancer]] if she did not have her [[uterus]] removed. Howard got surgery completed at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles and within three weeks she was back to a normal routine.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=163}}\n\nHer trauma followed her into her marriage with Harlan Howard. While married, her weight dropped below 97 pounds and she would pace their home at night. This prompted Harlan to institutionalize Jan.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} In her autobiography, she recounted being brought into a hospital room with doctors and nurses. She recalled that she was screaming and shouting until a nurse gave her a shot which put her \"six feet under\". A doctor diagnosed her with having [[paroxysmal tachycardia]] and sent her home. He also ordered her to seek [[therapy|counseling]] services from a psychiatrist. According to her psychiatrist, she developed a series of phobias from the traumatic experiences in her childhood.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=186-87}} After moving to Nashville, she continued having depressive episodes. One evening in 1962, she took a handful of sleeping pills and was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, her blood pressure dropped significantly low and was in critical condition. When she awoke, she recalled seeing [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle Carter]] feeding her. \"Little by little I felt stronger and knew, thank God, that I was going to live,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=227}}\n\nYears later, Howard reflected on her life experiences: \"One thing I want to make clear is that I'm not a martyr. I can't stand self-pity. I don't deserve and don't want any kind of pity...There are a lot of people who have gone through worse things than I have.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=229}}\n\nHoward died on March 28, 2020, fifteen days after her 91st birthday, in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]. \"We were all so lucky so many nights to hear her voice on stage and to catch up with her backstage. We\u2019re all better for having had her in our lives,\" said Dan Rogers, Vice President of the Grand Ole Opry.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paulson |first1=Dave |title=Jan Howard, Opry member and country

'''Lula Grace Johnson'''; March 13, 1929 \u2013 March 28, 2020) was an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and author. As a singer, she placed 30 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart, was a [[Grand Ole Opry]] member and was nominated for several major awards. As a writer, she wrote poems and published an autobiography. Additionally, she was married to American country songwriter [[Harlan Howard]].\n\nHoward was mostly raised in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. The family moved to various homes during her childhood. Marrying in her teens, Howard and her husband relocated various times. This included [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]] and Missouri. She took several part-time jobs to support her growing family, which now included three children. Howard would divorce her first husband in 1953. She met and married her second husband the same year. Moving to his military base, the couple and her three children lived a suburban lifestyle. In 1955, Howard discovered that he was a [[bigamist]] and she resettled with her children in [[Los Angeles]], California. \n\nIn 1957, she met and married Harlan Howard. Early in their marriage, he discovered that she could sing. Impressed by her voice, Harlan arranged for her to record [[demo (music)|demonstration tapes]]. These tapes were heard by other country artists and led to her first recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Howard had her first major country hit in 1960 with \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\". As her husband's songwriting became more successful, Howard's recording career followed suit. She had her biggest success after signing with [[Decca Records]]. Howard had major hits with the singles \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\" (1966) and \"[[My Son (song)|My Son]]\" (1968). She also had several hits after teaming up with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], including the number 1 hit \"[[For Loving You]]\" (1967). The pair continued recording and touring together until the mid 1970s.\n\nBy 1973, two of Howard's children had died and she divorced Harlan Howard. In a depressive state, she nearly gave up her career. Upon the encouragement of other performers, she released several more albums and singles into the 1980s. At the same time, she began devoting time to other interests including writing. In 1987, Howard published her best-selling autobiography entitled ''Sunshine and Shadow''. She also started writing poems and short stories and remained active in other ways. This included making regular appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. She also worked with [[United States Military]] veterans through various programs. She donated to charities and spoke at fundraisers.\n\n==Early life==\n===1929\u20131945: Childhood and teenage years===\nJan Howard was born Lula Grace Johnson in [[West Plains, Missouri]], the daughter of Linnie and Rolla Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usobit.com/obituaries-2020/03/jan-howard-march-13-1929-march-28-2020/|title=Jan Howard March 13 1929 March 28 2020|publisher=United States Obituary Notice|accessdate=2020-03-29}}</ref> She was the eighth of 11 children.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Two of her siblings died before the age of two.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=6}} Howard's father was a [[bricklayer|brick mason]] who received employment assistance from the [[Works Progress Administration]] during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=4}} In her early childhood, the family moved frequently as her father found work and better housing. They lived in nearby towns such as [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Birch Tree, Missouri|Birch Tree]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} When she was eight years old, the family briefly returned to West Plains. After returning, Howard was [[raped]] by a family friend. In her 1987 autobiography, she commented on the experience: \"My body was violated and my mind was damaged in a way I wasn't to know the full extent of for years to come.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} She kept it a secret from her family for many years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nIn her childhood, she developed an interest in listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] radio broadcasts with her father. In 2003, she recalled memories of listening with her father, \"The first time I heard the Opry I was eight or nine years old. My dad used to tune it in on the radio on Saturday nights, but he only listened enough to hear [[Texas Ruby]]. She was his favorite.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} In 1943, Howard's mother temporarily separated from her father. To help support the family, Howard worked as a dishwasher in a local cafe. Because the cafe owner could not afford to pay her, he gave Howard's family food for weekly meals. At age 16, she took a new job at a drugstore called Model Drugs.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=36-38}} \n[[File:West Plains Washington Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A downtown view of [[West Plains, Missouri]], the hometown of Howard.]] \n\nIn 1945, she married Mearle Wood and subsequently dropped out of high school.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} Wood enrolled in the military soon after their marriage began. Finding military housing for his wife, Wood resettled the couple to [[Waynesville, Missouri]]. In their first home together, they shared a house with another military couple. She briefly returned to her parents' house after discovering Wood was engaging in an affair. However, when Wood was re-stationed in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], Howard reunited with him in his new location.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=54}}\n\n===1946\u20131957: Early adulthood===\nHoward gave birth to three sons between the late 1940s and early 1950s.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} The young family continued to move as Wood took on various jobs. Among the cities they lived in were [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas]] and [[Greeley, Colorado]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=66-68}} While in Greeley, the family's house caught on fire. According to Howard she woke to the smell of smoke in the middle of the night and saved her three children from the fumes. Wood was not present at the time of the incident.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=80}} Towards the end of their marriage, the family moved back to West Plains. Howard later revealed in 1987 that Wood was physically abusive, especially at the end of their marriage. During one incident, Wood held a butcher knife to Howard's throat, nearly killing her. The same day, Howard and her three sons fled to live with her siblings in Oklahoma.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} \"Until midnight, Mom and Daddy kept us hidden. Then, with as much money as we could spare, we boarded a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] for Oklahoma City,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=101}} In 1953, she divorced Wood.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nWhile living with her brother, Howard became acquainted with his friend, Lowell \"Smitty\" Smith. Smith was also an active member of the [[United States Military|military]]. Developing a romantic affection, the two married in 1953.<ref name=\"Popular Music\">{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=1992}}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Living with Smith and her three sons on a military base, the family lived a suburban lifestyle. Howard also got a part-time job in the \"tea room\" of the Morehouse Fashion Department Store. In 1954, she gave birth to a fourth child named Janet Louise Smith. The child had a series of medical problems and died shortly after being born.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=114-116}} In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience: \"They were closing the top of the incubator. The realization hit me. The baby was dead,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=115}}\n\nThe Smith family then moved to a base in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], where they rented a newly-built home. The couple bought furniture on credit to decorate the home.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=121}} During this time, she became pregnant again and eventually [[miscarriage|miscarried]] the child.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Shortly after the miscarriage, Smith was re-stationed in [[Panama]]. Howard arranged for their furniture to be sent to Panama while Smith moved there. Howard and her children were to meet him there within a few months after.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=127-28}} Shortly after Smith left, she discovered that he was still married to another woman. Upon realizing this, she ended the relationship and moved with her sons to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1955.<ref name=\"Popular Music\"/>\n\nHoward worked a series of part-time jobs upon moving to Los Angeles. For a short time, she worked as a cocktail waitress in a strip club. \"I must have had thirty jobs in the next thirty days,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=137}} After several months, she got a job as a secretary. She later recalled that the position was challenging because she could not \"type or take [[shorthand]]\". In 1957, she met aspiring country music songwriter [[Harlan Howard]]. The pair met through her friend's association with country artist [[Wynn Stewart]] (Stewart was also a friend of Harlan Howard's).{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Within a month of meeting, the couple were married on May 10, 1957 in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}}\n\n==Singing career==\n===1958\u20131963: Early success===\nAt home, Jan would often sing to herself while her husband was out working. Coming home early one day, Harlan heard her singing while she was washing dishes. \"I didn't know you could sing,\" Harlan said.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=227-28}} The same day, he accompanied Jan on guitar while she sang his composition \"Mommy for a Day\". Harlan realized he could use Jan's singing voice for [[demo (music)|demo]] records. The Howards recorded the song's demo in their bathroom in [[Gardena, California]]. The song was sent to a publisher in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] where it was recorded and made a hit by [[Kitty Wells]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=164-65}} Howard also sang the demos for \"Pick Me Up on Your Way Down\" and \"I Wish I Could Fall in Love Again\". Both songs were recorded by [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]]. Harlan brought Jan's demo tapes to Joe Johnson of [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Johnson liked the songs however, Harlan would not let Johnson take them unless he signed Jan to the label. Johnson agreed and she officially signed with Challenge in 1958.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=166-67}}{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} After signing, the label changed her name from \"Lula Grace Howard\" to \"Jan Howard\".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}}\n[[File:Jan Howard--Most Promising Female Vocalist.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Early publicity photo of Howard in an ad from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 1960.]]\n\nJan and Stewart's first recording, \"Yankee Go Home\", was released on Challenge Records in 1959.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\">{{cite web |last1=Brennan |first1=Sandra |title=Jan Howard: Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jan-howard-mn0000214907 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> The duo also released a second single together entitled \"Wrong Company\".

From interacting with other country artists at clubs, Jan was presented with performance opportunities of her own. Among her first engagements was singing on the regional television show ''[[Town Hall Party]]''. However, Jan had fears about performing. In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience at the show. \"The band started 'Pick Me Up on Your Way Down' and someone pushed me onstage. After that, everything was a total blank...If I'd been given warning, I'd have been long gone.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=174-75}}\n\nThe success of \"Wrong Company\" prompted Joe Johnson to find Jan a solo release. Johnson chose the song \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\", which was co-written by Harlan Howard and Fuzzy Owen.

In response, she said, \"Yeah, it would make a great soap opera.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Howard had written an outline for the book but put it aside for three years before turning to it again.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=283}} She later explained that she chose to continue writing the autobiography because she became suicidal. In 1979, she was visiting a friend at their home in [[Florida]]. \"It was a very bad time in my life. I was in Florida and, I didn't know whether I was going to walk into the ocean or not. And I can't swim,\" Howard said in 2003. Deciding not to end her life, she went back inside the house. She then sat on the floor and wrote a song called \"My Story\". Howard later threw the song away because it was full of \"bitterness\". \"Once I started again, it was just like rolling back the years,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nThe year of the book's release, Howard canceled all her concert engagements in order to prepare for its completion.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=290}} When officially released in 1987, the autobiography was titled ''Sunshine and Shadow: My Story''.

In a 2015 interview, Howard explained that she still writes a \"little bit of everything\" including songs, poems and short stories. Howard also said she had started three fiction novels that had yet to be completed. \"I need to put those together, I need to go through them.

He would frequently come by to say hello and have a soda. The two spent more time together, eventually becoming a couple and marrying.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=41-43}} Howard later said that she did not want to marry Wood, however, her mother encouraged their courtship. \"I felt like I was dressing for a funeral. And in a way, I was. The funeral of my girlhood,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=41-43}} Her second marriage to Lowell \"Smitty\" Smith lasted only two years after discovering that he was a [[bigamist]].{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} \n\nIn her third marriage to Harlan Howard, Jan's three children legally were adopted by him and took on his last name.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=215}} In the mid-1960s, the couple owned a publishing company in Nashville called \"Wilderness Music\". Together, they bought an older home, renovated it and turned it into a series of offices for the company.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=230}} Jan later commented that Harlan took control of the Wilderness when they divorced.

Just the divorce.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=291}} Following her divorce, she became closer to her divorce lawyer, Jack Norman.

Within four weeks, he recovered from the illness.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=171-72}} During the Vietnam War in 1968, Jimmy was drafted into the military. Once he received his draft notice, Carter volunteered for the army. \"If Jimmy's going, I'm going,\" he said to Howard.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=321}} After being sent to basic training, the military was supposed to let Jimmy come home, but they refused. Upset about the situation, Howard discussed the situation with her friend and country DJ, [[Ralph Emery]]. Through the assistance of Emery, Howard got in contact with [[Richard Fulton|Congressman Richard Fulton]]. Emery found Fulton at a restaurant at nine o'clock the same night when he contacted him. It was Fulton who got permission from the military to send Jimmy home for 21 days. In her autobiography, Howard recounted the phone call she received from Jimmy the day he came home, \"Mom! What did you do? The Secretary of the Army himself called down here! My sergeant came and got me and said, 'Howard! Go call your mother, then be prepared to work you ass off!'\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=321}} Howard also recalled Jimmy's nervousness as he prepared for Vietnam. The evening before his departure, he sat at her bedside explaining his nervousness and anxieties.

Realizing the reasons for them being there, she began screaming and crying. Howard remembered the days following Jimmy's death in her autobiography. She recalled going through the days and weeks by \"forcing\" herself to keep going. She had trouble eating and sleeping, taking pills on a regular basis to help her through the anxieties and grief. \"I was crying when I woke up, and crying when I went to sleep,\" she wrote in 1987. One morning, Howard made the decision to dispose of all her medicine and continue on with her life. \"As I walked into the den and saw the relief on Corky and David's faces, my efforts were worthwhile,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=360-61}}\n\nHoward's youngest son, David, began abusing [[substance abuse|drugs]] in the years following Jimmy's death.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\">{{cite news |last1=Edwardsd |first1=Joe |title=Personal Setbacks Make Her Stronger |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19810404&id=AWRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zegMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2414,1548685&hl=en |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |date=1981}}</ref> Prior to this, he had been employed at the ''[[Opryland USA]]'' theme park, where he appeared as an actor in several shows.

When she would ask David he would reply by saying that he was \"just tired.\" She also noticed that he began associating with people who provided David with substances.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=432}} She eventually had him see a [[psychiatrist]] for his personal setbacks, but only found out that he was using the time for other reasons.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=435}} One morning in 1972, Howard found David in his bedroom dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She recalled that the next several days were a \"blur\". Devastated by her son's suicide, she stayed in bed for days at a time. After many weeks of grieving, Howard cleaned out his room and sold his [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. \"When everything was done, I took one last look around, walked out, and closed the door on the past. But it would never be locked,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=461-67}}\n\nIn the years following David's and Jimmy's deaths, Howard's middle son Carter began working with military veterans. He also owned his own business and became a real estate broker in Nashville.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\"/>\n\n===Other personal challenges===\nThe psychological trauma of Howard's childhood affected her as she entered her adult years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} After giving birth to her third child, she would cry uncontrollably. \"There were many times my heart would pound so hard I thought it would pop out of my chest,\" Howard commented. Howard's sister took her to see a doctor who explained that she was having a \"[[nervous breakdown]]\". To calm her anxieties, he prescribed Howard a strong pharmaceutical drug that she was told take four times per day.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=86}} In the early 1960s, she was rushed to the hospital after experiencing intense bleeding. Doctors told her that after giving birth to a stillborn baby and a previous operation, Howard had a strong possibility of developing [[cancer]] if she did not have her [[uterus]] removed. Howard got surgery completed at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles and within three weeks she was back to a normal routine.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=163}}\n\nHer trauma followed her into her marriage with Harlan Howard. While married, her weight dropped below 97 pounds and she would pace their home at night. This prompted Harlan to institutionalize Jan.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} In her autobiography, she recounted being brought into a hospital room with doctors and nurses. She recalled that she was screaming and shouting until a nurse gave her a shot which put her \"six feet under\". A doctor diagnosed her with having [[paroxysmal tachycardia]] and sent her home. He also ordered her to seek [[therapy|counseling]] services from a psychiatrist. According to her psychiatrist, she developed a series of phobias from the traumatic experiences in her childhood.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=186-87}} After moving to Nashville, she continued having depressive episodes. One evening in 1962, she took a handful of sleeping pills and was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, her blood pressure dropped significantly low and was in critical condition. When she awoke, she recalled seeing [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle Carter]] feeding her. \"Little by little I felt stronger and knew, thank God, that I was going to live,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=227}}\n\nYears later, Howard reflected on her life experiences: \"One thing I want to make clear is that I'm not a martyr. I can't stand self-pity.

Both predecessor publications had a long and storied history throughout the north valley of the [[Sacramento River]].<ref name=ChicoERHistory />\n\nThe Chico Record can trace its roots to the Butte Record. The Butte Record moved publication from Bidwell Bar to Oroville in 1856 where it was briefly known as the Oroville Union Record from 1864 to 1866. The publication would relocate to Chico in 1873 and after the acquisition of the Chico Chronicle became the Chico Morning Chronicle-Record. The name was winnowed back to Chico Record after new owners purchased the paper in 1897.\n\nThe Chico Enterprise originated in 1859 as the Tehama Tocsin in [[Tehama, California]]. It relocated to [[Red Bluff, California]] and, later, to Chico where it was renamed the Northern Enterprise. The name was later shorted to the Enterprise.\n\nThe Enterprise and the Record were among many newspapers that were published in Chico in the 1860s. Other publications included the Chico Index, Chico Courant and the [[California Caucasian]]. The Caucasian was reportedly a central force in fomenting the atmosphere of hate and bigotry which led to the burning of Chico's then-\"Chinatown\" in 1877 (http://www.what-you-see.com/calif/chico.htm).\n\nUltimately, the Enterprise and the Record emerged as Chico's two primary newspapers. They competed against each other through the 1940s. They published together for the first time in a single combined edition in October 1946 due to a printer's strike.\n\nThe Enterprise and the Record consolidated ownership in Nov. 13, 1947 when Record owners, Stanley and Samuel Beaubaire, sold their paper to the Chico Enterprise. Enterprise Publishing Co. published separate editions of the Enterprise and the Record until Dec. 6, 1948 when they were merged into the Chico Enterprise-Record.\n\nAfter merging, the paper was published in the afternoons Monday through Friday and on Saturday mornings. The newspaper's office and printing presses were at 700 Broadway.\n\nOn March 14, 1983, more than a century of local ownership ended when the publication was sold to Donrey Media Group of Fort Smith, Ark. One change was the introduction of a Sunday morning edition on Oct. 30, 1983. The E-R shifted to an entirely morning newspaper on Sept. 8, 1992.\n\nThe Enterprise-Record also moved its operation to its current offices and printing presses at 400 E. Park Ave. on Aug. 22, 1987. The ribbon cutting included Butte County Supervisor Jane Dolan, Chico Mayor Mary Andrews and Donrey founder Donald W. Reynolds.\n\n== National Influence and Coverage ==\nIn November 2018, the editor of the Enterprise-Record took a photo of [[Camp Fire (2018)|Camp Fire]], then consuming [[Paradise, California]]. The iconic photograph, taken with an iPhone camera, appeared on the websites of the ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', and ''Time'' magazine.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-chico-newspaper-editor-20181115-story.html|title=As city burns around it, a newspaper staff rises to cover unspeakable tragedy|last=Oreskes|first=Benjiman|date=15 November 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=}}</ref> The ''Los Angeles Times'' would later run an article detailing the efforts taken by the little paper to cover the tragedy, recognizing the staff for performing at \"the highest of levels.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[http://www.chicoer.com Official Site]\n\n{{MediaNews Group}}\n\n[[Category:Daily newspapers published in California]]\n[[Category:Media in Chico, California|ER]]\n[[Category:MediaNews Group publications]]\n[[Category:Publications established in 1853]]\n[[Category:1853 establishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Newspaper\n| name                = Chico Enterprise-Record\n| logo                = Enterprise-Record (2019-07-27).svg\n| caption             = \n| type                = Daily [[newspaper]]\n| format              = [[Broadsheet]]\n| foundation          = Nov. 12, 1853 (as the ''Butte Record'')\n| ceased publication  = \n| price               = USD 0.75 weekdays<br />USD 1.50 Sundays\n| owners              = [[Digital First Media]]\n| publisher           = Jim Gleim\n| editor              = Mike Wolcott\n| circulation         = under 10,000<ref name=\"Mondo\"/>\n| headquarters        = 400 E.

Both predecessor publications had a long and storied history throughout the north valley of the [[Sacramento River]].<ref name=ChicoERHistory />\n\nThe Chico Record can trace its roots to the Butte Record. The Butte Record moved publication from Bidwell Bar to Oroville in 1856 where it was briefly known as the Oroville Union Record from 1864 to 1866. The publication would relocate to Chico in 1873 and after the acquisition of the Chico Chronicle became the Chico Morning Chronicle-Record. The name was winnowed back to Chico Record after new owners purchased the paper in 1897.\n\nThe Chico Enterprise originated in 1859 as the Tehama Tocsin in [[Tehama, California]]. It relocated to [[Red Bluff, California]] and, later, to Chico where it was renamed the Northern Enterprise. The name was later shorted to the Enterprise.\n\nThe Enterprise and the Record were among many newspapers that were published in Chico in the 1860s. Other publications included the Chico Index, Chico Courant and the [[California Caucasian]]. The Caucasian was reportedly a central force in fomenting the atmosphere of hate and bigotry which led to the burning of Chico's then-\"Chinatown\" in 1877 (http://www.what-you-see.com/calif/chico.htm).\n\nUltimately, the Enterprise and the Record emerged as Chico's two primary newspapers. They competed against each other through the 1940s. They published together for the first time in a single combined edition in October 1946 due to a printer's strike.\n\nThe Enterprise and the Record consolidated ownership in Nov. 13, 1947 when Record owners, Stanley and Samuel Beaubaire, sold their paper to the Chico Enterprise. Enterprise Publishing Co. published separate editions of the Enterprise and the Record until Dec. 6, 1948 when they were merged into the Chico Enterprise-Record.\n\nAfter merging, the paper was published in the afternoons Monday through Friday and on Saturday mornings. The newspaper's office and printing presses were at 700 Broadway.\n\nOn March 14, 1983, more than a century of local ownership ended when the publication was sold to Donrey Media Group of Fort Smith, Ark. One change was the introduction of a Sunday morning edition on Oct. 30, 1983. The E-R shifted to an entirely morning newspaper on Sept. 8, 1992.\n\nThe Enterprise-Record also moved its operation to its current offices and printing presses at 400 E. Park Ave. on Aug. 22, 1987. The ribbon cutting included Butte County Supervisor Jane Dolan, Chico Mayor Mary Andrews and Donrey founder Donald W. Reynolds.\n\n== National Influence and Coverage ==\nIn November of 2018, the editor of the Enterprise-Record took a photo of [[Camp Fire (2018)|Camp Fire]], then consuming [[Paradise, California]]. The iconic photograph, taken with an iPhone camera, appeared on the websites of the ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', and ''Time'' magazine.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-chico-newspaper-editor-20181115-story.html|title=As city burns around it, a newspaper staff rises to cover unspeakable tragedy|last=Oreskes|first=Benjiman|date=15 November 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=}}</ref> The ''Los Angeles Times'' would later run an article detailing the efforts taken by the little paper to cover the tragedy, recognizing the staff for performing at \"the highest of levels.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[http://www.chicoer.com Official Site]\n\n{{MediaNews Group}}\n\n[[Category:Newspapers published in California]]\n[[Category:Media in Chico, California|ER]]\n[[Category:MediaNews Group publications]]\n[[Category:Publications established in 1853]]\n[[Category:1853 establishments in California]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico_Enterprise-Record"}

Part of the [[Bougainville campaign]], the battle occurred as a force of about 3,300 Japanese from the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]] supported by a sizeable concentration of artillery launched a counterattack against the main Australian offensive which had been pushing south towards [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]], concentrating their attacks on Slater's Knoll near the Puriata River. The Australian troops belonged to the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]], with the [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Infantry Battalion]] being the most heavily engaged, although the [[9th Battalion (Australia)|9th Infantry Battalion]] and the [[61st Battalion (Australia)|61st Infantry Battalion]] also took part in the fighting.\n\nAgainst Japanese tactics that included massed attacks, the Australians utilised [[Tank|armour]] and [[artillery]], and in the end these proved decisive. Commencing in late March, after the Australian advance had been halted by wet weather, over the course of several days the Japanese launched several probing raids followed by heavy attacks against the Australians.  The final assault on the knoll came on the night of 4/5 April when 129 men from 'B' Company, 25th Infantry Battalion repulsed an attack by a force of about 1,100 Japanese, killing 292. This proved to be the 7th Brigade's final involvement in the campaign as they were relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]] shortly afterwards. Overall, 620 Japanese were killed in the battle with another 1,000 estimated to have been wounded, while the Australians suffered 189 casualties.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\nAt the beginning of 1945, the south-eastern part of Bougainville was occupied by the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]],{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=211}} under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Tsutomu Akinaga]].{{#tag:ref|Akinaga, formerly chief of staff of the [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|XVII Army]], took over command of the division from Lieutenant General [[Masatane Kanda]] when Kanda was promoted to take over XVII Army.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=286}}|group=Note}} Made up of the [[13th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|13th]] and [[23rd Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|23rd Infantry Regiments]]\u2014600 and 700-strong respectively\u2014as well as the 6th Field Artillery Regiment, the 6th Engineer Regiment, the 6th Transport Regiment and the 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, Akinaga's division consisted of 3,300 men.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{#tag:ref|The Australian estimate of this force was between 2,400 and 2,700 men.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}|group=Note}}\n\nThe previous November, the [[II Corps (Australia)|Australian II Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Stanley Savige]] had taken over responsibility of the island from the US [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]], who had been transferred to fight in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944-45)|Philippines]].

In order to counter this, it was decided that the Australian II Corps\u2014consisting of [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] and [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] troops from the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th]] and [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigades]]{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=92}}{{#tag:ref|Also attached to the Australian corps were two field artillery regiments, the [[2nd Field Regiment (Australia)|2nd]] and [[4th Field Regiment (Australia)|4th Field Regiments]], a company from the [[1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion]], the [[2/8th Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/8th Commando Squadron]], and a squadron of Matilda II tanks from [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]].{{sfn|Long|1963|p=99}}|group=Note}}\u2014would go on the offensive{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=108}} and a three-pronged campaign was planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=113}}\n\nAs a result, the Australian campaign on the island developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow [[Bonis Peninsula]] and contained; in the centre, the [[Battle of Pearl Ridge|seizure of Pearl Ridge]] would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west thoroughfares and protection against further counterattacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign would take place in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}} Consequently, on 21 January, Savige directed the 3rd Division under Major General [[William Bridgeford]] to take \"swift and vigorous action\" to destroy Japanese forces in southern Bougainville. The division's immediate task was to advance south to the Puriata,{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this river was \"Priaka\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=282}}|group=Note}} and send patrols across it. Savige considered that the Japanese division was \"weak and off balance\"{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=141}} due to casualties and disease as well as a shortage of supplies. Brigadier [[Raymond Monaghan]]'s [[29th Brigade (Australia)|29th Brigade]] had opened the campaign in the south in mid-December, crossing the Jaba River, before conducting a series of landings by barge along the coast of [[Empress Augusta Bay]], outflanking the Tuju, Tavera, Adele and Hupai Rivers, in what became dubbed the \"Battle of the Swamps\" by the Australians. The fighting during this time resulted in 240 Japanese killed, and 148 Australian casualties.

Akinaga assessed that a counterattack against the Australian forces at this point with the entire weight of his division might be successful at this time and consequently he gave the order for his division to begin an attack across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=281}} Akinaga planned to commit 2,000 men to the assault, while 1,300 would be held back to act as ammunition carriers.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}}\n\nAccording to Karl James, no detailed orders were produced for the attack and deliberate planning was hastily completed with little or no co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}} In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack, began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields of fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting [[Vickers medium machine gun]]s and [[Bren light machine gun]]s. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=193\u2013195}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Probing raids===\n[[File:Bougainville campaign 1945.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Some key locations in the Bougainville campaign.|alt=A map of Bougainville Island, indicating the location of several key battles in the campaign]]\n\nThe main attack was planned for 1 April, but as the various Japanese units moved into position,{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}} a number of minor probes were made by elements of the Japanese 6th Engineer Regiment in the Australian rear areas and along their [[line of communication]]s.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} The first raid came on the night of 27/28 March, when a force of about 100 Japanese exploited a gap between the 25th Infantry Battalion's main defensive position and its 'B' Echelon\u2014which included its transport and logistics elements and was protected by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion\u2014fixed bayonets and then assaulted the rear of the Australian perimeter. The Australians had been alerted to their approach after the communication line between the two positions had been cut, and when the attack began the men had already been roused and the weapons pits fully manned. As a result, the attack failed and was turned back. A number of Japanese survivors managed to dig-in near the perimeter and later fired upon the Australian clearing patrol that was sent out the following morning, as well as snipe at the company defending 'B' Echelon's position. Afterwards, the Australians counted 19 dead Japanese around their position, while they also managed to capture one of the wounded. Against this, the 25th Infantry Battalion had lost three killed and seven wounded.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nAnother probe was made early on the morning of 28 March on the positions of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on the west bank of the Puriata River from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the [[booby trap]]s that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}\n\nThat evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's rear echelon at Barara, along the Toko\u2013Mosigetta\u2013Buin Road, came under attack. Under the command of the battalion [[second-in-command]], and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThroughout 29 March, the Japanese continued the tactic of using small-scale attacks to test the Australian defences and isolate the 25th Infantry Battalion's forward companies from its headquarters and rear. Over the course of the morning and into the afternoon, one of its companies was probed, while the headquarters also came under attack. The company from the 61st Infantry Battalion protecting the 25th Infantry Battalion's line of communications also came under attack from the 70 Japanese that were believed to be entrenched between the 'B' Echelon and the 25th's main positions, suffering two killed and two wounded.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}} Later, it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing for a major attack against Slater's Knoll, following the capture of a Japanese sergeant who confirmed that the probes were, in the words of [[Gavin Long]], the \"prelude to a full-scale offensive\".{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThese probes intensified on 30 March, as one of the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies was strongly attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol at the time of the attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Bougainville Matilda (AWM 018384).jpg|thumb|left|[[Matilda II]] tanks of the Australian 2/4th Armoured Regiment advancing towards Slater's Knoll on 30 March 1945|alt=Soldiers in combat equipment carrying rifles advance along a dirt road in front of a tank]]\n\nCommunications between the brigade and battalion headquarters and the forward company positions broke down at this stage and runners had to be dispatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and had run out of water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter,{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}} but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of [[Matilda II|Matilda tanks]] under Major Kenneth Arnott from the [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]] at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and over the course of the day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable to move under their own power.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nThis was the first time tanks had been used in the campaign and the going was slow. By 19:00 on 30 March they reached the 'B' Echelon position. Early on 31 March the tanks moved up to the battalion headquarters on Slater's Knoll where they were escorted by a [[platoon]] from the headquarters company and moved out again, once again using bulldozers to improve the ground in front of them. Just as they did, the Japanese launched an attack on one of the isolated companies. When they were {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the forward positions, the infantry deployed to the left and right of the tanks and they began their advance to contact, arriving just in time to help defeat the Japanese attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nAs the forward companies began to move back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There they were able to reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=161\u2013162}} McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n===First major assault===\nThe next morning, 1 April, the Australians extended across the Kero Creek and advanced north to the Puriata where they established a perimeter {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} south of Slater's Knoll.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}} Around 12:00, the Japanese 6th Field Artillery Regiment, whose gunners had been converted to the role of infantry, set up a form-up position {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=on}} to the front of the Australian company holding the perimeter to the south of Slater's Knoll at a location the Japanese called Pain, which lay along the Buin Road.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} Before the attack could be launched, the Australians detected the movement of the Japanese and began firing upon them. Shortly after 12:40, the Japanese gunners launched their assault. Firing their weapons from the hip, they rushed the Australian position, pushing the defenders back, leaving dead and wounded behind. That evening, the Australians launched a series of determined counterattacks in order to re-establish contact between Slater's Knoll and the forward companies, however, these were turned back.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Slaters knoll 1942 s.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Location of the Battle of Slater's Knoll in south west Bougainville.|alt=A location map, depicting a portion of the western coast of Bougainville, showing the relative position of Slater's Knoll, the Buin Road and several other key locations]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment, which had advanced on the right flank from Barara{{#tag:ref| The Japanese name for this location was \"Bara Bara\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}|group=Note}} attempted to move on Slater's Knoll from the north. Finding its way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking the equipment necessary to remove them, it was forced to halt its advance and cover the flank of Colonel Toyoji Muta's 13th Infantry Regiment, which was attempting to launch an assault across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} At this point, the river was about {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, while the opposite bank was about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The crossing began at 03:00 on 1 April, and the three battalions made heavy work of it. When they were halfway across, the two forward battalions were spotted by the Australians in the moonlight and engaged with machine gun and rifle fire.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} The Japanese quickly deployed and attempted to launch an attack; however, in the confusion the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment was cut off from the rest of the assault force. As daylight came, the Australians were able to call down mortar fire on the Japanese, causing considerable casualties. Running low on ammunition and having suffered considerable losses, the 23rd Infantry were forced to withdraw. The 1st Battalion  remained cut off until the evening of 1 April, when it was able to re-establish contact with the other two battalions and report to the divisional commander that the attack had been unsuccessful.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|pp=284\u2013285}}\n\n===Lull in the battle and secondary attack===\nOn 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akinaga, called the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments back across the Puriata, to a position south-west of the Pain feature.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} At this point, the decision was made to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nOn the night of 4/5 April, the Japanese heavily shelled the Australian artillery battery, while communications between brigade headquarters and the 25th Infantry Battalion headquarters were severed, as were the lines from the 25th Infantry Battalion's headquarters to its forward companies. Suspecting that the attack was about to commence, runners were sent and the men defending Slater's Knoll, now consisting of a force of only 129 men from 'B' Company, stood-to.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nAt 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese launched an attack from the north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south-west.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=162\u2013163}} For the next 80 minutes, 900\u20131,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment to deal with them the Japanese attack stalled.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well-sited machine guns.{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Colonel Muta, in a final act of defiance wrapped his unit's banner around his waist and armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile, finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=211}}  At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had enough. Just after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe day after the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=250}} In total, over the course of the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and estimated that another 1,000 had probably been wounded.{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=251}} Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=208}} Four wounded Japanese were also taken [[prisoner of war]]. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=163\u2013164}} Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\n[[File:Japanese dead after the Battle of Slater's Knoll.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese killed during the final assault on Slater's Knoll are buried the day after the battle|alt=Soldiers burying dead in a large pit]]\n\nThe result of the battle had a profound effect on the Japanese commanders. According to James, Kanda had been \"so certain of victory...[he]...had not developed any plans for...subsequent activities\".{{sfnp|James|2012|p=218}} Nevertheless, after the battle, the Japanese forces in the area pulled back to the [[Hongorai River]], where they were reorganised due to the heavy losses, with several infantry, engineer and artillery units being amalgamated. Lacking food, suffering the effects of disease, and isolated from home, morale amongst the Japanese troops fell heavily, with many realising that the war was lost. There was an increase in desertions at this time, although the vast majority continued to fight, if only because they were under orders to do so.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=210\u2013219}}\n\nOperationally, the battle proved to the Australian high command how effective armour could be when used in close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The use of [[Universal carrier|machine gun carriers]] to carry out the wounded had also been quite effective.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault even when it was clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=210}} Long goes on to argue that if the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result might have been different. The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\nThere were tactical deficiencies as well, particularly the predictability of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and bunching together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians to take full toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=211\u2013212}} Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, for after the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After the failure of the final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians might have been able to bring up and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=165}}\n\nIn the days immediately after the battle, the Australians continued to carry out patrolling operations around the knoll. On 7 April, a patrol from the 9th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force of about 30 men and in the ensuing engagement four Japanese were killed, while a patrol from the 61st Infantry Battalion on 8 April killed another five. On 13 April, the order was given that the 7th Brigade would be gradually withdrawn and relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th]].{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=166}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=231}} Shortly afterwards, the [[58th/59th Battalion (Australia)|58th/59th Infantry Battalion]] replaced the 25th in occupation of the knoll, while the [[24th Battalion (Australia)|24th Infantry Battalion]] resumed the advance along the Buin Road on 17 April,{{sfnp|Keogh|1965|p=419}} subsequently taking part in the [[Battle of the Hongorai River|fighting along the Hongorai River]].{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=122}} The 9th Infantry Battalion, however, was not withdrawn immediately, and remained in the northern area until it handed over to the [[57th/60th Battalion (Australia)|57th/60th Infantry Battalion]] in early May. The fighting on Bougainville continued throughout April as the Japanese resisted the Australian advance and went on until July when the fighting petered out due to heavy rain and flooding.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nAfter the war, the [[battle honour]] of \"Slater's Knoll\" was awarded to the 25th Infantry Battalion and the 2/4th Armoured Regiment. Neither the 9th or 61st Infantry Battalions were similarly credited, although according to Gordon Maitland there seems to be no explanation as to why.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=145}} For his actions during the attack on the Japanese pillboxes on 22 March, Rattey later received the [[Victoria Cross]]. Initially, his battalion commander, McKinna, had nominated him for the lesser [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]], but on review by Field, the brigade commander, the nomination was elevated.

Part of the [[Bougainville campaign]], the battle occurred as a force of about 3,300 Japanese from the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]] supported by a sizeable concentration of artillery launched a counterattack against the main Australian offensive which had been pushing south towards [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]], concentrating their attacks on Slater's Knoll near the Puriata River. The Australian troops belonged to the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]], with the [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Infantry Battalion]] being the most heavily engaged, although the [[9th Battalion (Australia)|9th Infantry Battalion]] and the [[61st Battalion (Australia)|61st Infantry Battalion]] also took part in the fighting.\n\nAgainst Japanese tactics that included massed attacks, the Australians utilised [[Tank|armour]] and [[artillery]], and in the end these proved decisive. Commencing in late March, after the Australian advance had been halted by wet weather, over the course of several days the Japanese launched several probing raids followed by heavy attacks against the Australians.  The final assault on the knoll came on the night of 4/5 April when 129 men from 'B' Company, 25th Infantry Battalion repulsed an attack by a force of about 1,100 Japanese, killing 292. This proved to be the 7th Brigade's final involvement in the campaign as they were relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]] shortly afterwards. Overall, 620 Japanese were killed in the battle with another 1,000 estimated to have been wounded, while the Australians suffered 189 casualties.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\nAt the beginning of 1945, the south-eastern part of Bougainville was occupied by the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]],{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=211}} under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Tsutomu Akinaga]].{{#tag:ref|Akinaga, formerly chief of staff of the [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|XVII Army]], took over command of the division from Lieutenant General [[Masatane Kanda]] when Kanda was promoted to take over XVII Army.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=286}}|group=Note}} Made up of the [[13th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|13th]] and [[23rd Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|23rd Infantry Regiments]]\u2014600 and 700-strong respectively\u2014as well as the 6th Field Artillery Regiment, the 6th Engineer Regiment, the 6th Transport Regiment and the 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, Akinaga's division consisted of 3,300 men.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{#tag:ref|The Australian estimate of this force was between 2,400 and 2,700 men.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}|group=Note}}\n\nThe previous November, the [[II Corps (Australia)|Australian II Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Stanley Savige]] had taken over responsibility of the island from the US [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]], who had been transferred to fight in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944-45)|Philippines]].

In order to counter this, it was decided that the Australian II Corps\u2014consisting of [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] and [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] troops from the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th]] and [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigades]]{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=92}}{{#tag:ref|Also attached to the Australian corps were two field artillery regiments, the [[2nd Field Regiment (Australia)|2nd]] and [[4th Field Regiment (Australia)|4th Field Regiments]], a company from the [[1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion]], the [[2/8th Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/8th Commando Squadron]], and a squadron of Matilda II tanks from [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]].{{sfn|Long|1963|p=99}}|group=Note}}\u2014would go on the offensive{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=108}} and a three-pronged campaign was planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=113}}\n\nAs a result, the Australian campaign on the island developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow [[Bonis Peninsula]] and contained; in the centre, the [[Battle of Pearl Ridge|seizure of Pearl Ridge]] would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west thoroughfares and protection against further counterattacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign would take place in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}} Consequently, on 21 January, Savige directed the 3rd Division under Major General [[William Bridgeford]] to take \"swift and vigorous action\" to destroy Japanese forces in southern Bougainville. The division's immediate task was to advance south to the Puriata,{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this river was \"Priaka\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=282}}|group=Note}} and send patrols across it. Savige considered that the Japanese division was \"weak and off balance\"{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=141}} due to casualties and disease as well as a shortage of supplies. Brigadier [[Raymond Monaghan]]'s [[29th Brigade (Australia)|29th Brigade]] had opened the campaign in the south in mid-December, crossing the Jaba River, before conducting a series of landings by barge along the coast of [[Empress Augusta Bay]], outflanking the Tuju, Tavera, Adele and Hupai Rivers, in what became dubbed the \"Battle of the Swamps\" by the Australians. The fighting during this time resulted in 240 Japanese killed, and 148 Australian casualties. Monaghan was also relieved of his command.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=158\u2013167}}\n\nIn late January, the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]], under Brigadier [[John Field (brigadier)|John Field]], which had been patrolling the Jaba River to protect the 29th Brigade's rear while they pushed south, was subsequently tasked to \"take Mosigetta, clear the enemy from the Kupon\u2013Nigitan\u2013Sisiruai area, and patrol along the Puriata\".{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=142}} Each of the brigade's three infantry battalions was marginally below full strength at the time, with frontages of between 600 and 700 personnel around the start of the battle.{{sfn|AWM52 8/3/46/25: 9th Infantry Battalion: March \u2013 April 1945|}}{{sfn|AWM52 8/3/63/23: 25th Infantry Battalion: March, May \u2013 June 1945 |}}{{sfn|AWM52 8/3/96/21: 61st Infantry Battalion: February \u2013 March 1945}}\n\n==Prelude==\nIn late January, a company from the Australian [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Infantry Battalion]]\u2014under Lieutenant Colonel [[John McKinna]]\u2014subsequently carried out an amphibious landing south of Motupena Point, on the [[Solomon Sea]] coast and had cleared towards Matsunkei.

On 6 March, Japanese shelling of the knoll wounded an Australian, Private Carl Slater, who held his post until relieved. The only casualty during this period, the knoll was named after him as a result.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=153}}{{#tag:ref|The Japanese called the knoll \"Goshu-dai\", which translates as \"Australian Heights\".{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}}|group=Note}} Throughout March, the 25th Infantry Battalion continued to expand its perimeter, to the north and south, along the Buin Road, while the 9th moved west from Mosigetta to link up with them and the 61st skirted east around Makapeka.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=144}} By late March, though, heavy rain temporarily stopped the Australian advance, as the main road became impassable due to thick mud.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=193}}\n\nAlthough the Japanese sporadically [[artillery shell|shelled]] the knoll during March, there were no further Australian casualties. The 25th Infantry Battalion, which had established its headquarters and main defensive position around the knoll, in front of the Puriata River, sent out patrols every day, and on 9 March, one of these reported having killed 10 Japanese soldiers without loss to itself.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=153}} The Japanese also began making dawn attacks, in which [[light machine gun]]ners would approach by stealth, set up and fire on the Australian positions, then retire to their own lines, {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}} away. As the advance was halted, the Australians began to expect a major attack in the area of the knoll.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=154}}{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}\n\nThe Japanese launched a number of attacks on the Australians between 15 and 17 March.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=154}} Under fire from three sides and in danger of being enveloped, on 19 March the Australians launched an attack of their own along the Buin Road, and although they had some success in clearing the forward Japanese positions, they then encountered a system of pillboxes and trenches around the Hatai Road junction.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=134}} The 25th Infantry Battalion's commander, McKinna, ordered the two platoons led by Lieutenant [[Richard David Keith Jefferies DSO|Dick Jefferies]] to attack the pillboxes, supported by a section of machine guns, and several [[PIAT]] anti-tank weapons. A two-hour fire-fight and a bayonet charge followed.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=154\u2013155}} This attack was ultimately beaten back by the defenders with the loss of eight Australians killed and 14 wounded.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=155}} A second attack was launched on 22 March. Supported by heavy artillery, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and machine guns, it proved successful, largely after the individual efforts of Corporal [[Reg Rattey]], who single-handedly silenced several bunkers.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|pp=134\u2013135}}{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}\n\nAs the Australians began to prepare for the next stage of the offensive,{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|p=31}} important intelligence confirmed that the Japanese were planning a large-scale counterattack in the area.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}} Believing that the Australian forces in the area surrounding the knoll were limited to just 400 men and observing that the Australians had not had time to reorganise, the Japanese XVII Army commander\u2014Lieutenant General [[Masatane Kanda]]\u2014ordered the 6th Division commander\u2014Akinaga\u2014to delay the Australian advance towards the south. Akinaga assessed that a counterattack against the Australian forces at this point with the entire weight of his division might be successful at this time and consequently he gave the order for his division to begin an attack across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=281}} Akinaga planned to commit 2,000 men to the assault, while 1,300 would be held back to act as ammunition carriers.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}}\n\nAccording to Karl James, no detailed orders were produced for the attack and deliberate planning was hastily completed with little or no co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}} In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack, began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields of fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting [[Vickers medium machine gun]]s and [[Bren light machine gun]]s. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=193\u2013195}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Probing raids===\n[[File:Bougainville campaign 1945.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Some key locations in the Bougainville campaign.|alt=A map of Bougainville Island, indicating the location of several key battles in the campaign]]\n\nThe main attack was planned for 1 April, but as the various Japanese units moved into position,{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}} a number of minor probes were made by elements of the Japanese 6th Engineer Regiment in the Australian rear areas and along their [[line of communication]]s.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} The first raid came on the night of 27/28 March, when a force of about 100 Japanese exploited a gap between the 25th Infantry Battalion's main defensive position and its 'B' Echelon\u2014which included its transport and logistics elements and was protected by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion\u2014fixed bayonets and then assaulted the rear of the Australian perimeter. The Australians had been alerted to their approach after the communication line between the two positions had been cut, and when the attack began the men had already been roused and the weapons pits fully manned. As a result, the attack failed and was turned back. A number of Japanese survivors managed to dig-in near the perimeter and later fired upon the Australian clearing patrol that was sent out the following morning, as well as snipe at the company defending 'B' Echelon's position. Afterwards, the Australians counted 19 dead Japanese around their position, while they also managed to capture one of the wounded. Against this, the 25th Infantry Battalion had lost three killed and seven wounded.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nAnother probe was made early on the morning of 28 March on the positions of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on the west bank of the Puriata River from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the [[booby trap]]s that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}\n\nThat evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's rear echelon at Barara, along the Toko\u2013Mosigetta\u2013Buin Road, came under attack. Under the command of the battalion [[second-in-command]], and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThroughout 29 March, the Japanese continued the tactic of using small-scale attacks to test the Australian defences and isolate the 25th Infantry Battalion's forward companies from its headquarters and rear. Over the course of the morning and into the afternoon, one of its companies was probed, while the headquarters also came under attack. The company from the 61st Infantry Battalion protecting the 25th Infantry Battalion's line of communications also came under attack from the 70 Japanese that were believed to be entrenched between the 'B' Echelon and the 25th's main positions, suffering two killed and two wounded.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}} Later, it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing for a major attack against Slater's Knoll, following the capture of a Japanese sergeant who confirmed that the probes were, in the words of [[Gavin Long]], the \"prelude to a full-scale offensive\".{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThese probes intensified on 30 March, as one of the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies was strongly attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol at the time of the attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Bougainville Matilda (AWM 018384).jpg|thumb|left|[[Matilda II]] tanks of the Australian 2/4th Armoured Regiment advancing towards Slater's Knoll on 30 March 1945|alt=Soldiers in combat equipment carrying rifles advance along a dirt road in front of a tank]]\n\nCommunications between the brigade and battalion headquarters and the forward company positions broke down at this stage and runners had to be dispatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and had run out of water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter,{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}} but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of [[Matilda II|Matilda tanks]] under Major Kenneth Arnott from the [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]] at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and over the course of the day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable to move under their own power.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nThis was the first time tanks had been used in the campaign and the going was slow. By 19:00 on 30 March they reached the 'B' Echelon position. Early on 31 March the tanks moved up to the battalion headquarters on Slater's Knoll where they were escorted by a [[platoon]] from the headquarters company and moved out again, once again using bulldozers to improve the ground in front of them. Just as they did, the Japanese launched an attack on one of the isolated companies. When they were {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the forward positions, the infantry deployed to the left and right of the tanks and they began their advance to contact, arriving just in time to help defeat the Japanese attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nAs the forward companies began to move back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There they were able to reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=161\u2013162}} McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n===First major assault===\nThe next morning, 1 April, the Australians extended across the Kero Creek and advanced north to the Puriata where they established a perimeter {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} south of Slater's Knoll.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}} Around 12:00, the Japanese 6th Field Artillery Regiment, whose gunners had been converted to the role of infantry, set up a form-up position {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=on}} to the front of the Australian company holding the perimeter to the south of Slater's Knoll at a location the Japanese called Pain, which lay along the Buin Road.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} Before the attack could be launched, the Australians detected the movement of the Japanese and began firing upon them. Shortly after 12:40, the Japanese gunners launched their assault. Firing their weapons from the hip, they rushed the Australian position, pushing the defenders back, leaving dead and wounded behind. That evening, the Australians launched a series of determined counterattacks in order to re-establish contact between Slater's Knoll and the forward companies, however, these were turned back.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Slaters knoll 1942 s.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Location of the Battle of Slater's Knoll in south west Bougainville.|alt=A location map, depicting a portion of the western coast of Bougainville, showing the relative position of Slater's Knoll, the Buin Road and several other key locations]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment, which had advanced on the right flank from Barara{{#tag:ref| The Japanese name for this location was \"Bara Bara\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}|group=Note}} attempted to move on Slater's Knoll from the north. Finding its way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking the equipment necessary to remove them, it was forced to halt its advance and cover the flank of Colonel Toyoji Muta's 13th Infantry Regiment, which was attempting to launch an assault across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} At this point, the river was about {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, while the opposite bank was about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The crossing began at 03:00 on 1 April, and the three battalions made heavy work of it. When they were halfway across, the two forward battalions were spotted by the Australians in the moonlight and engaged with machine gun and rifle fire.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} The Japanese quickly deployed and attempted to launch an attack; however, in the confusion the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment was cut off from the rest of the assault force. As daylight came, the Australians were able to call down mortar fire on the Japanese, causing considerable casualties. Running low on ammunition and having suffered considerable losses, the 23rd Infantry were forced to withdraw. The 1st Battalion  remained cut off until the evening of 1 April, when it was able to re-establish contact with the other two battalions and report to the divisional commander that the attack had been unsuccessful.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|pp=284\u2013285}}\n\n===Lull in the battle and secondary attack===\nOn 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akinaga, called the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments back across the Puriata, to a position south-west of the Pain feature.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} At this point, the decision was made to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nOn the night of 4/5 April, the Japanese heavily shelled the Australian artillery battery, while communications between brigade headquarters and the 25th Infantry Battalion headquarters were severed, as were the lines from the 25th Infantry Battalion's headquarters to its forward companies. Suspecting that the attack was about to commence, runners were sent and the men defending Slater's Knoll, now consisting of a force of only 129 men from 'B' Company, stood-to.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nAt 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese launched an attack from the north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south-west.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=162\u2013163}} For the next 80 minutes, 900\u20131,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment to deal with them the Japanese attack stalled.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well-sited machine guns.{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Muta, in a final act of defiance wrapped his unit's banner around his waist and armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=211}}  At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had enough. Just after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe day after the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=250}} In total, over the course of the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and estimated that another 1,000 had probably been wounded.{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=251}} Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=208}} Four wounded Japanese were also taken [[prisoner of war]]. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=163\u2013164}} Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\n[[File:Japanese dead after the Battle of Slater's Knoll.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese killed during the final assault on Slater's Knoll are buried the day after the battle|alt=Soldiers burying dead in a large pit]]\n\nThe result of the battle had a profound effect on the Japanese commanders. According to James, Kanda had been \"so certain of victory...[he]...had not developed any plans for...subsequent activities\".{{sfnp|James|2012|p=218}} Nevertheless, after the battle, the Japanese forces in the area pulled back to the [[Hongorai River]], where they were reorganised due to the heavy losses, with several infantry, engineer and artillery units being amalgamated. Lacking food, suffering the effects of disease, and isolated from home, morale amongst the Japanese troops fell heavily, with many realising that the war was lost. There was an increase in desertions at this time, although the vast majority continued to fight, if only because they were under orders to do so.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=210\u2013219}}\n\nOperationally, the battle proved to the Australian high command how effective armour could be when used in close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The use of [[Universal carrier|machine gun carriers]] to carry out the wounded had also been quite effective.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault even when it was clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=210}} Long goes on to argue that if the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result might have been different. The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\nThere were tactical deficiencies as well, particularly the predictability of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and bunching together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians to take full toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=211\u2013212}} Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, for after the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After the failure of the final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians might have been able to bring up and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=165}}\n\nIn the days immediately after the battle, the Australians continued to carry out patrolling operations around the knoll. On 7 April, a patrol from the 9th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force of about 30 men and in the ensuing engagement four Japanese were killed, while a patrol from the 61st Infantry Battalion on 8 April killed another five. On 13 April, the order was given that the 7th Brigade would be gradually withdrawn and relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th]].{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=166}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=231}} Shortly afterwards, the [[58th/59th Battalion (Australia)|58th/59th Infantry Battalion]] replaced the 25th in occupation of the knoll, while the [[24th Battalion (Australia)|24th Infantry Battalion]] resumed the advance along the Buin Road on 17 April,{{sfnp|Keogh|1965|p=419}} subsequently taking part in the [[Battle of the Hongorai River|fighting along the Hongorai River]].{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=122}} The 9th Infantry Battalion, however, was not withdrawn immediately, and remained in the northern area until it handed over to the [[57th/60th Battalion (Australia)|57th/60th Infantry Battalion]] in early May. The fighting on Bougainville continued throughout April as the Japanese resisted the Australian advance and went on until July when the fighting petered out due to heavy rain and flooding.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nAfter the war, the [[battle honour]] of \"Slater's Knoll\" was awarded to the 25th Infantry Battalion and the 2/4th Armoured Regiment. Neither the 9th or 61st Infantry Battalions were similarly credited, although according to Gordon Maitland there seems to be no explanation as to why.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=145}} For his actions during the attack on the Japanese pillboxes on 22 March, Rattey later received the [[Victoria Cross]]. Initially, his battalion commander, McKinna, had nominated him for the lesser [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]], but on review by Field, the brigade commander, the nomination was elevated. It was subsequently announced in the ''London Gazette'' in July 1945.{{sfnp|''London Gazette'' 24 July 1945|p=3857}}{{sfnp|James|2012|p=212}}\n\n==Notes==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |url = https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1022979/ |title=AWM52 8/3/46/25: 9th Infantry Battalion: March \u2013 April 1945 |work=Unit war diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=CITEREFAWM52 8/3/46/25: 9th Infantry Battalion: March \u2013 April 1945 }}\n* {{cite web |url = https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1026959/ |title=AWM52 8/3/63/23: 25th Infantry Battalion: March, May \u2013 June 1945 |work=Unit war diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=CITEREFAWM52 8/3/63/23: 25th Infantry Battalion: March, May \u2013 June 1945 }}\n* {{cite web |url = https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1026922/ |title=AWM52 8/3/96/21: 61st Infantry Battalion: February \u2013 March 1945|work=Unit war diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=CITEREFAWM52 8/3/96/21: 61st Infantry Battalion: February \u2013 March 1945 }}\n* {{cite book|last1=Belham|first1=David|last2=Denham |first2= Peter|title=The Blue Diamonds: The History of 7th Brigade, 1915\u20132008|year=2009|publisher=Department of Defence|location=Puckapunyal, Victoria|oclc=525034269|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=Where Australians Fought: The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year=1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=St Leonards, New South Wales|isbn= 1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Grey|first=Jeffrey|title=A Military History of Australia|edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne, Victoria|year=2008|isbn= 978-0-521-69791-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=James|first=Karl|title=The Hard Slog: Australians in the Bougainville Campaign, 1944\u201345|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Port Melbourne, Victoria|isbn=978-1-107-01732-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Johnston|first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Johnston (historian)|title=The Australian Army in World War II|year=2007|publisher =Osprey Publishing|location=Botley, Oxford|isbn=978-1-84603-123-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Keogh|first=Eustace|title=South West Pacific 1941\u201345|year=1965|publisher= Grayflower Publications|location=Melbourne, Victoria|oclc=7185705|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Long|first=Gavin |authorlink=Gavin Long |title=The Final Campaigns|series=Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945, Series 1\u2014Army.

At least one grey seal, probably escaped from captivity, has been observed in the [[Black Sea]] near the coasts of [[Ukraine]].<ref>Kovtun O.O.
