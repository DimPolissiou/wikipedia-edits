Associate membership was made available to other professional personnel of the agencies holding full memberships, and also to personnel of educational institutions engaged in teaching industrial hygiene. Governmental industrial hygiene personnel of other countries were eligible for affiliated membership.\n\nThe Conference came into being with 59 members, one affiliated member, and 16 associate members. Forty-three members, one associate and six guests, attended the initial Conference. All but five of the members were from health departments. The New York and Massachusetts state labor departments had two each present, and there was one from the West Virginia state compensation commission.\n\nAt the end of World War II, many individuals were leaving governmental employment and membership in the Conference declined from the peak of 281 in 1944 to 235 in 1946. Changes due to the transition to a peacetime economy, the development of other professional associations, and changes in the technical and administrative needs of state and local agencies, required the Conference to revise its constitution and make some major changes in its organizational structure.\n\nThe 1946 constitution revisions abandoned the concept of limiting full membership to only two individuals from each governmental industrial hygiene agency. This opened the doors to all of their professional personnel to participate in the activities of the organization on an equal basis. Governmental industrial hygiene personnel from foreign countries were also given the right to full membership. These changes, among others, were to have a salutary effect on the organization which, in 1946, changed its name to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH<sup>\u00ae</sup>).\n\nIn the mid 1950s, steady growth in membership resumed and by 1960 there were 511 members, including 54 from other countries. During the next decade these numbers more than doubled and in 1977 the total reached 1,800, of which 166 were from outside the United States.\n\nFor over 75 years, ACGIH<sup>\u00ae</sup> has been dedicated to the industrial hygiene and occupational and environmental health and safety communities. They have grown and expanded without losing sight of their original goal - to encourage the interchange of experience among industrial hygiene workers and to collect and make accessible such information and data as might be of aid to them in the proper fulfillment of their duties. This original goal is reflected in both their current mission - the advancement of occupational and environmental health - and in their tagline: Defining the Science of Occupational and Environmental Health.\n\nThis scientific information is provided to members and others in the industry through our journal, professional conferences and seminars, as well as through a vast list of technical and scientific publications, including the ''[http://www.acgih.org/forms/store/CommercePlusFormPublic/search?action=Feature TLVs<sup>\u00ae</sup> and BEIs<sup>\u00ae</sup>]'' book.\n\nPresently, nine ACGIH<sup>\u00ae</sup> committees focus their energies on a range of topics: agricultural safety and health, air sampling instruments, bioaerosols, biological exposure indices, industrial ventilation, international, small business, chemical substance TLVs<sup>\u00ae</sup>, and physical agent TLVs<sup>\u00ae</sup>.<ref>ACGIH<sup>\u00ae</sup> Committees.

Risankizumab has been approved in Europe, USA, Canada and Japan for treatment of moderate to severe plaque [[psoriasis]] in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.\n\n== Clinical trials ==\n=== Psoriasis ===\nIn a phase I clinical trial, thirty-nine patients received single-dose risankizumab, 18 of which received the drug intravenously, 13 subcutaneously, and eight received the placebo drug. There were several instances that adverse effects occurred but in the same frequency for the placebo and the experimental groups. Four serious adverse events occurred in the risankizumab treated patients, all of which were judged not treatment related. Risankizumab was associated with clinical improvement in individuals treated with the drug, from week 2 and maintained for up to 66 weeks after treatment. At week 12 of treatment, 75%, 90%, and 100% decreases in the [[Psoriasis Area and Severity Index]] (PASI) were achieved by 87%, 58%, and 16% of risankizumab treated patients, regardless of dose, respectively, versus individuals receiving placebo. Significant correlation between treatment-associated molecular changes and PASI improvement was observed in the risankizumab treated patients.<ref name=\"pmid25769911\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Krueger JG, Ferris LK, Menter A, Wagner F, White A, Visvanathan S, Lalovic B, Aslanyan S, Wang EE, Hall D, Solinger A, Padula S, Scholl P | display-authors = 6 | title = Anti-IL-23A mAb BI 655066 for treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis: Safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker results of a single-rising-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 116\u2013124.e7 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25769911 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2015.01.018 }}</ref>\n\nThe efficacy, safety and tolerability was further investigated in a phase III program comprising four clinical trials which compared risankizumab to [[ustekinumab]], [[adalimumab]] and [[placebo]] in the indication of plaque psoriasis.

The Nordic countries have a long history of political unions and other close relations, but do not form a singular entity today. The [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist movement]] sought to unite Denmark, Norway and Sweden into one country in the 19th century. With the independence of Finland in the early 20th century, and Iceland in the mid 20th century, this movement expanded into the modern organised Nordic cooperation which includes the [[Nordic Council]] and the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]]. The [[Helsinki Treaty]] is the political agreement that sets the framework for Nordic cooperation in the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Especially in [[English language|English]], [[Scandinavia]] is sometimes used as a synonym for the Nordic countries, but that term more properly refers to the three monarchies of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

These three dominant languages are taught in schools throughout the Nordic region. For example, [[Mandatory Swedish|Swedish is a mandatory subject]] in [[Education in Finland|Finnish schools]] since Finland by law is a bilingual country. [[Danish language|Danish]] is mandatory in Faroese and Greenlandic schools as these insular states are a part of the [[The unity of the Realm|Danish Realm]] (''Rigsf\u00e6llesskabet''). Iceland also teaches Danish since Iceland too was a part of the Danish Realm until 1918. Beside these and the insular Scandinavian languages [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] which are also North Germanic languages, there are the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[S\u00e1mi languages|Sami]] branches of the [[Uralic languages]], spoken in Finland and in northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, respectively; and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], an [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut language]], spoken in [[Greenland]].

It is meant usually to refer to this larger group, since the term [[Scandinavia]] is narrower and sometimes ambiguous. The Nordic countries are generally considered to refer to Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands and the \u00c5land Islands).\n\nThe term \"Nordic countries\" found mainstream use after the advent of [[Foreningen Norden]].

Especially outside of the Nordic region the term Scandinavia is often used as a synonym for the Nordic countries.

This Arctic area is located around and north of the Arctic Circle in the three Nordic European countries Norway, Sweden and Finland and the Kola Peninsula in Russia.\n* [[Barents Region]]  is formed by the Cap of the North as well as the [[Northern Ostrobothnia]] and [[Kainuu]] regions of Finland, Swedish provinces of [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]], [[V\u00e4sterbotten]] and [[Norrbotten]], Russian Oblasts of [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|Arkhangelsk]] and [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]], as well as the Republics of [[Republic of Karelia|Karelia]] and [[Komi Republic|Komi]].

However, one important collection that exists is a widespread and rich collection of stone drawings known as [[petroglyphs]]. The [[Goths]], who originated in southern [[Scandinavia]] and would later divide into [[Visigoths]] and [[Ostrogoths]], are known to have been one of the [[Germanic people]] that would later relate to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and the emergence of [[Medieval Europe]]. However, these acquired the [[Western Roman Empire|Latin culture of Rome]].<ref name=\"EBOgoth\">{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Goth|title= Goth |website= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |date= 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Nordic countries first came into more permanent contact with the rest of Europe during the [[Viking age]]. Southern Finland and northern parts of Sweden and Norway were areas where the Vikings mostly only traded and had raids, whilst the permanent settlements of Vikings in the Nordic region were in southern Norway and Sweden, Denmark and Faroes as well as parts of Iceland, Greenland and [[Oeselians|Estonia]]. Christian Europe responded to the raids and conquest of Vikings with intensive missionary work. The missionaries wanted the new territories to be ruled by Christian kings who would help to strengthen the church. After conversion to Christianity in the 11th century, three northern kingdoms emerged in the region: Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Iceland first became a [[Icelandic Commonwealth|commonwealth]] before it came under Norwegian rule in the early 13th century. There were several secular powers who aimed to bring Finland under their rule, but through the [[Second Swedish Crusade|Second]] and [[Third Swedish Crusade]] in the latter part of 13th and through [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|the colonisation]] of some coastal areas of Finland with Christian Swedes, the Swedish rule was gradually established in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hel.fi/hel2/kaumuseo/rakennusinventoinnit/raportit/kyl_paikkainventointi.pdf|title=Helsingin keskiaikaiset ja uuden ajan alun kyl\u00e4npaikat 2011, Inventointiraportti 2011.

The monarchies strengthened their positions in the 12th and 13th centuries through imposing taxes on peasants and a class of nobles also emerged. By the Late Middle Ages, the whole of the Nordic Region was politically united in the loose [[Kalmar Union]]. Diverging interests and especially Sweden's dissatisfaction over the Danish dominance gave rise to a conflict that hampered the union from the 1430s onward until its final dissolution in 1523. After the dissolution Denmark and Norway, including Iceland, formed a personal union of the two kingdoms called [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] whilst the successful period of [[History of Sweden (1523\u20131611)|Vasa Kings]] began in Sweden and Finland. The [[Lutheran Reformation]] played a major role in the establishment of the early-modern states in Denmark\u2013Norway and Sweden.\n\n=== Early modern period and industrialization ===\nSweden was very successful during the Thirty Years' War, while Denmark was a failure. Sweden saw an opportunity of a change of power in the region. Denmark\u2013Norway had a threatening territory surrounding Sweden and the Sound Dues were a continuing irritation for the Swedes. In 1643, the Swedish Privy Council determined Swedish territorial gain in an eventual war against Denmark\u2013Norway to have good chances. Not long after this, Sweden invaded Denmark\u2013Norway.\n\nDenmark was poorly prepared for the war and Norway was reluctant to attack Sweden, which left the Swedes in a good position.\n\nThe war ended as foreseen with Swedish victory and with the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]] in 1645 Denmark\u2013Norway had to cede some of their territories, including Norwegian territories [[J\u00e4mtland|Jemtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen|Herjedalen]] and [[\u00c4lvdalen Municipality|Idre and Serna]], as well as the Danish [[Baltic Sea]] islands of [[Gotland]] and [[Saaremaa|\u00d6sel]]. The Thirty Years' War thus began the [[Swedish Empire|rise of Sweden as a great power]], while it marked the start of decline for the Danish.\n\nTo some extent in the 16th century and certainly in the 17th, the Nordic region played a major role in European politics at the highest level. The struggle for dominion over the [[Baltic Sea]] and its trading opportunities raged between Denmark\u2013Norway and Sweden, which began to impact upon the neighboring nations. Sweden prevailed in the long term and became a major European power as it extended its reach into coastal tracts in modern-day Russia, Estonia, Latvia and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] also [[Pomerania]] and other North German areas. Sweden also conquered vast areas from Denmark\u2013Norway during the [[Northern Wars]] in the middle of the 17th century. Sweden also had several conflicts with Russia over Finland and other eastern areas of the country and after the [[Great Northern War]] (1700\u20131721) Sweden lost most of its territories outside the old Swedish border to Russia which then became the new major power in Northern Europe.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815), the political map of the Nordic countries altered again. In 1809, Finland was conquered by [[Russian Empire]] from Sweden in the [[Finnish War]], after which Finland became the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. In turn, Sweden captured Norway from Denmark in 1814 in the [[Swedish\u2013Norwegian War (1814)|Swedish\u2013Norwegian War]] and started a [[Union between Sweden and Norway]]. Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, which had been re-colonised in the 18th century, remained Danish. Population growth and industrialization brought change to the Nordic countries during the 19th century and new social classes steered political systems towards democracy. International politics and [[nationalism]] also created the preconditions for the later independence of [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|Norway in 1905]], [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland in 1917]] and [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|Iceland in 1944]].\n\n=== Late modern period and contemporary era ===\n[[File:The Prime Ministers of the Nordic Countries in October 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Nordic prime ministers at the [[Nordic Council]] meeting in 2014 in [[Stockholm]]]]\n\nDuring the two world wars and the Cold War, the five small Nordic states were forced into difficult balancing acts, but retained their independence and developed peaceful democracies. The Nordic states had been neutral during [[World War I]], but during [[World War II]] they could no longer stand apart from world politics. The [[Soviet Union]] attacked Finland in 1939 and Finland ceded territory following the [[Winter War]]. In 1941, Finland launched a [[Continuation War|retaliatory strike]] in conjunction with the German attack on the Soviet Union. However, more territory was lost and for many years to come Finnish foreign policy was based on [[Finlandization|appeasing the Soviet Union]], even though Finland was able to retain its democratic form of government. [[Denmark in World War II|Denmark]] and [[Norway in World War II|Norway]] were occupied by Germany in 1940. The Allies responded by occupying Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. [[Sweden in World War II|Sweden]] managed to formally maintain its neutrality in the Axis/Allies conflict and avoided direct hostilities, but in practice it adapted to the wishes of the dominant power \u2013 first Germany, later the Allies. However, during the Winter War between Finland and Russia in 1939\u20131940, Sweden did support Finland and declared itself \"non combatant\" rather than neutral.\n\nCompared with large parts of Europe, the Nordic region got off lightly during the World War II, which partially explains its strong post-war economic development. The [[labour movement]] \u2013 both trade unions and political parties \u2013 was an important political presence throughout the Nordic countries in the 20th century. The big social democratic parties became dominant and after World War II the Nordic countries began to serve as a [[Nordic model|model]] for the welfare state. Economically, the five Nordic countries were strongly dependent on foreign trade and so they positioned themselves alongside the big trading blocks. Denmark was the first to join [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1972 and after it became [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993 Finland and Sweden also joined in 1995. Norway and Iceland have remained part of [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA).\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|Geography of \u00c5land|Geography of Denmark|Geography of the Faroe Islands|Geography of Finland|Geography of Greenland|Geography of Iceland|Geography of Norway|Geography of Sweden}}\n\n[[File:Norden satellite.jpg|thumb|Satellite map of the Nordic countries]]\n[[File:Resundsbron 2009-09-17, Johannes Jansson.jpg|thumb|The [[\u00d6resund Bridge]] between [[Malm\u00f6]] in Sweden and [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark]]\n\nThe Nordic countries in alphabetic order\u2014number of inhabitants (2018), area (km<sup>2</sup>) and population density (people/km<sup>2</sup>):\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!Country!!Inhabitants!!Area!!Pop.

The area is so vast that it covers five [[time zone|time zones]]. To the east the region borders [[Russia]], and on the west the [[Canada|Canadian]] coastline can be seen from Greenland on a clear day. Even excluding Greenland and the Norwegian islands of [[Svalbard]] and [[Jan Mayen]], the remaining part of the Nordic countries covers around 1.3 million square kilometres. This is about the same area as France, Germany and Italy together. To the south, the countries neighbor the [[Baltic states]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], while to the north there is the [[Arctic Ocean]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook  |publisher=Nordic Council |page=24 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nNotable natural features of the Nordic countries include the [[Norwegian fjords]], the [[Archipelago Sea]] between Finland and Sweden, the [[Geology of Iceland|extensive volcanic and geothermal activity of Iceland]], and Greenland, which is the largest island in the world. The southernmost point of the Nordic countries is [[Gedser]], on the island of [[Falster]] in Denmark. The northernmost point is [[Kaffeklubben Island]] in Greenland, which is also the northernmost point of land on Earth. The largest cities and capitals of the Nordic countries are situated on the southern parts of the region, with the exception of [[Reykjav\u00edk]], the capital of Iceland. [[Helsinki]], [[Oslo]] and [[Stockholm]] are all close to the same latitude as the southernmost point of Greenland, [[Egger Island]] (''Itilleq''): about 60[[latitude|\u00b0N]].\n\n=== Topography ===\n{{see also|Muddus plains|Sub-Cambrian peneplain}}\nAll of Denmark and most of Finland lie below 200 m, the topography of both is countries being relatively flat. In Denmark, [[moraine]]s and [[tunnel valley]]s add some relief to the landscape while in Finland the surroundings of lakes [[Pielinen]] and [[Lake P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne|P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne]] display some moderate relief. The Finnish area just east of [[Bothnian Bay]] stand out as the largest plain in the Nordic countries.<ref name=Rudberg/> The [[Scandinavian Mountains]] dominate the landscape of Norway. The southern part of the Scandinavian Mountains is broader than the northern one and contain higher peaks. The southern part contains also a series of [[Paleic surface|plateaux and gently undulating plains]]. The western parts of mountains are cut by fjords producing a dramatic landscape. The landscape of Sweden can be described as a mixture of that of Norway, Finland and Denmark. Except at the [[High Coast]] the coastal areas of Sweden form lowlands. Sweden has three highland areas, the [[South Swedish highlands|South Swedish Highlands]], the Scandinavian Mountains and the [[Norrland terrain]] which is the eastern continuation of the Scandinavian Mountains.<ref name=Rudberg/> The South Swedish Highland and the Norrland terrain are separated by the [[Central Swedish lowland]]. The topography of Iceland stands out among the Nordic countries for being a bowl-formed highland.<ref name=Rudberg>{{cite book |last=Rudberg |first=Sten |author-link=Sten Rudberg |year=1960 |title=Geography of Norden |chapter=Geology and Morphology |chapter-url= |location= |publisher= |pages=27\u201340|editor-last=Somme|editor-first=Axel|editor-link=Axel S\u00f8mme |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{main|Climate of the Nordic countries}}\n[[File:Average temperatures in the capitals of the Nordic countries in 2012.jpg|thumb|Average temperatures in the capitals of the Nordic countries in 2012]]\nDespite their northern location, the Nordic countries generally have a mild climate compared with other countries that share globally the same latitudes. The climate in the Nordic countries is mainly influenced by their northern location, but remedied by the vicinity to the ocean and the [[Gulf Stream]] which brings warm ocean currents from the tip of Florida. Even far to the north, the winters can be quite mild, though north of the Polar Circle the climate zone is Arctic with harsh winters and short summers. The sea has a heavy influence on the weather in the western coastal zones of Iceland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden. The precipitation is high and snow cover during winters is rare. Summers are generally cool.\n\nThe further away that one gets from the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream the colder it gets during the winters. Finland, most of Sweden and the south-eastern part of Norway are influenced by the vast continent to the east which results in warm and long summers and clear and cold winters, often with snow. For example, [[Bergen]] at the west coast of Norway normally has a temperature above zero in February while [[Helsinki]] in Finland normally will have a temperature of 7\u20138&nbsp;\u00b0C below zero during the same month.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=23\u201326 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nClimatic conditions and quality of land have determined how land is used in the Nordic countries. In densely populated mainland Denmark there is hardly any wild nature left. Most of the scarce forests are plantations and nearly 60 per cent of Denmark's total area is [[Cultivated land|cultivated]] or zoned as gardens or parks. On the other hand, in the other Nordic countries there is much wild nature left. Only between 0 and 9 per cent of the land in the other Nordic countries is cultivated. Around 17 per cent of the land area in Iceland is used for permanent meadows and pastures and both Finland, Norway as well as Sweden have large forest areas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=25 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n{{See also|Politics of \u00c5land|Politics of Denmark|Politics of Greenland|Politics of the Faroe Islands|Politics of Finland|Politics of Iceland|Politics of Norway|Politics of Sweden}}\n\n=== Nordic Council and Nordic Council of Ministers ===\n{{Main|Nordic Council}}\n\n[[File:Sessionssalen vid Nordiska Radets session i Oslo 2007.jpg|thumb|Nordic Council in session at the Parliament of Norway in 2007]]\n\nNordic co-operation is based on the \u201c[[Helsinki Treaty]]\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/information/formal-nordic-co-operation|title=Formal Nordic co-operation {{!}} Nordic cooperation|website=www.norden.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> Politically, Nordic countries do not form a separate entity, but they co-operate in the [[Nordic Council]] and the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]]. The council was established after World War II and its first concrete result was the introduction of a [[Nordic Passport Union]] in 1952. This resulted in a common [[labour economics|labour market]] and free movement across borders without passports for the countries' citizens. In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an intergovernmental forum, was established to complement the Council. The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in Copenhagen and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at Ved Stranden No. 18, close to Slotsholmen.\n\nThe Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called \"theme session\" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands and \u00c5land{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council|title=The Nordic Council \u2013 Nordic cooperation|publisher=}}</ref> The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its country's legislative assembly. With Denmark, Iceland and Norway being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[neutral country|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation. However, the Nordic foreign and security policy cooperation has become closer and over the past few years expanded its scope.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet/tiedote/fi.jsp?oid=408655 |title=Nordic Countries strengthen their cooperation in foreign and security policy |website=valtioneuvosto.fi |publisher=Finnish Government |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://formin.finland.fi/public/download.aspx?ID=126747&GUID={A6A5DF01-72E4-45BD-8B29-488EE055ACC1} |title=Joint statement by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden on Nordic foreign and security policy cooperation \u2013 building security in a comprehensive manner |publisher=Nordic council |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Nordic Council of Ministers is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility, but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work.

The welfare states were largely developed by strong [[Social democracy|social democrat]] parties and in Finland with cooperation with the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]]. Although the specifics differ between countries and there are ongoing political arguments, there is a strong consensus about keeping to the general concept.\n\nA central theme in the Nordic model is the \"universalist\" welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy, promoting social mobility and ensuring the universal provision of basic human rights, as well as for stabilizing the economy. In this model welfare is not just aid to those who are in need of it, but a central part of the life of everybody: education is free, healthcare has zero or nominal fees in most cases, most children go to municipal day care, ''et cetera''.\n\nThe Nordic model is distinguished from other types of welfare states by its emphasis on maximizing labour force participation, promoting gender equality, egalitarian and extensive benefit levels, the large magnitude of income redistribution and liberal use of expansionary fiscal policy. Trade unions are strong.\n\nThe model has been successful: the countries are among the wealthiest worldwide and there is little social unrest. In 2015, [[Save the Children]] ranked<ref>[[Save the Children]]: State of the World's Mothers 2015. {{ISBN|1-888393-30-0}}</ref> the Nordic countries as number 1\u20135 of countries where mothers and children fare the best (among 179 countries studied).\n\n=== Elections ===\n{{See also|Elections in Denmark|Elections in Greenland|Elections in the Faroe Islands|Elections in Finland|Elections in \u00c5land|Elections in Iceland|Elections in Norway|Elections in Sweden}}\n\n[[File:Vigdis Finnbogadottir (1985).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir]] served as the fourth President of Iceland from 1980 to 1996 and was the world's first [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state|democratically elected female head of state]]]]\n\nNordic parliaments are all based on a [[unicameralism|one-chamber system]]. The Norwegian parliament, the [[Storting]], did actually function as two separate chambers until 2009 when dealing with certain issues. The Icelandic [[Althing]], founded in 930 AD, is reputed to be the oldest working parliament in the world. In Denmark, Iceland and Sweden elections are held at least once every four years. Finland, \u00c5land and Norway have fixed four-year election periods. Elections in the Faroe Islands and Greenland follow the Danish system of elections. The Danish [[Folketing]] has 179 seats, including two seats each for the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The Finnish [[Eduskunta]] has 200 seats, including one seat for \u00c5land. The Icelandic Althing has 63 seats, the Norwegian Storting 169 seats and the Swedish [[Riksdag]] 349 seats. The Faroese [[L\u00f8gting]] has 32 seats, Greenland's [[Parliament of Greenland|Inatsisartut]] 31 seats and \u00c5land's [[Parliament of \u00c5land|Lagtinget]] 30 seats.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=91 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nNordic citizens \u2013 and in the three member countries of the EU also EU citizens \u2013 living in another Nordic country are normally entitled to vote in local government elections after three months of residence, while other foreign citizens have to reside in the Nordic countries for three to four years before they are eligible to vote. In Denmark and the Faroe Islands,  the percentage turn-out at elections is close to 90% per cent, but it is only about 67% in \u00c5land and Finland. Men are more often elected to the national assembly compared to women. The biggest bias between the two sexes is seen in the Faroe Islands and \u00c5land, while in Sweden men and women are close to being equally represented in the national assembly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=92 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Nordic Passport Union ===\n{{Main|Nordic Passport Union}}\n\nThe Nordic Passport Union, created in 1954 and implemented on 1 May 1958, allows [[citizenship|citizens]] of the Nordic countries: Denmark (Faroe Islands included since 1 January 1966, Greenland not included), Sweden, Norway ([[Svalbard]], [[Bouvet Island]] and [[Queen Maud Land]] not included), Finland and Iceland (since 24 September 1965) to cross approved border districts without carrying and having their [[passport]] checked. Other citizens can also travel between the Nordic countries' borders without having their passport checked, but still have to carry some sort of approved travel identification documents. As of November 2015, there are temporary border controls set up between Denmark and Sweden. These border controls were set up to tackle the issue with immigrants coming to Sweden in relation to the ongoing [[European migrant crisis]]\n\nSince 1996, these countries have been part of the larger EU directive [[Schengen Agreement]] area, comprising 30 countries in Europe. [[Border checkpoint|Border checkpoints]] have been removed within the [[Schengen Area]] and only a national [[identity document|ID card]] is required. Within the Nordic area any means of proving one's identity, e.g. a [[driving license|driving licence]], is valid for Nordic citizens because of the Nordic Passport Union. When traveling to other countries than the Nordics, public officials in the foreign services of any of the Nordic countries are to assist citizens of another Nordic country if that country is not represented in the territory concerned, according to the Helsinki treaty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/meld.-st.-12-20102011/id637527/sec3|title=Meld.

The [[Helsinki Treaty]] is the political agreement which sets the framework for Nordic cooperation. In this context, several aspects of the [[single market|common market]] as in the EU have been implemented decades before the EU implemented them. Intra-Nordic trade is not covered by the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|CISG]], but by local law. The Nordic countries have cooperated closely in the administrative and consular fields since the Nordic Passport Union was established and the Helsinki Treaty concluded. According to the Helsinki treaty, public officials in the [[List of diplomatic missions of the Nordic countries|foreign services of any of the Nordic countries]] are to assist citizens of another Nordic country if that country is not represented in the territory concerned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/meld.-st.-12-20102011/id637527/sec3|title=Meld. St. 12 (2010\u20132011)|date=April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the EU, the [[Northern Dimension]] refers to external and cross-border policies covering the Nordic countries, the Baltic countries and [[Russia]].\n\nThe political cooperation between the Nordic Countries has not led to a common policy or an agreement on the countries' memberships in the EU, [[Eurozone]] and [[NATO]]. Norway and Iceland are the only Nordic countries not members of the EU, while Finland and Sweden are the only Nordic countries not members of NATO. Denmark alone participates in both organizations. Only Finland is a member of the Eurozone. The tasks and policies of the EU overlap with the Nordic council significantly, e.g. the [[Schengen Agreement]] partially supersedes the Nordic [[passport-free zone]] and a common labor market.\n\nAdditionally, certain areas of Nordic countries have special relationships with the EU. For example, Finland's autonomous island province [[\u00c5land]] is [[Special member state territories and their relations with the EU#\u00c5land Islands|not a part of the EU VAT zone]].\n\n=== Current leaders ===\nAll the Nordic countries are long-established parliamentary democracies. Denmark, Norway and Sweden have a political system of [[constitutional monarchy]], in which a nonpolitical monarch acts as [[head of state]] and the ''[[de facto]]'' [[executive power]] is exercised by a [[Cabinet government|cabinet]] led by a prime minister. [[Margrethe II]] has reigned in Denmark as Queen Regnant and head of state since 14 January 1972, [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] became King of Sweden on 15 September 1973 and [[King Harald V]] of Norway has reigned since 17 January 1991.\n\nFinland and Iceland have been [[parliamentary republic|parliamentary republics]] since their independence. Both countries are led by prime ministers, whilst the directly elected president acts mostly as a ceremonial head of state with some legislative power. Finland had a long tradition of having a strong presidential system, since in the beginning of its independence [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]] was elected to the throne of Finland and Finland was to become a monarchy. This failed due to World War I and the fall of the [[German Empire]] and so it was a compromise that Finland became a republic with a strong head of state. The President's powers were once so broad that it was said Finland was the only real monarchy in northern Europe.

Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have for example experienced constant and large excess exports in recent years. Iceland is the only country which has balance of payments deficits as of 2011. At the same time, unemployment is low in most of the Nordic countries compared with the rest of Europe. As a result of the cyclical down-turn, the public balance is now in deficit, except for Norway. Over the past ten years, the Nordic countries had a noticeably larger increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) than the Eurozone. The only exceptions were Denmark and \u00c5land which had a lower growth. Measured by GDP per capita, the Nordic countries have a higher income than the Eurozone countries. Norway's GDP per capita is as high as 80 per cent above the EA17 average and Norway is actually one of the countries with the highest standard of living in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=99 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] and the following recession all the Nordic countries have been affected by the global crisis though to varying degrees. Iceland was most affected and had an [[2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis|economic crisis from 2008 to 2011]], but GDP growth was also negative in all the other Nordic countries in 2008 and 2009. From 2009 most of the Nordic countries experienced growth again. The Nordic Council has set an objective for Nordic co-operation to achieve stable and sustainable economic growth, development of the [[Nordic model|Nordic welfare model]], economic integration in the Nordic region and the promotion of joint Nordic interests at international level.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook  |publisher=Nordic Council |page=100 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n[[Private consumption]] has fallen during the crisis, but it gained pace again from 2010 onward. The decline was most profound in Denmark, Finland and Iceland. On the other hand, public consumption has experienced positive growth rates \u2013 except for Iceland since 2008 and Denmark since 2010. The general rise is due to the many fiscal initiatives made by the Nordic governments to support economic growth and the financial and business sectors. From 2006 Iceland has experienced a fall in gross capital formation. This is after many years with an Icelandic growth particularly driven by investments, which had more than tripled in the recent ten years. Iceland also holds a leading position compared to the other Nordic countries regarding growth in public consumption in the years from 2000 to 2008.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=101 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nRecent years\u2019 large [[balance-of-payments]] surplus in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden has reduced the countries\u2019 [[foreign debt]]. In addition to a balance-of-payments surplus or deficit, the size of a country's foreign debt and foreign assets is affected by the exchange rate and the price of securities. Consequently, Finland's foreign debt increased noticeably when the price of technology shares increased drastically in the late 1990s due to a large proportion of these shares being owned by households, funds and companies abroad. In this way, these foreign owners held a greater claim on Finland. When share prices decreased drastically in 1999\u20132001 in the [[dot-com bubble]], it also led to a marked decrease in Finland's net foreign debt. Iceland's foreign net debt accounts for close to five times of its GDP. This means that Iceland owes the surrounding world values corresponding to five times the country's total production. Sweden also had foreign debts by the end of 2010, but at a much smaller scale. In 2012, all Nordic countries had a surplus on the total balance of payments. Norway accounts for a substantial foreign exchange surplus, which is due to revenue from exports of oil and gas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=103\u201304 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Industries ===\n[[File:Statfjord A.JPG|thumb|[[Statfjord oil field|Statfjord]] [[oil platform]] in Norway is owned and operated by [[Equinor]], which is the [[List of largest Nordic companies|largest company in the Nordic countries]]]]\nSince the late 1990s, the Nordic [[manufacturing industry]] has accounted for a slightly declining proportion of the gross domestic product, with Norway being a distinct exception. In Norway, the manufacturing industry's proportion of GDP is still at a high level of around 35 per cent due to the large oil and natural gas sector. In the rest of the Nordic countries, the proportion lies between 15 and 20 per cent. Despite growing production, the manufacturing industry accounts for a decreasing proportion of total employment in the Nordic countries. Among the Nordic countries, Finland is today the number one Nordic industrial country, as the manufacturing industry in Finland accounts for the greatest proportion of the country's jobs, around 16 per cent. By way of comparison, in Denmark, Norway and Iceland it only accounts for less than 13 per cent of total employment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=106 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe service sector has increased drastically in all Nordic countries in the last 15 years and today accounts for about three fourths of all employed persons. Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Sweden and \u00c5land have the largest proportion of employed in the service sector, between 75 and more than 90 per cent of those employed, while the corresponding figure is 72 per cent in Finland and 70 per cent in Iceland. The service sector is a little smaller if its proportion of total gross domestic product is measured compared to the share of employment. In Norway, the service sector accounts for 57 per cent of GDP, in Iceland for 66 per cent, in Finland for 69 per cent, in Sweden for 72 per cent and in Denmark for 78 per cent. The service sector includes retail and wholesale trade, hotels, restaurants, transportation, communication, financial services, real estate sale, renting, business services and other services such as teaching and care of children, sick persons and the elderly \u2013 services which are typically rendered by the public sector in the Nordic countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=107 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Foreign investments ===\nIceland and Sweden have the highest rate of foreign direct investment, both with regards to foreign companies investing in Iceland and Sweden and Icelandic and Swedish companies investing abroad. However, in 2011 Denmark superseded Sweden regarding outward investments. Looking at a larger time span of ten years, most of the Nordic countries have experienced growth in both inward and outward investments.\n\nHowever, Iceland has been in a league of its own in this area. Foreign investment from Iceland increased significantly and sharply especially from 2003 to 2007 from 16 to 123 per cent of GDP. The expansion of Icelandic companies into foreign markets was a rapid process. Strong pension funds provided capital for investments, and the privatization of the banking system made new sources of financing available for companies wishing to expand their operations. Also inward investment to Iceland increased sharply from 2003, but at a more moderate level compared with other Nordic countries. This pattern changed in 2007 with dramatic decreases in both outward and inward foreign direct investment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=105 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Foreign and intra-Nordic trade ===\n[[File:BERGEN VIKING.JPG|thumb|The [[Port of Gothenburg]] is the largest port in the Nordic countries]]\nNordic co-operation is characterized largely by the international community and the global challenges and opportunities. The Nordic countries, which are relatively small, have historically and still are benefiting greatly by obtaining common use in cooperation with other countries and institutions. The Nordic economies are small and open and thus the countries are [[export|export-depending]]. Foreign trade constitutes an important part of the economic activity. Nordic foreign trade in goods, measured as the average of imports and exports, amounts to more than one fourth of GDP in the Nordic countries. All the Nordic countries except Finland had a surplus in their balance of trade in 2012 and every year since 1995 Denmark, Norway and Sweden have all had greater exports than imports.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=108 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe trade between the Nordic countries is especially considerable as about one fifth of the countries\u2019 foreign trade is trade with other Nordic countries. The total population of the Nordic countries of around 26 million people makes them to a far greater extent dependent on each other with respect to exports and imports, compared to for example [[Germany]] with a population of 82 million people. Swedish exports to the other Nordic countries account for a considerably higher share than combined Swedish exports to Germany and [[France]] \u2013 despite the fact that the total population of Germany and France is 147 million people, while Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway only have a total population of 16 million. In 2012, around 23 per cent of the total exports from both Denmark and Sweden went to other Nordic countries. Other Nordic countries account for 16 per cent of Finnish exports, 13 per cent of Norwegian exports and 10 per cent of the total exports in Iceland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=111 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the other Nordic countries, The EU is the largest trading partner for the Nordic countries. Especially important is trade with Germany, [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Outside of Europe, the [[United States]] is also a major trading partner. A common characteristic in the exports of the Nordic countries is a concentration on a few products. The exports of Greenland and the Faroe Islands are entirely dominated by fish and fish products, to a lesser extent in Iceland where aluminium exports also contribute significantly. Oil and gas are the predominant products exported by Norway and Finnish exports are dominated by wood, paper and paper products and telecommunication equipment. Danish and Swedish exports are more equally distributed on different products, with processed food, pharmaceuticals and chemical products as the major Danish export products and cars, wood, paper products and telecommunication equipment as predominant in Swedish exports. Germany is completely dominant when it comes to Nordic imports. However, the Nordic countries also have considerable imports from the Netherlands, China and Russia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=114\u201315 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Energy ===\n{{see also|Energy in Denmark|Energy in Finland|Energy in Iceland|Energy in Norway|Energy in Sweden}}\n[[File:Middelgrunden wind farm 2009-07-01 edit filtered2.jpg|thumb|During the recent years, Denmark has [[Wind power in Denmark|invested heavily in windfarms]]]]\nThe Nordic region is one of the richest sources of energy in the world. Apart from the natural occurrence of fossil fuels such as oil and gas, the Nordic countries also have good infrastructure and technology to exploit renewable energy sources such as water, wind, bio-energy and geothermal heat. Especially Iceland and Sweden, but also Finland and Norway, have a significant production of electricity based on [[hydro power]]. [[Geothermal energy]] production is the most important\nsource of energy in Iceland, whilst nuclear power is produced in both Finland and in Sweden. The indigenous production of energy in the Nordic countries has risen considerably over the last couple of decades \u2013 especially in Denmark and Norway due to oil deposits in the [[North Sea]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=35 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe most important energy sources in the Nordic countries measured in terms of energy supply in million toe (tonnes oil equivalent) are in order of importance: oil, solid fuels (e.g. coal and wood), nuclear power, hydro and geothermal power and solar energy and gas. In the EU, the most important source of energy is also oil, but gas comes in second. Hydro and geothermal power and other renewable sources of energy are major sources in the Nordic countries as compared to the EU countries. Particularly in Iceland and Norway, hydro and geothermal power constitute a major share of the overall energy supply. Denmark depends almost entirely on thermal power generated from coal, oil and gas. Iceland obtains a substantial part of its energy for heating from geothermal energy and depends almost entirely upon hydro-power resources for its production of electricity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=36 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{see|Tourism in Denmark|Tourism in Finland|Tourism in Iceland|Tourism in Norway|Tourism in Sweden}}\nThe Nordic countries in order of popularity with tourists are Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland then Iceland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tourism |url=https://www.nordicstatistics.org/the-business-sector/tourism/ |website=Nordic Statistics database |language=sv-SE}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics{{anchor|Population}} ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:90%; white-space:nowrap\"\n!style=\"width:6em\"|Country\n!style=\"width:6em\"|Capital\n!style=\"width:5em\"|Population\n!style=\"width:5em\"|Area (km\u00b2)\n|-style=\"line-height:95%\"\n|[[Denmark]]\n|[[Copenhagen]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|5,748,769<ref name=Dpopulation>{{cite web|title=Population at the first day of the quarter by municipality, sex, age, marital status, ancestry, country of origin and citizenship|url=http://www.statbank.dk/FOLK1|publisher=[[Statistics Denmark]]|accessdate=13 February 2017|quote=January 2017}}</ref>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|43,561\n|-style=\"line-height:95%\"\n|[[Greenland]]\n|[[Nuuk]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|55,877<ref>[http://www.stat.gl/dialog/topmain.asp?lang=en&subject=Population&sc=BE#chart-wrapper \"Gr\u00f8nlands Statistik\"].

Today, the population has increased to 27 million people. The Nordic countries have one of the lowest population densities in the world. The low density is partly due to the fact that many parts of the Nordic countries are marginal areas, where nature puts limitations on settlement. In four out of five Nordic countries,{{which|date=July 2016}} around 20 per cent of the population is to be found in the vicinity of the respective capitals. In Iceland, this percentage is even higher, with more than 60 per cent of Icelanders residing at or nearby the capital city of [[Reykjav\u00edk]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nDuring the past 100 years, the population growth has been strongest in Greenland, where the population has multiplied by almost five, from 12,000 to 56,000 people. In Iceland, the increase has gone from 78,000 to 322,000 people. The population on the Faroe Islands has more than tripled, from 15,000 to 48,000 people. The Swedish and \u00c5landic populations are the only ones that have not at least doubled.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Since 1990, the total population in the Nordic countries has increased by more than 2.8 million people (12 per cent) \u2013 the most in Iceland (27 per cent) and in Norway and \u00c5land by 19 and close to 18 per cent. Certain regions in Finland, Norway and Sweden have experienced a decline in the population due to [[urbanization]], but at the national level all the Nordic countries have experienced growth. Compared to 2005, both the Faroe Islands and Greenland have experienced a minor decline in the population. Iceland has also experienced shorter periods with a declining population. The Danish population is expected to increase by 8 per cent until 2035, while Finland and Sweden expect an increase in the population of about 10 and almost 16 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=37\u201338 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nLife expectancy is rising in all the Nordic countries, though the levels vary greatly. Life expectancy for men in Greenland is 68.3 years (2011), compared to 80.8 years for men in Iceland. Women in the Faroe Islands and in \u00c5land are expected to live the longest \u2013 more than 84 years. The population in the Nordic countries is getting older and according to the population projection for the Nordic countries as a whole, the share of the population above the age of 80 will reach 8.4 per cent in 2040, as compared to the 2013 level of 4.7 per cent. The share of population 80 years or older has increased from 1990 to 2013. The increase in the share of people above the age of 80 over the last 10 years is partly due to the fact that the death rate has fallen for almost all age groups and partly that the number of births has been low during the same period. In the next 25 years, the demographic dependency ratio is expected to have the strongest growth in Finland and \u00c5land. According to the most recent population forecasts in Finland and \u00c5land, in 2030 it is expected that people over 65 will make up 50 per cent of the adult population. Sweden and Denmark can look forward to a relatively modest increase in the next decades.

That was also the case with Denmark, Finland, \u00c5land and Norway. In the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland, natural population increase had the greatest impact on the population change, but both Greenland and the Faroe Islands still had a slight decrease in the population due to a negative net migration in 2012.\n\nA large proportion of the migration in the Nordic countries occurs between and among the countries themselves, largely as the result of the free labour market and liberal rules for the exchange of students in the Nordic countries. The trend has led to an increasing number of foreign citizens in the Nordic countries during the past few decades. In all the countries, the major part of the foreign citizens is non-Nordic. That is not the case for Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which have a high proportion of other Nordic citizens. Non-nationals range from 47 per cent of the total immigration in Iceland, to 89 per cent in Norway. In 2013 the largest proportions of non-nationals were in Norway and Denmark, where they account for 8.9 and 8.8 per cent of the population. The proportion\nof non-nationals in the Finnish population is small compared to the other Nordic countries \u2013 3.6 per cent in 2013 \u2013 but the proportion has risen significantly during and after the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=48\u201352 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Sami people ===\n[[File:Honningsv\u00e5g 2013 06 09 2187 (10302640703).jpg|thumb|Sami man at [[Honningsv\u00e5g]], Norway, wearing the traditional [[G\u00e1kti]]]]\nThe [[Sami people]], also spelled S\u00e1mi or Saami, are a Finno-Ugric people who have their traditional settlement areas in northern Finland, Norway and Sweden and Western Russia.

Because the countries do not make an official record of who has the Sami identity or background,{{clarify|reason=There are official records for the S\u00e1mi parliament elections, but the criteria for being included are disputed.|date=May 2015}} no one knows the exact number of the Sami people. The Sami are the only indigenous people of the Nordic countries excluding Greenland that are recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples. They are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. There are several Sami languages.\n\nTraditionally, the Sami have plied a variety of livelihoods, including coastal fishing, fur trapping and sheep herding. However, the best known Sami livelihood is semi-nomadic reindeer herding. For traditional, environmental, cultural and political reasons, reindeer herding is legally reserved only for Sami people in certain regions of the Nordic countries. Nowadays, the Sami work in all sectors, in line with the non-Sami population, though the primary industries are still important culture bearers for the Sami people.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Share of total population in the Nordic countries in 2013.JPG|Share of total population of the Nordic countries by country in January 2013\nFile:Life expectancy at birth in the Nordic countries in 2012.JPG|[[Life expectancy]] at birth in the Nordic countries in 2012\nFile:Marriages and divorces in the Nordic countries in 2012.JPG|Marriages and divorces in the Nordic countries in 2012\nFile:Immigrants in the Nordic countries in 2012.JPG|Immigrants in the Nordic countries in 2012\n</gallery>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|Faroese folk dancers in national costumes]]\nNordic countries have historically been one of the most socially progressive cultures in the world and culture is one of the main components of co-operation between the Nordic countries. The policies of the Nordic countries with respect to cultural life, mass media and religion have many shared values and features in common. However, some differences may be pointed out and for instance cultural institutions arising from historical circumstances. In both Denmark and Sweden, there are cultural institutions with roots in the traditions of the royal courts. In these countries, national institutions formed the foundation of cultural life at an early stage while in Norway cultural institutions began to form later.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook  |publisher=Nordic Council |page=94 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nIceland has the highest government expenditure on culture, a total of 3.3 per cent of its GDP in 2011. Denmark comes second with a total of 1.6 per cent of GDP in 2011. Sweden spend the least in 2011 with 1.1 per cent. Looking at per capita expenditure, Iceland again has the highest expenditure with Norway coming second. Greenland spends the third highest amount on culture and leisure per capita.

Many theatres in the Nordic countries receive public funding. Theatre funding constitutes a major share of allocations within the cultural area in all the countries. All countries have national theatres, where plays, ballets and operas are performed. In addition to the national theatres, there are professional regional theatres, which are also supported by the state, counties or municipalities.

The Fund's ambition is to enable talented artists, both professionals and amateurs, to enrich each other via the cultural diversity that exists among the 26 million or more people of the Region. Its activities are based on an agreement between the Nordic countries, which came into force in 1967.

In [[folk music]], Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the Faroe Islands share many common aspects. Greenland's [[Inuit culture]] has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture. Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the other Nordic countries as well as [[Estonia]]. The Sami have their own unique culture, with ties to the neighboring cultures.\n\nArt music has a strong position in Nordic countries. Apart from state-owned opera houses, there are symphony orchestras in most major cities. The most prominent historical composers from Nordic countries are the Finn [[Jean Sibelius]], the Dane [[Carl Nielsen]] and the Norwegian [[Edvard Grieg]]. Of contemporary composers, the Finns [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Kaija Saariaho]] and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] are among the most often performed in the world.\n\nRock and roll influences that came from the United States and United Kingdom were the start of the Nordic pop scene, but influences from the Nordic folk music can still be found today in popular music. Common characteristic in Nordic pop music is that it can often be either very lighthearted pop music or very dark metal. Some of the most well-known Nordic music groups include [[ABBA]], [[Ace of Base]], [[a-ha]], [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[The Cardigans]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Hanoi Rocks]], [[Roxette]], [[The Rasmus]], [[Kaizers Orchestra]] and [[The Spotnicks]]. Sweden and Finland have possibly the largest music industries in the area, especially Sweden which is the largest exporter of pop music per capita and the third largest overall after the United States and the United Kingdom.

Many big names such as [[Amon Amarth]], [[Children of Bodom]], [[In Flames]], [[Meshuggah]] and [[Opeth]] originate from the Nordic countries. Nordic metal bands have had a long and lasting influence on the metal subculture alongside their counterparts in the United Kingdom and the United States. The [[black metal]] genre was developed in Norway by bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and the related genre of [[Viking metal]] was developed throughout the Nordic region by bands such as [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], Burzum, Emperor, [[Einherjer]], [[Moonsorrow]] and Amon Amarth.\n\nSince 2000, the total sale of music has declined by almost 50 per cent in all the Nordic countries and at the same time the digital sale has increased (digital sales cover both downloads and streaming of music). In Denmark, Norway and Finland, the sale of digital music has increased by 400 per cent since 2006 and now amounts to 39, 27 and 25 per cent of the total sale in 2010/2011. In Denmark and Sweden, sales of digital music rose almost eight-fold in the same period and now represent 51 per cent of the total sale. In Iceland, digital sale still only represents 3 per cent of the total sale.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=97 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{see also|Nordic literature}}\n[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] is considered to be the first existentialist philosopher]]\n[[File:Astrid Lindgren and Tove Jansson in 1958.jpg|thumb|Swedish author [[Astrid Lindgren]] together with Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]] in Stockholm in 1958]]\nThe earliest written records from Scandinavia are [[runic inscriptions]] on memorial stones and other objects. Some of those contain allusions to [[Norse mythology]] and even short poems in [[alliterative verse]]. The best known example is the elaborate [[R\u00f6k runestone]] (circa 800) which alludes to legends from the migration age. The oldest of the [[Eddic poems]] are believed to have been composed in the 9th century, though they are only preserved in 13th-century manuscripts. They tell of the myths and heroic legends of Scandinavia. [[Skaldic poetry]] is mostly preserved in late manuscripts but was preserved orally from the 9th century onwards and also appears on runestones, such as the [[Karlevi Runestone]]. In Iceland the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] are the best-known specimens of [[Icelandic literature]]. In Finland the most famous collection of folk poetry is by far the [[Kalevala]], which is the [[national epic]] of the country.\n\nNordic countries have produced important and influential literature. [[Henrik Ibsen]], a Norwegian playwright, was largely responsible for the popularity of modern realistic drama in Europe, with plays like ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' and ''[[A Doll's House]]''. His contemporary, Swedish novelist and playwright [[August Strindberg]], was a forerunner of experimental forms such as [[expressionism]], [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and [[surrealism]].

The Nordic countries have a long history of political unions and other close relations, but do not form a singular entity today. The [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist movement]] sought to unite Denmark, Norway and Sweden into one country in the 19th century. With the independence of Finland in the early 20th century, and Iceland in the mid 20th century, this movement expanded into the modern organised Nordic cooperation which includes the [[Nordic Council]] and the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]]. The [[Helsinki Treaty]] is the political agreement that sets the framework for Nordic cooperation in the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Especially in [[English language|English]], [[Scandinavia]] is sometimes used as a synonym for the Nordic countries, but that term more properly refers to the three monarchies of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

These three dominant languages are taught in schools throughout the Nordic region. For example, [[Mandatory Swedish|Swedish is a mandatory subject]] in [[Education in Finland|Finnish schools]] since Finland by law is a bilingual country.

However, one important collection that exists is a widespread and rich collection of stone drawings known as [[petroglyphs]]. The [[Goths]], who originated in southern [[Scandinavia]] and would later divide into [[Visigoths]] and [[Ostrogoths]], are known to have been one of the [[Germanic people]] that would later relate to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and the emergence of [[Medieval Europe]]. However, these acquired the [[Western Roman Empire|Latin culture of Rome]].<ref name=\"EBOgoth\">{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Goth|title= Goth |website= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |date= 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Nordic countries first came into more permanent contact with the rest of Europe during the [[Viking age]]. Southern Finland and northern parts of Sweden and Norway were areas where the Vikings mostly only traded and had raids, whilst the permanent settlements of Vikings in the Nordic region were in southern Norway and Sweden, Denmark and Faroes as well as parts of Iceland, Greenland and [[Oeselians|Estonia]]. Christian Europe responded to the raids and conquest of Vikings with intensive missionary work. The missionaries wanted the new territories to be ruled by Christian kings who would help to strengthen the church. After conversion to Christianity in the 11th century, three northern kingdoms emerged in the region: Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Iceland first became a [[Icelandic Commonwealth|commonwealth]] before it came under Norwegian rule in the early 13th century. There were several secular powers who aimed to bring Finland under their rule, but through the [[Second Swedish Crusade|Second]] and [[Third Swedish Crusade]] in the latter part of 13th and through [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|the colonisation]] of some coastal areas of Finland with Christian Swedes, the Swedish rule was gradually established in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hel.fi/hel2/kaumuseo/rakennusinventoinnit/raportit/kyl_paikkainventointi.pdf|title=Helsingin keskiaikaiset ja uuden ajan alun kyl\u00e4npaikat 2011, Inventointiraportti 2011.

The monarchies strengthened their positions in the 12th and 13th centuries through imposing taxes on peasants and a class of nobles also emerged. By the Late Middle Ages, the whole of the Nordic Region was politically united in the loose [[Kalmar Union]]. Diverging interests and especially Sweden's dissatisfaction over the Danish dominance gave rise to a conflict that hampered the union from the 1430s onward until its final dissolution in 1523. After the dissolution Denmark and Norway, including Iceland, formed a personal union of the two kingdoms called [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] whilst the successful period of [[History of Sweden (1523\u20131611)|Vasa Kings]] began in Sweden and Finland. The [[Lutheran Reformation]] played a major role in the establishment of the early-modern states in Denmark\u2013Norway and Sweden.\n\n=== Early modern period and industrialization ===\nSweden was very successful during the Thirty Years' War, while Denmark was a failure. Sweden saw an opportunity of a change of power in the region. Denmark\u2013Norway had a threatening territory surrounding Sweden and the Sound Dues were a continuing irritation for the Swedes. In 1643, the Swedish Privy Council determined Swedish territorial gain in an eventual war against Denmark\u2013Norway to have good chances. Not long after this, Sweden invaded Denmark\u2013Norway.\n\nDenmark was poorly prepared for the war and Norway was reluctant to attack Sweden, which left the Swedes in a good position.\n\nThe war ended as foreseen with Swedish victory and with the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]] in 1645 Denmark\u2013Norway had to cede some of their territories, including Norwegian territories [[J\u00e4mtland|Jemtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen|Herjedalen]] and [[\u00c4lvdalen Municipality|Idre and Serna]], as well as the Danish [[Baltic Sea]] islands of [[Gotland]] and [[Saaremaa|\u00d6sel]]. The Thirty Years' War thus began the [[Swedish Empire|rise of Sweden as a great power]], while it marked the start of decline for the Danish.\n\nTo some extent in the 16th century and certainly in the 17th, the Nordic region played a major role in European politics at the highest level. The struggle for dominion over the [[Baltic Sea]] and its trading opportunities raged between Denmark\u2013Norway and Sweden, which began to impact upon the neighboring nations. Sweden prevailed in the long term and became a major European power as it extended its reach into coastal tracts in modern-day Russia, Estonia, Latvia and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] also [[Pomerania]] and other North German areas. Sweden also conquered vast areas from Denmark\u2013Norway during the [[Northern Wars]] in the middle of the 17th century. Sweden also had several conflicts with Russia over Finland and other eastern areas of the country and after the [[Great Northern War]] (1700\u20131721) Sweden lost most of its territories outside the old Swedish border to Russia which then became the new major power in Northern Europe.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815), the political map of the Nordic countries altered again. In 1809, Finland was conquered by [[Russian Empire]] from Sweden in the [[Finnish War]], after which Finland became the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. In turn, Sweden captured Norway from Denmark in 1814 in the [[Swedish\u2013Norwegian War (1814)|Swedish\u2013Norwegian War]] and started a [[Union between Sweden and Norway]]. Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, which had been re-colonised in the 18th century, remained Danish. Population growth and industrialization brought change to the Nordic countries during the 19th century and new social classes steered political systems towards democracy. International politics and [[nationalism]] also created the preconditions for the later independence of [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|Norway in 1905]], [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland in 1917]] and [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|Iceland in 1944]].\n\n=== Late modern period and contemporary era ===\n[[File:The Prime Ministers of the Nordic Countries in October 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Nordic prime ministers at the [[Nordic Council]] meeting in 2014 in [[Stockholm]]]]\n\nDuring the two world wars and the Cold War, the five small Nordic states were forced into difficult balancing acts, but retained their independence and developed peaceful democracies. The Nordic states had been neutral during [[World War I]], but during [[World War II]] they could no longer stand apart from world politics. The [[Soviet Union]] attacked Finland in 1939 and Finland ceded territory following the [[Winter War]]. In 1941, Finland launched a [[Continuation War|retaliatory strike]] in conjunction with the German attack on the Soviet Union. However, more territory was lost and for many years to come Finnish foreign policy was based on [[Finlandization|appeasing the Soviet Union]], even though Finland was able to retain its democratic form of government. [[Denmark in World War II|Denmark]] and [[Norway in World War II|Norway]] were occupied by Germany in 1940. The Allies responded by occupying Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. [[Sweden in World War II|Sweden]] managed to formally maintain its neutrality in the Axis/Allies conflict and avoided direct hostilities, but in practice it adapted to the wishes of the dominant power \u2013 first Germany, later the Allies. However, during the Winter War between Finland and Russia in 1939\u20131940, Sweden did support Finland and declared itself \"non combatant\" rather than neutral.\n\nCompared with large parts of Europe, the Nordic region got off lightly during the World War II, which partially explains its strong post-war economic development. The [[labour movement]] \u2013 both trade unions and political parties \u2013 was an important political presence throughout the Nordic countries in the 20th century. The big social democratic parties became dominant and after World War II the Nordic countries began to serve as a [[Nordic model|model]] for the welfare state. Economically, the five Nordic countries were strongly dependent on foreign trade and so they positioned themselves alongside the big trading blocks. Denmark was the first to join [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1972 and after it became [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993 Finland and Sweden also joined in 1995. Norway and Iceland have remained part of [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA).\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|Geography of \u00c5land|Geography of Denmark|Geography of the Faroe Islands|Geography of Finland|Geography of Greenland|Geography of Iceland|Geography of Norway|Geography of Sweden}}\n\n[[File:Norden satellite.jpg|thumb|Satellite map of the Nordic countries]]\n[[File:Resundsbron 2009-09-17, Johannes Jansson.jpg|thumb|The [[\u00d6resund Bridge]] between [[Malm\u00f6]] in Sweden and [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark]]\n\nThe Nordic countries in alphabetic order\u2014number of inhabitants (2018), area (km<sup>2</sup>) and population density (people/km<sup>2</sup>):\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!Country!!Inhabitants!!Area!!Pop.

The area is so vast that it covers five [[time zone|time zones]]. To the east the region borders [[Russia]], and on the west the [[Canada|Canadian]] coastline can be seen from Greenland on a clear day. Even excluding Greenland and the Norwegian islands of [[Svalbard]] and [[Jan Mayen]], the remaining part of the Nordic countries covers around 1.3 million square kilometres. This is about the same area as France, Germany and Italy together. To the south, the countries neighbor the [[Baltic states]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], while to the north there is the [[Arctic Ocean]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook  |publisher=Nordic Council |page=24 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nNotable natural features of the Nordic countries include the [[Norwegian fjords]], the [[Archipelago Sea]] between Finland and Sweden, the [[Geology of Iceland|extensive volcanic and geothermal activity of Iceland]], and Greenland, which is the largest island in the world. The southernmost point of the Nordic countries is [[Gedser]], on the island of [[Falster]] in Denmark. The northernmost point is [[Kaffeklubben Island]] in Greenland, which is also the northernmost point of land on Earth. The largest cities and capitals of the Nordic countries are situated on the southern parts of the region, with the exception of [[Reykjav\u00edk]], the capital of Iceland. [[Helsinki]], [[Oslo]] and [[Stockholm]] are all close to the same latitude as the southernmost point of Greenland, [[Egger Island]] (''Itilleq''): about 60[[latitude|\u00b0N]].\n\n=== Topography ===\n{{see also|Muddus plains|Sub-Cambrian peneplain}}\nAll of Denmark and most of Finland lie below 200 m, the topography of both is countries being relatively flat. In Denmark, [[moraine]]s and [[tunnel valley]]s add some relief to the landscape while in Finland the surroundings of lakes [[Pielinen]] and [[Lake P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne|P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne]] display some moderate relief. The Finnish area just east of [[Bothnian Bay]] stand out as the largest plain in the Nordic countries.<ref name=Rudberg/> The [[Scandinavian Mountains]] dominate the landscape of Norway. The southern part of the Scandinavian Mountains is broader than the northern one and contain higher peaks. The southern part contains also a series of [[Paleic surface|plateaux and gently undulating plains]]. The western parts of mountains are cut by fjords producing a dramatic landscape. The landscape of Sweden can be described as a mixture of that of Norway, Finland and Denmark. Except at the [[High Coast]] the coastal areas of Sweden form lowlands. Sweden has three highland areas, the [[South Swedish highlands|South Swedish Highlands]], the Scandinavian Mountains and the [[Norrland terrain]] which is the eastern continuation of the Scandinavian Mountains.<ref name=Rudberg/> The South Swedish Highland and the Norrland terrain are separated by the [[Central Swedish lowland]]. The topography of Iceland stands out among the Nordic countries for being a bowl-formed highland.<ref name=Rudberg>{{cite book |last=Rudberg |first=Sten |author-link=Sten Rudberg |year=1960 |title=Geography of Norden |chapter=Geology and Morphology |chapter-url= |location= |publisher= |pages=27\u201340|editor-last=Somme|editor-first=Axel|editor-link=Axel S\u00f8mme |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{main|Climate of the Nordic countries}}\n[[File:Average temperatures in the capitals of the Nordic countries in 2012.jpg|thumb|Average temperatures in the capitals of the Nordic countries in 2012]]\nDespite their northern location, the Nordic countries generally have a mild climate compared with other countries that share globally the same latitudes. The climate in the Nordic countries is mainly influenced by their northern location, but remedied by the vicinity to the ocean and the [[Gulf Stream]] which brings warm ocean currents from the tip of Florida. Even far to the north, the winters can be quite mild, though north of the Polar Circle the climate zone is Arctic with harsh winters and short summers. The sea has a heavy influence on the weather in the western coastal zones of Iceland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden. The precipitation is high and snow cover during winters is rare. Summers are generally cool.\n\nThe further away that one gets from the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream the colder it gets during the winters. Finland, most of Sweden and the south-eastern part of Norway are influenced by the vast continent to the east which results in warm and long summers and clear and cold winters, often with snow. For example, [[Bergen]] at the west coast of Norway normally has a temperature above zero in February while [[Helsinki]] in Finland normally will have a temperature of 7\u20138&nbsp;\u00b0C below zero during the same month.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=23\u201326 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nClimatic conditions and quality of land have determined how land is used in the Nordic countries. In densely populated mainland Denmark there is hardly any wild nature left. Most of the scarce forests are plantations and nearly 60 per cent of Denmark's total area is [[Cultivated land|cultivated]] or zoned as gardens or parks. On the other hand, in the other Nordic countries there is much wild nature left. Only between 0 and 9 per cent of the land in the other Nordic countries is cultivated. Around 17 per cent of the land area in Iceland is used for permanent meadows and pastures and both Finland, Norway as well as Sweden have large forest areas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=25 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n{{See also|Politics of \u00c5land|Politics of Denmark|Politics of Greenland|Politics of the Faroe Islands|Politics of Finland|Politics of Iceland|Politics of Norway|Politics of Sweden}}\n\n=== Nordic Council and Nordic Council of Ministers ===\n{{Main|Nordic Council}}\n\n[[File:Sessionssalen vid Nordiska Radets session i Oslo 2007.jpg|thumb|Nordic Council in session at the Parliament of Norway in 2007]]\n\nNordic co-operation is based on the \u201c[[Helsinki Treaty]]\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/information/formal-nordic-co-operation|title=Formal Nordic co-operation {{!}} Nordic cooperation|website=www.norden.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> Politically, Nordic countries do not form a separate entity, but they co-operate in the [[Nordic Council]] and the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]]. The council was established after World War II and its first concrete result was the introduction of a [[Nordic Passport Union]] in 1952. This resulted in a common [[labour economics|labour market]] and free movement across borders without passports for the countries' citizens. In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an intergovernmental forum, was established to complement the Council. The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in Copenhagen and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at Ved Stranden No. 18, close to Slotsholmen.\n\nThe Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called \"theme session\" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands and \u00c5land{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council|title=The Nordic Council \u2013 Nordic cooperation|publisher=}}</ref> The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its country's legislative assembly. With Denmark, Iceland and Norway being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[neutral country|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation. However, the Nordic foreign and security policy cooperation has become closer and over the past few years expanded its scope.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet/tiedote/fi.jsp?oid=408655 |title=Nordic Countries strengthen their cooperation in foreign and security policy |website=valtioneuvosto.fi |publisher=Finnish Government |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://formin.finland.fi/public/download.aspx?ID=126747&GUID={A6A5DF01-72E4-45BD-8B29-488EE055ACC1} |title=Joint statement by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden on Nordic foreign and security policy cooperation \u2013 building security in a comprehensive manner |publisher=Nordic council |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Nordic Council of Ministers is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility, but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers|title=About the Nordic Council of Ministers \u2013 Nordic cooperation|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930222646/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers|archive-date=30 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Nordic model ===\n{{Main|Nordic model}}\n\nThe Nordic countries share an economic and social model, which involves the combination of a market economy with a welfare state financed with heavy taxes. The welfare states were largely developed by strong [[Social democracy|social democrat]] parties and in Finland with cooperation with the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]]. Although the specifics differ between countries and there are ongoing political arguments, there is a strong consensus about keeping to the general concept.\n\nA central theme in the Nordic model is the \"universalist\" welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy, promoting social mobility and ensuring the universal provision of basic human rights, as well as for stabilizing the economy. In this model welfare is not just aid to those who are in need of it, but a central part of the life of everybody: education is free, healthcare has zero or nominal fees in most cases, most children go to municipal day care, ''et cetera''.\n\nThe Nordic model is distinguished from other types of welfare states by its emphasis on maximizing labour force participation, promoting gender equality, egalitarian and extensive benefit levels, the large magnitude of income redistribution and liberal use of expansionary fiscal policy. Trade unions are strong.\n\nThe model has been successful: the countries are among the wealthiest worldwide and there is little social unrest. In 2015, [[Save the Children]] ranked<ref>[[Save the Children]]: State of the World's Mothers 2015. {{ISBN|1-888393-30-0}}</ref> the Nordic countries as number 1\u20135 of countries where mothers and children fare the best (among 179 countries studied).\n\n=== Elections ===\n{{See also|Elections in Denmark|Elections in Greenland|Elections in the Faroe Islands|Elections in Finland|Elections in \u00c5land|Elections in Iceland|Elections in Norway|Elections in Sweden}}\n\n[[File:Vigdis Finnbogadottir (1985).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir]] served as the fourth President of Iceland from 1980 to 1996 and was the world's first [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state|democratically elected female head of state]]]]\n\nNordic parliaments are all based on a [[unicameralism|one-chamber system]]. The Norwegian parliament, the [[Storting]], did actually function as two separate chambers until 2009 when dealing with certain issues. The Icelandic [[Althing]], founded in 930 AD, is reputed to be the oldest working parliament in the world. In Denmark, Iceland and Sweden elections are held at least once every four years. Finland, \u00c5land and Norway have fixed four-year election periods. Elections in the Faroe Islands and Greenland follow the Danish system of elections. The Danish [[Folketing]] has 179 seats, including two seats each for the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The Finnish [[Eduskunta]] has 200 seats, including one seat for \u00c5land. The Icelandic Althing has 63 seats, the Norwegian Storting 169 seats and the Swedish [[Riksdag]] 349 seats. The Faroese [[L\u00f8gting]] has 32 seats, Greenland's [[Parliament of Greenland|Inatsisartut]] 31 seats and \u00c5land's [[Parliament of \u00c5land|Lagtinget]] 30 seats.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=91 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nNordic citizens \u2013 and in the three member countries of the EU also EU citizens \u2013 living in another Nordic country are normally entitled to vote in local government elections after three months of residence, while other foreign citizens have to reside in the Nordic countries for three to four years before they are eligible to vote. In Denmark and the Faroe Islands,  the percentage turn-out at elections is close to 90% per cent, but it is only about 67% in \u00c5land and Finland. Men are more often elected to the national assembly compared to women. The biggest bias between the two sexes is seen in the Faroe Islands and \u00c5land, while in Sweden men and women are close to being equally represented in the national assembly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=92 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Nordic Passport Union ===\n{{Main|Nordic Passport Union}}\n\nThe Nordic Passport Union, created in 1954 and implemented on 1 May 1958, allows [[citizenship|citizens]] of the Nordic countries: Denmark (Faroe Islands included since 1 January 1966, Greenland not included), Sweden, Norway ([[Svalbard]], [[Bouvet Island]] and [[Queen Maud Land]] not included), Finland and Iceland (since 24 September 1965) to cross approved border districts without carrying and having their [[passport]] checked. Other citizens can also travel between the Nordic countries' borders without having their passport checked, but still have to carry some sort of approved travel identification documents. As of November 2015, there are temporary border controls set up between Denmark and Sweden. These border controls were set up to tackle the issue with immigrants coming to Sweden in relation to the ongoing [[European migrant crisis]]\n\nSince 1996, these countries have been part of the larger EU directive [[Schengen Agreement]] area, comprising 30 countries in Europe. [[Border checkpoint|Border checkpoints]] have been removed within the [[Schengen Area]] and only a national [[identity document|ID card]] is required. Within the Nordic area any means of proving one's identity, e.g. a [[driving license|driving licence]], is valid for Nordic citizens because of the Nordic Passport Union. When traveling to other countries than the Nordics, public officials in the foreign services of any of the Nordic countries are to assist citizens of another Nordic country if that country is not represented in the territory concerned, according to the Helsinki treaty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/meld.-st.-12-20102011/id637527/sec3|title=Meld.

There are some areas in the Nordic Passport Union that give extra rights for Nordic citizens, not covered by Schengen, such as less paperwork if moving to a different Nordic country and fewer requirements for [[naturalization|naturalisation]].\n\n=== Political dimension and divisions ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|-\n!Organisation\n!Denmark\n!Finland\n!Iceland\n!Norway\n!Sweden\n|-\n|[[Council of Europe|CoE]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|-\n|[[Nordic Council]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|-\n|[[European Economic Area|EEA]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|-\n|[[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]]\n|{{No}}\n|{{No}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{No}}\n|-\n|[[European Union|EU]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{No}}\n|{{No}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|-\n|[[Eurozone]]\n|{{No}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{No}}\n|{{No}}\n|{{No}}\n|-\n|[[Schengen Area]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|-\n|[[NATO]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{No}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{No}}\n|-\n|[[OECD]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|-\n|[[United Nations|UN]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|-\n|[[World Trade Organization|WTO]]\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|}\n\nThe Nordic region has a political dimension in the joint official bodies called the [[Nordic Council]] and the Nordic Council of Ministers. The [[Helsinki Treaty]] is the political agreement which sets the framework for Nordic cooperation. In this context, several aspects of the [[single market|common market]] as in the EU have been implemented decades before the EU implemented them. Intra-Nordic trade is not covered by the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|CISG]], but by local law. The Nordic countries have cooperated closely in the administrative and consular fields since the Nordic Passport Union was established and the Helsinki Treaty concluded. According to the Helsinki treaty, public officials in the [[List of diplomatic missions of the Nordic countries|foreign services of any of the Nordic countries]] are to assist citizens of another Nordic country if that country is not represented in the territory concerned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/meld.-st.-12-20102011/id637527/sec3|title=Meld. St. 12 (2010\u20132011)|date=April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the EU, the [[Northern Dimension]] refers to external and cross-border policies covering the Nordic countries, the Baltic countries and [[Russia]].\n\nThe political cooperation between the Nordic Countries has not led to a common policy or an agreement on the countries' memberships in the EU, [[Eurozone]] and [[NATO]]. Norway and Iceland are the only Nordic countries not members of the EU, while Finland and Sweden are the only Nordic countries not members of NATO. Denmark alone participates in both organizations. Only Finland is a member of the Eurozone. The tasks and policies of the EU overlap with the Nordic council significantly, e.g. the [[Schengen Agreement]] partially supersedes the Nordic [[passport-free zone]] and a common labor market.\n\nAdditionally, certain areas of Nordic countries have special relationships with the EU. For example, Finland's autonomous island province [[\u00c5land]] is [[Special member state territories and their relations with the EU#\u00c5land Islands|not a part of the EU VAT zone]].\n\n=== Current leaders ===\nAll the Nordic countries are long-established parliamentary democracies. Denmark, Norway and Sweden have a political system of [[constitutional monarchy]], in which a nonpolitical monarch acts as [[head of state]] and the ''[[de facto]]'' [[executive power]] is exercised by a [[Cabinet government|cabinet]] led by a prime minister. [[Margrethe II]] has reigned in Denmark as Queen Regnant and head of state since 14 January 1972, [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] became King of Sweden on 15 September 1973 and [[King Harald V]] of Norway has reigned since 17 January 1991.\n\nFinland and Iceland have been [[parliamentary republic|parliamentary republics]] since their independence. Both countries are led by prime ministers, whilst the directly elected president acts mostly as a ceremonial head of state with some legislative power. Finland had a long tradition of having a strong presidential system, since in the beginning of its independence [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]] was elected to the throne of Finland and Finland was to become a monarchy. This failed due to World War I and the fall of the [[German Empire]] and so it was a compromise that Finland became a republic with a strong head of state. The President's powers were once so broad that it was said Finland was the only real monarchy in northern Europe. However, amendments passed in 1999 reduced his powers somewhat and the President now shares executive authority with the Prime Minister.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |isbn=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Heads of state\">\nFile:Drottning Margrethe av Danmark.jpg|Denmark<br />[[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]<br />[[Monarchy of Denmark|Queen of Denmark]]<br />since 1972\nFile:Sauli Niinist\u00f6 Senate of Poland 2015.JPG|Finland<br />[[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]]<br />[[President of Finland]]<br />since [[2012 Finnish presidential election|2012 election]]\nFile:Gu\u00f0ni Th.

Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have for example experienced constant and large excess exports in recent years. Iceland is the only country which has balance of payments deficits as of 2011. At the same time, unemployment is low in most of the Nordic countries compared with the rest of Europe. As a result of the cyclical down-turn, the public balance is now in deficit, except for Norway. Over the past ten years, the Nordic countries had a noticeably larger increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) than the Eurozone. The only exceptions were Denmark and \u00c5land which had a lower growth. Measured by GDP per capita, the Nordic countries have a higher income than the Eurozone countries. Norway's GDP per capita is as high as 80 per cent above the EA17 average and Norway is actually one of the countries with the highest standard of living in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=99 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] and the following recession all the Nordic countries have been affected by the global crisis though to varying degrees. Iceland was most affected and had an [[2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis|economic crisis from 2008 to 2011]], but GDP growth was also negative in all the other Nordic countries in 2008 and 2009. From 2009 most of the Nordic countries experienced growth again. The Nordic Council has set an objective for Nordic co-operation to achieve stable and sustainable economic growth, development of the [[Nordic model|Nordic welfare model]], economic integration in the Nordic region and the promotion of joint Nordic interests at international level.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook  |publisher=Nordic Council |page=100 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n[[Private consumption]] has fallen during the crisis, but it gained pace again from 2010 onward. The decline was most profound in Denmark, Finland and Iceland. On the other hand, public consumption has experienced positive growth rates \u2013 except for Iceland since 2008 and Denmark since 2010. The general rise is due to the many fiscal initiatives made by the Nordic governments to support economic growth and the financial and business sectors. From 2006 Iceland has experienced a fall in gross capital formation. This is after many years with an Icelandic growth particularly driven by investments, which had more than tripled in the recent ten years. Iceland also holds a leading position compared to the other Nordic countries regarding growth in public consumption in the years from 2000 to 2008.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=101 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nRecent years\u2019 large [[balance-of-payments]] surplus in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden has reduced the countries\u2019 [[foreign debt]]. In addition to a balance-of-payments surplus or deficit, the size of a country's foreign debt and foreign assets is affected by the exchange rate and the price of securities. Consequently, Finland's foreign debt increased noticeably when the price of technology shares increased drastically in the late 1990s due to a large proportion of these shares being owned by households, funds and companies abroad. In this way, these foreign owners held a greater claim on Finland. When share prices decreased drastically in 1999\u20132001 in the [[dot-com bubble]], it also led to a marked decrease in Finland's net foreign debt. Iceland's foreign net debt accounts for close to five times of its GDP. This means that Iceland owes the surrounding world values corresponding to five times the country's total production. Sweden also had foreign debts by the end of 2010, but at a much smaller scale. In 2012, all Nordic countries had a surplus on the total balance of payments. Norway accounts for a substantial foreign exchange surplus, which is due to revenue from exports of oil and gas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=103\u201304 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Industries ===\n[[File:Statfjord A.JPG|thumb|[[Statfjord oil field|Statfjord]] [[oil platform]] in Norway is owned and operated by [[Equinor]], which is the [[List of largest Nordic companies|largest company in the Nordic countries]]]]\nSince the late 1990s, the Nordic [[manufacturing industry]] has accounted for a slightly declining proportion of the gross domestic product, with Norway being a distinct exception. In Norway, the manufacturing industry's proportion of GDP is still at a high level of around 35 per cent due to the large oil and natural gas sector. In the rest of the Nordic countries, the proportion lies between 15 and 20 per cent. Despite growing production, the manufacturing industry accounts for a decreasing proportion of total employment in the Nordic countries. Among the Nordic countries, Finland is today the number one Nordic industrial country, as the manufacturing industry in Finland accounts for the greatest proportion of the country's jobs, around 16 per cent. By way of comparison, in Denmark, Norway and Iceland it only accounts for less than 13 per cent of total employment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=106 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe service sector has increased drastically in all Nordic countries in the last 15 years and today accounts for about three fourths of all employed persons. Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Sweden and \u00c5land have the largest proportion of employed in the service sector, between 75 and more than 90 per cent of those employed, while the corresponding figure is 72 per cent in Finland and 70 per cent in Iceland. The service sector is a little smaller if its proportion of total gross domestic product is measured compared to the share of employment. In Norway, the service sector accounts for 57 per cent of GDP, in Iceland for 66 per cent, in Finland for 69 per cent, in Sweden for 72 per cent and in Denmark for 78 per cent. The service sector includes retail and wholesale trade, hotels, restaurants, transportation, communication, financial services, real estate sale, renting, business services and other services such as teaching and care of children, sick persons and the elderly \u2013 services which are typically rendered by the public sector in the Nordic countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=107 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Foreign investments ===\nIceland and Sweden have the highest rate of foreign direct investment, both with regards to foreign companies investing in Iceland and Sweden and Icelandic and Swedish companies investing abroad. However, in 2011 Denmark superseded Sweden regarding outward investments. Looking at a larger time span of ten years, most of the Nordic countries have experienced growth in both inward and outward investments.\n\nHowever, Iceland has been in a league of its own in this area. Foreign investment from Iceland increased significantly and sharply especially from 2003 to 2007 from 16 to 123 per cent of GDP. The expansion of Icelandic companies into foreign markets was a rapid process. Strong pension funds provided capital for investments, and the privatization of the banking system made new sources of financing available for companies wishing to expand their operations. Also inward investment to Iceland increased sharply from 2003, but at a more moderate level compared with other Nordic countries. This pattern changed in 2007 with dramatic decreases in both outward and inward foreign direct investment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=105 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Foreign and intra-Nordic trade ===\n[[File:BERGEN VIKING.JPG|thumb|The [[Port of Gothenburg]] is the largest port in the Nordic countries]]\nNordic co-operation is characterized largely by the international community and the global challenges and opportunities. The Nordic countries, which are relatively small, have historically and still are benefiting greatly by obtaining common use in cooperation with other countries and institutions. The Nordic economies are small and open and thus the countries are [[export|export-depending]]. Foreign trade constitutes an important part of the economic activity. Nordic foreign trade in goods, measured as the average of imports and exports, amounts to more than one fourth of GDP in the Nordic countries. All the Nordic countries except Finland had a surplus in their balance of trade in 2012 and every year since 1995 Denmark, Norway and Sweden have all had greater exports than imports.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=108 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe trade between the Nordic countries is especially considerable as about one fifth of the countries\u2019 foreign trade is trade with other Nordic countries. The total population of the Nordic countries of around 26 million people makes them to a far greater extent dependent on each other with respect to exports and imports, compared to for example [[Germany]] with a population of 82 million people. Swedish exports to the other Nordic countries account for a considerably higher share than combined Swedish exports to Germany and [[France]] \u2013 despite the fact that the total population of Germany and France is 147 million people, while Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway only have a total population of 16 million. In 2012, around 23 per cent of the total exports from both Denmark and Sweden went to other Nordic countries. Other Nordic countries account for 16 per cent of Finnish exports, 13 per cent of Norwegian exports and 10 per cent of the total exports in Iceland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=111 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the other Nordic countries, The EU is the largest trading partner for the Nordic countries. Especially important is trade with Germany, [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Outside of Europe, the [[United States]] is also a major trading partner. A common characteristic in the exports of the Nordic countries is a concentration on a few products. The exports of Greenland and the Faroe Islands are entirely dominated by fish and fish products, to a lesser extent in Iceland where aluminium exports also contribute significantly. Oil and gas are the predominant products exported by Norway and Finnish exports are dominated by wood, paper and paper products and telecommunication equipment. Danish and Swedish exports are more equally distributed on different products, with processed food, pharmaceuticals and chemical products as the major Danish export products and cars, wood, paper products and telecommunication equipment as predominant in Swedish exports. Germany is completely dominant when it comes to Nordic imports. However, the Nordic countries also have considerable imports from the Netherlands, China and Russia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=114\u201315 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Energy ===\n{{see also|Energy in Denmark|Energy in Finland|Energy in Iceland|Energy in Norway|Energy in Sweden}}\n[[File:Middelgrunden wind farm 2009-07-01 edit filtered2.jpg|thumb|During the recent years, Denmark has [[Wind power in Denmark|invested heavily in windfarms]]]]\nThe Nordic region is one of the richest sources of energy in the world. Apart from the natural occurrence of fossil fuels such as oil and gas, the Nordic countries also have good infrastructure and technology to exploit renewable energy sources such as water, wind, bio-energy and geothermal heat. Especially Iceland and Sweden, but also Finland and Norway, have a significant production of electricity based on [[hydro power]]. [[Geothermal energy]] production is the most important\nsource of energy in Iceland, whilst nuclear power is produced in both Finland and in Sweden. The indigenous production of energy in the Nordic countries has risen considerably over the last couple of decades \u2013 especially in Denmark and Norway due to oil deposits in the [[North Sea]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=35 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe most important energy sources in the Nordic countries measured in terms of energy supply in million toe (tonnes oil equivalent) are in order of importance: oil, solid fuels (e.g. coal and wood), nuclear power, hydro and geothermal power and solar energy and gas. In the EU, the most important source of energy is also oil, but gas comes in second. Hydro and geothermal power and other renewable sources of energy are major sources in the Nordic countries as compared to the EU countries. Particularly in Iceland and Norway, hydro and geothermal power constitute a major share of the overall energy supply. Denmark depends almost entirely on thermal power generated from coal, oil and gas. Iceland obtains a substantial part of its energy for heating from geothermal energy and depends almost entirely upon hydro-power resources for its production of electricity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=36 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{see|Tourism in Denmark|Tourism in Finland|Tourism in Iceland|Tourism in Norway|Tourism in Sweden}}\nThe Nordic countries in order of popularity with tourists are Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland then Iceland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tourism |url=https://www.nordicstatistics.org/the-business-sector/tourism/ |website=Nordic Statistics database |language=sv-SE}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics{{anchor|Population}} ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:90%; white-space:nowrap\"\n!style=\"width:6em\"|Country\n!style=\"width:6em\"|Capital\n!style=\"width:5em\"|Population\n!style=\"width:5em\"|Area (km\u00b2)\n|-style=\"line-height:95%\"\n|[[Denmark]]\n|[[Copenhagen]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|5,748,769<ref name=Dpopulation>{{cite web|title=Population at the first day of the quarter by municipality, sex, age, marital status, ancestry, country of origin and citizenship|url=http://www.statbank.dk/FOLK1|publisher=[[Statistics Denmark]]|accessdate=13 February 2017|quote=January 2017}}</ref>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|43,561\n|-style=\"line-height:95%\"\n|[[Greenland]]\n|[[Nuuk]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|55,877<ref>[http://www.stat.gl/dialog/topmain.asp?lang=en&subject=Population&sc=BE#chart-wrapper \"Gr\u00f8nlands Statistik\"].

Today, the population has increased to 27 million people. The Nordic countries have one of the lowest population densities in the world. The low density is partly due to the fact that many parts of the Nordic countries are marginal areas, where nature puts limitations on settlement. In four out of five Nordic countries,{{which|date=July 2016}} around 20 per cent of the population is to be found in the vicinity of the respective capitals. In Iceland, this percentage is even higher, with more than 60 per cent of Icelanders residing at or nearby the capital city of [[Reykjav\u00edk]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nDuring the past 100 years, the population growth has been strongest in Greenland, where the population has multiplied by almost five, from 12,000 to 56,000 people. In Iceland, the increase has gone from 78,000 to 322,000 people. The population on the Faroe Islands has more than tripled, from 15,000 to 48,000 people. The Swedish and \u00c5landic populations are the only ones that have not at least doubled.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Since 1990, the total population in the Nordic countries has increased by more than 2.8 million people (12 per cent) \u2013 the most in Iceland (27 per cent) and in Norway and \u00c5land by 19 and close to 18 per cent. Certain regions in Finland, Norway and Sweden have experienced a decline in the population due to [[urbanization]], but at the national level all the Nordic countries have experienced growth. Compared to 2005, both the Faroe Islands and Greenland have experienced a minor decline in the population. Iceland has also experienced shorter periods with a declining population. The Danish population is expected to increase by 8 per cent until 2035, while Finland and Sweden expect an increase in the population of about 10 and almost 16 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=37\u201338 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nLife expectancy is rising in all the Nordic countries, though the levels vary greatly. Life expectancy for men in Greenland is 68.3 years (2011), compared to 80.8 years for men in Iceland. Women in the Faroe Islands and in \u00c5land are expected to live the longest \u2013 more than 84 years. The population in the Nordic countries is getting older and according to the population projection for the Nordic countries as a whole, the share of the population above the age of 80 will reach 8.4 per cent in 2040, as compared to the 2013 level of 4.7 per cent. The share of population 80 years or older has increased from 1990 to 2013. The increase in the share of people above the age of 80 over the last 10 years is partly due to the fact that the death rate has fallen for almost all age groups and partly that the number of births has been low during the same period. In the next 25 years, the demographic dependency ratio is expected to have the strongest growth in Finland and \u00c5land. According to the most recent population forecasts in Finland and \u00c5land, in 2030 it is expected that people over 65 will make up 50 per cent of the adult population. Sweden and Denmark can look forward to a relatively modest increase in the next decades. Iceland and Norway seem to maintain their positions with the lowest proportions of elderly people in the Nordic countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic

That was also the case with Denmark, Finland, \u00c5land and Norway. In the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland, natural population increase had the greatest impact on the population change, but both Greenland and the Faroe Islands still had a slight decrease in the population due to a negative net migration in 2012.\n\nA large proportion of the migration in the Nordic countries occurs between and among the countries themselves, largely as the result of the free labour market and liberal rules for the exchange of students in the Nordic countries. The trend has led to an increasing number of foreign citizens in the Nordic countries during the past few decades. In all the countries, the major part of the foreign citizens is non-Nordic. That is not the case for Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which have a high proportion of other Nordic citizens. Non-nationals range from 47 per cent of the total immigration in Iceland, to 89 per cent in Norway. In 2013 the largest proportions of non-nationals were in Norway and Denmark, where they account for 8.9 and 8.8 per cent of the population. The proportion\nof non-nationals in the Finnish population is small compared to the other Nordic countries \u2013 3.6 per cent in 2013 \u2013 but the proportion has risen significantly during and after the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |pages=48\u201352 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Sami people ===\n[[File:Honningsv\u00e5g 2013 06 09 2187 (10302640703).jpg|thumb|Sami man at [[Honningsv\u00e5g]], Norway, wearing the traditional [[G\u00e1kti]]]]\nThe [[Sami people]], also spelled S\u00e1mi or Saami, are a Finno-Ugric people who have their traditional settlement areas in northern Finland, Norway and Sweden and Western Russia. Most Sami live in Norway, followed by Sweden and Finland, while the fewest Sami live in Russia. Because the countries do not make an official record of who has the Sami identity or background,{{clarify|reason=There are official records for the S\u00e1mi parliament elections, but the criteria for being included are disputed.|date=May 2015}} no one knows the exact number of the Sami people. The Sami are the only indigenous people of the Nordic countries excluding Greenland that are recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples. They are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. There are several Sami languages.\n\nTraditionally, the Sami have plied a variety of livelihoods, including coastal fishing, fur trapping and sheep herding. However, the best known Sami livelihood is semi-nomadic reindeer herding. For traditional, environmental, cultural and political reasons, reindeer herding is legally reserved only for Sami people in certain regions of the Nordic countries. Nowadays, the Sami work in all sectors, in line with the non-Sami population, though the primary industries are still important culture bearers for the Sami people.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Share of total population in the Nordic countries in 2013.JPG|Share of total population of the Nordic countries by country in January 2013\nFile:Life expectancy at birth in the Nordic countries in 2012.JPG|[[Life expectancy]] at birth in the Nordic countries in 2012\nFile:Marriages and divorces in the Nordic countries in 2012.JPG|Marriages and divorces in the Nordic countries in 2012\nFile:Immigrants in the Nordic countries in 2012.JPG|Immigrants in the Nordic countries in 2012\n</gallery>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|Faroese folk dancers in national costumes]]\nNordic countries have historically been one of the most socially progressive cultures in the world and culture is one of the main components of co-operation between the Nordic countries. The policies of the Nordic countries with respect to cultural life, mass media and religion have many shared values and features in common. However, some differences may be pointed out and for instance cultural institutions arising from historical circumstances. In both Denmark and Sweden, there are cultural institutions with roots in the traditions of the royal courts. In these countries, national institutions formed the foundation of cultural life at an early stage while in Norway cultural institutions began to form later.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook  |publisher=Nordic Council |page=94 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nIceland has the highest government expenditure on culture, a total of 3.3 per cent of its GDP in 2011. Denmark comes second with a total of 1.6 per cent of GDP in 2011. Sweden spend the least in 2011 with 1.1 per cent. Looking at per capita expenditure, Iceland again has the highest expenditure with Norway coming second. Greenland spends the third highest amount on culture and leisure per capita. In Iceland and Norway, expenditures have more than doubled since 2000. In the other Nordic countries, expenditures have gone up between 40 and 50 per cent in the same period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=95 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nDenmark has the most museums, a total of 274, but museums in \u00c5land and Iceland have the most visitors, an average of 4 and 5 visits per inhabitant. Many theatres in the Nordic countries receive public funding. Theatre funding constitutes a major share of allocations within the cultural area in all the countries. All countries have national theatres, where plays, ballets and operas are performed. In addition to the national theatres, there are professional regional theatres, which are also supported by the state, counties or municipalities. Most countries also have a few private theatres and many amateur ensembles, which may be supported at least partially by municipalities, primarily.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=96 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\nNordic Culture Fund, established in 1966, aims to support a broad spectrum of cultural cooperations between the Nordic countries. The Fund's ambition is to enable talented artists, both professionals and amateurs, to enrich each other via the cultural diversity that exists among the 26 million or more people of the Region. Its activities are based on an agreement between the Nordic countries, which came into force in 1967. The Fund receives its money in the form of an annual grant from the Nordic Council of Ministers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nordiskkulturfond.org/en/content/about-fund |title=Nordic Culture Fund - About the fund |website=nordiskkulturfond.org |publisher=Nordic Culture Fund |accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{see also|Nordic folk music|Nordic popular music}}\n[[File:ABBA Rotterdam 1979.jpg|thumb|[[ABBA]] is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]]]\nNordic countries share certain traditions in music, many of which have diverged significantly. In [[folk music]], Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the Faroe Islands share many common aspects. Greenland's [[Inuit culture]] has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture. Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the other Nordic countries as well as [[Estonia]]. The Sami have their own unique culture, with ties to the neighboring cultures.\n\nArt music has a strong position in Nordic countries. Apart from state-owned opera houses, there are symphony orchestras in most major cities. The most prominent historical composers from Nordic countries are the Finn [[Jean Sibelius]], the Dane [[Carl Nielsen]] and the Norwegian [[Edvard Grieg]]. Of contemporary composers, the Finns [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Kaija Saariaho]] and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] are among the most often performed in the world.\n\nRock and roll influences that came from the United States and United Kingdom were the start of the Nordic pop scene, but influences from the Nordic folk music can still be found today in popular music. Common characteristic in Nordic pop music is that it can often be either very lighthearted pop music or very dark metal. Some of the most well-known Nordic music groups include [[ABBA]], [[Ace of Base]], [[a-ha]], [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[The Cardigans]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Hanoi Rocks]], [[Roxette]], [[The Rasmus]], [[Kaizers Orchestra]] and [[The Spotnicks]]. Sweden and Finland have possibly the largest music industries in the area, especially Sweden which is the largest exporter of pop music per capita and the third largest overall after the United States and the United Kingdom. Norway, Iceland and Denmark have all had successful domestic record industries for many years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allscandinavian.com/591/top-1010-best-selling-scandinavian-artists-of-all-time/ |title=Top 10 Best selling Scandinavian artists of all time |website=allscandinavian.com |publisher=Peter Krogholm and Thomas Brundstom |accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacc-sandiego.org/415/ |title=The Swedish Music Export Phenomenon |website=sacc-sandiego.org |publisher=The Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Nordic metal scene is highly visible compared to other genres from the region. Many big names such as [[Amon Amarth]], [[Children of Bodom]], [[In Flames]], [[Meshuggah]] and [[Opeth]] originate from the Nordic countries. Nordic metal bands have had a long and lasting influence on the metal subculture alongside their counterparts in the United Kingdom and the United States. The [[black metal]] genre was developed in Norway by bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and the related genre of [[Viking metal]] was developed throughout the Nordic region by bands such as [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], Burzum, Emperor, [[Einherjer]], [[Moonsorrow]] and Amon Amarth.\n\nSince 2000, the total sale of music has declined by almost 50 per cent in all the Nordic countries and at the same time the digital sale has increased (digital sales cover both downloads and streaming of music). In Denmark, Norway and Finland, the sale of digital music has increased by 400 per cent since 2006 and now amounts to 39, 27 and 25 per cent of the total sale in 2010/2011. In Denmark and Sweden, sales of digital music rose almost eight-fold in the same period and now represent 51 per cent of the total sale. In Iceland, digital sale still only represents 3 per cent of the total sale.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=97 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{see also|Nordic literature}}\n[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] is considered to be the first existentialist philosopher]]\n[[File:Astrid Lindgren and Tove Jansson in 1958.jpg|thumb|Swedish author [[Astrid Lindgren]] together with Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]] in Stockholm in 1958]]\nThe earliest written records from Scandinavia are [[runic inscriptions]] on memorial stones and other objects. Some of those contain allusions to [[Norse mythology]] and even short poems in [[alliterative verse]]. The best known example is the elaborate [[R\u00f6k runestone]] (circa 800) which alludes to legends from the migration age. The oldest of the [[Eddic poems]] are believed to have been composed in the 9th century, though they are only preserved in 13th-century manuscripts. They tell of the myths and heroic legends of Scandinavia. [[Skaldic poetry]] is mostly preserved in late manuscripts but was preserved orally from the 9th century onwards and also appears on runestones, such as the [[Karlevi Runestone]]. In Iceland the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] are the best-known specimens of [[Icelandic literature]]. In Finland the most famous collection of folk poetry is by far the [[Kalevala]], which is the [[national epic]] of the country.\n\nNordic countries have produced important and influential literature. [[Henrik Ibsen]], a Norwegian playwright, was largely responsible for the popularity of modern realistic drama in Europe, with plays like ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' and ''[[A Doll's House]]''. His contemporary, Swedish novelist and playwright [[August Strindberg]], was a forerunner of experimental forms such as [[expressionism]], [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and [[surrealism]]. [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel prizes for literature]] have been awarded to [[Selma Lagerl\u00f6f]], [[Verner von Heidenstam]], [[Karl Adolph Gjellerup]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]], [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Sigrid Undset]], [[Erik Axel Karlfeldt]], [[Frans Eemil Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4]], [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]], [[P\u00e4r Lagerkvist]], [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Eyvind Johnson]], [[Harry Martinson]] and [[Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer]]. World-famous Nordic [[children's book]] writers include [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Tove Jansson]] and [[Astrid Lindgren]].\n\nSince 1962, the Nordic council has awarded a [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize|literature prize]] once a year for a work of fiction written in one of the Nordic languages. Since its establishment, the prize has been won by 15 Swedish, 10 Danish, 10 Norwegian, 8 Finnish, 7 Icelandic, 2 Faroe and 1 Sami writers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/nordic-council-prizes/nordisk-raads-litteraturpris |title=Nordic Council Literature Prize |website=Norden.org |publisher=Nordic Council |accessdate=28 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918222731/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/nordic-council-prizes/nordisk-raads-litteraturpris |archive-date=18 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNordic libraries function as information centres with a wide variety of services and access to all kinds of printed and electronic media. In the last twenty years, there has been an overall decline in stock and lending of books in public libraries. Despite the general decline in stock and loans, most of the Nordic countries have had an increase in the lending of other media than books. Since 2000, the stock of other media has increased between 30 and 85 percent in the Nordic countries. The lending of books has at the same time decreased in all Nordic countries, a decline between 10 and 20 percent.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haagensen |first=Klaus Munch |year=2013 |title=Nordic Statistical Yearbook |publisher=Nordic Council |page=98 |isbn=978-92-893-2481-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Art ===\n{{see also|Nordic art}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"160\" heights=\"170\" caption=\"Examples of nordic art from the 19th century\">\nFile:Interi\u00f8r med ung l\u00e6sende mand.jpg|{{flagicon|DEN}} '''[[Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i]]''' <br /><small>(1864\u20131916)</small><br />'' Interior with Young Man Reading'', 1898\nFile:Tanssiaiskengat iso by Helena Schjerfbeck 1882.jpg|{{flagicon|FIN}} '''[[Helene Schjerfbeck]]''' <br /><small>(1862\u20131946)</small><br />''Dancing Shoes'', 1882\nFile:Thorarinn thingvellir.jpg|{{flagicon|ISL}} '''[[\u00de\u00f3rarinn B. \u00deorl\u00e1ksson]]''' <br /><small>(1867\u20131924)</small><br />''[[\u00deingvellir]]'', 1900\nFile:The Scream.jpg|{{flagicon|NOR}} '''[[Edvard Munch]]''' <br /><small>(1863\u20131944)</small><br />''[[The Scream]]'', 1893\nFile:Marine avec recif-August Strindberg-IMG 8230.JPG|{{flagicon|SWE}} '''[[August Strindberg]]''' <br /><small>(1849\u20131912)</small><br /> ''Marine with rocks'', 1894\nFile:Didrikur a skarvanesi1.jpg|{{flagicon|FAR}} '''[[D\u00ed\u00f0rikur \u00e1 Skarvanesi]]''' <br /><small>(1802\u20131865)</small><br /> ''Birds'', 1800s\n</gallery>\n{{expand section|date=July 2016}}\n\n== National symbols ==\nAll Nordic countries, including the autonomous territories of [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]] and [[\u00c5land Islands]], have a similar flag design, all based on the [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]], the Danish flag.

A [[Roman Republic|Roman]] army led by [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]], with crucial support from Numidian leader [[Masinissa]], defeated the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] army led by [[Hannibal Barca]].\n\nAfter defeating Carthaginian and Numidian armies at the battles of [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]] and the [[Battle of the Great Plains|Great Plains]], Scipio imposed peace terms on the Carthaginians, who had no choice but to accept them. At the same time they recalled their general Hannibal's army from Italy. Confident in Hannibal's forces, the Carthaginians broke the armistice with Rome. Scipio and Hannibal confronted each other near [[Zama Regia]]. Hannibal had 36,000 [[infantry]] to Scipio's 29,000. One-third of Hannibal's army were citizen [[conscripts|levies]] and the Romans had 6,100 [[cavalry]] to Carthage's 4,000, as most of the [[Numidian cavalry]] that Hannibal had employed with great success in Italy had defected to the Romans.\n\nHannibal also employed 80 [[war elephants]]. The elephants opened the battle by charging the main Roman army. Scipio's soldiers avoided the elephants by opening their ranks and drove them off with missiles. The Roman and Numidian cavalry subsequently defeated the Carthaginian cavalry and chased them from the battlefield. Hannibal's first line of [[mercenaries]] attacked Scipio's infantry and were defeated. The second line of citizen levies and the mercenaries' remnants assaulted and inflicted heavy losses on the Roman first line. The Roman second line joined the struggle and pushed back the Carthaginian assault. Hannibal's third line of veterans, reinforced by the citizen levies and mercenaries, faced off against the Roman army, which had been redeployed into a single line. The combat was fierce and evenly matched. Finally, Scipio's cavalry returned to the battle and attacked Hannibal's army in the rear, routing and destroying it.\n\nThe Carthaginians lost 20,000\u201325,000 killed and 8,500\u201320,000 captured. Scipio lost 4,000\u20135,000 men, 1,500\u20132,500 Romans and 2,500 Numidians, killed. Defeated on their home ground, the [[Ancient Carthage#Government|Carthaginian ruling elite]] sued for peace and accepted humiliating terms, ending the 17-year war.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Schlacht bei Zama Gem\u00e4lde H P Motte.jpg|thumb|right|305px|The Battle of Zama by [[Henri-Paul Motte]], 1890.]]\nCrossing the Alps, Hannibal reached the Italian peninsula in 218 BC and won several major victories against the Roman armies. The Romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in Italy, but following Scipio's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Ilipa]] in Spain in 206 BC, Iberia had been secured by the Romans. In 205 BC Scipio returned to [[Rome]], where he was elected [[Roman consul|consul]] by unanimous vote. Scipio, now powerful enough, proposed to end the war by directly invading the [[Tunisia|Carthaginian homeland]].<ref>Livy, [[s: From the Founding of the City/Book 28#40|28.40]]</ref> The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] initially opposed this ambitious design of Scipio, persuaded by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] that the enterprise was far too hazardous. Scipio and his supporters eventually convinced the Senate to ratify the plan, and Scipio was given the requisite authority to attempt the invasion.<ref name = \"Bagnall Punic\">{{citation | first = Nigel | last = Bagnall | title = The Punic Wars}}.</ref>{{rp |270}}\n\nInitially, Scipio received no levy troops, and he sailed to [[Sicily]] with a group of 7,000 heterogeneous volunteers.<ref name = \"Hart Scipio\">{{citation | first = Basil Henry | last = Liddell Hart | title = Scipio}}.</ref>{{rp |96}} He was later authorized to employ the regular forces stationed in Sicily, which consisted mainly of the remnants of the 5th and 6th Legion, exiled to the island as a punishment for the humiliation they suffered at the [[Battle of Cannae]].<ref name = \"Hart Scipio\" />{{rp |119}}\n\nScipio continued to reinforce his troops with local defectors.<ref name = \"Bagnall Punic\" />{{rp |271}} He landed at [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and defeated the Carthaginian army at the [[Battle of the Great Plains]] in 203 BC. The panicked Carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to Scipio and him, having the authority to do so, granted peace on generous terms. Under the treaty, Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire, by that time a ''fait-accompli''. [[Masinissa]] was to be allowed to expand Numidia into parts of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity. The Roman Senate ratified the treaty. The Carthaginian senate recalled Hannibal, who was still in Italy (although confined to the south of the peninsula) when Scipio landed in Africa, in 203 BC.<ref name=\"reference\">{{citation | title = Readings in Ancient History \u2013 Illustrative Extracts from the Sources | first = William Stearns | last = Davis | ISBN = 1-4067-4833-1 | page = 79}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Carthaginians breached the armistice agreement by capturing a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and stripping it of supplies.

Scipio led a pre-[[Marian reforms|Marian]] Roman army [[Roman infantry tactics#Layout of the triple line|quincunx]], along with a body of Numidian cavalry.\n\nThe battle took place at [[Zama Regia]], near [[Siliana]] 130&nbsp;km southwest of [[Tunis]]. Hannibal was first to march and reach the plains of Zama Regia, which were suitable for cavalry maneuvering. This also gave an edge in turn to Scipio, who relied greatly on his Roman heavy cavalry and Numidian light cavalry. Hannibal deployed his troops facing northwest, while Scipio deployed his troops in front of the Carthaginian army facing southeast.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{citation | title = The battle of Zama | first = Don | last = Nardo | ISBN = 1-56006-420-X | page = 30}}.</ref>\n\nHannibal's army consisted of 36,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 80 [[war elephant]]s, while Scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry.<ref name=\"Lazenby, Hannibal's War pp.220-221\"/> Putting his cavalry on the flanks, with the inexperienced Carthaginian cavalry on the right and the Numidians on the left, Hannibal aligned the rest of his troops in three straight lines behind his elephants.<ref>Carey, Hannibal's Last Battle, p.116</ref> The first line consisted of mixed infantry of mercenaries from [[Gaul]], [[Liguria]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. In his second line he placed the Carthaginian and Libyan citizen levies, while his veterans from Italy, including mercenaries from Gaul and [[Hispania]], were placed in the third line.<ref>{{citation | quote =...novissimos Italicos constituit, quorum et timebat fidem et segnitiam verebatur, quoniam plerosque eorum ab Italia invitos extraxerat | last = Frontinus | first = Sextus Julius | title = Stratagemata | editor-first = Charles E | editor-last = Bennet | publisher = Loeb | series = Classical library | year = 1925 | page = 114 | ISBN = 0-674-99192-3}}.</ref> Hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line, in order to thwart Scipio's tendency to pin the Carthaginian center and envelop his opponent's lines, as he had done at the [[Battle of Ilipa]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Livy states that Hannibal deployed 4,000 Macedonians in the second line. Their presence is widely discounted as Roman propaganda, although T. Dorey suggests that there may be a grain of truth here if the Carthaginians recruited a trivial and unofficial number of mercenaries from Macedonia.<ref>{{citation | contribution = Macedonian Troops at the Battle of Zama | first = TA | last = Dorey | title = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 78 | number = 2 | year = 1957 | pages = 185\u20137}}.</ref>\n\nScipio deployed his army in three lines: the first was composed of the [[hastati]], the second of [[principes]] and the third of the [[triarii]]. The stronger right wing was composed of the Numidian cavalry and commanded by [[Masinissa]], while the left was composed of Italian cavalry under the command of Laelius. The greatest concern for Scipio was the elephants. He came up with an ingenious plan to deal with them.\n\n[[Image:Young Folks' History of Rome illus174.png|thumb|right|250px|Meeting of Hannibal and Scipio at Zama ([[Charlotte Mary Yonge]]), 1880.]]\nScipio knew that elephants could be ordered to charge forward, but they could only continue their charge in a straight line.<ref name=\"ScipioAfricanus\">{{citation | first = Scipio | last = Africanus | title = Greater Than Napoleon | first2 = BH Liddell | last2 = Hart | first3 = Michael | last3 = Grant | ISBN = 0-306-81363-7 | page = 263}}.</ref> He believed that if he opened gaps in his troops, the elephants would simply pass between them without harming any of his soldiers. He created lanes between the regiments across the depth of his forces and hid them with [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] of skirmishers. The plan was that when the elephants charged, these lanes would open, allowing them to pass through the legionaries' ranks and be dealt with at the rear of the army.\n\nHannibal and the Carthaginians had relied on cavalry superiority in previous battles such as [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], but Scipio, recognizing their importance, held the cavalry advantage at Zama. This was due in part to his raising of a new cavalry regiment in Sicily and careful courting of Masinissa as an ally.\n\nHannibal most likely believed that the combination of the war elephants and the depth of the first two lines would weaken and disorganize the Roman advance. This would have allowed him to complete a victory with his reserves in the third line and overlap Scipio's lines. Though this formation was well-conceived, it failed to produce a Carthaginian victory. The two men are said to have met face-to-face before the battle. Hannibal offered a treaty that would give up any claims to overseas territories to ensure the sovereignty of Carthage. Scipio refused, saying that it was either unconditional surrender or battle.\n\n==The battle==\nAt the outset of the battle, Hannibal unleashed his [[War elephant|elephants]] and [[skirmishers]] against the [[Roman army|Roman troops]] in order to break the cohesion of their lines and exploit the breaches that could be opened.<ref>{{citation | title = Scipio Africanus in the second Punic war | first = Howard Hayes | last = Scullard | publisher = CUP Publisher Archive | year = 1930}}.</ref> The attack was met by Roman skirmishers. In addition, Scipio ordered the [[cavalry]] to blow loud horns to frighten the beasts, which partly succeeded, and several rampaging elephants turned towards the Carthaginian left wing and disordered it completely. Seizing this opportunity, Masinissa led his Numidian cavalry and charged at the Carthaginian left wing, which was also composed of Numidian cavalry, and was unknowingly lured off the field. Meanwhile, the rest of the elephants were carefully lured through the lanes and funneled to the rear of the Roman army, where they were dealt with. Scipio's plan to neutralize the threat of the elephants had worked; his troops then fell back into traditional Roman battle formation. Laelius, the commander of the Roman left wing, charged against the Carthaginian right. The Carthaginian cavalry, acting on the instructions of Hannibal, allowed the Roman cavalry to chase them in order to lure them away from the battlefield so that they wouldn't attack the Carthaginian armies in the rear.<ref>{{citation | first = Adrian | last = Goldsworth | title = The Fall of Carthage, The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC | place = Phoenix | year = 2006 | page = 304}}.</ref>\n\nScipio now marched with his center towards the Carthaginian center, which was under the direct command of Hannibal. Hannibal moved forward with two lines; the third line of veterans was kept in reserve. After a close contest, his first line was pushed back by the Roman [[hastati]].<ref name = \"ScipioAfricanus\" /> Hannibal ordered his second line not to allow the first line in their ranks. The bulk of them managed to escape and position themselves on the wings of the second line on Hannibal's instructions.<ref name=\"reference\" /> Hannibal now charged with his second line. A furious struggle ensued and the Roman hastati were pushed back with heavy losses. Scipio reinforced the hastati with the second-line [[principes]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n{{gallery\n | width = 400\n | height = 292\n | lines = 4 <!-- extra caption line, default is 2, to prevent scrolling -->\n | File:Mohammad adil rais-battle of zama-2.PNG|Hannibal begins the battle with his war elephants charging at Roman front.

Click to play.]]\nWith this reinforcement the Roman front renewed their attack and defeated Hannibal's second line. Again, it was not allowed to merge with the third line and was forced to the wings, along with the first line. Carthaginian cavalry carried out Hannibal's instructions well and there was no sign of Roman cavalry on the battlefield. Once the Carthaginian cavalry was far enough away, they turned and attacked the Roman cavalry but were eventually routed. At this point there was a pause in the battle as both sides redeployed their troops. Scipio played for time as he redeployed his forces in a single line with the [[hastati]] in the middle, the [[principes]] in the inner wings and the [[triarii]] on the outer wings. Hannibal waited for Scipio to attack. The resulting clash was fierce and bloody, with neither side achieving superiority. Scipio was able to rally his men.<ref name=\"ScipioAfricanus\" /> The battle finally turned in the Romans' favor when the Roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the Carthaginian line from behind. The Carthaginian infantry was encircled and annihilated. Thousands of Carthaginians, including Hannibal, managed to escape the slaughter.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\nHannibal experienced a major defeat that put an end to all resistance on the part of Carthage. In total, as many as 20,000 of Hannibal's troops were killed at Zama, while 20,000 more were taken prisoner. The Romans suffered 2,500 dead.<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Fall of Carthage, The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC'', Phoenix, 2006, pp. 305\u2013307</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slaget ved Zama - Cornelis Cort, 1567.jpg|thumb|right|''The Battle of Zama'' by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567.]]\nSoon after Scipio's victory at [[Zama Regia|Zama]] the war ended, with the Carthaginian senate suing for peace. Unlike the treaty that ended the [[First Punic War]], the terms Carthage acceded to were so punishing that it was never able to challenge Rome for supremacy of the Mediterranean again. The treaty bankrupted Carthage and destroyed any chance of its being a military power in the future, although its economic recovery was quick. One provision of the treaty was that the Carthaginians were not allowed to make war without Roman consent. This allowed the Romans to establish a ''[[casus belli]]'' for the [[Third Punic War]] when the Carthaginians defended themselves from Numidian encroachments in which the Romans did not intervene.\n\nWhen Rome waged war again on Carthage about 50 years later, the Carthaginians had little power and could not defeat the by-then very aged [[Masinissa]] in Africa. They organized a defense of their home city which, after an extended siege, was captured and completely destroyed in 146 BC. Only 55,000 survived.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author = [[Hans Delbruck]]| title = Warfare in antiquity| year = 1990| publisher = University of Nebraska Press| isbn = 978-0-8032-9199-7 }}\n* Robert F.

A [[Roman Republic|Roman]] army led by [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]], with crucial support from Numidian leader [[Masinissa]], defeated the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] army led by [[Hannibal Barca]].\n\nAfter defeating Carthaginian and Numidian armies at the battles of [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]] and the [[Battle of the Great Plains|Great Plains]], Scipio imposed peace terms on the Carthaginians, who had no choice but to accept them. At the same time they recalled their general Hannibal's army from Italy. Confident in Hannibal's forces, the Carthaginians broke the armistice with Rome. Scipio and Hannibal confronted each other near [[Zama Regia]]. Hannibal had 36,000 [[infantry]] to Scipio's 29,000. One-third of Hannibal's army were citizen [[conscripts|levies]] and the Romans had 6,100 [[cavalry]] to Carthage's 4,000, as most of the [[Numidian cavalry]] that Hannibal had employed with great success in Italy had defected to the Romans.\n\nHannibal also employed 80 [[war elephants]]. The elephants opened the battle by charging the main Roman army. Scipio's soldiers avoided the elephants by opening their ranks and drove them off with missiles. The Roman and Numidian cavalry subsequently defeated the Carthaginian cavalry and chased them from the battlefield. Hannibal's first line of [[mercenaries]] attacked Scipio's infantry and were defeated. The second line of citizen levies and the mercenaries' remnants assaulted and inflicted heavy losses on the Roman first line. The Roman second line joined the struggle and pushed back the Carthaginian assault. Hannibal's third line of veterans, reinforced by the citizen levies and mercenaries, faced off against the Roman army, which had been redeployed into a single line. The combat was fierce and evenly matched. Finally, Scipio's cavalry returned to the battle and attacked Hannibal's army in the rear, routing and destroying it.\n\nThe Carthaginians lost 20,000\u201325,000 killed and 8,500\u201320,000 captured. Scipio lost 4,000\u20135,000 men, 1,500\u20132,500 Romans and 2,500 Numidians, killed. Defeated on their home ground, the [[Ancient Carthage#Government|Carthaginian ruling elite]] sued for peace and accepted humiliating terms, ending the 17-year war.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Schlacht bei Zama Gem\u00e4lde H P Motte.jpg|thumb|right|305px|The Battle of Zama by [[Henri-Paul Motte]], 1890.]]\nCrossing the Alps, Hannibal reached the Italian peninsula in 218 BC and won several major victories against the Roman armies. The Romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in Italy, but following Scipio's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Ilipa]] in Spain in 206 BC, Iberia had been secured by the Romans. In 205 BC Scipio returned to [[Rome]], where he was elected [[Roman consul|consul]] by unanimous vote. Scipio, now powerful enough, proposed to end the war by directly invading the [[Tunisia|Carthaginian homeland]].<ref>Livy, [[s: From the Founding of the City/Book 28#40|28.40]]</ref> The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] initially opposed this ambitious design of Scipio, persuaded by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] that the enterprise was far too hazardous. Scipio and his supporters eventually convinced the Senate to ratify the plan, and Scipio was given the requisite authority to attempt the invasion.<ref name = \"Bagnall Punic\">{{citation | first = Nigel | last = Bagnall | title = The Punic Wars}}.</ref>{{rp |270}}\n\nInitially, Scipio received no levy troops, and he sailed to [[Sicily]] with a group of 7,000 heterogeneous volunteers.<ref name = \"Hart Scipio\">{{citation | first = Basil Henry | last = Liddell Hart | title = Scipio}}.</ref>{{rp |96}} He was later authorized to employ the regular forces stationed in Sicily, which consisted mainly of the remnants of the 5th and 6th Legion, exiled to the island as a punishment for the humiliation they suffered at the [[Battle of Cannae]].<ref name = \"Hart Scipio\" />{{rp |119}}\n\nScipio continued to reinforce his troops with local defectors.<ref name = \"Bagnall Punic\" />{{rp |271}} He landed at [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and defeated the Carthaginian army at the [[Battle of the Great Plains]] in 203 BC. The panicked Carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to Scipio and him, having the authority to do so, granted peace on generous terms. Under the treaty, Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire, by that time a ''fait-accompli''. [[Masinissa]] was to be allowed to expand Numidia into parts of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity. The Roman Senate ratified the treaty. The Carthaginian senate recalled Hannibal, who was still in Italy (although confined to the south of the peninsula) when Scipio landed in Africa, in 203 BC.<ref name=\"reference\">{{citation | title = Readings in Ancient History \u2013 Illustrative Extracts from the Sources | first = William Stearns | last = Davis | ISBN = 1-4067-4833-1 | page = 79}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Carthaginians breached the armistice agreement by capturing a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and stripping it of supplies.

Scipio led a pre-[[Marian reforms|Marian]] Roman army [[Roman infantry tactics#Layout of the triple line|quincunx]], along with a body of Numidian cavalry.\n\nThe battle took place at [[Zama Regia]], near [[Siliana]] 130&nbsp;km southwest of [[Tunis]]. Hannibal was first to march and reach the plains of Zama Regia, which were suitable for cavalry maneuvering. This also gave an edge in turn to Scipio, who relied greatly on his Roman heavy cavalry and Numidian light cavalry. Hannibal deployed his troops facing northwest, while Scipio deployed his troops in front of the Carthaginian army facing southeast.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{citation | title = The battle of Zama | first = Don | last = Nardo | ISBN = 1-56006-420-X | page = 30}}.</ref>\n\nHannibal's army consisted of 36,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 80 [[war elephant]]s, while Scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry.<ref name=\"Lazenby, Hannibal's War pp.220-221\"/> Putting his cavalry on the flanks, with the inexperienced Carthaginian cavalry on the right and the Numidians on the left, Hannibal aligned the rest of his troops in three straight lines behind his elephants.<ref>Carey, Hannibal's Last Battle, p.116</ref> The first line consisted of mixed infantry of mercenaries from [[Gaul]], [[Liguria]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. In his second line he placed the Carthaginian and Libyan citizen levies, while his veterans from Italy, including mercenaries from Gaul and [[Hispania]], were placed in the third line.<ref>{{citation | quote =...novissimos Italicos constituit, quorum et timebat fidem et segnitiam verebatur, quoniam plerosque eorum ab Italia invitos extraxerat | last = Frontinus | first = Sextus Julius | title = Stratagemata | editor-first = Charles E | editor-last = Bennet | publisher = Loeb | series = Classical library | year = 1925 | page = 114 | ISBN = 0-674-99192-3}}.</ref> Hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line, in order to thwart Scipio's tendency to pin the Carthaginian center and envelop his opponent's lines, as he had done at the [[Battle of Ilipa]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Livy states that Hannibal deployed 4,000 Macedonians in the second line. Their presence is widely discounted as Roman propaganda, although T. Dorey suggests that there may be a grain of truth here if the Carthaginians recruited a trivial and unofficial number of mercenaries from Macedonia.<ref>{{citation | contribution = Macedonian Troops at the Battle of Zama | first = TA | last = Dorey | title = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 78 | number = 2 | year = 1957 | pages = 185\u20137}}.</ref>\n\nScipio deployed his army in three lines: the first was composed of the [[hastati]], the second of [[principes]] and the third of the [[triarii]]. The stronger right wing was composed of the Numidian cavalry and commanded by [[Masinissa]], while the left was composed of Italian cavalry under the command of Laelius. The greatest concern for Scipio was the elephants. He came up with an ingenious plan to deal with them.\n\n[[Image:Young Folks' History of Rome illus174.png|thumb|right|250px|Meeting of Hannibal and Scipio at Zama ([[Charlotte Mary Yonge]]), 1880.]]\nScipio knew that elephants could be ordered to charge forward, but they could only continue their charge in a straight line.<ref name=\"ScipioAfricanus\">{{citation | first = Scipio | last = Africanus | title = Greater Than Napoleon | first2 = BH Liddell | last2 = Hart | first3 = Michael | last3 = Grant | ISBN = 0-306-81363-7 | page = 263}}.</ref> He believed that if he opened gaps in his troops, the elephants would simply pass between them without harming any of his soldiers. He created lanes between the regiments across the depth of his forces and hid them with [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]] of skirmishers. The plan was that when the elephants charged, these lanes would open, allowing them to pass through the legionaries' ranks and be dealt with at the rear of the army.\n\nHannibal and the Carthaginians had relied on cavalry superiority in previous battles such as [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], but Scipio, recognizing their importance, held the cavalry advantage at Zama. This was due in part to his raising of a new cavalry regiment in Sicily and careful courting of Masinissa as an ally.\n\nHannibal most likely believed that the combination of the war elephants and the depth of the first two lines would weaken and disorganize the Roman advance. This would have allowed him to complete a victory with his reserves in the third line and overlap Scipio's lines. Though this formation was well-conceived, it failed to produce a Carthaginian victory. The two men are said to have met face-to-face before the battle. Hannibal offered a treaty that would give up any claims to overseas territories to ensure the sovereignty of Carthage. Scipio refused, saying that it was either unconditional surrender or battle.\n\n==The battle==\nAt the outset of the battle, Hannibal unleashed his [[War elephant|elephants]] and [[skirmishers]] against the [[Roman army|Roman troops]] in order to break the cohesion of their lines and exploit the breaches that could be opened.<ref>{{citation | title = Scipio Africanus in the second Punic war | first = Howard Hayes | last = Scullard | publisher = CUP Publisher Archive | year = 1930}}.</ref> The attack was met by Roman skirmishers. In addition, Scipio ordered the [[cavalry]] to blow loud horns to frighten the beasts, which partly succeeded, and several rampaging elephants turned towards the Carthaginian left wing and disordered it completely. Seizing this opportunity, Masinissa led his Numidian cavalry and charged at the Carthaginian left wing, which was also composed of Numidian cavalry, and was unknowingly lured off the field. Meanwhile, the rest of the elephants were carefully lured through the lanes and funneled to the rear of the Roman army, where they were dealt with. Scipio's plan to neutralize the threat of the elephants had worked; his troops then fell back into traditional Roman battle formation. Laelius, the commander of the Roman left wing, charged against the Carthaginian right. The Carthaginian cavalry, acting on the instructions of Hannibal, allowed the Roman cavalry to chase them in order to lure them away from the battlefield so that they wouldn't attack the Carthaginian armies in the rear.<ref>{{citation | first = Adrian | last = Goldsworth | title = The Fall of Carthage, The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC | place = Phoenix | year = 2006 | page = 304}}.</ref>\n\nScipio now marched with his center towards the Carthaginian center, which was under the direct command of Hannibal. Hannibal moved forward with two lines; the third line of veterans was kept in reserve. After a close contest, his first line was pushed back by the Roman [[hastati]].<ref name = \"ScipioAfricanus\" /> Hannibal ordered his second line not to allow the first line in their ranks. The bulk of them managed to escape and position themselves on the wings of the second line on Hannibal's instructions.<ref name=\"reference\" /> Hannibal now charged with his second line. A furious struggle ensued and the Roman hastati were pushed back with heavy losses. Scipio reinforced the hastati with the second-line [[principes]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n{{gallery\n | width = 400\n | height = 292\n | lines = 4 <!-- extra caption line, default is 2, to prevent scrolling -->\n | File:Mohammad adil rais-battle of zama-2.PNG|Hannibal begins the battle with his war elephants charging at Roman front.

Click to play.]]\nWith this reinforcement the Roman front renewed their attack and defeated Hannibal's second line. Again, it was not allowed to merge with the third line and was forced to the wings, along with the first line. Carthaginian cavalry carried out Hannibal's instructions well and there was no sign of Roman cavalry on the battlefield. Once the Carthaginian cavalry was far enough away, they turned and attacked the Roman cavalry but were eventually routed. At this point there was a pause in the battle as both sides redeployed their troops. Scipio played for time as he redeployed his forces in a single line with the [[hastati]] in the middle, the [[principes]] in the inner wings and the [[triarii]] on the outer wings. Hannibal waited for Scipio to attack. The resulting clash was fierce and bloody, with neither side achieving superiority. Scipio was able to rally his men.<ref name=\"ScipioAfricanus\" /> The battle finally turned in the Romans' favor when the Roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the Carthaginian line from behind. The Carthaginian infantry was encircled and annihilated. Thousands of Carthaginians, including Hannibal, managed to escape the slaughter.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\nHannibal experienced a major defeat that put an end to all resistance on the part of Carthage. In total, as many as 20,000 of Hannibal's troops were killed at Zama, while 20,000 more were taken prisoner. The Romans suffered 2,500 dead.<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Fall of Carthage, The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC'', Phoenix, 2006, pp. 305\u2013307</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slaget ved Zama - Cornelis Cort, 1567.jpg|thumb|right|''The Battle of Zama'' by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567.]]\nSoon after Scipio's victory at [[Zama Regia|Zama]] the war ended, with the Carthaginian senate suing for peace. Unlike the treaty that ended the [[First Punic War]], the terms Carthage acceded to were so punishing that it was never able to challenge Rome for supremacy of the Mediterranean again. The treaty bankrupted Carthage and destroyed any chance of its being a military power in the future, although its economic recovery was quick. One provision of the treaty was that the Carthaginians were not allowed to make war without Roman consent. This allowed the Romans to establish a ''[[casus belli]]'' for the [[Third Punic War]] when the Carthaginians defended themselves from Numidian encroachments in which the Romans did not intervene.\n\nWhen Rome waged war again on Carthage about 50 years later, the Carthaginians had little power and could not defeat the by-then very aged [[Masinissa]] in Africa. They organized a defense of their home city which, after an extended siege, was captured and completely destroyed in 146 BC. Only 55,000 survived.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author = [[Hans Delbruck]]| title = Warfare in antiquity| year = 1990| publisher = University of Nebraska Press| isbn = 978-0-8032-9199-7 }}\n* Robert F.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=March 27, 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle.<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> He would eventually teach himself to play the guitar as well.\n\n==Musical process==\n\n===Approach to songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHe says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of thinking in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=March 27, 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=March 27, 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=Shopify |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.
