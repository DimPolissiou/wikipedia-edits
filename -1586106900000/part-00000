As of 2013, it has a population of 15,710 inhabitants, while the town of Ugljevik has a population of 4,155 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality is located in the countryside of the eastern foothills of [[Majevica|Mount Majevica]], where the mountains start descending towards the flatlands of [[Semberija]], to which it is tied more than any other surrounding area. It is the home of miners and other energy resource professionals.\n\n==Name==\nUgljevik was named for the [[coal]], which first began to be exploited on Mount [[Majevica]] in 1899.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==History==\n[[Coal]] production has been exploited on Mount [[Majevica]] since 1899. Within a century, the local inhabitants developed the initial small dig into today\u2019s surface mine producing 6,000 [[tonne]]s of coal per day and the coal-fired power plant \u201cTermoelektrana Ugljevik\u201d ([[Ugljevik Power Plant]]), supplying the Republic with 300 [[megawatt]]s of [[electricity]]. Preparations are underway for the construction of another power-plant of 600 MW. Exploration indicates huge{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2016}} reserves of quality coal, with seams stretching in every direction, even reaching [[Zvornik]] on the [[Drina]] river. The administrative center of the Municipality was the village of Zabrdje, to be transferred to the mining community of Ugljevik (now named Stari Ugljevik (Old Ugljevik)) in 1941, after Zabrdje was burned by [[Usta\u0161e]]. The present-day Ugljevik began to be built in 1980 in the valley of [[Janja River|Janja]] river (one of the [[Drina]]\u2019s tributaries) between Zabrdje, Stari Ugljevik, Bogutovo Selo and Ugljevicka Obrijez, in answer to the need for increasing the surface mining operations and building the power-plant. The whole of the old Ugljevik was then moved to this new site.\n[[File:Stariugljevik.jpg|thumb|279x279px|Ugljevik, miners settlement \u2013 Kolonija, in 1931]][[File:Bogutovoselospomenje.jpg|277x277px|thumb|Medieval graveyards in Ugljevik village of Bogutovo Selo|alt=]]\nAt least ten archaeological locations have been found in the area. These include five locations with groupings of [[medieval]] stone sarcophagi, called ''ste\u0107ci'', and three dating from the Roman period. Though research into [[Neolithic]] sites in the municipality is lacking, near-by areas have Neolithic archaeological sites, allowing postulation that there might have been ancient sites present. The village of Tutnjevac contains the remains of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] villa.\n\nThe first population census of the region showed five settlements with a total of 55 houses, which date from prior to arrival of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 15th century. During troubled times the population would leave these parts with most of the succeeding population&mdash;the forebears of the present Majevicans&mdash;coming from Eastern and \u2018Old\u2019 [[Herzegovina]] in the 19th century.\n\nDuring the past hundred years, the pace and extent of development of the Ugljevik region has been determined by coal production. With the increased need for coal, coal exploitation began in 1899, and a [[narrow gauge railway]] was built from [[Ra\u010da]], on the [[Sava]] river, to the Ugljevik coal-mine via Bijeljina in 1919. Subsequently, this railway was upgraded to normal narrow gauge, and later was connected to one of Ugljevik\u2019s communities, Mezgraja, in 1938. This was the last narrow-gauge railway in the Europe before it was closed on May 26, 1979.\n\nThe coal from Bogutovo Selo surface mine has a [[Energy value of coal|calorific value]] of 2,550 [[calorie|kcal]]/kg (10.68 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg), and it is estimated that the reserves are sufficient to satisfy the needs of four 300 [[megawatt]] coal-fired power plants.\n\nIt is thanks to these coal giants that almost all of Ugljevik\u2019s corporations developed.\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Russianandamericancampinugljevik.jpg|190px|thumb|right|Picture taken from [[helicopter]] showing river Janja dividing US Army Camp (in front) and Russian Army camp (other side of river)]] -->\nAfter the [[Bosnian War]] Ugljevik became a significant peacekeeping force post. For the first time after the [[World War II]], Russian (then Soviet) Army and Western Allies worked together in a military mission, as Implementation Force ([[IFOR]]) and later Stabilization Forces ([[SFOR]]). Headquarters of Russian Peacekeeping Mission in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] was in Ugljevik. Americans had a small base in Ugljevik, across the Janja river from the Russians. In relation to this, IFOR info magazine \u201cTalon\u201d wrote in one of its issues \u201cCold War melted on the Balkan sun\u201d.\n\n== Location ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ugljevik 001.JPG|100px|thumb|right|Monument dedidcated to the serbian soldiers and civilians of the 1992-95 war]] -->\nThe Municipality of Ugljevik borders to the East and North on the Municipality of [[Bijeljina]], with [[Lopare]] Municipality marking the West and [[Zvornik]] Municipality the South boundaries, and in the South also touching on [[Teo\u010dak]] Municipality in the BiH Federation. The 1993 population census indicated a population of 16,456 residing in 4,733 households, in this Municipality covering {{convert|164|km2|abbr=off}}. The population density is 12.44/km\u00b2, thi being the result of dispersed nature of the communities.\n\nUgljevik is located on the inter-Entity [[Bijeljina]]-[[Tuzla]] highway&mdash;built in 1971&mdash;which connects it to all the surrounding regions, with asphalt roads branching off the highway towards Zabrdje, Trnova and other communities. It is now possible to reach every village in Ugljevik municipality by car. This, coupled with other circumstances&mdash;primarily the fine infrastructure, employment opportunities, healthy environment and proximity to populous towns&mdash;contribute to the municipality\u2019s towns developing quickly and the residents choice to remain in them. Despite the destruction of the recent war and the postwar hardships of recovery, new houses are replacing old at every step.\n\n==Territorial organisation==\nThe Municipality of Ugljevik has the following 21 communities:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Korenita]]\n* [[Male\u0161evci, Ugljevik|Male\u0161evci]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e (Ugljevik)|Zabrdje]]\n* [[Ugljevi\u010dka Obrije\u017e]]\n* [[Stari Ugljevik]]\n* [[Ugljevik Selo]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e (Ugljevik)|Gornje Zabrdje]]\n* [[Ravno Polje]]\n* [[Bogutovo Selo]]\n* [[Gornja Kr\u0107ina]]\n* [[Trnova, Ugljevik|Gornja Trnova]]\n* {{ill|Mezgraja, Ugljevik|lt=Mezgraja|bs|Mezgraja (Ugljevik)}}\n* [[Modran, Ugljevik|Modran]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e (Ugljevik)|Donje Zabr\u0111e]]\n* [[Janjari (Atma\u010di\u0107i)]]\n* [[Trnova, Ugljevik|Srednja Trnova]]\n* [[Glinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Glinje]]\n* [[Sarije]]\n* [[Mukat]]\n* Stankovi\u0107i\n* [[Trnova, Ugljevik|Donja Trnova]]\n* [[Akma\u010di\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Ugljevik municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|24,178\n|24,540\n|17,830\n|15,710\n|-\n|1\n|Atma\u010di\u0107i\n|\n|\n|566\n|429\n|-\n|2\n|Bogutovo Selo\n|\n|\n|499\n|294\n|-\n|3\n|Donja Trnova\n|\n|\n|1,491\n|1,154\n|-\n|4\n|Glinje\n|\n|\n|648\n|461\n|-\n|5\n|Gornja Trnova\n|\n|\n|420\n|284\n|-\n|6\n|Janjari\n|\n|\n|651\n|497\n|-\n|7\n|Korenita\n|\n|\n|840\n|557\n|-\n|8\n|Male\u0161evci\n|\n|\n|602\n|404\n|-\n|9\n|Mezgraja\n|\n|\n|714\n|459\n|-\n|10\n|Mukat Stankovi\u0107i\n|\n|\n|458\n|330\n|-\n|11\n|Ravno Polje\n|\n|\n|466\n|598\n|-\n|12\n|Srednja Trnova\n|\n|\n|721\n|579\n|-\n|13\n|Stari Ugljevik\n|\n|\n|1,126\n|707\n|-\n|14\n|Tutnjevac\n|\n|\n|1,489\n|1,042\n|-\n|15\n|Ugljevi\u010dka Obrije\u017e\n|\n|\n|934\n|945\n|-\n|16\n|'''Ugljevik'''\n|2,388\n|2,442\n|2,981\n|4,155\n|-\n|17\n|Ugljevik Selo\n|\n|\n|693\n|478\n|-\n|18\n|Zabr\u0111e\n|\n|\n|1,725\n|1,551\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Ugljevik town\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|4,155 (100,0%)\n|2,981 (100,0%)\n|2,442 (100,0%)\n|2,388 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|2,426 (81,38%)\n|2,210 (90,50%)\n|2,256 (94,47%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|348 (11,67%)\n|66 (2,703%)\n|86 (3,601%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|133 (4,462%)\n|143 (5,856%)\n|15 (0,628%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|39 (1,308%)\n|3 (0,123%)\n|15 (0,628%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|35 (1,174%)\n|16 (0,655%)\n|5 (0,209%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|4 (0,164%)\n|6 (0,251%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|\n|4 (0,168%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|\n|1 (0,042%)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Ugljevik municipality\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|15,710 (100,0%)\n|25,587 (100,0%)\n|24,540 (100,0%)\n|24,178 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|13,412 (85,37%)\n|14,468 (56,54%)\n|14,066 (57,32%)\n|14,816 (61,28%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|2,186 (13,91%)\n|10,241 (40,02%)\n|9,403 (38,32%)\n|8,859 (36,64%)\n|-\n|Others\n|70 (0,446%)\n|532 (2,079%)\n|81 (0,330%)\n|58 (0,240%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|42 (0,267%)\n|56 (0,219%)\n|17 (0,069%)\n|53 (0,219%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|290 (1,133%)\n|573 (2,335%)\n|35 (0,145%)\n|-\n|Roma\n|\n|\n|376 (1,532%)\n|328 (1,357%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|9 (0,037%)\n|13 (0,054%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|7 (0,029%)\n|12 (0,050%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|4 (0,016%)\n|3 (0,012%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|3 (0,012%)\n|\n|-\n|Hungarians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,004%)\n|1 (0,004%)\n|}\n[[File:Panoramicviewofugljevik.JPG|546x546px|thumb|left|Panoramic view of Ugljevik from one of nearby hills, cave also visible]]\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Centar za kulturu Filip Visnjic Ugljevik.JPG|thumb|334x334px|left|Building of Cultural center \"Filip Vi\u0161nji\u0107\".]]\nCulture in these parts is gaining momentum. Numerous cultural events are presented at the Cultural Center.\n''Cultural Club Rudar'' was founded in 1976 and in the composition of the club work: folk dance ensemble, drama and recitation section, original (authentic) creative work, folk music orchestra. With its good programme the Club takes part in all important manifestations in the municipality and economy collectives and they also often had their performances in other municipalities.\n\nBuilding of ''Cultural Center \u201cFilip Vi\u0161nji\u0107\u201d'' was opened in 2006, and it is replica of Mine Head Office (\u201e''Direkcija''\u201c building) in Stari Ugljevik. Original building was built in 1921, but due to removal of Ugljevik on new location it was abandoned. New building is a center of rich cultural life in municipality and region.\n\n== Religion ==\nReligion assumed its traditional place in the last decade among the lives of the local populace. In addition to the existing churches in Zabrdje, Tutnjevac, Stari Ugljevik, which all shared the fate of their faithful, new [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] are being built. The most impressive one is in Ugljevik, dedicated to the protesters of Ugljevik and the Municipality, [[Parascheva of the Balkans|Holy Mother Paraskeva]]. The church was built in the traditional [[Serbian Orthodox Church#Serbo-Byzantine Style|Serbian-Byzantine]] Church style, and dominates the town.\n\n[[Mosque]]s are also being rebuilt, after the war, in villages (Janjari, Atma\u010di\u0107i, Glinje, Srednja Trnova).\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:Srednja skola Mihailo Petrovic Alas Ugljevik.jpg|thumb|200px|\"[[Mihailo Petrovi\u0107 Alas]]\" High School.]]\nEducation has a long  tradition in the Municipality of Ugljevik. An elementary school was founded in Zabrdje in 1875. The town was at the time the largest settlement in this part of Majevica, since it was located on the [[Bijeljina]]-[[Tuzla]] road. In the year of 1995 town marked the 120th anniversary of its school, making Zabrdje, one of privileged communities of [[Majevica]] and [[Semberija]] to have their own school for quite some time.\n\nThe second school to open in these parts began lesson in 1890 in Korenita. It was followed two years later by the opening of a school in Ugljevik. After the [[Second World War]], village schools appeared in other Ugljevik communities&mdash;Tutnjevac, Malesevci, Trnova, Mezgraja, Bogutovo Selo, Ugljevicka Obrijez and other communities. All school-age children attend classes. School building are modern and well equipped, with an adequate number of teachers ensuring a high standard of education. Two thousand pupils attend Ugljevik Municipality schools each year.\n\nUgljevik also has a Secondary School training future energy technicians, covering the trades needed most by the Ugljevik Termoelektrana (Power Plant). Despite a number of Ugljevik students attending school in [[Bijeljina]] secondary schools, and vice versa, Ugljevik still has 600 students.\n\n== Natural environment ==\nThe Ugljevik region includes the now evaporated [[Pannonian Sea]]. It had once reached above New Ugljevik, its waves cutting into the mountainside above the school complex where fossilised traces of aquatic flora and fauna are visible. Above Old Ugljevik lie the Medieval remains of the fortress Jablangrad. From its cliffs, reaching to {{convert|451|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], can be had views of the flatlands of [[Semberija]], while beyond, across the [[Drina]], are discernible [[Ma\u010dva]] and Mount [[Cer (mountain)|Cer]].\nUdrigovo Peak, where a radio-TV relay tower was built after the war, rises above the Ugljevik region. Udrigovo is known for its thick [[oak]] stands.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\nMajevica's hills have a number of forests, with the [[Quercus robur|black oak]] being well-known in Udrigovo.{{fact|date=May 2017}} Plans are being made to protect the forests and natural environment of the region and the Nature Reserves in Bogutovo Selo and Lazarevici, while maintaining lumber production.{{fact|date=May 2017}} These are also the conditions necessary to the development of recreation and various forms of tourism in the region.{{or-inline|date=May 2017}} This should be kept in mind when planning to expand surface coal exploitation or build new roads.{{or-inline|date=May 2017}} Forest of [[sessile oak]], black oak and other varieties can be found at Bogutovo Selo, Korenita and Lazarevic, as elsewhere.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Hotel Energetik Ugljevik.jpg|thumb|150px|right|\"Energetik\" Hotel]]\nThe village of Kr\u0107ina, in the direction of [[Zvornik]], has great potential for the development of village [[tourism]],{{fact|date=March 2019}} it being located in natural surroundings and possessing a cave nearby known by the local population as the cave of the epic hero ''Starina Novak''. Nearby is also located the [[Tavna Monastery]], dating to Middle Ages. The village is accessible from the [[Podrinje]], from the direction of [[Loznica]], [[Jadar (Serbia)|Jadar]], [[Radjevina]], [[Zvornik]] and [[Bijeljina]].

The pride of these parts is the [[FK Rudar Ugljevik|Football Club Rudar]], which has won the most important trophies and titles in [[Republika Srpska]] and spread the name of Ugljevik throughout the Republic. The Club is a wellspring of talented players, and its successes have inspired the development of soccer in neighbour municipalities as well. Village soccer clubs and school soccer teams have increased and improved their programmes also.\n\n[[Basketball]] and other sports are on the rise. Great attention is being paid the construction of sports facilities&mdash;soccer stadium, swimming pool, universal gym&mdash;while minor sports facilities are available for the youth in the vicinity of the elementary and secondary schools.\n\nThe Rudar [[Karate]] Club is a young [[sport]]s club, but this does not prevent it from achieving high results in numerous domestic and international karate meets. Competition began with county and regional meets, to finally progress to the world karate scene, it being of exceptional quality past years.\n\nThe Rudar [[Basketball]] Club was founded in 1984 and belongs to the Prime League of Republika Srpska. The club stopped operating in 1989, to renew itself in 1994 with great strides towards the Republic\u2019s basketball elite.\n\nRudar is also the name of [[chess]] club, which, through its competitions and work at popularising this ancient game, proudly represents the name of Rudar.\n\n[[Volleyball]], [[judo]] and [[bowling]] are also represented in Rudar sport\u2019s family.\n\nThere are additionally nine soccer clubs in the various villages: Partizan in Donja Trnova, Mladost in Bogutovo Selo, Buducnost in Ravno Polje, Strijelac in Tutnjevac, Proleter in Ugljevik Selo, Borac in Ugljevicka Obrijez, Majevica in Donja Zabrdje, Hajduk in Mezgraja and Granicar in Korenita.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Ugljevikzgrade.jpg|Srpske Sloge street\nFile:Ulica ugljevik.jpg|Kralja Petra I street\nFile:Dom zdravlja Ugljevik.jpg|Health Center\nFile:UgljevikPP.jpg|[[Ugljevik Power Plant]]\nFile:UgljevikPPChimney.jpg|Chimney of [[Ugljevik Power Plant]], {{convert|310|m|abbr=off}} tall, tallest structure in Bosnia.\n</gallery>\n\n==Twin Cities==\n{{see also|Town twinning}}\n\n* {{flagicon|SRB}} [[Beo\u010din]], [[Serbia]] 1982.\n* {{flagicon|FRA}} [[H\u00e9ric]], [[France]]\n* {{flagicon|NMK}} [[Kavadarci]], [[North Macedonia]] 2011.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* [[Filip Vi\u0161nji\u0107]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Official results from the book: Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ugljevik}}\n* {{official website|}}\n\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n{{coord|44|41|36|N|18|59|40|E|region:BA_type:city|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Ugljevik| ]]<!--please leave the empty space as standard-->\n[[Category:Populated places in Ugljevik]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Republika Srpska]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Republika Srpska]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n|settlement_type = [[List of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Town]] and [[Municipalities of Republika Srpska|municipality]]\n|subdivision_type = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name = [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Entity]]\n|subdivision_name1 = [[Republika Srpska]]\n|subdivision_type2 = Geographical [[region]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Semberija]]\n|timezone = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset = +1\n|timezone_DST = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST = +2\n|image_skyline = Ugljevik-Karadjordjeva st-panorama.JPG\n|image_caption = Main Street in center of municipality, Kara\u0111or\u0111eva street\n|unit_pref =\n|map_caption = Location of Ugljevik within Republika Srpska\n|native_name = {{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0423\u0433\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043a}}\n|official_name = Ugljevik\n|other_name =\n|image_flag =\n|flag_size = 125px\n|image_shield = Grb Ugljevik.png\n|shield_size = 100px\n|image_map = Ugljevik municipality.svg\n|pushpin_map = Bosnia and Herzegovina\n|area_blank1_title = Town\n|area_blank1_km2 = \n|area_blank2_title = Municipality\n|area_blank2_km2 = 165.2\n|population_as_of = 2013 census\n|population_blank1_title = Town\n|population_blank1 = 4155\n|population_density_blank1_km2 = auto\n|population_blank2_title = Municipality\n|population_blank2 = 15710\n|population_density_blank2_km2 = auto\n|coordinates = {{coord|44|41|36|N|18|59|40|E|region:BA|display=inline}}\n|postal_code_type = Postal Code\n|postal_code = 76330\n|area_code = (+387) 55\n|website = {{url|http://www.opstinaugljevik.net}}\n|footnotes =\n||leader_title=[[Mayor]]|\nleader_name = Vasilije Peri\u0107\n|leader_party = [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|SDS]] \n|twin1 = [[Beo\u010din]]\n|twin1_country = [[Serbia]]\n|twin2 = [[H\u00e9ric]]\n|twin2_country = [[France]]\n|\n|}}\n'''Ugljevik''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|\u0423\u0433\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043a}}) is a town and municipality located in [[Republika Srpska]], an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 15,710 inhabitants, while the town of Ugljevik has a population of 4,155 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality is located in the countryside of the eastern foothills of [[Majevica|Mount Majevica]], where the mountains start descending towards the flatlands of [[Semberija]], to which it is tied more than any other surrounding area. It is the home of miners and other energy resource professionals.\n\n==Name==\nUgljevik was named for the [[coal]], which first began to be exploited on Mount [[Majevica]] in 1899.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==History==\n[[Coal]] production has been exploited on Mount [[Majevica]] since 1899. Within a century, the local inhabitants developed the initial small dig into today\u2019s surface mine producing 6,000 [[tonne]]s of coal per day and the coal-fired power plant \u201cTermoelektrana Ugljevik\u201d ([[Ugljevik Power Plant]]), supplying the Republic with 300 [[megawatt]]s of [[electricity]]. Preparations are underway for the construction of another power-plant of 600 MW. Exploration indicates huge{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2016}} reserves of quality coal, with seams stretching in every direction, even reaching [[Zvornik]] on the [[Drina]] river. The administrative center of the Municipality was the village of Zabrdje, to be transferred to the mining community of Ugljevik (now named Stari Ugljevik (Old Ugljevik)) in 1941, after Zabrdje was burned by [[Usta\u0161e]]. The present-day Ugljevik began to be built in 1980 in the valley of [[Janja River|Janja]] river (one of the [[Drina]]\u2019s tributaries) between Zabrdje, Stari Ugljevik, Bogutovo Selo and Ugljevicka Obrijez, in answer to the need for increasing the surface mining operations and building the power-plant. The whole of the old Ugljevik was then moved to this new site.\n[[File:Ugljevik-naselja.PNG|thumb|336x336px|Settlements of Ugljevik municipality]]\n[[File:Stariugljevik.jpg|thumb|276x276px|Ugljevik, miners settlement \u2013 Kolonija, in 1931]][[File:Bogutovoselospomenje.jpg|277x277px|thumb|Medieval graveyards in Ugljevik village of Bogutovo Selo|alt=]]\nAt least ten archaeological locations have been found in the area. These include five locations with groupings of [[medieval]] stone sarcophagi, called ''ste\u0107ci'', and three dating from the Roman period. Though research into [[Neolithic]] sites in the municipality is lacking, near-by areas have Neolithic archaeological sites, allowing postulation that there might have been ancient sites present. The village of Tutnjevac contains the remains of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] villa.\n\nThe first population census of the region showed five settlements with a total of 55 houses, which date from prior to arrival of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 15th century. During troubled times the population would leave these parts with most of the succeeding population&mdash;the forebears of the present Majevicans&mdash;coming from Eastern and \u2018Old\u2019 [[Herzegovina]] in the 19th century.\n\nDuring the past hundred years, the pace and extent of development of the Ugljevik region has been determined by coal production. With the increased need for coal, coal exploitation began in 1899, and a [[narrow gauge railway]] was built from [[Ra\u010da]], on the [[Sava]] river, to the Ugljevik coal-mine via Bijeljina in 1919. Subsequently, this railway was upgraded to normal narrow gauge, and later was connected to one of Ugljevik\u2019s communities, Mezgraja, in 1938. This was the last narrow-gauge railway in the Europe before it was closed on May 26, 1979.\n\nThe coal from Bogutovo Selo surface mine has a [[Energy value of coal|calorific value]] of 2,550 [[calorie|kcal]]/kg (10.68 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg), and it is estimated that the reserves are sufficient to satisfy the needs of four 300 [[megawatt]] coal-fired power plants.\n\nIt is thanks to these coal giants that almost all of Ugljevik\u2019s corporations developed.\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Russianandamericancampinugljevik.jpg|190px|thumb|right|Picture taken from [[helicopter]] showing river Janja dividing US Army Camp (in front) and Russian Army camp (other side of river)]] -->\nAfter the [[Bosnian War]] Ugljevik became a significant peacekeeping force post. For the first time after the [[World War II]], Russian (then Soviet) Army and Western Allies worked together in a military mission, as Implementation Force ([[IFOR]]) and later Stabilization Forces ([[SFOR]]). Headquarters of Russian Peacekeeping Mission in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] was in Ugljevik. Americans had a small base in Ugljevik, across the Janja river from the Russians. In relation to this, IFOR info magazine \u201cTalon\u201d wrote in one of its issues \u201cCold War melted on the Balkan sun\u201d.\n\n== Location ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ugljevik 001.JPG|100px|thumb|right|Monument dedidcated to the serbian soldiers and civilians of the 1992-95 war]] -->\nThe Municipality of Ugljevik borders to the East and North on the Municipality of [[Bijeljina]], with [[Lopare]] Municipality marking the West and [[Zvornik]] Municipality the South boundaries, and in the South also touching on [[Teo\u010dak]] Municipality in the BiH Federation. The 1993 population census indicated a population of 16,456 residing in 4,733 households, in this Municipality covering {{convert|164|km2|abbr=off}}. The population density is 12.44/km\u00b2, thi being the result of dispersed nature of the communities.\n\nUgljevik is located on the inter-Entity [[Bijeljina]]-[[Tuzla]] highway&mdash;built in 1971&mdash;which connects it to all the surrounding regions, with asphalt roads branching off the highway towards Zabrdje, Trnova and other communities. It is now possible to reach every village in Ugljevik municipality by car. This, coupled with other circumstances&mdash;primarily the fine infrastructure, employment opportunities, healthy environment and proximity to populous towns&mdash;contribute to the municipality\u2019s towns developing quickly and the residents choice to remain in them. Despite the destruction of the recent war and the postwar hardships of recovery, new houses are replacing old at every step.\n\n==Territorial organisation==\nThe Municipality of Ugljevik has the following 21 communities:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Korenita]]\n* [[Male\u0161evci, Ugljevik|Male\u0161evci]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e (Ugljevik)|Zabrdje]]\n* [[Ugljevi\u010dka Obrije\u017e]]\n* [[Stari Ugljevik]]\n* [[Ugljevik Selo]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e (Ugljevik)|Gornje Zabrdje]]\n* [[Ravno Polje]]\n* [[Bogutovo Selo]]\n* [[Gornja Kr\u0107ina]]\n* [[Trnova, Ugljevik|Gornja Trnova]]\n* {{ill|Mezgraja, Ugljevik|lt=Mezgraja|bs|Mezgraja (Ugljevik)}}\n* [[Modran, Ugljevik|Modran]]\n* [[Zabr\u0111e (Ugljevik)|Donje Zabr\u0111e]]\n* [[Janjari (Atma\u010di\u0107i)]]\n* [[Trnova, Ugljevik|Srednja Trnova]]\n* [[Glinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Glinje]]\n* [[Sarije]]\n* [[Mukat]]\n* Stankovi\u0107i\n* [[Trnova, Ugljevik|Donja Trnova]]\n* [[Akma\u010di\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Ugljevik municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|24,178\n|24,540\n|17,830\n|15,710\n|-\n|1\n|Atma\u010di\u0107i\n|\n|\n|566\n|429\n|-\n|2\n|Bogutovo Selo\n|\n|\n|499\n|294\n|-\n|3\n|Donja Trnova\n|\n|\n|1,491\n|1,154\n|-\n|4\n|Glinje\n|\n|\n|648\n|461\n|-\n|5\n|Gornja Trnova\n|\n|\n|420\n|284\n|-\n|6\n|Janjari\n|\n|\n|651\n|497\n|-\n|7\n|Korenita\n|\n|\n|840\n|557\n|-\n|8\n|Male\u0161evci\n|\n|\n|602\n|404\n|-\n|9\n|Mezgraja\n|\n|\n|714\n|459\n|-\n|10\n|Mukat Stankovi\u0107i\n|\n|\n|458\n|330\n|-\n|11\n|Ravno Polje\n|\n|\n|466\n|598\n|-\n|12\n|Srednja Trnova\n|\n|\n|721\n|579\n|-\n|13\n|Stari Ugljevik\n|\n|\n|1,126\n|707\n|-\n|14\n|Tutnjevac\n|\n|\n|1,489\n|1,042\n|-\n|15\n|Ugljevi\u010dka Obrije\u017e\n|\n|\n|934\n|945\n|-\n|16\n|'''Ugljevik'''\n|2,388\n|2,442\n|2,981\n|4,155\n|-\n|17\n|Ugljevik Selo\n|\n|\n|693\n|478\n|-\n|18\n|Zabr\u0111e\n|\n|\n|1,725\n|1,551\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Ugljevik town\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|4,155 (100,0%)\n|2,981 (100,0%)\n|2,442 (100,0%)\n|2,388 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|2,426 (81,38%)\n|2,210 (90,50%)\n|2,256 (94,47%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|348 (11,67%)\n|66 (2,703%)\n|86 (3,601%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|133 (4,462%)\n|143 (5,856%)\n|15 (0,628%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|39 (1,308%)\n|3 (0,123%)\n|15 (0,628%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|35 (1,174%)\n|16 (0,655%)\n|5 (0,209%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|4 (0,164%)\n|6 (0,251%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|\n|4 (0,168%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|\n|1 (0,042%)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Ugljevik municipality\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|15,710 (100,0%)\n|25,587 (100,0%)\n|24,540 (100,0%)\n|24,178 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|13,412 (85,37%)\n|14,468 (56,54%)\n|14,066 (57,32%)\n|14,816 (61,28%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|2,186 (13,91%)\n|10,241 (40,02%)\n|9,403 (38,32%)\n|8,859 (36,64%)\n|-\n|Others\n|70 (0,446%)\n|532 (2,079%)\n|81 (0,330%)\n|58 (0,240%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|42 (0,267%)\n|56 (0,219%)\n|17 (0,069%)\n|53 (0,219%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|290 (1,133%)\n|573 (2,335%)\n|35 (0,145%)\n|-\n|Roma\n|\n|\n|376 (1,532%)\n|328 (1,357%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|9 (0,037%)\n|13 (0,054%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|7 (0,029%)\n|12 (0,050%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|4 (0,016%)\n|3 (0,012%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|3 (0,012%)\n|\n|-\n|Hungarians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,004%)\n|1 (0,004%)\n|}\n[[File:Panoramicviewofugljevik.JPG|546x546px|thumb|left|Panoramic view of Ugljevik from one of nearby hills, cave also visible]]\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Centar za kulturu Filip Visnjic Ugljevik.JPG|thumb|334x334px|left|Building of Cultural center \"Filip Vi\u0161nji\u0107\".]]\nCulture in these parts is gaining momentum. Numerous cultural events are presented at the Cultural Center.\n''Cultural Club Rudar'' was founded in 1976 and in the composition of the club work: folk dance ensemble, drama and recitation section, original (authentic) creative work, folk music orchestra. With its good programme the Club takes part in all important manifestations in the municipality and economy collectives and they also often had their performances in other municipalities.\n\nBuilding of ''Cultural Center \u201cFilip Vi\u0161nji\u0107\u201d'' was opened in 2006, and it is replica of Mine Head Office (\u201e''Direkcija''\u201c building) in Stari Ugljevik. Original building was built in 1921, but due to removal of Ugljevik on new location it was abandoned. New building is a center of rich cultural life in municipality and region.\n\n== Religion ==\nReligion assumed its traditional place in the last decade among the lives of the local populace. In addition to the existing churches in Zabrdje, Tutnjevac, Stari Ugljevik, which all shared the fate of their faithful, new [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] are being built. The most impressive one is in Ugljevik, dedicated to the protesters of Ugljevik and the Municipality, [[Parascheva of the Balkans|Holy Mother Paraskeva]]. The church was built in the traditional [[Serbian Orthodox Church#Serbo-Byzantine Style|Serbian-Byzantine]] Church style, and dominates the town.\n\n[[Mosque]]s are also being rebuilt, after the war, in villages (Janjari, Atma\u010di\u0107i, Glinje, Srednja Trnova).\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:Srednja skola Mihailo Petrovic Alas Ugljevik.jpg|thumb|200px|\"[[Mihailo Petrovi\u0107 Alas]]\" High School.]]\nEducation has a long  tradition in the Municipality of Ugljevik. An elementary school was founded in Zabrdje in 1875. The town was at the time the largest settlement in this part of Majevica, since it was located on the [[Bijeljina]]-[[Tuzla]] road. In the year of 1995 town marked the 120th anniversary of its school, making Zabrdje, one of privileged communities of [[Majevica]] and [[Semberija]] to have their own school for quite some time.\n\nThe second school to open in these parts began lesson in 1890 in Korenita. It was followed two years later by the opening of a school in Ugljevik. After the [[Second World War]], village schools appeared in other Ugljevik communities&mdash;Tutnjevac, Malesevci, Trnova, Mezgraja, Bogutovo Selo, Ugljevicka Obrijez and other communities. All school-age children attend classes. School building are modern and well equipped, with an adequate number of teachers ensuring a high standard of education. Two thousand pupils attend Ugljevik Municipality schools each year.\n\nUgljevik also has a Secondary School training future energy technicians, covering the trades needed most by the Ugljevik Termoelektrana (Power Plant). Despite a number of Ugljevik students attending school in [[Bijeljina]] secondary schools, and vice versa, Ugljevik still has 600 students.\n\n== Natural environment ==\nThe Ugljevik region includes the now evaporated [[Pannonian Sea]]. It had once reached above New Ugljevik, its waves cutting into the mountainside above the school complex where fossilised traces of aquatic flora and fauna are visible. Above Old Ugljevik lie the Medieval remains of the fortress Jablangrad. From its cliffs, reaching to {{convert|451|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], can be had views of the flatlands of [[Semberija]], while beyond, across the [[Drina]], are discernible [[Ma\u010dva]] and Mount [[Cer (mountain)|Cer]].\nUdrigovo Peak, where a radio-TV relay tower was built after the war, rises above the Ugljevik region. Udrigovo is known for its thick [[oak]] stands.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\nMajevica's hills have a number of forests, with the [[Quercus robur|black oak]] being well-known in Udrigovo.{{fact|date=May 2017}} Plans are being made to protect the forests and natural environment of the region and the Nature Reserves in Bogutovo Selo and Lazarevici, while maintaining lumber production.{{fact|date=May 2017}} These are also the conditions necessary to the development of recreation and various forms of tourism in the region.{{or-inline|date=May 2017}} This should be kept in mind when planning to expand surface coal exploitation or build new roads.{{or-inline|date=May 2017}} Forest of [[sessile oak]], black oak and other varieties can be found at Bogutovo Selo, Korenita and Lazarevic, as elsewhere.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Hotel Energetik Ugljevik.jpg|thumb|150px|right|\"Energetik\" Hotel]]\nThe village of Kr\u0107ina, in the direction of [[Zvornik]], has great potential for the development of village [[tourism]],{{fact|date=March 2019}} it being located in natural surroundings and possessing a cave nearby known by the local population as the cave of the epic hero ''Starina Novak''.
