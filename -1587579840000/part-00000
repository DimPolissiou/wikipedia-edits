In the morning of 14 May, ''Aurore'' put to sail for her first trials, watched by the numerous officials, the guarrison and a large crowd. She was deemed a successful vessel, and in the next days her 24-man crew started training and getting accustomed to the ship, while the scientists started calibrating their instruments in a laboratory on the set up on the port.<ref name=Delacroix9 /> Along with his chronometer, Le Roy brought a second prototype, which he did not initially enter in the competition, as its had not been fully tested yet.<ref name=Delacroix9 />\n\nOn 21 May, ''Aurore'' attempted the first leg of her journey, bound for Calais, but a gale forced her to return to Le Havre and wait several days for more clement weather. On 25 May, she departed again, reaching Calais the next morning through bad weather that left the passengers and the crew shaken. The weather taking another turn for the worse, ''Aurore'' remained in Calais for several days. On 6 June, in the early morning, she departed for Dunkirk, where she arrived in the late afternoon, threatened by yet another storm.<ref name=Delacroix10 /> On 13, the passengers were able to go ashore in a boat, enabling measurements to be made on the ground. ''Aurore'' departed Dunkirk on 20, and arrived in Rotterdam during the night. Again, the watches were sent ashore for precise measurements, and Courtanvaux left to visit the Netherland.

''Aurore'' was trapped by unfavourable winds that had prevented navigation for a week, and in the night of 6 July, she attempted to seize a passing opportunity to depart; however, a man went overboard, to be saved in the nick of time by a fellow sailor, then ''Aurore'' collided with a Dutch merchantman, and eventually the wind pushed her to the shore. She then aborted her attempt, and returned to port. She finally left on 8 July, arriving in Amsterdam on 11 after sustaining such bad weather that her guns would touch the water and that Le Roy measured a 25\u00b0 list. At Amsterdam, she was rejoined by Courtanvaux, and the scientific staff went ashore again to test their instruments and take precise measurements. <ref name=Delacroix11 />\n\nOn 22 July, ''Aurore'' departed Amsterdam, bound for [[Den Helder]], while Courtanvaux pursued his touristic endeavours ashore. They met again at Texel on 25, where ''Aurore'' was again trapped by bad weather until 3 August. In the night of 4 August, she observed an [[aurora]], and in the afternoon of 6 August, she arrived at Boulogne. In the evening, the scientists attempted to disembark on boats, but a sudden gale forced ''Aurore'' to return out at sea. She eventually entered Boulogne harbour the next day.

Originally released on May 5, 1992 for [[DOS]], it was inspired by the 1981 [[Muse Software]] video game ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', and is the third installment in the ''[[Wolfenstein]]'' series. In ''Wolfenstein 3D'', the player [[player character|assumes the role]] of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] spy [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]] during [[World War II]] as he escapes from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses each of the game's [[level (video gaming)|levels]] to find an elevator to the next level or kill a [[boss (video gaming)|final boss]], fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with knives and a variety of guns.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the second major release by id Software, after the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer [[John Carmack]] experimented with making a fast 3D [[game engine]] by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single [[plane (geometry)|plane]], producing ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]'' as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly ''Keen'' to a more violent theme, programmer [[John Romero]] suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter ''Castle Wolfenstein'' as a fast-paced action game. He and designer [[Tom Hall]] designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' features artwork by [[Adrian Carmack]] and sound effects and music by [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]]. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the [[shareware]] model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was a critical and commercial success and widely considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made. Garnering numerous awards and selling over 200,000 copies by the end of 1993. It has been termed the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\", and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the [[Wolfenstein (series)|''Wolfenstein'' series]] have been developed by other companies since 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Wolf3d pc.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of the DOS version, showing the player character firing a submachine gun at guards|alt=A submachine gun firing at a falling brown-uniformed Nazi, while a second Nazi aims a pistol at the viewer]]\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with rudimentary [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> The game is broken up into [[level (video gaming)|levels]], each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> Each level is themed after [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> Levels\u2014ten in the original episodes\u2014are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and [[health (gaming)|health]]. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire [[chain gun]].<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nThe player's health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one [[life (gaming)|life]] and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its [[porting|ports]] the player can only save between levels.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/><ref name=\"HG101\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is divided into two sets of three episodes: \"Escape from Castle Wolfenstein\", \"Operation: Eisenfaust\", and \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled ''The Nocturnal Missions'' including \"A Dark Secret\", \"Trail of the Madman\", and \"Confrontation\". The protagonist is [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], an American spy of [[Polish Americans|Polish descent]], and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In \"Escape\", Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. \"Operation: Eisenfaust\" follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of [[undead]] mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" he infiltrates a [[F\u00fchrerbunker|bunker]] under the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], culminating in a battle with [[Adolf Hitler]] in a [[powered exoskeleton|robotic suit]] equipped with four [[chain gun]]s.\n\n''The Nocturnal Missions'' form a [[prequel]] storyline dealing with German plans for [[chemical warfare]]. \"A Dark Secret\" deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. \"Trail of the Madman\" takes place in Castle [[Erlangen]], where Blazkowicz's goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in \"Confrontation\", which is set in Castle [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]] as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.\n\nAn additional episode, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a retail game by [[FormGen]]. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] from the Nazis after it was stolen from [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to [[German nuclear weapon project|build a nuclear weapon]] or [[evocation|summon demons]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Simple raycasting with fisheye correction.gif|thumb|300px|right|A simple [[ray casting]] rendering similar to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine. The red dot is the player's location. The orange area represents the player's [[field of view]].|alt=A rotating view of a complex 3D area, with an overhead view on the right showing the raycasting area as the view rotates]]\nIn October\u2013December 1990, a team of employees from programming studio [[Softdisk]] calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game ''[[Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons]]'', the first game in the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] developing games for the ''Gamer's Edge'' video game subscription service and [[disk magazine]], was composed of programmers [[John Romero]] and [[John Carmack]], designer [[Tom Hall]], artist [[Adrian Carmack]], and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December through [[shareware]] publisher [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game\u2014the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends\u2014the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for ''Gamer's Edge'', one every two months.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/>\n\nIdeas from the Deep, now formally established as [[id Software]], used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games.<ref name=\"IGNid\"/> Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with [[3D computer graphics]], which until then was largely the purview of [[amateur flight simulation|flight simulation games]] such as ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' (1990). Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of [[personal computer]]s of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast [[action game]] in 3D due to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|number of surfaces]] it needed to calculate, but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/><ref name=\"AM386\"/> During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through [[ray casting]], in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D [[game engine]] that used animated 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'', in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD6676\"/> In the fall of 1991, after the team\u2014sans Wilbur\u2014had relocated to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and he had largely finished the engine work for ''[[Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy]]'', Carmack decided to implement a feature from ''[[Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss]]'', a [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] in development by [[Looking Glass Studios|Blue Sky Productions]].<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> ''Ultima Underworld'' was planned to display [[texture mapping|texture-mapped]] 3D graphics without ''Hovertank''{{'}}s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/><ref name=\"UU\"/><ref name=\"UU2\"/> Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as ''Underworld'' was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from ''Hovertank 3D'' for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]''.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> Upon seeing it, [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/>\n\n[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]\nIn November 1991, with the second ''Commander Keen'' trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially wanted to do a third ''Keen'' trilogy, recognized that Carmack's programming focus had shifted from the 2D [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, \"It's Green and Pissed\", Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]''. The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack's 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of ''Keen'' into something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a \"loud\" and \"cool\" fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay.<ref name=\"RomeroComm\"/> He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company's designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nInitially the team believed that they would be unable to use the ''Wolfenstein'' name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> They contacted ''Castle Wolfenstein'' developer [[Silas Warner]], but learned that [[Muse Software]] and successor companies no longer existed and the trademark had lapsed by 1986.<ref name=\"DawnFPS\"/> The copyrights last belonged to someone in [[Michigan]], and the team was able to purchase them.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Thus they were free to use the name ''Wolfenstein 3D''.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he guaranteed id a US$100,000 payment on the project.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail ''Wolfenstein'' project to [[FormGen]], which had published id's December 1991 ''[[Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter]]'', overcoming the publisher's concerns over ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/>\n\n[[File:John Carmack E3 2006.jpg|thumb|[[John Carmack]] in 2006|alt=Black and white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses]]\nThe project officially began on December 15, 1991.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics; Romero wanted the goal to be \"to mow down Nazis\", with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] soldiers and Hitler himself, as well as dogs, blood \"like you never see in games\", and straightforward, lethal weapons. He also composed the general storyline for the game.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagDev\"/> Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> He also did sketches for the bosses and the title screen.<ref name=\"Gamasutra-CKTech\"/> He programmed \"the core\" of the game's engine in a month; he added a few features to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'', including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/><ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The game was programmed in [[ANSI C]] and [[assembly language]].<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> The graphics for the game were planned to be in 16 color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], but were changed to 256 color [[VGA]] four months before release.<ref name=\"GSMillerInt\"/> Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack using [[Electronic Arts]]'s ''[[Deluxe Paint|Deluxe Paint II]]''.<ref name=\"Gamasutra3DDesign\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-BitTech\"/><ref name=\"DeluxePaintII\"/> Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures, but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game.<ref name=\"GamasutraWalls\"/> The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and paid homage with a hidden ''Pac-Man'' level.<ref name=\"Pacman\"/> The team was going to include some anti-facist references and Nazi atrocities, but left them out to avoid controversies.<ref name=\"WaysideIdeas\"/> They ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by ''Keen'' composer [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]] to make the guns sound exciting.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> With the aid of a 16-bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder, Bobby Prince composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] sounds. The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies.<ref name=\"SFXGamasutra\"/> Some of the enemy shouts were based off the original Castle Wolfenstein game.<ref name=\"DawnFPS\"/>\n\nAs development continued, id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison [[Kevin Cloud]] as an assistant artist, and moved the company out to [[Mesquite, Texas]], near where Apogee was located.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their [[royalty payment|royalty]] rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ''ScubaVenture'', so that id could focus on ''Wolfenstein''. The game was intended to be released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> The level maps were designed in 2D using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which had been used for the entire ''Keen'' series as well as several other games.<ref name=\"TE5GameUltra\"/> Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/>\n\nAs the game neared completion, FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode. The team also added \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\", the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. The team did a month of playtesting in the final stage of the game's development.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to [[bulletin board system]]s. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/>\n\nThe following summer, most of the id Software team developed ''Spear of Destiny'', except John Carmack, who instead experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for ''[[Shadowcaster]]'' and became the basis of the ''Doom'' engine.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/> The one episode of ''Spear of Destiny'' was a prequel to ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and used the same engine, but added some new audio, graphics, and enemies. It took two months to create, and was published commercially by FormGen in September 1992.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/><ref name=\"SOD-Romero\"/><ref name=\"SOD-5YearsDoom\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as ''Wolfenstein 3D'', though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled ''The Nocturnal Missions''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game.<ref name=\"TUH\"/> In 1993 Apogee also published the ''Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades'' pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called \"WolfMaster\", along with a map editor titled \"MapEdit\" and a random level generator named \"Wolf Creator\".<ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"SuperWolfUpgrade\"/> A retail ''Wolfenstein'' episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each the same length as ''Spear of Destiny'', in May 1994, and later that year published ''Spear of Destiny'' and the two mission packs together as the ''Spear of Destiny Super CD Package''. Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through [[GT Interactive|GT Software]] in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through [[Activision]] in 1998.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/>\n\nThere were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release, both of which were cancelled. A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading \"Call Apogee and say [[Aardwolf]]\" (\"Snapity\" in beta versions)<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/>; it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize (consisting of US$1,000 or a line of Apogee games for life),<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/> but the quick creation of level editors and [[cheating in video games|cheat]] programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea. Additionally, after completing an episode the player is given a three-letter code in addition to their total score and time. This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high-score contest, but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced.<ref name=\"Aardwolf\"/>\n\n[[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]] commissioned id to port the game to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) for a US$100,000 advance. The team was busy with the [[development of Doom|development of ''Doom'']], and ignored the project for seven or eight months, finally hiring [[Rebecca Heineman]] to do the work.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/><ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"RomeroGDC\"/> They made no progress on the port, however, and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March 1993.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> This version made use of [[binary space partitioning]] rather than raycasting in order to give it speed.<ref name=\"scarydarkfast43-44\"/> [[Nintendo]] insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies; this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it, removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips, and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagPlay\"/><ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> The port was released in Japan on February 10, 1994 under the name ''Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust'' before being released in North America and Europe later that year.<ref name=\"WolfenJP\"/> Using the source code of the SNES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the [[Atari Jaguar]]. [[Atari Corporation]] approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]], improving the port's graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version. He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/>\n\nSince its initial release, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been ported to numerous other platforms as well.<ref name=\"GameFan2-6\"/> In 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology licensed ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and converted it into a [[virtual reality]] arcade game.<ref name=\"VR-Wolf3D\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-AVT\"/> The 1994 Acorn Archimedes port was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-RISC\"/><ref name=\"wolfencorn\"/> By 1994, a port for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] was under development by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]], who intended to release it by September, but it was cancelled due to technical problems.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-MDrive\"/> The 1994 [[Classic Mac OS]] version of the game had three releases: ''The First Encounter'', a shareware release; ''The Second Encounter'', with 30 exclusive levels; and ''The Third Encounter'', with all 60 levels from the DOS version.<ref name=\"MacWolf\"/> An [[Atari Lynx]] version of the game was offered earlier by Atari for id, but work on the port was never started.<ref name=\"LynxEGM\"/><ref name=\"LynxPodcast\"/> A [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] version was released in October 1995.<ref name=\"wolfen3do\"/><ref name=\"WolfenJP3DO\"/> The Apple IIGS port had been in development since Fall 1994 by Rebecca Heineman under the Vitesse company, but due to licensing problems.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GSII\"/> Ninjaforce Entertainment took over the project, but were having difficulties making satisfactory graphics on a limited color palette, although they managed to include authentic German voices.<ref name=\"NinjaForce\"/> The game was not released until four years later and published by Logicware.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GSII\"/> An open source [[iOS]] port  programmed by Carmack himself was released in 2009.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-iOS\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-OpenSource\"/> An unofficial port for the [[Game Boy Color]] was made in 2016.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GBC\"/> The Android port was titled \"Wolfenstein 3D Touch\" and published by Beloko Games.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Android\"/> Other releases include the [[Game Boy Advance]] (2002), [[Xbox Live Arcade]], and [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\"wolfengba\"/><ref name=\"wolfenxbla\"/><ref name=\"wolfenpsn\"/> These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes ''Spear of Destiny'', and a 2007 [[Steam (software)|Steam]] release for PC, macOS, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes.<ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"wolfensteam\"/> [[Bethesda Softworks]], whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of ''Wolfenstein 3D''{{'}}s release by producing a free-to-play [[browser game|browser-based]] version of the game in 2012.<ref name=\"wolfenbrowse\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nId had no clear expectations for ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> ''[[PC Zone]]'' quoted a shareware distributor as saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the top shareware seller of 1992.<ref name=\"PCZ\"/> The game was selling at a rate of 4000 copies a month by mail order.<ref name=\"PrimaGames\"/> By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' as well as ''Spear of Destiny'' had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id sold another 150,000 retail copies as ''Spear of Destiny''; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|banned from sale in Germany]] due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] in 1994, and again in 1997 for ''Spear of Destiny''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraBPS\"/> Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the game five months after release, describing it as: \"View from the character's point of view: It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play, and it runs well ... This is the only game of its type.\"<ref name=\"Famitsu\"/> The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier ''Commander Keen'' series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where ''Commander Keen'' games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' averaged $200,000 per month for the first year and a half.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' won the 1992 Best Arcade game award from ''[[Compute!]]'', the 1992 Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'', the 1992 Reader's Choice&nbsp;\u2014 Action/Arcade Game award from ''Game Bytes'', the 1993 Best Action/Arcade Game, Best Entertainment Software, and People's Choice awards at the [[Shareware Industry Awards]], the 1993 Best Action Game award from ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and a [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] from the [[Software Publishers Association]] for Best Action/Arcade Game.<ref name=\"SIAaward\"/><ref name=\"scarydarkfast11\"/><ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"CGW106\"/><ref name=\"CGW111\"/> It was the first shareware title to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) became the smallest company to ever receive the award. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was noted as one of the top games of the year at the 1993 [[Game Developers Conference]].<ref name=\"CGW108\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was well received by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the \"sparse [but] gorgeous\", \"frighteningly realistic\", and \"extremely violent\" graphics, as well as the immersive sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned \"those sensitive to such things to stay home\". Lombardi concluded that ''Wolfenstein 3D'', alongside ''Ultima Underworld'' released two months prior, was \"the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief\u2013suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment\", stating that they knew of no other game that could \"evoke such intense psychological responses from its players\".<ref name=\"CGW98\"/> ''Wolfenstein'' twice received 5 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it \"definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC\", highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the \"fast-paced action\" could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> [[Sandy Petersen]], in the first \"Eye of the Monitor\" column, claimed that \"there is nothing else quite like ''Wolfenstein''\" and that it had \"evolved almost beyond recognition\" from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it \"a fun game with lots of action\" and \"a fun, fairly mindless romp\", though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The ''Spear of Destiny'' retail episode was also rated highly by ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes.<ref name=\"CGW102\"/> Formgen's ''Spear of Destiny'' mission packs \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\" were reviewed by Paul Hyman of ''Computer Gaming World'', who praised the updated graphical details and sound, as well as the smooth gameplay, but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game.<ref name=\"SODPack-CGWreview\"/>\n\nThe early ports of the game also received high reviews, though their sales have been described as \"dismal\".<ref name=\"NGen11\"/> The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential.<ref name=\"EGMSNESreview\"/> The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play.<ref name=\"EGMJAGreview\"/> A ''[[GamePro]]'' review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' \"set a new standard for PC gaming\" and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities.<ref name=\"GPJAGreview\"/> A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic, terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games.<ref name=\"NGjag\"/> Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild, stating that \"there isn't a staggering amount of freshness here, but the action is fast, deadly, and (surprise) addictive\".<ref name=\"NGmac\"/> Major Mike of ''GamePro'' commended the 3DO version's complete absence of [[pixelation]], fast scaling, \"rousing\" music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, \"still packs a punch as a first-person shooter\".<ref name=\"GP3DOreview\"/> ''Wolfenstein 3D'' won ''GamePro''{{'}}s Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed ''[[The Need for Speed]]'' and ''[[D (video game)|D]]''.<ref name=\"3DOaward\"/> ''Maximum'', on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' and the PlayStation version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' that a new port was pointless, with the game now \"somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive\".<ref name=\"MAX3DOreview\"/> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' asserted that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was \"still as [[video game addiction|addictive]] as it ever was\" but essentially agreed with ''Maximum'', contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or \"moved on\" to more advanced games in the genre.<ref name=\"NGen12\"/> More modern reviews include one for the [[Xbox 360]] port in 2009 by Ryan McCaffrey of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'', who heavily criticized it for non-existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]], who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was \"dated and flawed\", it was \"required playing for any first-person shooter fan\".<ref name=\"XboxMag99\"/><ref name=\"IGNPSNreview\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\",<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"AGGreview\"/><ref name=\"IGN100\"/><ref name=\"WIREDretro\"/> Although some prior computer shooting-based games existed, they were generally [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooters]], while ''Wolfenstein 3D'' helped move the market towards first-person shooters. It has also been attributed with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time;<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> ''VideoGames & Computer Entertainment'' claimed in September 1992 that the game \"justified the existence of shareware\", and in July 1993 ''Computer Gaming World'' claimed that it \"almost single-handedly\" demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing, leading to a wave of other shareware first-person shooters.<ref name=\"CGW108\"/><ref name=\"VGCE\"/><ref name=\"DSretro\"/> The game's high revenue compared to prior, smaller 2D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger, 3D titles built by larger development teams.<ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\nDuring development, id approached [[Sierra Entertainment]], then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing ''Commander Keen'' and an early version of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', CEO [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, ''Doom'', the success of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' declared ''Wolfenstein 3-D'' the 97th-best computer game ever released.<ref name=\"cgw150\"/>\n\nThe game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' section 86a]] up through 2018. Section 86a had \"social adequacy\" allowances for works of art, but in 1998, a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within ''Wolfenstein 3D'' determined that video games did not fall under this allowance. The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences, \"this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them, which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas\".<ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> Up through 2018, the Germany software ratings board, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery, effectively banning the game for sale within the country. However, in August 2018, the decision was reversed by the German government, having determined that the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings, and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance.<ref name=\"GermanBanReversed\"/><ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> In November 2019, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was formally struck from the \"Index\", the list of games banned from sale in Germany.<ref name=\"Wolf3dGermanyok\"/>\n\nAfter the game's release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the ''Commander Keen'' engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine or derivatives of it include ''[[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold|Blake Stone]]'', the [[Capstone Software]] games ''[[Corridor 7: Alien Invasion|Corridor 7]]'' and ''[[Operation Body Count]]'', as well as ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINEbs\"/><ref name=\"ENGINEna\"/> Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled ''Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II'', designed by Tom Hall using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINErott\"/> Additionally, Softdisk produced ''Catacomb Abyss'' using the prototype ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'' as part of the ''[[Catacomb 3-D#Catacomb Adventure Series|Catacomb Adventure Series]]'' trilogy of sequels.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ Softdisk\"/> Although ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> The modding efforts of ''Wolfenstein'' players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like ''Doom'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD166\"/><ref name=\"OW\"/> The source code for the original ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/> The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as ''[[Ken's Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Nitemare 3D]]'', ''[[The Terminator: Rampage]]'', ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Terminal Terror|Terminal Terror]]'' and ''[[The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki]]'', among others.<ref name=\"ROTThistory\"/>\n\nAlthough id Software did not develop another ''Wolfenstein'' game, as their development focus shifted to ''Doom'' shortly after release,<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> and has never returned to the series, multiple ''Wolfenstein'' titles have been produced by other companies, sometimes using game engines developed by id. The first of these newer ''Wolfenstein'' games was ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' in 2001, a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, and the latest titles are the 2019 games ''[[Wolfenstein: Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot]]''.<ref name=\"RTCW\"/><ref name=\"WTNC\"/>\n\n==References==\n;References\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- GAMEPLAY -->\n\n<ref name=\"HG101\">{{Cite

Originally released on May 5, 1992 for [[DOS]], it was inspired by the 1981 [[Muse Software]] video game ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', and is the third installment in the ''[[Wolfenstein]]'' series. In ''Wolfenstein 3D'', the player [[player character|assumes the role]] of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] spy [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]] during [[World War II]] as he escapes from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses each of the game's [[level (video gaming)|levels]] to find an elevator to the next level or kill a [[boss (video gaming)|final boss]], fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with knives and a variety of guns.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the second major release by id Software, after the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer [[John Carmack]] experimented with making a fast 3D [[game engine]] by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single [[plane (geometry)|plane]], producing ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]'' as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly ''Keen'' to a more violent theme, programmer [[John Romero]] suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter ''Castle Wolfenstein'' as a fast-paced action game. He and designer [[Tom Hall]] designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' features artwork by [[Adrian Carmack]] and sound effects and music by [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]]. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the [[shareware]] model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was a critical and commercial success and widely considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made. Garnering numerous awards and selling over 200,000 copies by the end of 1993. It has been termed the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\", and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the [[Wolfenstein (series)|''Wolfenstein'' series]] have been developed by other companies since 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Wolf3d pc.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of the DOS version, showing the player character firing a submachine gun at guards|alt=A submachine gun firing at a falling brown-uniformed Nazi, while a second Nazi aims a pistol at the viewer]]\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with rudimentary [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> The game is broken up into [[level (video gaming)|levels]], each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/> Each level is themed after [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> Levels\u2014ten in the original episodes\u2014are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and [[health (gaming)|health]]. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire [[chain gun]].<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nThe player's health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one [[life (gaming)|life]] and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its [[porting|ports]] the player can only save between levels.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/><ref name=\"HG101\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is divided into two sets of three episodes: \"Escape from Castle Wolfenstein\", \"Operation: Eisenfaust\", and \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled ''The Nocturnal Missions'' including \"A Dark Secret\", \"Trail of the Madman\", and \"Confrontation\". The protagonist is [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], an American spy of [[Polish Americans|Polish descent]], and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In \"Escape\", Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. \"Operation: Eisenfaust\" follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of [[undead]] mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in \"Die, F\u00fchrer, Die!\" he infiltrates a [[F\u00fchrerbunker|bunker]] under the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], culminating in a battle with [[Adolf Hitler]] in a [[powered exoskeleton|robotic suit]] equipped with four [[chain gun]]s.\n\n''The Nocturnal Missions'' form a [[prequel]] storyline dealing with German plans for [[chemical warfare]]. \"A Dark Secret\" deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. \"Trail of the Madman\" takes place in Castle [[Erlangen]], where Blazkowicz's goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in \"Confrontation\", which is set in Castle [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]] as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.\n\nAn additional episode, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a retail game by [[FormGen]]. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] from the Nazis after it was stolen from [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to [[German nuclear weapon project|build a nuclear weapon]] or [[evocation|summon demons]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Simple raycasting with fisheye correction.gif|thumb|300px|right|A simple [[ray casting]] rendering similar to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine.

The group, who worked at Softdisk in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] developing games for the ''Gamer's Edge'' video game subscription service and [[disk magazine]], was composed of programmers [[John Romero]] and [[John Carmack]], designer [[Tom Hall]], artist [[Adrian Carmack]], and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December through [[shareware]] publisher [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game\u2014the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends\u2014the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for ''Gamer's Edge'', one every two months.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/>\n\nIdeas from the Deep, now formally established as [[id Software]], used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games.<ref name=\"IGNid\"/> Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with [[3D computer graphics]], which until then was largely the purview of [[amateur flight simulation|flight simulation games]] such as ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' (1990). Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of [[personal computer]]s of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast [[action game]] in 3D due to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|number of surfaces]] it needed to calculate, but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible.<ref name=\"MOD6676\"/><ref name=\"AM386\"/> During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through [[ray casting]], in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D [[game engine]] that used animated 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'', in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD6676\"/> In the fall of 1991, after the team\u2014sans Wilbur\u2014had relocated to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and he had largely finished the engine work for ''[[Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy]]'', Carmack decided to implement a feature from ''[[Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss]]'', a [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] in development by [[Looking Glass Studios|Blue Sky Productions]].<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> ''Ultima Underworld'' was planned to display [[texture mapping|texture-mapped]] 3D graphics without ''Hovertank''{{'}}s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/><ref name=\"UU\"/><ref name=\"UU2\"/> Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as ''Underworld'' was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from ''Hovertank 3D'' for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]''.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> Upon seeing it, [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/>\n\n[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]\nIn November 1991, with the second ''Commander Keen'' trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially wanted to do a third ''Keen'' trilogy, recognized that Carmack's programming focus had shifted from the 2D [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, \"It's Green and Pissed\", Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]''. The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack's 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of ''Keen'' into something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a \"loud\" and \"cool\" fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay.<ref name=\"RomeroComm\"/> He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company's designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.<ref name=\"MOD8793\"/>\n\nInitially the team believed that they would be unable to use the ''Wolfenstein'' name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> They contacted ''Castle Wolfenstein'' developer [[Silas Warner]], but learned that [[Muse Software]] and successor companies no longer existed and the trademark had lapsed by 1986.<ref name=\"DawnFPS\"/> The copyrights last belonged to someone in [[Michigan]], and the team was able to purchase them.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Thus they were free to use the name ''Wolfenstein 3D''.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he guaranteed id a US$100,000 payment on the project.<ref name=\"MOD7786\"/> [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail ''Wolfenstein'' project to [[FormGen]], which had published id's December 1991 ''[[Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter]]'', overcoming the publisher's concerns over ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/>\n\n[[File:John Carmack E3 2006.jpg|thumb|[[John Carmack]] in 2006|alt=Black and white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses]]\nThe project officially began on December 15, 1991.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics; Romero wanted the goal to be \"to mow down Nazis\", with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] soldiers and Hitler himself, as well as dogs, blood \"like you never see in games\", and straightforward, lethal weapons. He also composed the general storyline for the game.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagDev\"/> Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> He also did sketches for the bosses and the title screen.<ref name=\"Gamasutra-CKTech\"/> He programmed \"the core\" of the game's engine in a month; he added a few features to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'', including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/><ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The game was programmed in [[ANSI C]] and [[assembly language]].<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> The graphics for the game were planned to be in 16 color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], but were changed to 256 color [[VGA]] four months before release.<ref name=\"GSMillerInt\"/> Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack using [[Electronic Arts]]'s ''[[Deluxe Paint|Deluxe Paint II]]''.<ref name=\"Gamasutra3DDesign\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-BitTech\"/><ref name=\"DeluxePaintII\"/> Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures, but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game.<ref name=\"GamasutraWalls\"/> The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and paid homage with a hidden ''Pac-Man'' level.<ref name=\"Pacman\"/> The team was going to include some anti-facist references and Nazi atrocities, but left them out to avoid controversies.<ref name=\"WaysideIdeas\"/> They ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by ''Keen'' composer [[Robert Prince (video game composer)|Bobby Prince]] to make the guns sound exciting.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> With the aid of a 16-bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder, Bobby Prince composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] sounds. The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies.<ref name=\"SFXGamasutra\"/> Some of the enemy shouts were based off the original Castle Wolfenstein game.<ref name=\"DawnFPS\"/>\n\nAs development continued, id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison [[Kevin Cloud]] as an assistant artist, and moved the company out to [[Mesquite, Texas]], near where Apogee was located.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their [[royalty payment|royalty]] rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ''ScubaVenture'', so that id could focus on ''Wolfenstein''. The game was intended to be released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> The level maps were designed in 2D using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which had been used for the entire ''Keen'' series as well as several other games.<ref name=\"TE5GameUltra\"/> Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD105112\"/> Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.<ref name=\"MOD105112\"/>\n\nAs the game neared completion, FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode. The team also added \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\", the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. The team did a month of playtesting in the final stage of the game's development.<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/> In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to [[bulletin board system]]s. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/>\n\nThe following summer, most of the id Software team developed ''Spear of Destiny'', except John Carmack, who instead experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for ''[[Shadowcaster]]'' and became the basis of the ''Doom'' engine.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/> The one episode of ''Spear of Destiny'' was a prequel to ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and used the same engine, but added some new audio, graphics, and enemies. It took two months to create, and was published commercially by FormGen in September 1992.<ref name=\"SOD-Doom\"/><ref name=\"SOD-Romero\"/><ref name=\"SOD-5YearsDoom\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as ''Wolfenstein 3D'', though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled ''The Nocturnal Missions''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game.<ref name=\"TUH\"/> In 1993 Apogee also published the ''Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades'' pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called \"WolfMaster\", along with a map editor titled \"MapEdit\" and a random level generator named \"Wolf Creator\".<ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"SuperWolfUpgrade\"/> A retail ''Wolfenstein'' episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\", each the same length as ''Spear of Destiny'', in May 1994, and later that year published ''Spear of Destiny'' and the two mission packs together as the ''Spear of Destiny Super CD Package''. Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through [[GT Interactive|GT Software]] in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through [[Activision]] in 1998.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/>\n\nThere were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release, both of which were cancelled. A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading \"Call Apogee and say [[Aardwolf]]\" (\"Snapity\" in beta versions)<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/>; it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize (consisting of US$1,000 or a line of Apogee games for life),<ref name=\"IDInterview\"/><ref name=\"JoeSigCall\"/> but the quick creation of level editors and [[cheating in video games|cheat]] programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea. Additionally, after completing an episode the player is given a three-letter code in addition to their total score and time. This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high-score contest, but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced.<ref name=\"Aardwolf\"/>\n\n[[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]] commissioned id to port the game to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) for a US$100,000 advance. The team was busy with the [[development of Doom|development of ''Doom'']], and ignored the project for seven or eight months, finally hiring [[Rebecca Heineman]] to do the work.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/><ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"RomeroGDC\"/> They made no progress on the port, however, and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March 1993.<ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> This version made use of [[binary space partitioning]] rather than raycasting in order to give it speed.<ref name=\"scarydarkfast43-44\"/> [[Nintendo]] insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies; this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it, removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips, and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-JagPlay\"/><ref name=\"wolf3d-Terraform\"/> The port was released in Japan on February 10, 1994 under the name ''Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust'' before being released in North America and Europe later that year.<ref name=\"WolfenJP\"/> Using the source code of the SNES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the [[Atari Jaguar]]. [[Atari Corporation]] approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]], improving the port's graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version. He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Jag\"/>\n\nSince its initial release, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been ported to numerous other platforms as well.<ref name=\"GameFan2-6\"/> In 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology licensed ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and converted it into a [[virtual reality]] arcade game.<ref name=\"VR-Wolf3D\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-AVT\"/> The 1994 Acorn Archimedes port was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-RISC\"/><ref name=\"wolfencorn\"/> By 1994, a port for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] was under development by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]], who intended to release it by September, but it was cancelled due to technical problems.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-MDrive\"/> The 1994 [[Classic Mac OS]] version of the game had three releases: ''The First Encounter'', a shareware release; ''The Second Encounter'', with 30 exclusive levels; and ''The Third Encounter'', with all 60 levels from the DOS version.<ref name=\"MacWolf\"/> An [[Atari Lynx]] version of the game was offered earlier by Atari for id, but work on the port was never started.<ref name=\"LynxEGM\"/><ref name=\"LynxPodcast\"/> A [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] version was released in October 1995.<ref name=\"wolfen3do\"/><ref name=\"WolfenJP3DO\"/> The Apple IIGS port had been in development since Fall 1994 by Rebecca Heineman under the Vitesse company, but due to licensing problems.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GSII\"/> Ninjaforce Entertainment took over the project, but were having difficulties making satisfactory graphics on a limited color palette, although they managed to include authentic German voices.<ref name=\"NinjaForce\"/> The game was not released until four years later and published by Logicware.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GSII\"/> An open source [[iOS]] port  programmed by Carmack himself was released in 2009.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-iOS\"/><ref name=\"Wolf3D-OpenSource\"/> An unofficial port for the [[Game Boy Color]] was made in 2016.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-GBC\"/> The Android port was titled \"Wolfenstein 3D Touch\" and published by Beloko Games.<ref name=\"Wolf3D-Android\"/> Other releases include the [[Game Boy Advance]] (2002), [[Xbox Live Arcade]], and [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\"wolfengba\"/><ref name=\"wolfenxbla\"/><ref name=\"wolfenpsn\"/> These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes ''Spear of Destiny'', and a 2007 [[Steam (software)|Steam]] release for PC, macOS, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes.<ref name=\"wolfenios\"/><ref name=\"wolfensteam\"/> [[Bethesda Softworks]], whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of ''Wolfenstein 3D''{{'}}s release by producing a free-to-play [[browser game|browser-based]] version of the game in 2012.<ref name=\"wolfenbrowse\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nId had no clear expectations for ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> ''[[PC Zone]]'' quoted a shareware distributor as saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the top shareware seller of 1992.<ref name=\"PCZ\"/> The game was selling at a rate of 4000 copies a month by mail order.<ref name=\"PrimaGames\"/> By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' as well as ''Spear of Destiny'' had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id sold another 150,000 retail copies as ''Spear of Destiny''; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/> Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|banned from sale in Germany]] due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] in 1994, and again in 1997 for ''Spear of Destiny''.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"GamasutraBPS\"/> Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the game five months after release, describing it as: \"View from the character's point of view: It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play, and it runs well ... This is the only game of its type.\"<ref name=\"Famitsu\"/> The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier ''Commander Keen'' series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where ''Commander Keen'' games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' averaged $200,000 per month for the first year and a half.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' won the 1992 Best Arcade game award from ''[[Compute!]]'', the 1992 Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'', the 1992 Reader's Choice&nbsp;\u2014 Action/Arcade Game award from ''Game Bytes'', the 1993 Best Action/Arcade Game, Best Entertainment Software, and People's Choice awards at the [[Shareware Industry Awards]], the 1993 Best Action Game award from ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and a [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] from the [[Software Publishers Association]] for Best Action/Arcade Game.<ref name=\"SIAaward\"/><ref name=\"scarydarkfast11\"/><ref name=\"3DRlegacy\"/><ref name=\"CGW106\"/><ref name=\"CGW111\"/> It was the first shareware title to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) became the smallest company to ever receive the award. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was noted as one of the top games of the year at the 1993 [[Game Developers Conference]].<ref name=\"CGW108\"/>\n\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was well received by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the \"sparse [but] gorgeous\", \"frighteningly realistic\", and \"extremely violent\" graphics, as well as the immersive sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned \"those sensitive to such things to stay home\". Lombardi concluded that ''Wolfenstein 3D'', alongside ''Ultima Underworld'' released two months prior, was \"the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief\u2013suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment\", stating that they knew of no other game that could \"evoke such intense psychological responses from its players\".<ref name=\"CGW98\"/> ''Wolfenstein'' twice received 5 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it \"definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC\", highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the \"fast-paced action\" could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence.<ref name=\"Dragon192\"/> [[Sandy Petersen]], in the first \"Eye of the Monitor\" column, claimed that \"there is nothing else quite like ''Wolfenstein''\" and that it had \"evolved almost beyond recognition\" from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it \"a fun game with lots of action\" and \"a fun, fairly mindless romp\", though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard.<ref name=\"Dragon197\"/> The ''Spear of Destiny'' retail episode was also rated highly by ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes.<ref name=\"CGW102\"/> Formgen's ''Spear of Destiny'' mission packs \"Return to Danger\" and \"Ultimate Challenge\" were reviewed by Paul Hyman of ''Computer Gaming World'', who praised the updated graphical details and sound, as well as the smooth gameplay, but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game.<ref name=\"SODPack-CGWreview\"/>\n\nThe early ports of the game also received high reviews, though their sales have been described as \"dismal\".<ref name=\"NGen11\"/> The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential.<ref name=\"EGMSNESreview\"/> The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play.<ref name=\"EGMJAGreview\"/> A ''[[GamePro]]'' review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' \"set a new standard for PC gaming\" and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities.<ref name=\"GPJAGreview\"/> A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic, terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games.<ref name=\"NGjag\"/> Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild, stating that \"there isn't a staggering amount of freshness here, but the action is fast, deadly, and (surprise) addictive\".<ref name=\"NGmac\"/> Major Mike of ''GamePro'' commended the 3DO version's complete absence of [[pixelation]], fast scaling, \"rousing\" music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, \"still packs a punch as a first-person shooter\".<ref name=\"GP3DOreview\"/> ''Wolfenstein 3D'' won ''GamePro''{{'}}s Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed ''[[The Need for Speed]]'' and ''[[D (video game)|D]]''.<ref name=\"3DOaward\"/> ''Maximum'', on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' and the PlayStation version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' that a new port was pointless, with the game now \"somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive\".<ref name=\"MAX3DOreview\"/> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' asserted that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was \"still as [[video game addiction|addictive]] as it ever was\" but essentially agreed with ''Maximum'', contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or \"moved on\" to more advanced games in the genre.<ref name=\"NGen12\"/> More modern reviews include one for the [[Xbox 360]] port in 2009 by Ryan McCaffrey of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'', who heavily criticized it for non-existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]], who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was \"dated and flawed\", it was \"required playing for any first-person shooter fan\".<ref name=\"XboxMag99\"/><ref name=\"IGNPSNreview\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\",<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"AGGreview\"/><ref name=\"IGN100\"/><ref name=\"WIREDretro\"/> Although some prior computer shooting-based games existed, they were generally [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooters]], while ''Wolfenstein 3D'' helped move the market towards first-person shooters. It has also been attributed with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time;<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/><ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/> ''VideoGames & Computer Entertainment'' claimed in September 1992 that the game \"justified the existence of shareware\", and in July 1993 ''Computer Gaming World'' claimed that it \"almost single-handedly\" demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing, leading to a wave of other shareware first-person shooters.<ref name=\"CGW108\"/><ref name=\"VGCE\"/><ref name=\"DSretro\"/> The game's high revenue compared to prior, smaller 2D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger, 3D titles built by larger development teams.<ref name=\"20YearsGameUltra\"/>\nDuring development, id approached [[Sierra Entertainment]], then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing ''Commander Keen'' and an early version of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', CEO [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"MOD94104\"/> By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, ''Doom'', the success of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.<ref name=\"GamasutraDoom\"/> In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' declared ''Wolfenstein 3-D'' the 97th-best computer game ever released.<ref name=\"cgw150\"/>\n\nThe game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' section 86a]] up through 2018. Section 86a had \"social adequacy\" allowances for works of art, but in 1998, a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within ''Wolfenstein 3D'' determined that video games did not fall under this allowance. The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences, \"this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them, which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas\".<ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> Up through 2018, the Germany software ratings board, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery, effectively banning the game for sale within the country. However, in August 2018, the decision was reversed by the German government, having determined that the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings, and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance.<ref name=\"GermanBanReversed\"/><ref name=\"ars tech ban\"/> In November 2019, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was formally struck from the \"Index\", the list of games banned from sale in Germany.<ref name=\"Wolf3dGermanyok\"/>\n\nAfter the game's release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the ''Commander Keen'' engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine or derivatives of it include ''[[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold|Blake Stone]]'', the [[Capstone Software]] games ''[[Corridor 7: Alien Invasion|Corridor 7]]'' and ''[[Operation Body Count]]'', as well as ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINEbs\"/><ref name=\"ENGINEna\"/> Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled ''Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II'', designed by Tom Hall using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''.<ref name=\"ENGINErott\"/> Additionally, Softdisk produced ''Catacomb Abyss'' using the prototype ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'' as part of the ''[[Catacomb 3-D#Catacomb Adventure Series|Catacomb Adventure Series]]'' trilogy of sequels.<ref name=\"Apogee FAQ Softdisk\"/> Although ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others.<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> The modding efforts of ''Wolfenstein'' players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like ''Doom'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"MOD166\"/><ref name=\"OW\"/> The source code for the original ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release.<ref name=\"CarmackComm\"/><ref name=\"Apogee FAQ\"/> The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as ''[[Ken's Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Nitemare 3D]]'', ''[[The Terminator: Rampage]]'', ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Terminal Terror|Terminal Terror]]'' and ''[[The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki]]'', among others.<ref name=\"ROTThistory\"/>\n\nAlthough id Software did not develop another ''Wolfenstein'' game, as their development focus shifted to ''Doom'' shortly after release,<ref name=\"MOD113117\"/> and has never returned to the series, multiple ''Wolfenstein'' titles have been produced by other companies, sometimes using game engines developed by id. The first of these newer ''Wolfenstein'' games was ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' in 2001, a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, and the latest titles are the 2019 games ''[[Wolfenstein: Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot]]''.<ref name=\"RTCW\"/><ref name=\"WTNC\"/>\n\n==References==\n;References\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- GAMEPLAY -->\n\n<ref name=\"HG101\">{{Cite
