The episodes are the 21st and 22nd of the [[Smallville (season 10)|10th season]], and the 216th and 217th episodes overall. The finale originally aired on [[The CW]] in the United States on May 13, 2011. The first half was written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, and directed by [[Kevin Fair|Kevin G. Fair]], and the second half was written by Kelly Souders and [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]], and directed by [[Greg Beeman]].\n\nThe series follows the adventures of the young [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] ([[Tom Welling]]) in the fictional town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville, Kansas]], before he becomes [[Superman]]. In the series finale, [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) learns that the planet [[Apokolips]] is coming to destroy humanity, and that [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) is under the possession of [[Darkseid]]. Meanwhile, the [[Lionel Luthor]] from Earth-2 ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]) attempts to bring his deceased doppelg\u00e4nger's son [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]] ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]) back to life. Clark finally realizes his true destiny, just in time to stop Darkseid's arrival on Earth. The finale episodes feature a flashforward seven years into the future, revealing Clark's new superhero persona, \"Superman\".\n\nThe episodes, written in advance during the fall of 2010, were conceived to successfully bring an end to the series. [[Showrunner]]s Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]], [[Aaron Ashmore]], [[Annette O'Toole]], and [[Michael Rosenbaum]]. In addition, [[Michael McKean]] made an uncredited voice cameo. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]''.\n\nUpon its premiere, the two-episode finale was watched by 3.35 million viewers. The episodes received generally positive reviews from commentators, many of whom felt that the series was successfully able to wrap up its story arcs. Rosenbaum's return was met with critical applause; however, the artistic decision to not show Welling in the full Superman suit and instead to render Superman using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was met with negativity.\n\n==Plot==\nSeven years in the future, [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]]) reads a [[comic book]] titled \"Smallville\", detailing the rise of Superman, to her son. Flashing back seven years, [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]) and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] ([[Tom Welling]]) argue about their upcoming wedding. Lois wants to call off the wedding, believing that she is hindering Clark's destiny. Chloe gives Lois a copy of Clark's vows to help convince her to go through with the wedding. Meanwhile, Clark has a discussion with his mother, Martha ([[Annette O'Toole]]) about letting go of the past. Clark visits Lois at their apartment, where she tells him that the wedding is on, admitting that she read his vows, and gives him hers in exchange. Clark reads her vows and tells her that he will meet her at the chapel.\n\nAt the Luthor Mansion, [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is confronted by [[Granny Goodness]], who offers her one final chance to join [[Darkseid]]'s forces to spare her life during the coming destruction. Tess refuses, declaring that, just because she was born a Luthor, her fate is not sealed. At Watchtower, discovering that [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) disabled the organization's satellites, Tess brings up previous satellite footage revealing the planet [[Apokolips]] descending toward Earth. Before Tess can warn the team, she is ambushed by a group of armed men and taken captive. [[Granny Goodness]], [[Desaad]], and [[Gordon Godfrey]] meet in their lair. Oliver\u2014possessed by the power of Darkseid\u2014arrives and is instructed to remove Clark's powers with a [[gold kryptonite]] wedding ring. At the wedding, Chloe realizes the ring is kryptonite and stops Oliver. Clark helps Oliver overcome Darkseid's control just as Apokolips enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\nTess, awakening on a table inside a laboratory, is greeted by the parallel universe version of [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]) from Earth-2, who reveals that they are underneath the ruins of the Luthor Mansion, where [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]] has been hiding, taking his clones' vital parts and grafting them to his body to mend himself (as revealed in the season premiere episode \"Lazarus\"). Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and fatally shoots Lionel during her escape. Lionel makes a deal with Darkseid to bring his doppelg\u00e4nger's son to life in exchange for Lionel's soul. Clark tracks Tess to the mansion, where he is confronted by Lex. Clark apologizes for not being able to save Lex from the loss of his soul, but declares that he will always be there to stop Lex in the future. Oliver confronts Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey, dispatching them with three arrows. At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he always knew that she was his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him. As she lies dying, she poisons Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all of his memories within 30 seconds.\n\nAfter overhearing a government radio broadcast containing disguised references to nuclear weapons, Lois sneaks on board [[Air Force One]]. She manipulates her way into a room with the Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid, who is possessing Lionel's body. [[Jor-El]] taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment. Harnessing the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and makes his way to the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. There, the spirit of his father, [[Characters of Smallville#Jonathan Kent|Jonathan Kent]] ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.\n\nFlashing forward seven years, a TV broadcast announces that Lex Luthor has just been elected the [[President of the United States]]. At the ''Daily Planet'', Clark runs into Lois, and they discuss finally getting married, after seven years. News arrives of a bomb found in an elevator uptown. Clark runs to the rooftop and rips open his shirt, revealing his [[Superman logo|suit]] as \"Superman\".\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background and writing===\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Smallville (season 7)|seventh season]] finale \"Arctic\", [[showrunner]]s and original series developers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] left the series. This meant that they were unable to write the series finale, although Millar later noted that, in their minds, \"the last moment of the show would [have been] him putting on the suit and flying off into his future and his destiny.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=Al Gough and Miles Millar Exclusive Interview Smallville|url=http://collider.com/al-gough-miles-millar-interview-smallville/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=May 25, 2014|date=2011}}</ref> According to executive producer and showrunner Kelly Souders, she and fellow executive producer and showrunner [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] kept Gough and Millar's original ending in mind when they began working on the finale, because the scenes that Gough and Millar had envisioned represented \"real wish fulfillments for fans\".<ref name=kryptoninterview/> However, the resultant script changed along the way, with Souders eventually calling it \"a smorgasbord of what everybody wanted.\"<ref name=kryptoninterview>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Craig|title=''Smallville''{{'}}s Executive Producer Kelly Souders Talks About The Final Episodes!|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/finaleinterview-kellysouders2.htm|publisher=KryptonSite|accessdate=May 25, 2014|date=2011}}</ref>\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"Kelly and I split up the script, and I happened to get the very last few minutes.

Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts of the episode to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced [[heart palpitations]] due to exhaustion, excitement, and the emotion of the experience.<ref name=hollywoodwriting/>\n\nThe episode finally features Clark flying. Peterson and Souders had toyed with the idea of showing Clark flying in either the 200th episode, \"Homecoming,\" or during a different mid-season episode, but they decided against it; they argued that Clark flying was a metaphor for him finally embracing his destiny, and that adding it to another episode other than the finale would be jarring. The writers listened to both network executive and fans in order to formulate the best idea as to how to handle the situation. Peterson noted that people wanted \"one big transformation\".<ref name=hollywoodwriting>{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title=Emmys: How 'Entourage,' 'Smallville' Writers Tackled Their Series Finales|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-how-entourage-smallville-writers-203814|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 25, 2014|author2=Guthrie, Marisa |date=June 22, 2011}}</ref> According to Souders, the writers initially wished to include more members of the [[Justice League]] but, because of budgetary constraints, these ideas did not come to pass.

Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting that she would not be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kreuk released a statement on her [[Facebook]] page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on ''Smallville'', she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that she was glad that they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|title=Kristin Kreuk Clears the Air On Her Smallville Status: 'Lana's Story Is Done'|url=http://tvline.com/2011/03/14/kristin-kreuk-smallville-status-lana-series-finale/|work=[[TV Line]]|publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]]|accessdate=May 25, 2014|date=March 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nBecause the finale encompassed two separate episodes, each was filmed by a different director. Part one was directed by Kevin G. Fair, and the second part was directed by [[Greg Beeman]]. Beeman had been a regular director for the series during its first five years, but he had left after helping direct the [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]] episode \"[[Reckoning (Smallville)|Reckoning]]\". A fan of the series himself, he was particularly pleased with the way in which the various story arcs were wrapped up, highlighting the scenes in the Fortress of Solitude, the flash forward seven years, and the reappearance of Schneider.<ref name=ksiteinterview/> Production for the finale started in March 2011.<ref name=scriptproduction/> The producers for the series were initially concerned that they had not filmed enough material to fill the finale's allotted air time, so additional scenes were filmed between Granny Goodness and Godfrey concerning the Darkseid mythology.<ref name=\"whatifnolex?\"/><ref name=tvguide/> However, a rough cut of the finished episodes ended up going over time, and the scenes were cut. There was talk that these scenes would appear on the 10th season DVD, although this did not come to pass.<ref name=\"whatifnolex?\"/>\n\nThe suit that Clark dons in the series finale was originally used in the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', worn by [[Brandon Routh]]. The producers of ''Smallville'' had been offered the suit worn by [[Christopher Reeve]] in the original ''Superman'' films; however, they turned the offer down. Peterson reasoned that this was because it \"didn't quite fit with our world\".<ref>{{cite web|title=KryptonSite Smallville Comic-Con Interviews, Part V: Executive Producer Brian Peterson!|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/cc10-brianpeterson.htm|publisher=KryptonSite.com|accessdate=May 26, 2014|date=2011}}</ref> The final scene was shot to be reminiscent of the similar scene in the original 1978 ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film, where Reeve rips open his shirt to reveal the Superman suit. Beeman and the rest of the production staff reviewed the scene to make sure that they filmed the homage correctly, but Beeman later noted that the iconic scene was \"clunkier\" and more \"out of focus\" than they wanted, and that people's memories make it seem more impressive. However, he was pleased that the recreated shot was the sequence to wrap up ''Smallville'', noting that he \"always thought that was going to be the final moment\".<ref name=ksiteinterview>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Craig|title=KSiteTV Interview With Greg Beeman|url=http://www.ksitetv.com/ksitetv-interview-with-greg-beeman-page-2-of-2|publisher=KSiteTV.com|accessdate=May 26, 2014|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSpecial effects for the finale episodes\u2014and series as a whole\u2014were completed by Entity FX. The company produced nearly 80 different [[visual effects]] shots for the episode, which were created in the Entity FX facilities in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, and [[Santa Monica, California]], with addition supervision in Vancouver. Mat Beck, owner of the company, later explained that the company was in charge of \"work[ing] this magic\" on several minutes of screen time, during which hardly any photography had been filmed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Entity FX Soars with Smallville 'Finale' Visual Effects|url=http://www.entityfx.com/news_051611.html|publisher=Entity FX|accessdate=May 26, 2014|date=May 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225040505/http://www.entityfx.com/news_051611.html|archivedate=February 25, 2015}}</ref> The episode also made use of practical effects, such as how Lex Luthor's bald head was created. Unlike Rosenbaum's previous appearances, the actor decided to opt for a [[bald cap]] to cover his hair, arriving at this decision both because it had taken four months for his hair to grow back and because he was working on other projects that required him to have hair.<ref>{{cite web|last=Engelhardt|first=Gordon|title=Rosenbaum Returns to 'Smallville' For Series Finale|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/feb/13/rosenbaum-returns-smallville-series-finale/|work=[[Evansville Courier & Press]]|publisher=[[E.

The episodes are the 21st and 22nd of the [[Smallville (season 10)|10th season]], and the 216th and 217th episodes overall. The finale originally aired on [[The CW]] in the United States on May 13, 2011. The first half was written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, and directed by [[Kevin Fair|Kevin G. Fair]], and the second half was written by Kelly Souders and [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]], and directed by [[Greg Beeman]].\n\nThe series follows the adventures of the young [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] ([[Tom Welling]]) in the fictional town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville, Kansas]], before he becomes [[Superman]]. In the series finale, [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) learns that the planet [[Apokolips]] is coming to destroy humanity, and that [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) is under the possession of [[Darkseid]]. Meanwhile, the [[Lionel Luthor]] from Earth-2 ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]) attempts to bring his deceased doppelg\u00e4nger's son [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]] ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]) back to life. Clark finally realizes his true destiny, just in time to stop Darkseid's arrival on Earth. The finale episodes feature a flashforward seven years into the future, revealing Clark's new superhero persona, \"Superman\".\n\nThe episodes, written in advance during the fall of 2010, were conceived to successfully bring an end to the series. [[Showrunner]]s Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]], [[Aaron Ashmore]], [[Annette O'Toole]], and [[Michael Rosenbaum]]. In addition, [[Michael McKean]] made an uncredited voice cameo. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]''.\n\nUpon its premiere, the two-episode finale was watched by 3.35 million viewers. The episodes received generally positive reviews from commentators, many of whom felt that the series was successfully able to wrap up its story arcs. Rosenbaum's return was met with critical applause; however, the artistic decision to not show Welling in the full Superman suit and instead to render Superman using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was met with negativity.\n\n==Plot==\nSeven years in the future, [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]]) reads a [[comic book]] titled \"Smallville\", detailing the rise of Superman, to her son. Flashing back seven years, [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]) and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] ([[Tom Welling]]) argue about their upcoming wedding. Lois wants to call off the wedding, believing that she is hindering Clark's destiny. Chloe gives Lois a copy of Clark's vows to help convince her to go through with the wedding. Meanwhile, Clark has a discussion with his mother, Martha ([[Annette O'Toole]]) about letting go of the past. Clark visits Lois at their apartment, where she tells him that the wedding is on, admitting that she read his vows, and gives him hers in exchange. Clark reads her vows and tells her that he will meet her at the chapel.\n\nAt the Luthor Mansion, [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is confronted by [[Granny Goodness]], who offers her one final chance to join [[Darkseid]]'s forces to spare her life during the coming destruction. Tess refuses, declaring that, just because she was born a Luthor, her fate is not sealed. At Watchtower, discovering that [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) disabled the organization's satellites, Tess brings up previous satellite footage revealing the planet [[Apokolips]] descending toward Earth. Before Tess can warn the team, she is ambushed by a group of armed men and taken captive. [[Granny Goodness]], [[Desaad]], and [[Gordon Godfrey]] meet in their lair. Oliver\u2014possessed by the power of Darkseid\u2014arrives and is instructed to remove Clark's powers with a [[gold kryptonite]] wedding ring. At the wedding, Chloe realizes the ring is kryptonite and stops Oliver. Clark helps Oliver overcome Darkseid's control just as Apokolips enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\nTess, awakening on a table inside a laboratory, is greeted by the parallel universe version of [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]) from Earth-2, who reveals that they are underneath the ruins of the Luthor Mansion, where [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]] has been hiding, taking his clones' vital parts and grafting them to his body to mend himself (as revealed in the season premiere episode \"Lazarus\"). Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and fatally shoots Lionel during her escape. Lionel makes a deal with Darkseid to bring his doppelg\u00e4nger's son to life in exchange for Lionel's soul. Clark tracks Tess to the mansion, where he is confronted by Lex. Clark apologizes for not being able to save Lex from the loss of his soul, but declares that he will always be there to stop Lex in the future. Oliver confronts Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey, dispatching them with three arrows. At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he always knew that she was his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him. As she lies dying, she poisons Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all of his memories within 30 seconds.\n\nAfter overhearing a government radio broadcast containing disguised references to nuclear weapons, Lois sneaks on board [[Air Force One]]. She manipulates her way into a room with the Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid, who is possessing Lionel's body. [[Jor-El]] taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment. Harnessing the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and makes his way to the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. There, the spirit of his father, [[Characters of Smallville#Jonathan Kent|Jonathan Kent]] ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.\n\nFlashing forward seven years, a TV broadcast announces that Lex Luthor has just been elected the [[President of the United States]]. At the ''Daily Planet'', Clark runs into Lois, and they discuss finally getting married, after seven years. News arrives of a bomb found in an elevator uptown. Clark runs to the rooftop and rips open his shirt, revealing his [[Superman logo|suit]] as \"Superman\".\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background and writing===\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Smallville (season 7)|seventh season]] finale \"Arctic\", [[showrunner]]s and original series developers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] left the series. This meant that they were unable to write the series finale, although Millar later noted that, in their minds, \"the last moment of the show would [have been] him putting on the suit and flying off into his future and his destiny.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=Al Gough and Miles Millar Exclusive Interview Smallville|url=http://collider.com/al-gough-miles-millar-interview-smallville/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=May 25, 2014|date=2011}}</ref> According to executive producer and showrunner Kelly Souders, she and fellow executive producer and showrunner [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] kept Gough and Millar's original ending in mind when they began working on the finale, because the scenes that Gough and Millar had envisioned represented \"real wish fulfillments for fans\".<ref name=kryptoninterview/> However, the resultant script changed along the way, with Souders eventually calling it \"a smorgasbord of what everybody wanted.\"<ref name=kryptoninterview>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Craig|title=''Smallville''{{'}}s Executive Producer Kelly Souders Talks About The Final Episodes!|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/finaleinterview-kellysouders2.htm|publisher=KryptonSite|accessdate=May 25, 2014|date=2011}}</ref>\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"Kelly and I split up the script, and I happened to get the very last few minutes.

Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts of the episode to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced [[heart palpitations]] due to exhaustion, excitement, and the emotion of the experience.<ref name=hollywoodwriting/>\n\nThe episode finally features Clark flying. Peterson and Souders had toyed with the idea of showing Clark flying in either the 200th episode, \"Homecoming,\" or during a different mid-season episode, but they decided against it; they argued that Clark flying was a metaphor for him finally embracing his destiny, and that adding it to another episode other than the finale would be jarring. The writers listened to both network executive and fans in order to formulate the best idea as to how to handle the situation. Peterson noted that people wanted \"one big transformation\".<ref name=hollywoodwriting>{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title=Emmys: How 'Entourage,' 'Smallville' Writers Tackled Their Series Finales|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-how-entourage-smallville-writers-203814|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 25, 2014|author2=Guthrie, Marisa |date=June 22, 2011}}</ref> According to Souders, the writers initially wished to include more members of the [[Justice League]] but, because of budgetary constraints, these ideas did not come to pass.

Kreuk released a statement on her [[Facebook]] page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on ''Smallville'', she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that she was glad that they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|title=Kristin Kreuk Clears the Air On Her Smallville Status: 'Lana's Story Is Done'|url=http://tvline.com/2011/03/14/kristin-kreuk-smallville-status-lana-series-finale/|work=[[TV Line]]|publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]]|accessdate=May 25, 2014|date=March 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nBecause the finale encompassed two separate episodes, each was filmed by a different director. Part one was directed by Kevin G. Fair, and the second part was directed by [[Greg Beeman]]. Beeman had been a regular director for the series during its first five years, but he had left after helping direct the [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]] episode \"[[Reckoning (Smallville)|Reckoning]]\". A fan of the series himself, he was particularly pleased with the way in which the various story arcs were wrapped up, highlighting the scenes in the Fortress of Solitude, the flash forward seven years, and the reappearance of Schneider.<ref name=ksiteinterview/> Production for the finale started in March 2011.<ref name=scriptproduction/> The producers for the series were initially concerned that they had not filmed enough material to fill the finale's allotted air time, so additional scenes were filmed between Granny Goodness and Godfrey concerning the Darkseid mythology.<ref name=\"whatifnolex?\"/><ref name=tvguide/> However, a rough cut of the finished episodes ended up going over time, and the scenes were cut. There was talk that these scenes would appear on the 10th season DVD, although this did not come to pass.<ref name=\"whatifnolex?\"/>\n\nThe suit that Clark dons in the series finale was originally used in the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', worn by [[Brandon Routh]]. The producers of ''Smallville'' had been offered the suit worn by [[Christopher Reeve]] in the original ''Superman'' films; however, they turned the offer down.

It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejazi territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.\n\nThe historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''.\n\nThe graves of [[Fatimah]] ([[Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters|Muhammad's daughter]]) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] ([[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad's grandson]]), across from the mosque at ''Jannat [[al-Baqi']]'', and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad's wife]], [[Aisha]]), and of Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here. The mosque dates back to the time of Muhammad, but has been twice reconstructed.<ref name=\"EA\">1954 [[Encyclopedia Americana]], vol. 18, pp.587, 588</ref>\n\nBecause of the Saudi government's religious policy and concern that historic sites could become the focus for [[idolatry in Islam|idolatry]], much of Medina's Islamic physical heritage has been [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|altered]].\n\n==Religious significance in Islam==\n{{Main|Muhammad in Medina}}\n[[File:The Green Dome, Masjid Nabawi, Madina.jpg|thumb|The Green Dome of the Prophet's Mosque]]\n\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''. The mosque was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. [[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.\n\nAfter Muhammad migrated to Madinah, he built Quba' Mosque and offered prayers in it.

It was restored by [[Qaitbay]], the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Egyptian ruler]], in 1487.<ref name=\"EA\"/> \n\nMuslims are encouraged to perform 2 rakaat of Sunnah prayer at this Quba' Mosque. According to a hadith from Sunan Ibn Majah, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad  said, ''\u201cWhoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\u201d'' (Hadith by Imam Ibn Majah)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muslim.sg/articles/11-places-to-visit-in-madinah?type=articles|title=10 Places To Visit In Madinah|website=muslim.sg|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n''Masjid al-Qiblatain'' is another mosque also historically important to Muslims.

Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their '[[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several [[Banu Hashim|family members of Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.\n\nIslamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts. There is also a book within the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] titled 'Virtues of Medina'.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=30&translator=1 hadith found in 'Virtues of Madinah' of Sahih Bukhari] searchtruth.com</ref>\n\n[[Sahih Bukhari]] says:\n{{quote|Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.

At first, these tribes were allied with Jewish rulers, but later they revolted and became  independent.<ref name=\"Medina\">\"Al-Medina.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''</ref> Toward the end of the 5th century,<ref>for date see \"J. Q. R.\" vii. 175, note</ref> the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj. The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/>\n\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aus and the Khazraj.<ref>See e.g., Peters 193; \"Qurayza\", ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''</ref> However, according to scholar of Islam [[William Montgomery Watt]], the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nEarly Muslim chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]] tells of an ancient conflict between the last [[Yemen]]ite king of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]<ref>Muslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of \"[[Tubba']]\".</ref> and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118.

In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]]. The Muslims dispatched the Meccan champions in a three-on-three m\u00eal\u00e9e, Hamzah killed his opponent with the very first strike, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |date=20 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nNow both armies began firing arrows at each other. Two Muslims and an unknown number of Quraysh were killed.

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.<ref>Esposito, John L. \"Islam.\" Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices, edited by Thomas Riggs, vol. 1: Religions and Denominations, Gale, 2006, pp. 349-379.</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&nbsp;\u2014 from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.<ref name=\"mantran\"/>\n\n===Capital city of Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate===\n[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]\n\nIn the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 CE/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in the day.

It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejazi territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.\n\nThe historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''.\n\nThe graves of [[Fatimah]] ([[Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters|Muhammad's daughter]]) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] ([[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad's grandson]]), across from the mosque at ''Jannat [[al-Baqi']]'', and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad's wife]], [[Aisha]]), and of Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here.

The mosque was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. [[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.\n\nAfter Muhammad migrated to Madinah, he built Quba' Mosque and offered prayers in it.

It was restored by [[Qaitbay]], the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Egyptian ruler]], in 1487.<ref name=\"EA\"/> \n\nMuslims are encouraged to perform 2 rakaat of Sunnah prayer at this Quba' Mosque. According to a hadith from Sunan Ibn Majah, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad  said, ''\u201cWhoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\u201d'' (Hadith by Imam Ibn Majah)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muslim.sg/articles/11-places-to-visit-in-madinah?type=articles|title=10 Places To Visit In Madinah|website=muslim.sg|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n''Masjid al-Qiblatain'' is another mosque also historically important to Muslims.

Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their '[[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several [[Banu Hashim|family members of Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.\n\nIslamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts. There is also a book within the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] titled 'Virtues of Medina'.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=30&translator=1 hadith found in 'Virtues of Madinah' of Sahih Bukhari] searchtruth.com</ref>\n\n[[Sahih Bukhari]] says:\n{{quote|Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.

At first, these tribes were allied with Jewish rulers, but later they revolted and became  independent.<ref name=\"Medina\">\"Al-Medina.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''</ref> Toward the end of the 5th century,<ref>for date see \"J. Q. R.\" vii. 175, note</ref> the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj. The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/>\n\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aus and the Khazraj.<ref>See e.g., Peters 193; \"Qurayza\", ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''</ref> However, according to scholar of Islam [[William Montgomery Watt]], the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nEarly Muslim chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]] tells of an ancient conflict between the last [[Yemen]]ite king of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]<ref>Muslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of \"[[Tubba']]\".</ref> and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters 116; \"Muhammad\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\"; \"Kurayza, Banu\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\".</ref> In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kit\u0101b \u1e0fimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons.<ref>Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites \u2013 History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288\u2013299. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Badr====\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|Battle of Badr}}\n[[File:Battle of Badr.png|thumb|Battle positions at Badr]]\nThe Battle of Badr was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca. In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]].

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.{{cn|date=February 2019}}<ref>Esposito, John L. \"Islam.\" Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices, edited by Thomas Riggs, vol. 1: Religions and Denominations, Gale, 2006, pp. 349-379.</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina.

Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in the day.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

They \"breathe\" [[electron donor]]s such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is very little energy at greater depths, and metabolism can be up to a million times slower than at the surface.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

Survivalist phytoplankton has a high N:P ratio (>30) and contains an abundance of resource-acquisition machinery to sustain growth under scarce resources. Bloomer phytoplankton has a low N:P ratio (<10), contains a high proportion of growth machinery and is adapted to exponential growth. Generalist phytoplankton has similar N:P to the Redfield ratio and contain relatively equal resource-acquisition and growth machinery.<ref name=\"Arrigo2005\"/>\n\nThe [[f-ratio]] is the fraction of total [[primary production]] fuelled by [[nitrate]] (as opposed to that fuelled by other [[nitrogen]] [[chemical compound|compounds]] such as [[ammonium]]).

They are [[heterotrophic]] (other-feeding), meaning they cannot produce their own food and must consume instead other plants or animals as food. In particular, this means they eat phytoplankton.\n\nZooplankton are generally larger than phytoplankton, mostly still microscopic but some can be seen with the naked eye. Many [[protozoan]]s (single-celled [[#Marine protists|protists]] that prey on other microscopic life) are zooplankton, including [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, [[radiolarian]]s, some [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[#Marine microanimals|marine microanimals]]. Macroscopic zooplankton (not covered further here) include pelagic [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s and [[tunicate]]s, as well as planktonic [[chaetognatha|arrow worms]] and [[Polychaete|bristle worms]].\n\n'''Microzooplankton: major grazers of the plankton...'''\n<gallery mode=packed heights=144px style=float:left;>\nFile:Copepod 2 with eggs.jpg|[[Copepod]]s eat phytoplankton.
