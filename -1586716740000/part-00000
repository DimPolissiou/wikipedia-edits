Her father, a former soldier at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], foresaw trouble from citizenry calling for [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution]], and so gathered his family in 1846 and fled to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in the United States.\n\nIn 1864, Josephine met and married [[United States Army|Army]] [[Lieutenant]] James A. Clifford in [[New Mexico]].  Clifford's sanity began to unravel and he confessed to his wife that he had killed a man in [[Texas]].  He threatened her, saying that if she told anyone, he would kill her too.  After appealing to his superiors and making sure he was under guard, she fled to her family in [[San Francisco]].\n\n==In California==\nMcCracken wrote articles for [[Harper (publisher)|Harper Brothers]] and for the newspapers ''Out West'' and ''Western Field'' while traveling through New Mexico and lower California,<ref name=\"Taylor\">Taylor, Arther Adelbert, [https://archive.org/details/californiaredwo00taylgoog California redwood park, sometimes called Sempervirens park: an appreciation], Sacramento, 1912, p. 31.</ref> and once in San Francisco, turned full-time to her love for [[Creative writing|writing]] and literary pursuits.

Turing Award citation reads:\n\n{{Quote|text=\nFran Allen's work has had an enormous impact on compiler research and practice. Both alone and in joint work with [[John Cocke]], she introduced many of the abstractions, algorithms, and implementations that laid the groundwork for automatic program optimization technology. Allen's 1966 paper, \"Program Optimization,\" laid the conceptual basis for systematic analysis and transformation of computer programs. This paper introduced the use of graph-theoretic structures to encode program content in order to automatically and efficiently derive relationships and identify opportunities for optimization. Her 1970 papers, \"Control Flow Analysis\" and \"A Basis for Program Optimization\" established \"intervals\" as the context for efficient and effective data flow analysis and optimization. Her 1971 paper with Cocke, \"A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations,\" provided the first description and systematization of optimizing transformations. Her 1973 and 1974 papers on interprocedural data flow analysis extended the analysis to whole programs. Her 1976 paper with Cocke describes one of the two main analysis strategies used in optimizing compilers today.\n\nAllen developed and implemented her methods as part of compilers for the IBM STRETCH-HARVEST and the experimental Advanced Computing System. This work established the feasibility and structure of modern machine- and language-independent optimizers. She went on to establish and lead the PTRAN project on the automatic parallel execution of FORTRAN programs. Her PTRAN team developed new parallelism detection schemes and created the concept of the program dependence graph, the primary structuring method used by most parallelizing compilers.\n|sign=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM)|source=[https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/allen_1012327.cfm Citation for the A.M.

She planned to return to teaching once her student loans had been paid but ended up staying with IBM for her entire 45-year career. Allen was assigned to the [[IBM 7950 Harvest|Harvest]] project for code breaking with the [[National Security Agency]] in 1959 and worked on a [[programming language]] called ''Alpha''.<ref name=\"CACM\"/> She managed the compiler-optimization team for both Harvest and the [[IBM 7030 Stretch|Stretch]] project. In the 1960s she contributed to the [[ACS-1]] project and in the 1970s to [[PL/I]]. From 1970 to 1971 she spent a [[sabbatical]] at [[New York University]] and acted as [[adjunct professor]] for a few years afterwards.

Turing Award citation reads:\n\n{{Quote|text=\nFran Allen's work has had an enormous impact on compiler research and practice. Both alone and in joint work with [[John Cocke]], she introduced many of the abstractions, algorithms, and implementations that laid the groundwork for automatic program optimization technology. Allen's 1966 paper, \"Program Optimization,\" laid the conceptual basis for systematic analysis and transformation of computer programs. This paper introduced the use of graph-theoretic structures to encode program content in order to automatically and efficiently derive relationships and identify opportunities for optimization. Her 1970 papers, \"Control Flow Analysis\" and \"A Basis for Program Optimization\" established \"intervals\" as the context for efficient and effective data flow analysis and optimization. Her 1971 paper with Cocke, \"A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations,\" provided the first description and systematization of optimizing transformations. Her 1973 and 1974 papers on interprocedural data flow analysis extended the analysis to whole programs. Her 1976 paper with Cocke describes one of the two main analysis strategies used in optimizing compilers today.\n\nAllen developed and implemented her methods as part of compilers for the IBM STRETCH-HARVEST and the experimental Advanced Computing System. This work established the feasibility and structure of modern machine- and language-independent optimizers. She went on to establish and lead the PTRAN project on the automatic parallel execution of FORTRAN programs. Her PTRAN team developed new parallelism detection schemes and created the concept of the program dependence graph, the primary structuring method used by most parallelizing compilers.\n|sign=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM)|source=[https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/allen_1012327.cfm Citation for the A.M.

She dominated her way through the rounds.\n\nIn the final, [[Christina Manning]] got the best start along with [[Devynne Charlton]], but Harrison quickly made up ground.  By the second hurdle, she had a foot (30 cm) lead, over the two, with Charlton fading from contention after that, while [[Sharika Nelvis]] and [[Isabelle Pedersen]] were the next back by the third hurdle.  [[Nadine Visser]] pulled even with Pedersen still 2 feet behind Nelvis.  Out front, Harrison had a metre lead over Manning.  On the run in, Harrison and Manning retained their positions, while Visser closed quickly to take bronze from Nelvis.  Seventh over the last barrier, [[Cindy Roleder]] also closed quickly to almost catch Nelvis for fourth.  Harrison's winning time of 7.70 was a new [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics#Championship records|Championship record]].\n\n==Results==\n===Heats===\nThe heats were started on 2 March at 18:05.<ref>[https://media.aws.iaaf.org/competitiondocuments/pdf/6019/AT-60H-W-h----.RS4.pdf Heats results]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Rank !!

Members of the ''Verlorene Haufen'' earned double pay, thus giving them the name of ''[[Doppels\u00f6ldner]]'' ('Double-wagers'). Since there were not enough volunteers for this assignment, criminals who had been sentenced to death were taken into the ranks as well. As a field sign, the ''Verlorene Haufen'' carried a red ''Blutfahne'' ('Blood Banner').\n\nBy extension, the term ''forlorn hope'' became used for any body of troops placed in a hazardous position, ''e.g.'', an exposed outpost, or the defenders of an [[outwork]] in advance of the main defensive position.<ref name=\"brit\" /> This usage was especially common in accounts of the [[English Civil War]], as well as in the [[British Army]] in the [[Peninsular War]] of 1808\u20131814. In the days of muzzle-loading [[musket]]s, the term was most frequently used to refer to the first wave of soldiers attacking a breach in defenses during a [[siege]].\n\nWhile it was likely that most members of the forlorn hope would be killed or wounded, the intention was that some would survive long enough to seize a foothold that could be reinforced, or, at least, that a second wave with better prospects could be sent in while the defenders were reloading or engaged in mopping up the remnants of the first wave.<ref name=\"brit\" />  That said, such soldiers were rarely suicidal or foolhardy: British troops of the forlorn hope at the 1812 [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Siege of Badajoz]] carried a large bag ({{convert|5|-|6|ft}} by {{convert|2|ft}} in diameter) stuffed with hay or straw, which was thrown down into the enemy trenches to create a cushion and prevent injury as they jumped down.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/08/11/never-trump-republicans-could-have-their-revenge|title='Never Trump' Republicans could have their revenge|last=|first=|date=9 August 2018|work=The Economist|access-date=15 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The London Journal, and Weekly Record of Literature, Science, and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRRLAQAAMAAJ|year=1847|publisher=G.

Since there were not enough volunteers for this assignment, criminals who had been sentenced to death were taken into the ranks as well. As a field sign, the ''Verlorene Haufen'' carried a red ''Blutfahne'' ('Blood Banner').\n\nBy extension, the term ''forlorn hope'' became used for any body of troops placed in a hazardous position, ''e.g.'', an exposed outpost, or the defenders of an [[outwork]] in advance of the main defensive position.<ref name=\"brit\" /> This usage was especially common in accounts of the [[English Civil War]], as well as in the [[British Army]] in the [[Peninsular War]] of 1808\u20131814. In the days of muzzle-loading [[musket]]s, the term was most frequently used to refer to the first wave of soldiers attacking a breach in defenses during a [[siege]].\n\nWhile it was likely that most members of the forlorn hope would be killed or wounded, the intention was that some would survive long enough to seize a foothold that could be reinforced, or, at least, that a second wave with better prospects could be sent in while the defenders were reloading or engaged in mopping up the remnants of the first wave.<ref name=\"brit\" />  That said, such soldiers were rarely suicidal or foolhardy: British troops of the forlorn hope at the 1812 [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Siege of Badajoz]] carried a large bag ({{convert|5|-|6|ft}} by {{convert|2|ft}} in diameter) stuffed with hay or straw, which was thrown down into the enemy trenches to create a cushion and prevent injury as they jumped down.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/08/11/never-trump-republicans-could-have-their-revenge|title='Never Trump' Republicans could have their revenge|last=|first=|date=9 August 2018|work=The Economist|access-date=15 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The London Journal, and Weekly Record of Literature, Science, and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRRLAQAAMAAJ|year=1847|publisher=G.

Both enlisted men and officers joined the dangerous mission as an opportunity to raise themselves in the army.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Banzai charge]]\n* [[Battle of Sari Bair]]\n* [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]]\n* [[Cannon fodder]]\n* [[Frontal assault]]\n* [[Inghimasi]]\n* [[Kamikaze]]\n* [[Penal military unit]]\n* [[Shock troops]]\n* [[Suicide attack]]\n* [[Suicide mission]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Military slang and jargon]]\n[[Category:Siege tactics]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forlorn_hope"}

Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in [[Placodermi]] fossils. They lacked distinct teeth, having instead the oral surfaces of their jaw plates modified to serve the various purposes of teeth. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a [[Fish jaw|jawed mouth]]. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.\n\nFish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like [[sea squirt]], whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have [[Neoteny|kept the larval form into adulthood]] (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.\n\n===Taxonomy===\nFish are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group: that is, any [[clade]] containing all fish also contains the [[tetrapod]]s, which are not fish.

Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing [[countercurrent exchange]]. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx.

[[Gar]] and [[bowfin]] have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. [[Cypriniformes|Loaches]], [[Erythrinidae|trahiras]], and many [[catfish]] breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as [[gourami]]s and [[betta]]s) have a [[labyrinth (organ)|labyrinth organ]] above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]], [[Luciocephalidae|pikeheads]], and the [[Clariidae]] catfish family.\n\nBreathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and [[cichlid]]s, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of [[aestivation]] (summertime hibernation) until water returns.\n\nAir breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the [[African lungfish]], ''must'' breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish ''[[Hypostomus plecostomus]]'', only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.<ref name=\"Armbruster1998\"/>\n\n===Circulation===\n[[File:Didactic model of a fish heart--FMVZ USP-09.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a fish heart]]\nFish have a [[circulatory system|closed-loop circulatory system]]. The [[heart]] pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.<ref name=\"Setaro\">{{Cite book |last=Setaro |first=John F. |year=1999 |title=Circulatory System |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99}}</ref> The first part is the [[sinus venosus]], a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's [[vein]]s before allowing it to flow to the second part, the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]], which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, [[bulbus arteriosus]], a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the [[aorta]], through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.\n\n===Digestion===\nJaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the [[esophagus]]. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called [[pyloric caeca]], which secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\n===Excretion===\nAs with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as [[ammonia]]. Some of the wastes [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the gills. Blood wastes are [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] by the [[kidney]]s.\n\nSaltwater fish tend to lose water because of [[osmosis]]. Their kidneys return water to the body. The reverse happens in [[freshwater fish]]: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.\n\n===Scales===\n{{Main|Fish scale}}\nThe scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth.\n\n===Sensory and nervous system===\n[[File:Fish brain.png|thumb|upright|Dorsal view of the brain of the [[rainbow trout]]|alt=Anatomical diagram showing the pairs of olfactory, telencephalon, and optic lobes, followed by the cerebellum and the mylencephalon]]\n\n====Central nervous system====\nFish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\">{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably [[Mormyridae|mormyrids]] and [[shark]]s, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and [[marsupial]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=191}}</ref>\n\nFish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the [[olfactory bulb|olfactory lobes]], a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the [[nostril]]s via the two [[olfactory nerve]]s.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed [[telencephalon]], the structural equivalent to the [[cerebrum]] in [[amniote|higher vertebrates]]. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with [[olfaction]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> Together these structures form the forebrain.\n\nConnecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the [[diencephalon]] (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with [[hormone]]s and [[homeostasis]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> The [[pineal body]] lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains [[circadian]] rhythms, and controls color changes.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\nThe [[midbrain]] (or mesencephalon) contains the two [[Midbrain#Corpora quadrigemina|optic lobes]]. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as [[rainbow trout]] and [[cichlid]]s.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\nThe hindbrain (or [[metencephalon]]) is particularly involved in swimming and balance.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\" /> Hagfish and [[lamprey]]s have relatively small cerebellae, while the [[mormyrid]] cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their [[electric fish|electrical sense]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\nThe brain stem (or [[myelencephalon]]) is the brain's posterior.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> As well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[osmoregulation]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\n====Sense organs====\nMost fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see [[vision in fishes]]). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the [[lateral line system]], which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey.<ref name=\"Encarta 99\">{{Cite book |last=Orr |first=James |year=1999 |title=Fish |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99 |isbn=978-0-8114-2346-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/fearsomefishcree00stev }}</ref> Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]], organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.<ref>Albert, J.S., and W.G.R.

For example, [[manta rays]] have exhibited behavior linked to [[self-awareness]] in [[mirror test]] cases. Placed in front of a mirror, individual rays engaged in contingency testing, that is, repetitive behavior aiming to check whether their reflection's behavior mimics their body movement.<ref>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z Contingency checking and self-directed behaviors in giant manta rays: Do elasmobranchs have self-awareness?] - article at [https://link.springer.com/ Springer]</ref>\n\n[[Wrasses]] have also passed the mirror test in a 2018 scientific study.<ref>[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/397067v1 Cleaner wrasse pass the mark test.

Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British [[RSPCA]] now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1037515,00.html |title=The Times & The Sunday Times |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Emotion====\nIn 2019, scientists have shown that members of the [[monogamous]] species [[Amatitlania siquia]] exhibit pessimistic behavior when they are prevented from being with their partner.<ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0760</ref>\n\n===Muscular system===\n{{Main|Fish locomotion}}\n[[File:Swim bladder.jpg|thumb|Swim bladder of a rudd (''[[Scardinius erythrophthalmus]]'')|alt=Photo of white bladder that consists of a rectangular section and a banana-shaped section connected by a much thinner element]]\n\nMost fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a [[swim bladder]] that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.\n\n====Endothermy====\nAlthough most fish are exclusively [[ectothermic]], there are exceptions.

In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skates]]. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic fin]]s known as [[clasper]]s.\n\nMarine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column.

They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.\n\nIn [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the [[yolk]]. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.\n\nSome species of fish are [[viviparous]]. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placental mammals|mammals]] connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the [[Embiotocidae|surf-perches]], [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], and [[lemon shark]]. Some viviparous fish exhibit [[oophagy]], in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the [[halfbeak]] ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.<ref name=\"Meisner\">Meisner, A & Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae)\" ''Journal of Morphology'' 234, pp. 295\u2013317, 1997</ref> [[Intrauterine cannibalism]] is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings.

The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.<ref name=\"Bioacoustics\"/>\nThe sounds emitted can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. Fish can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.<ref name=\"Journal\"/>\n\n===Stridulatory sound producing mechanisms===\n[[File:French grunts - Haemulon flavolineatum.jpg|thumb|French grunts \u2013 Haemulon flavolineatum]]\nThere are some species of fish that can produce sounds by rubbing or grinding their bones together.

To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses. ''Non-specific'' defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that traps and inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s. If [[pathogen]]s breach these defenses, fish can develop an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers [[white blood cells]] that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an [[immune response]].<ref>{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=95\u201396}}</ref> In recent years, [[vaccine]]s have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example [[furunculosis]] vaccines in farmed [[salmon]] and [[koi herpes virus]] in [[koi]].<ref>R.C.

These fish rely on regions of [[lymphoid tissue]] within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[plasma cells]] are produced in the anterior kidney (or [[pronephros]]) and some areas of the gut (where [[granulocytes]] mature.) They resemble primitive [[bone marrow]] in hagfish.\n[[Cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to [[Chondrichthyes]]; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the [[Leydig's organ]] within the walls of their esophagus, and a [[spiral valve]] in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable [[thymus]] and a well-developed [[spleen]] (their most important immune organ) where various [[lymphocyte]]s, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.\n[[Chondrostean]] fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the [[meninges]] (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, [[reticular cell]]s and a small number of [[macrophage]]s. The chondrostean kidney is an important [[hemopoietic]] organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.\n\nLike chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or [[teleostei]]) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.<ref>D.P. Anderson. ''Fish Immunology''. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc.

When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a ''shoal'' or a ''school'' depending on the degree of organisation. A ''shoal'' is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. ''Schools'' of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction.

They are also caught by [[Recreational fishing|recreational fishers]], kept as pets, raised by [[Fishkeeping|fishkeepers]], and exhibited in public [[aquarium|aquaria]]. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as [[deity|deities]], religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.\n\n==Evolution==\n{{main|Evolution of fish}}Fish, as vertebrata, developed as sister of the tunicata. As the tetrapods emerged deep within the fishes group, as sister of the lungfish, characteristics of fish are typically shared by tetrapods, including having vertebrae and a cranium.[[File:Dunkleosteus BW.jpg|thumb|''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' was a gigantic, {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} long [[prehistoric fish]] of class Placodermi.|alt=Drawing of animal with large mouth, long tail, very small dorsal fins, and pectoral fins that attach towards the bottom of the body, resembling lizard legs in scale and development.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |title=Monster fish crushed opposition with strongest bite ever |newspaper=[[Smh.com.au]] |date=30 November 2006 |accessdate=26 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402143409/http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |archivedate=2 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Eastmanosteus pustulosus.jpg|thumb|Lower jaw of the placoderm ''[[Eastmanosteus]] pustulosus'', showing the shearing structures (\"teeth\") on its oral surface; from the [[Devonian]] of [[Wisconsin]].]]\n\nEarly fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small, jawless, armored fish known as [[ostracoderm]]s. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in [[Placodermi]] fossils. They lacked distinct teeth, having instead the oral surfaces of their jaw plates modified to serve the various purposes of teeth. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a [[Fish jaw|jawed mouth]]. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.\n\nFish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like [[sea squirt]], whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have [[Neoteny|kept the larval form into adulthood]] (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.\n\n===Taxonomy===\nFish are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group: that is, any [[clade]] containing all fish also contains the [[tetrapod]]s, which are not fish. For this reason, groups such as the class ''Pisces'' seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications.\n[[File:Leedsi&Liopl DB.jpg|thumb|[[Leedsichthys]] (left), of the subclass Actinopterygii, is the largest known fish, with estimates in 2005 putting its maximum size at {{convert|16|m}}.]]\n\nTraditional classification divides fish into three [[extant taxon|extant]] [[class (biology)|classes]], and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree, sometimes as their own classes:<ref name=\"Romer, A 1977\">[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. & T.S.

Gills consist of threadlike structures called [[Protein filament|filaments]]. Each filament contains a [[capillary]] network that provides a large [[surface area]] for exchanging [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing [[countercurrent exchange]]. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like [[shark]]s and [[lamprey]]s, possess multiple gill openings. However, [[bony fish]] have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]].\n\nJuvenile [[bichir]]s have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share with larval [[amphibian]]s.\n\n====Air breathing====\n[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|[[Tuna]] gills inside the head.

[[Amphibious fish]] such as the [[mudskipper]] can live and move about on land for up to several days,{{doubtful|date=December 2014}} or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of [[anguillidae|anguillid eels]] may absorb oxygen directly. The [[buccal cavity]] of the [[electric eel]] may breathe air. Catfish of the families [[Loricariidae]], [[Callichthyidae]], and [[Scoloplacidae]] absorb air through their digestive tracts.<ref name=\"Armbruster1998\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |title=Modifications of the Digestive Tract for Holding Air in Loricariid and Scoloplacid Catfishes |journal=[[Copeia]] |year=1998 |issue=3 |pages=663\u2013675 |doi=10.2307/1447796 |accessdate=25 June 2009 |volume=1998 |last1=Armbruster |first1=Jonathan W. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326130527/http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy-all |jstor=1447796 }}</ref> [[Lungfish]], with the exception of the [[Australian lungfish]], and [[bichir]]s have paired lungs similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. [[Gar]] and [[bowfin]] have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. [[Cypriniformes|Loaches]], [[Erythrinidae|trahiras]], and many [[catfish]] breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as [[gourami]]s and [[betta]]s) have a [[labyrinth (organ)|labyrinth organ]] above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]], [[Luciocephalidae|pikeheads]], and the [[Clariidae]] catfish family.\n\nBreathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and [[cichlid]]s, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of [[aestivation]] (summertime hibernation) until water returns.\n\nAir breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the [[African lungfish]], ''must'' breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish ''[[Hypostomus plecostomus]]'', only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.<ref name=\"Armbruster1998\"/>\n\n===Circulation===\n[[File:Didactic model of a fish heart--FMVZ USP-09.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a fish heart]]\nFish have a [[circulatory system|closed-loop circulatory system]]. The [[heart]] pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.<ref name=\"Setaro\">{{Cite book |last=Setaro |first=John F. |year=1999 |title=Circulatory System |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99}}</ref> The first part is the [[sinus venosus]], a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's [[vein]]s before allowing it to flow to the second part, the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]], which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, [[bulbus arteriosus]], a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the [[aorta]], through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.\n\n===Digestion===\nJaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the [[esophagus]]. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called [[pyloric caeca]], which secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\n===Excretion===\nAs with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as [[ammonia]]. Some of the wastes [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the gills. Blood wastes are [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] by the [[kidney]]s.\n\nSaltwater fish tend to lose water because of [[osmosis]]. Their kidneys return water to the body. The reverse happens in [[freshwater fish]]: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.\n\n===Scales===\n{{Main|Fish scale}}\nThe scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth.\n\n===Sensory and nervous system===\n[[File:Fish brain.png|thumb|upright|Dorsal view of the brain of the [[rainbow trout]]|alt=Anatomical diagram showing the pairs of olfactory, telencephalon, and optic lobes, followed by the cerebellum and the mylencephalon]]\n\n====Central nervous system====\nFish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\">{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably [[Mormyridae|mormyrids]] and [[shark]]s, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and [[marsupial]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=191}}</ref>\n\nFish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the [[olfactory bulb|olfactory lobes]], a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the [[nostril]]s via the two [[olfactory nerve]]s.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed [[telencephalon]], the structural equivalent to the [[cerebrum]] in [[amniote|higher vertebrates]]. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with [[olfaction]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> Together these structures form the forebrain.\n\nConnecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the [[diencephalon]] (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with [[hormone]]s and [[homeostasis]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> The [[pineal body]] lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains [[circadian]] rhythms, and controls color changes.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\nThe [[midbrain]] (or mesencephalon) contains the two [[Midbrain#Corpora quadrigemina|optic lobes]]. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as [[rainbow trout]] and [[cichlid]]s.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\nThe hindbrain (or [[metencephalon]]) is particularly involved in swimming and balance.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\" /> Hagfish and [[lamprey]]s have relatively small cerebellae, while the [[mormyrid]] cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their [[electric fish|electrical sense]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\nThe brain stem (or [[myelencephalon]]) is the brain's posterior.<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/> As well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[osmoregulation]].<ref name=\"Helfman_brain\"/>\n\n====Sense organs====\nMost fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see [[vision in fishes]]). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the [[lateral line system]], which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey.<ref name=\"Encarta 99\">{{Cite book |last=Orr |first=James |year=1999 |title=Fish |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99 |isbn=978-0-8114-2346-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/fearsomefishcree00stev }}</ref> Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]], organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.<ref>Albert, J.S., and W.G.R.

These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a [[swim bladder]] that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.\n\n====Endothermy====\nAlthough most fish are exclusively [[ectothermic]], there are exceptions.

In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skates]]. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic fin]]s known as [[clasper]]s.\n\nMarine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column.

They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.\n\nIn [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the [[yolk]]. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.\n\nSome species of fish are [[viviparous]]. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placental mammals|mammals]] connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the [[Embiotocidae|surf-perches]], [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], and [[lemon shark]]. Some viviparous fish exhibit [[oophagy]], in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the [[halfbeak]] ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.<ref name=\"Meisner\">Meisner, A & Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae)\" ''Journal of Morphology'' 234, pp. 295\u2013317, 1997</ref> [[Intrauterine cannibalism]] is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings.

To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses. ''Non-specific'' defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that traps and inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s. If [[pathogen]]s breach these defenses, fish can develop an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers [[white blood cells]] that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an [[immune response]].<ref>{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=95\u201396}}</ref> In recent years, [[vaccine]]s have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example [[furunculosis]] vaccines in farmed [[salmon]] and [[koi herpes virus]] in [[koi]].<ref>R.C.

Iwama and T.Nakanishi,), New York, Academic Press, 1996, pp. 1\u201355.</ref>\nIn the [[jawless fish]] (lampreys and hagfish), true [[lymph]]oid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of [[lymphoid tissue]] within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[plasma cells]] are produced in the anterior kidney (or [[pronephros]]) and some areas of the gut (where [[granulocytes]] mature.) They resemble primitive [[bone marrow]] in hagfish.\n[[Cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to [[Chondrichthyes]]; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the [[Leydig's organ]] within the walls of their esophagus, and a [[spiral valve]] in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable [[thymus]] and a well-developed [[spleen]] (their most important immune organ) where various [[lymphocyte]]s, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.\n[[Chondrostean]] fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the [[meninges]] (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, [[reticular cell]]s and a small number of [[macrophage]]s. The chondrostean kidney is an important [[hemopoietic]] organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.\n\nLike chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or [[teleostei]]) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.<ref>D.P. Anderson. ''Fish Immunology''. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc.

When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a ''shoal'' or a ''school'' depending on the degree of organisation. A ''shoal'' is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. ''Schools'' of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.<ref>{{cite book |last=Helfman |first=G. |last2=Collette |first2=B. |last3=Facey |first3=D. |year=1997 |title=The Diversity of Fishes |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |page=375 |isbn=978-0-86542-256-8}}</ref>\n\nExamples:\n* Cichlids congregating at [[Lek (mating arena)|lekking]] sites form an ''aggregation''.\n* Many minnows and characins form ''shoals''.\n* Anchovies, herrings and silversides are classic examples of ''schooling'' fish.\n\nWhile the words \"school\" and \"shoal\" have different meanings within biology, the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat the words as [[synonym]]s.

The game was released for [[iOS]] in September 2019, [[macOS]] in October 2019, with [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] versions scheduled for release on May 28, 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAs a return to the style of the first three entries in the series, the game follows the half-genie [[Shantae (character)|Shantae]] as she explores an interconnected world. During her journey, Shantae encounters towns with non-player characters to interact with, as well as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon]]-style labyrinths containing new abilities to unlock and bosses to defeat. Shantae retains her ability to transform into other creatures, now utilized via an ability called \"fusion magic\" that allows her to instantly transform and use a creature's ability without having to select it like in past games. Additional special abilities can be performed by dancing. A new collectible card system allows players to obtain monster cards and use them to augment Shantae's abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/wayforward_reveals_shantae_and_the_seven_sirens_the_half-genie_heros_next_adventure|title=WayForward Reveals Shantae And The Seven Sirens, The Half-Genie Hero's Next Adventure|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|last=Doolan|first=Liam|date=August 14, 2019|accessdate=August 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815143149/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/wayforward_reveals_shantae_and_the_seven_sirens_the_half-genie_heros_next_adventure|archive-date=August 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Like other games in the series, completing the story awards the player with bonus artwork based on their final time and completion percentage, and unlocks a [[New Game Plus]] mode, which gives Shantae all of her transformations from the start of the game, in order to facilitate [[speedrun]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game follows the half-genie Shantae as she and her friends are invited to a tropical island to participate in the Half-Genie Festival.
