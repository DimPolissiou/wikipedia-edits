Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, has been released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast will premiere on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{main|List of Money Heist episodes}}\n{{:List of Money Heist episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017) ===\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman named \"Tokyo\", as a man named the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police and proposes her a heist of drastic proportions. After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<!-- Main and recurring are split and ordered as they appear in the series' credits. -->\n* [[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]] as Silene Oliveira (Tokyo): the narrator; she was a runaway robber until scouted by the Professor to participate in his plan.\n* [[Itziar Itu\u00f1o]] as Raquel Murillo (Lisbon): an inspector of the [[National Police Corps]] who is put in charge of the case until she joins the group in part 3.\n* [[\u00c1lvaro Morte]] as Sergio Marquina (The Professor / Salvador \"Salva\" Mart\u00edn): the mastermind of the heist who assembled the group, and Berlin's brother.\n* [[Paco Tous]] as Agust\u00edn Ramos (Moscow) (part 1\u20132; featured part 3\u20134): a former miner turned criminal and Denver's father.\n* [[Pedro Alonso]] as Andr\u00e9s de Fonollosa (Berlin): a terminally ill jewel thief and the Professor's second-in-command and brother.\n* [[Alba Flores]] as \u00c1gata Jim\u00e9nez (Nairobi) (part 1\u20134): an expert in forgery in charge of printing the money for the group.\n* [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]] as An\u00edbal Cort\u00e9s (Rio): a young hacker and Tokyo's boyfriend.\n* [[Jaime Lorente]] as Daniel Ricardo \u201cDani\u201d Ramos (Denver): Moscow's son who joins him in the heist.\n* [[Esther Acebo]] as M\u00f3nica Gaztambide (Stockholm): one of the hostages who is Arturo Rom\u00e1n's secretary and mistress, carrying his child out of wedlock.

Now we want more, which is not little.\"<ref name=elpais_170503 /> Reviewing the full first part, Marcos lauded the series for its outstanding direction, musical selection and for trying to innovate Spanish television, but criticized the length and ebbing tension.<ref name=elpais_171124>{{cite web |url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2017/11/24/television/1511480525_162365.html |title=\u2018La casa de papel\u2019 ha ganado |language=es |last=Marcos |first=Natalia |website=[[elpais.com]] |access-date=12 August 2019 |date=24 November 2017}}</ref> At the end of the series' original run, Nay\u00edn Costas of ''El Confidencial'' commended the series for its \"high quality closure\" that may make the finale \"one of the best episodes of the Spanish season\", but regretted that it aimed to satisfy viewers with a predictable happy ending rather than risk to \"do something different, original, ambitious\", and that the show was unable to follow in the footsteps of Pina's ''[[Locked Up (TV series)|Locked Up]]''.<ref name=elconfidencial_171123>{{cite web |last=Costas |first=Nay\u00edn |url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/television/series-tv/2017-11-23/final-como-acaba-la-casa-de-papel-muerte-berlin-hermano-profesor_1482592/ |title=Final feliz en 'La casa de papel', un gran cap\u00edtulo lastrado por la falta de sorpresa |language=es |publisher=elconfidencial.com |date=23 November 2017 |access-date=5 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the show's move to Netflix for its international release, Adrian Hennigan of the Israeli ''[[Haaretz]]'' said the series was \"more of a twisty thriller than soapy telenovela, driven by its ingenious plot, engaging characters, tense flash points, pulsating score and occasional moments of humor\", but taunted the English title \"Money Heist\" as bland.<ref name=haaretz_180807 /> In a scathing review, Pauline Bock of the British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' questioned the global hype of the series, saying that it was \"full of plot holes, clich\u00e9d slow-motions, corny love stories and gratuitous sex scenes\", before continuing to add that \"the music is pompous, the voice-over irritating, and it's terribly edited\".<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> [[John Doyle (critic)|John Doyle]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' praised parts 1 and 2 for the heist genre subversions; he also said that the series could be \"deliciously melodramatic at times\" with \"outrageous twists and much passion\" like a telenovela.<ref name=theglobeandmail>{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-three-great-foreign-dramas-on-netflix-for-a-summer-binge/?cmpid=rss1 |title=Three great foreign dramas on Netflix for a summer binge |last=Doyle |first=John |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=12 August 2019 |date=22 June 2018}}</ref> Jennifer Keishin Armstrong of the [[BBC]] saw the series' true appeal in the interpersonal dramas emerging through the heist between \"the beautiful robbers, their beautiful hostages and the beautiful authorities trying to negotiate with them.\"<ref name=bbc_190312 /> David Hugendick of ''[[Die Zeit]]'' found the series \"sometimes a bit sentimental, a little cartoonesque\", and the drama sometimes too telenovela-like, but \"all with a good sense for timing and spectacle.\"<ref name=zeit_180410>{{cite web |last=Hugendick |first=David |url=https://www.zeit.de/kultur/film/2018-04/haus-des-geldes-serie-netflix |title=Knackt das System! |language=de |publisher=[[zeit.de]] |date=10 April 2018 |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave part 3 an approval rating of 100% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10.

He felt unaffected by the internal drama between the characters and specifically disliked Tokyo's narration for its hollowness.<ref name=elespanol_190724 /> Alex Jim\u00e9nez of Spanish newspaper ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' found part 3 mostly succeeding in its attempts to reinvent the show and stay fresh.<ref name=abc_190725 />  Euan Ferguson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' recommended watching part 3, as \"it's still a glorious ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'', just with [[tapas]] and subtitles\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/28/week-in-tv-i-am-nicola-orange-is-new-black-keeping-faith-money-heist |title=The week in TV: I Am Nicola; Orange Is the New Black; Keeping Faith; Money Heist |last=Ferguson |first=Euan |publisher=theguardian.com |access-date=7 October 2019 |date=28 July 2019}}</ref> while Pere Sol\u00e0 Gimferrer of ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' found that the amount of plot holes in part 3 could only be endured with constant [[suspension of disbelief]].<ref name=lavanguardia_190809 /> Though entertained, Alfonso Rivadeneyra Garc\u00eda of Peruvian newspaper ''[[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]]'' said the show does \"what it does best: pretend to be the smartest boy in class when, in fact, it is only the most alive.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elcomercio.pe/tvmas/series/casa-papel-temporada-3-review-resena-spoilers-netflix-ecpm-noticia-654511 |title=\"La casa de papel\" temporada 3: rese\u00f1amos sin SPOILERS los primeros 3 episodios |language=es |last=Rivadeneyra Garc\u00eda |first=Alfonso |publisher=elcomercio.pe |access-date=3 October 2019 |date=19 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, has been released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast will premiere on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{main|List of Money Heist episodes}}\n{{:List of Money Heist episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017) ===\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman named \"Tokyo\", as a man named the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police and proposes her a heist of drastic proportions. After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<!-- Main and recurring are split and ordered as they appear in the series' credits. -->\n* [[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]] as Silene Oliveira (Tokyo): the narrator; she was a runaway robber until scouted by the Professor to participate in his plan.\n* [[Itziar Itu\u00f1o]] as Raquel Murillo (Lisbon): an inspector of the [[National Police Corps]] who is put in charge of the case until she joins the group in part 3.\n* [[\u00c1lvaro Morte]] as Sergio Marquina (The Professor / Salvador \"Salva\" Mart\u00edn): the mastermind of the heist who assembled the group, and Berlin's brother.\n* [[Paco Tous]] as Agust\u00edn Ramos (Moscow) (part 1\u20132; featured part 3\u20134): a former miner turned criminal and Denver's father.\n* [[Pedro Alonso]] as Andr\u00e9s de Fonollosa (Berlin): a terminally ill jewel thief and the Professor's second-in-command and brother.\n* [[Alba Flores]] as \u00c1gata Jim\u00e9nez (Nairobi): an expert in forgery in charge of printing the money for the group.\n* [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]] as An\u00edbal Cort\u00e9s (Rio): a young hacker and Tokyo's boyfriend.\n* [[Jaime Lorente]] as Daniel Ricardo \u201cDani\u201d Ramos (Denver): Moscow's son who joins him in the heist.\n* [[Esther Acebo]] as M\u00f3nica Gaztambide (Stockholm): one of the hostages who is Arturo Rom\u00e1n's secretary and mistress, carrying his child out of wedlock.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\". These X Crystals unlock special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which can unlock and upgrade modules.

[[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals.

During the 1700s laundry was hung on bushes, limbs or lines to dry but no clothespins can be found in any painting or prints of the era. The clothespin for hanging up wet laundry only appears in the early 19th century patented by [[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Victor Opdebec]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} This design does not use springs, but is fashioned in one piece, with the two prongs part of the peg chassis with only a small distance between them\u2014this form of peg creates the gripping action due to the two prongs being wedged apart and thus squeezing together in that the prongs want to return to their initial, resting state.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This form of peg is often fashioned from plastic, or originally, wood. In England, clothes-peg making used to be a craft associated with [[Romani people|the Romani people]], commonly known by the slur gypsy, who made clothes-pegs from small, split lengths of [[willow]] or [[ash tree|ash]] wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merl.org.uk/online_exhibitions/gypsylife/crafts.htm |title=Crafts |publisher=Merl.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A Working Class Family in Wartime- Every Day Life With the Suter Family in London, 1940 D788.jpg|thumb|Londoner using clothes-pegs in 1940]]\nToday, many clothes-pegs (also clothespins) are manufactured very cheaply by creating two interlocking plastic or wooden prongs, in between which is often wedged a small [[spring (device)|spring]].

It was one of his hobbies. He used to think clearly whenever playing violin, thinking about every day problems. That was how he came up with the idea to invent a clothespin.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe design by Smith was improved by [[Solon E. Moore]] in 1887. He added what he called a \"coiled fulcrum\" made from a single wire, this was the spring that held the wooden pieces together, acted as a spring forcing them to shut, and as a [[Lever|fulcrum]] on which the two halves could rock, eliminating the need for a separate component, and reducing [[manufacturing cost]]s.<ref name=who/> This became the first successful spring-actuated clothespin, being manufactured and sold in huge quantities all across the United States. The state of Vermont, and its capitol of [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], in particular, quickly became what [[The New York Times]] has called \"The [[Silicon Valley]] of Clothespin Manufacturing\", the United States Clothespin Company opening in 1887 to manufacture Moore's improved design. Vermonter [[Stephen Thomas (Medal of Honor)|Stephen Thomas]], a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as [[President (corporate title)|company president]], and the company enjoyed a significant level of success, in spite of the competitors that rapidly sprang up in [[Waterbury, Vermont|Waterbury]] and other places. Most significant was in 1909, when Allan Moore, one of the U.S.C. Co. employees, devised a way in which clothespins could be manufactured more cheaply, by eliminating one of the coils in the \"spring fulcrum\".

It was one of his hobbies. He used to think clearly whenever playing violin, thinking about every day problems. That was how he came up with the idea to invent a clothespin.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe design by Smith was improved by [[Solon E. Moore]] in 1887. He added what he called a \"coiled fulcrum\" made from a single wire, this was the spring that held the wooden pieces together, acted as a spring forcing them to shut, and as a [[Lever|fulcrum]] on which the two halves could rock, eliminating the need for a separate component, and reducing [[manufacturing cost]]s.<ref name=who/> This became the first successful spring-actuated clothespin, being manufactured and sold in huge quantities all across the United States. The state of Vermont, and its capitol of [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], in particular, quickly became what [[The New York Times]] has called \"The [[Silicon Valley]] of Clothespin Manufacturing\", the United States Clothespin Company opening in 1887 to manufacture Moore's improved design. Vermonter [[Stephen Thomas (Medal of Honor)|Stephen Thomas]], a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as [[President (corporate title)|company president]], and the company enjoyed a significant level of success, in spite of the competitors that rapidly sprang up in [[Waterbury, Vermont|Waterbury]] and other places. Most significant was in 1909, when Allan Moore, one of the U.S.C. Co. employees, devised a way in which clothespins could be manufactured more cheaply, by eliminating one of the coils in the \"spring fulcrum\". He left the company, and with a loan from a local [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] opened a competing factory, literally across the street from the U.S.C. Co. building. The new National Clothespin Company rapidly overtook the U.S.C. Co., consuming 500,000 [[Board foot|board-feet]] of lumber at the height of production.

Produced and co-written by [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]], it was recorded for Summer's fifth studio album, ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]'' (1977). The album concept was to have each track evoke a different musical decade; for \"I Feel Love\", the team aimed to create a futuristic mood, employing a [[Moog synthesizer]].  \n\n\"I Feel Love\" was released May 1, 1977, just before release of the album, as the B-side to the single \"Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)\", which rose to #20 on the US R&B chart. Two months later, the sides were flipped and the single was reissued. \"I Feel Love\" was a number one hit in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, number three in Germany and Italy, number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the United States, and also topped the charts in many other countries.<ref name=\"krautrock\"/>\n\n\"I Feel Love\" became popular during the [[disco]] period,<ref>{{cite web|author=Benjamin Genocchio|url=http://www.rozanehmagazine.com/MarchApril06/Anegarafkhami.pdf|title=Exploring the Effects of Disco's Beat|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date= February 19, 2006}}</ref> influencing artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[Brian Eno]], [[the Human League]], and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/song-from-the-future-the-story-of-donna-summer-and-giorgio-moroders-i-feel-love/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)]]|title=Song from the Future: The Story of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \u201cI Feel Love\u201d|author=[[Simon Reynolds]]|date=June 29, 2017}}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' credited it as \"one of the most influential records ever made\", laying the foundations for [[electronic dance music]].<ref name=Cheal>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/147b4da8-27e3-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89|author= David Cheal|title=The Life of a Song: 'I Feel Love'|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date= June 3, 2016}}</ref> In 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] added the song to the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Recording Registry Listing|accessdate=December 3, 2017|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/nominate/|title=Nominate - National Recording Preservation Board|accessdate=December 3, 2017|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> It has been covered by acts including [[Bronski Beat]], [[Messiah (UK duo)|Messiah]] and [[Sam Smith]].\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Giorgio Moroder Melt! 2015 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Giorgio Moroder in 2015]]\n\nIn 1970s Munich, [[Musicland Studios]], led by producers [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte|Pete Bellotte]], had produced a number of disco hits, including [[Donna Summer|Donna Summer's]] 1975 single \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love To Love You Baby]]\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://mixmag.net/feature/i-feel-love-donna-summer-and-giorgio-moroder-created-the-template-for-dance-music-as-we-know-it|title=I feel love: Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder created the template for dance music as we know it|work=Mixmag|access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> Summer had moved to Munich to perform in the musical [[Hair (musical)|''Hair'']], and had become a successful [[session vocalist]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Moroder described her as \"an incredibly talented singer, who could improvise but was also very disciplined\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor Summer's fifth album, ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]'' (1977), the production team wanted the album to be \"a journey through music of the ages\",<ref name=Cheal/> with each track evoking a different musical decade, such as 40s [[Swing music|swing]], 60s [[girl group]]s, and 70s [[funk]] and [[disco]].

impressing Moroder, became a popular \"underground classic\" available only on [[acetate disc]]s.<ref name=disconet>{{citation|title=DJ News Vol. 3 Program 7|publisher=Disconet|date=June

overdubbed effects and synthesiser parts.\n\nIn mid-1980, Cowley's mix was released with the title \"I Feel Love / I Feel Megalove\" and subtitle \"The Patrick Cowley MegaMix\", but only on a limited vinyl pressing by the [[Remix service|DJ-only subscription service]] Disconet.<ref name=disconet/> Since this pressing was not available to the general public for commercial sale, it became highly sought after by collectors.\n\nIn 1982, the mix was released on a commercially available 12\" single in the UK market by [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]], backed with an 8-minute edited version.<ref

Feel Love\" became a dance floor hit again, five years after its debut. A further-edited 7\" single reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe Patrick Cowley mix was out of print until it was released on the bonus disc of the 2003 UK edition of ''[[The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer]]'' and the [[Ben Liebrand]] compilation album ''Grand 12-Inches''. It also exists on the 2013 double disc ''I Feel Love: The Collection''.\n\n==1995 and 2013 remixes==\n\nFollowing 1993's ''[[The Donna Summer Anthology]]'' and 1994's ''[[Endless Summer: Greatest Hits]]'', both released by [[PolyGram]], \"I Feel Love\" was re-released on the PolyGram sublabel Manifesto in a newly remixed form as a single in 1995, including mixes by [[Masters at Work]] and production duo [[Rollo Armstrong|Rollo &]] [[Sister Bliss]] of UK electronic group [[Faithless]] \u2013 and also new vocals by Summer. The single became a UK number 8 hit,<ref name=uk/> the second time the song had entered the Top 10,<ref name=uk/> and the '95 Radio Edit was later included as a bonus track on PolyGram France's version of the ''Endless Summer'' compilation.

Produced and co-written by [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]], it was recorded for Summer's fifth studio album, ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]'' (1977). The album concept was to have each track evoke a different musical decade; for \"I Feel Love\", the team aimed to create a futuristic mood, employing a [[Moog synthesizer]].  \n\n\"I Feel Love\" was released May 1, 1977, just before release of the album, as the B-side to the single \"Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)\", which rose to #20 on the US R&B chart. Two months later, the sides were flipped and the single was reissued. \"I Feel Love\" was a number one hit in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, number three in Germany and Italy, number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the United States, and also topped the charts in many other countries.<ref name=\"krautrock\"/>\n\n\"I Feel Love\" became popular during the [[disco]] period,<ref>{{cite web|author=Benjamin Genocchio|url=http://www.rozanehmagazine.com/MarchApril06/Anegarafkhami.pdf|title=Exploring the Effects of Disco's Beat|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date= February 19, 2006}}</ref> influencing artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[Brian Eno]], [[the Human League]], and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/song-from-the-future-the-story-of-donna-summer-and-giorgio-moroders-i-feel-love/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)]]|title=Song from the Future: The Story of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder\u2019s \u201cI Feel Love\u201d|author=[[Simon Reynolds]]|date=June 29, 2017}}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' credited it as \"one of the most influential records ever made\", laying the foundations for [[electronic dance music]].<ref name=Cheal>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/147b4da8-27e3-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89|author= David Cheal|title=The Life of a Song: 'I Feel Love'|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date= June 3, 2016}}</ref> In 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] added the song to the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Recording Registry Listing|accessdate=December 3, 2017|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/nominate/|title=Nominate - National Recording Preservation Board|accessdate=December 3, 2017|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> It has been covered by acts including [[Bronski Beat]], [[Messiah (UK duo)|Messiah]] and [[Sam Smith]].\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Giorgio Moroder Melt! 2015 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Giorgio Moroder in 2015]]\n\nIn 1970s Munich, [[Musicland Studios]], led by producers [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte|Pete Bellotte]], had produced a number of disco hits, including [[Donna Summer|Donna Summer's]] 1975 single \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love To Love You Baby]]\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://mixmag.net/feature/i-feel-love-donna-summer-and-giorgio-moroder-created-the-template-for-dance-music-as-we-know-it|title=I feel love: Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder created the template for dance music as we know it|work=Mixmag|access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> Summer had moved to Munich to perform in the musical [[Hair (musical)|''Hair'']], and had become a successful [[session vocalist]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Moroder described her as \"an incredibly talented singer, who could improvise but was also very disciplined\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor Summer's fifth album, ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]'' (1977), the production team wanted the album to be \"a journey through music of the ages\",<ref name=Cheal/> with each track evoking a different musical decade, such as 40s [[Swing music|swing]], 60s [[girl group]]s, and 70s [[funk]] and [[disco]].

overdubbed effects and synthesiser parts.\n\nIn mid-1980, Cowley's mix was released with the title \"I Feel Love / I Feel Megalove\" and subtitle \"The Patrick Cowley MegaMix\", but only on a limited vinyl pressing by the [[Remix service|DJ-only subscription service]] Disconet.<ref name=disconet/> Since this pressing was not available to the general public for commercial sale, it became highly sought after by collectors.\n\nIn 1982, the mix was released on a commercially available 12\" single in the UK market by [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]], backed with an 8-minute edited version.<ref

A further-edited 7\" single reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe Patrick Cowley mix was out of print until it was released on the bonus disc of the 2003 UK edition of ''[[The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer]]'' and the [[Ben Liebrand]] compilation album ''Grand 12-Inches''.

The single became a UK number 8 hit,<ref name=uk/> the second time the song had entered the Top 10,<ref name=uk/> and the '95 Radio Edit was later included as a bonus track on PolyGram France's version of the ''Endless Summer'' compilation.

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\".

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

O'Connell rejected international and industrial production methods, seeking a return a smaller scale, more personalised, craft.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=20}}{{sfn|Leland|2004}} While his main inspiration for the building was early medieval architecture, a number of recently built churches in [[County Cork]] informed his choices, in particular [[Timoleague]]'s parish church and the chapel in [[Gougane Barra]].{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}}\n\n[[File:Honan interior 1.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The nave, looking west towards the main entrance]]\nThe chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=164}} Its interior has a very simple outlay,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}  consisting of four areas; the main entrance, nave, chancel and nunnery.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}} Unusually the chapel does not contain [[aisle]]s or [[transept]]s, and the six-bay {{sfn|NIAH|2000}} rectangular [[nave]] is rather plain.{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the chapel, the architecture is austere and modest.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} Functionally, the chapel lacks shrines where people could light candles or place flowers near devotional images, making it similar to a Protestant rather than a Catholic church.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=25}} Its round bell-tower (''[[campanile]]'') and circular-plan are inspired by the [[Irish round tower|round towers]] found in Irish [[monastic settlement]]s from the 9th century.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} \n\nThe main entrance is on the western side, and approached via double-hinged [[wrought iron]] gates.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} The doorway is capped by three limestone [[Rib vault|ribbed]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]],{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}} supported by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] containing [[relief]]s of the heads of six [[Munster]] saints: Finnbarr of Cork, [[Colman mac Duagh|Coleman of Cloyne]]; [[St. Gobnait]] of [[Ballyvourney]]; [[Brendan]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore]] and [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} Each figure was later represented in the stained glass windows.

Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to the subject's \"trickster\" [[Paganism|pagan]] powers\" than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time.
