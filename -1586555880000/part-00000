The village of Cap-\u00e0-l'aigle is bypassed on the north side by [[Quebec route 138|route 138]] (Malcom Fraser Boulevard) along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River.

This paronic road has many coasts, due to erosion by streams running down the mountains. This row consists of several houses and farm buildings typical of the beginning of the XXe century.

In 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] attributed to present-day Mount Remous in [[Saint-Fid\u00e8le]] (located 10&nbsp;km northeast of the current village of Cap-\u00e0-l'Aigle), the designation of Cape to Eagle (modern maps designate \"Gros Cap-\u00e0-l'Aigle\"); it is a land advance of 228 m in height and more extensive. However, [[Samuel de Champlain]] would have made a mistake in locating this \"cape at L'Aigle\" by locating it 8 leagues (24 miles or 38&nbsp;km) from Salmon Head; the distance is about 2 leagues (about 6 miles or 11&nbsp;km).\n\nThis could be an editing error, since [[Samuel de Champlain]]'s estimate of the distance between the current [[Port-aux-Quilles]] (now a sector of the municipality of [[Saint-Sim\u00e9on, Capitale-Nationale, Quebec|Saint-Sim\u00e9on (Charlevoix-Est)]]) and the cape Salmon is rigorously exact. In this respect, in 1993, Louis Pelletier raises the hypothesis that this course, mentioned by [[Samuel de Champlain]], while not corresponding to the course of the current Eagle, can not be precisely located.\n\nOn a cartographic document drawn around 1641, Jean Bourdon identifies a \"cape \u00e0 l'Aigle\" which corresponds to the location of \"Gros cap \u00e0 l'Aigle\", located much further to the east, as mentioned in 1824 by Georges Duberger. The English forms Cape Eagle and Eagle's Cape appear frequently in cartographic documents of the 18th and 19th century.\n\nIn the course of history, the name \"Cap \u00e0 l'Aigle\" has been associated with several toponymic names of this region: a small and a large rocky cape, a concession, a rank, a village, a municipality, a cove (between 1800 and 1814) and an area of [[La Malbaie]]. In the first half of the 19th century, the designation \"Cap-\u00e0-l'Aigle\" applied by borrowing to the current rocky natural course. By popular usage, this toponymic designation was probably derived from the appellations of the Cape to the Ancient Eagle or the current Gros Cap \u00e0 l'Aigle.<ref>Book: \"Names and Places of Quebec\", work of the [[Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec]], published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM produced by the Micro-Intel company, in 1997, from this dictionary.</ref>\n\nSeveral rocky capes of Charlevoix on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River are designated by bird names including: cape crows, goose cape and cape crows, Cap-\u00e0-l'Aigle (small) and Gros-Cap -to-the Eagle.
