The village is over 450 years old and lies north-east of [[Churu]] and {{Convert|25|km|mi}} from Churu town. Bordering villages include [[Ranwa Ki Dhani]], [[Lalasar]], [[Ginadi Taal]], [[Inderpura]], [[Thalori]] and [[Bhamasi]].\n\nThe 43 [[bigha]] village has an overall population of 998.<ref>http://churu.nic.in/pages/gpcensus/pschuru.pdf{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Pre-Indian Independence==\nOne view is that some 450 years ago, there was a [[jagayat]] centre (authorised resting place for travellers on payment) on the way (sub trade route [[Taranagar]] (RINI) - Churu). The jagayti (contractor owner of the place) had to pay 1 [[gini (coin)|gini]] (a gold coin equal to 1/2 of a [[mohar]]). The centre, therefore, was called Giniwala.\n\nDuring the war between Rai Sigh Rathore (a son of the [[Bika Rathore]] of then newly established state [[Bikaner]]) and the [[Poonia]] chief Kanha Deo of Jhansal (near [[Hisar, India|Hissar]]) many Poonia families were displaced. One Ramkishan [[Poonia]] family migrated from the village Binjawas ([[Rajgadh]]) to adjoining area of [[Shekhawati]] region Neema ki dhani. The Poonia family along with the families of ancestors of Deepa Karel, ancestors of Roopdas Swami and ancestors of Balaram Meghwal further displaced reached the Giniwala Jagayat - centre and established their dhani (residence) there.\n\n===Relics===\nThe \"Theh\" (remains of earthen pots) at Rathion Ki Dhani and south of the village site at farmlands of Kanaram Kulhari and Richhpal Poonia. The Babal Kunds and the Chhatri there, the Bodia Kua and the memorial chabutra of Meghrajot [[Singh]] near or under the house of [[Ramnarayan]].\n\n===Village administration===\nThe village along with 24 others was under the [[jagir]] of Rajpura Thakur. Poonia, Udaram and his ancestors, were village [[Choudhary]] and [[Meghwal]] the village Kotwal. The Choudhary collected land revenue (Rakam) and arbitrated the village disputes. The Kotwal functioned as Ahalkar (messenger-cum-attendant) of the [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]] and Choudhary. Due to untimely death of Choudhary Rajuram and his ailing son Surjaram Poonia, Chimnaram [[Tetarwal]] was appointed as co-choudhary of the village 20 years before abolition of the jagirdari system.\n\n===Housing  and construction===\n[[File:Matka in Village.JPG|thumb|Matka in the Village]]\n\nIn the past there were huts and Saals (room built with clay and limestone and with thatched ceiling). The first pakka room (built with chuna (baked limestone) and khor (nodules of clay) used with Dhandhla stone) was built by Motaram Poonia followed by Bhinwam chamar, Chimnaram Tetarwal & Udaram Poonia.  The four rooms, kua, johra, three kunds (Babal kunds along with the Babal chhatri and the memorial chabutra) were the only pakka structures before independence.\n\n==After independence==\n\n===Village government===\nThe village is governed by Panchayati Raj System. In the first panchayat election, the village along with 14 others, was under Sehjusar gram PANCHYAT. Later on it became part of Inderpura panchayat and now it is a part of Lalasr Banirotan. Presently out of total 9 members of the panchayat 3 panchas are elected from Ginadi. The panchayat is under Vikas Samiti Churu. It is part of the Churu MLA constituency. During first two panchayats, Nyay Samitis at panchayat levels were also constituted. Ch. Magaram Poonia of the village was elected member of the nyay Samiti. Secretary Panchayat, Patwari, Gram Sewak, Vyavsthapak cooperative society, waterman, lineman & Sathin Aanganbari Kendra are village-level government functionaries. The village is under Dudhwakhara police station.\n\n===Village economy===\nAlmost all the families of the village are engaged in farming. However, some members of the families are engaged in services & other activities. There are three male government teachers, two female government teachers, five private school teachers, five nurses, one railway, one in the RAC, three state policemen, six in army, three in water Works department, five retired [[Havildars]], 22 work in [[Arab]] countries, there are two accountants, one retired government PG college principal, one private college lecturer, two engineers, three (MBA) managers, two lawyers & twenty persons working in factories outside the village. As can be seen from these figures, out of the 220 families (houses) more than 85 villagers are employed in occupations other than agriculture.\n\nThere are four private schools established and operated by the villagers, two in the village and two at Jodhpur.\n\nApart from agriculture, live-stock activities are also carried on in the village, almost every household has some sort of animals with it. There are ten 'Rewads'(a herd of sheep and goats), 30 camels, 60 cows with one village bull,160 buffaloes with a common \"Jhota\"( he buffalo), two mares & 4 donkeys. The village is counted as one of the best villages in the tehsil. Almost every household has a pakka room with pakki boundaries & there are good havelis.\n\nBut as compared with the position of the village some 50 years ago, in general, the financial position has worsened. Then, out of 125 households only 25 houses were indebted, but now out of 220 households more than 160 are indebted. Thus indebtedness has risen from 20% to more than 75%.\n\nReasons of rise in indebtedness are many. On one hand are positive changes in lifestyle, raising of living standards, now people eat better, wear better clothes, use amenities and facilities seen in towns. Villagers spend on education, transportation, and medication. But the biggest setback has been the adverse farming conditions. In the past, every member of the family earned: children raised livestock, [[ghee]] was sold to arrange for groceries, every bye-product of farming - woods, fodder etc. - fetched a hefty income. The costs in farming were little, medical expenses almost non-existent, no expense on water-electricity, no education expense, no transportation expense; no expense on detergents & cosmetics. The expenses were very few since the living standards were low and even little income led to an economy of surplus & self-reliance. In addition, farmers do not know where their interests lie. They support rallies that seek to curb prices of farm produce in guise of controlling inflation. As a matter of fact such rallies are to benefit other sections of society at the cost of the farmer.\n\n===Transportation===\nGinadi is connected by a two lane asphalt road to Churu. Churu Railway station, {{Convert|25|km|mi}} from [[Ginari]] is the nearest railway station, which is  well connected to [[Jaipur]], [[Delhi]] and other cities.\n\nAsphalt roads connect the village to surrounding villages. The first village road connecting it to Churu - Taranagar road was built 1n 2006 with the efforts of the villagers under the leadership of prof. Shivram poonia and his cousin 'Sarpanch'(Gram Panchayat head) sh. Chokharam poonia.[[Camel carts]] and [[bullock carts]] were formerly the chief means of transportation and are being replaced by cycles and other automobiles.\n\nIn the rainy season, womenfolk can be seen bringing grass on their heads for cows and buffaloes.\n\n===Academics===\nPrimary school was established by the government in 1961-62. The school started in a 'khuddi' (a room with mud walls and grass roof). Two pakka rooms were constructed by the villagers in 1963. Now the school has been upgraded to middle level with 8 rooms and 300 students on its roll. Two private primary schools are also operating in the village.\n\n==Religion==\nAll the  villagers follow the [[Hindu]] religion.\n\n===Local deities===\n* [[Thakurji]]: the oldest temple in the village; The Swami clan as its priest; owning a \"Dohli\" (tax-free farm-land allotted by the state for sustenance of the priest family); actually it is a Krishna temple but called Thakurji perhaps due to influence of erstwhile Thakurs (jagirdars); the priest daily in the morning takes a ferry to each house and says \"jai thakurji\" and in turn gets some floor. The villagers go to the temple on the occasions of birth, marriage and death. The temple was housed in a mud-walled room till 1980 when the employees of the village, under leadership of prof. Shiv Ram Poonia, got constructed full 'pakka' temple with installation of statues('Pran pratistha').\n* [[Gogaji]] is a Chauhan chieftain born in nearby Jodi village to mata (mother) Bachhal with the blessing of Guru Gorakh Nath and blessed by him to be lord of snakes> He owned the famous magical mere Keshar Kalvi and fought against the plunders to protect cows, and was exiled by his mother due to his killing of his  cousins Arjan-Sharjan. He prayed \"Kalma\" (a religious mantra of the Muslims)and took \"Jinwat Smadhi\"(lively going in the earth)and therefore called [[Goga peer]], perhaps the only deity worshiped  by both the Hindus and the Muslims, his \"smadhi-sathal\" (death place) Gogamedi near Bhadra tehsil is an India level pilgrim centre.\n* In Ginadi there was only a \"than\" (a small triangular structure symbolic of a \"medi\" (full temple) till 2007 when a'pakki' medi was constructed by the villagers under the leadership of haveldar Ishar ram Ishran..In the months of Shrawan-Bhadwa, village girls go to it and offer water while singing and praying for protection from snakes. snake-bites in the area are most common in the months of Shrawan-Bhadwa; snake-bitten person is brought to the medi and a tanti (a thread embedded with the feather of peacock) is tied to him, the person is depoisoned. If not, a \"thali of Kansi\" (plate of alloy) is applied to his back by an expert and the poison is sucked by it. Eighth day of the month of Bhadwa is observed as Goga-day; a \"prashad\" (blessed offering) of chitki (a piece of coconut) and kheer (a liquid preparation of milk-rice) is offered on this day. The Bhakat (devotee priest) prays for landing of \"Jewdees\" (rope like poison -less snakes) and if not obliged, punishes himself with a \"Shankal\" (a ring with iron spokes). The moment is surcharged with emotions for the onlookers.\n* Mawliaji, also called MahamayaJi, is goddess mother of children; there is a 'than' of the deity two km south of the village, along with a pasture land of some 30 ''bighas'' attached to it. The place of the deity is one of its kind in the area and devotees from hundreds of km come to it for worship and to pray for the well being of their newborn babies.  One time worship of the goddess is considered mandatory for every newborn baby.\n* [[Gudganvwali]] Mata for the clan of Harjans, [[Karni Mata]] for the clan of Rajputs, Sedh Mata, Malasi ka Mamliaji, Khetarpalji, Bhomiaji and [[Peerji]] (peerji ka jaant at Manglaram Tetarwal ka Kheda) and Netji  are village deity; [[Netji]] and [[Harsh (deity)|Harsh]] are also clan deities for [[Poonia]] while Gossainji for [[Ishrans]].\n\n==Water resources==\nUnderground water is saline. Underground wells and johdas were main source of water for   animals and domestic requirements. Drinking water was fetched from the nearby village Inderpura.\n\nA Kui \u0915\u0941\u0908 (a narrow vertical tunnel dug to the underground water level) on the west of bodia kua \u092c\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0941\u0906 was built 200 years ago. During the severe drought of [[Vikram Samvat]] 1995 to 1996, under the inspiration of ch. Chimnaram Tetarwal, a 'pakka kua\u2019 was built by Seth Jaydyalji Goenka of [[Churu]]. Later a 60x60x15 (feet cube) size pakka johda along with a 30x15x10 ft size Gaughat  were built.\n\nThere were 4 community kuis of [[Poonia]], [[Sunda clan|Sunda]], [[Thakar tribe|Thakur]], and [[Tetarwal]]. The well was operated through a bid system. Livestock heads were counted and per head bidding rates invited. Water was drawn with the help of bullocks. The well was operated daily in the morning and evening. The echo of the sweet songs by the \"kuadias\" \u0915\u0941\u0906\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e( two men operating the well)at 4 [[Ante meridian|AM]] were used to be very refreshing and enlightening. In the evening, operating time of the well was very lively and entertaining. Both of the elders and the youth would gather in the \"Guaad\" \u0917\u0941\u0906\u0921\u093c(courtyard in the common land); overtly gossiping and discussing village news. But their main attraction would be the \"Paniharins\" \u092a\u0928\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0902 (the newly wed brides in a flock along with their young [[sisters-in-law]] going to fetch water from the well). They used to dress themselves in the best of their decorated traditional attires and ornaments. The elders stealthily glancing and the youths openly and closely; but the moments would be exotic to both.\n\nDuring the month of Falgun, the \"Rasiyas\"(the men in a group dancing, singing and playing on 'Damphs'- circular drums- on the eve of Holi festival) performing with all the vigour and gusto at the time of 'panghat'( the system of fetching water from the village well), the occasion becomes frenetic, memorable to any body to the extent of envy.\n\nThere were only three Kunds of Poonia, Tetarwal & Meghwal. They were underground  tanks with tomb shaped \"Dhoala\" & pakka catchment area to store rain water, the tanks were cylindrical  shaped to withstand pressure of water & their inner sides were coated with a Sunla of Singraj powder to stop leakage of  water. The tanks were main source of precious drinkable water and were cleaned of dirt annually and occasionally sprayed with \"Gangajal\" to prevent pollution.\n\nIn 1974-75, Under the inspiration of Prof. Shiv Ram Poonia, a new well was constructed by Seth Kanhailal Dugar of Sardarshahr and handed over to Public Health Engineering Department [[PHED]]. Almost every house of the village was connected to the storage tanks through pipelines. Recently the village has been connected to German water supply system.\n\n===Electrification===\nThe village was electrified in 1980 due to personal efforts by the villagers under the leadership of late ch. Rikhuram Poonia. The villagers  bought Rural Electrification Bonds of Rs.5,000 (then five thousand!) in order to get electric connectivity; the bonds are still pending redemption due to negligence of the descendants of the buyers.\n\n==Johda \u091c\u094b\u0939\u094d\u0921\u093c\u093e (Common grazing land)==\nThe johdas are earthen ponds with large catchment areas meant for storage of rain water inside Charagah (grazing) lands for animals. The Johdas include Kalra \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0930\u093e (biggest and best with kalar clays famous for preserving water up to 9 months a year and connected to village with Goha \u0917\u094b\u0939\u093e (a wide strip of land meant for animal transit). Kesana (best pasture land) was connected to village with a Goha. Sujania \u0938\u0941\u091c\u093e\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e, Mawliaji ki johadi \u092e\u093e\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0906\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u094b\u0939\u0921\u093c\u0940 are located at village kankad \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0915\u0921\u093c(border). Others are- Ram talai \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0924\u0932\u093e\u0908, Gangania \u0917\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e, Khatayani \u0916\u093e\u0924\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0940, dumani \u0921\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940, Pichparani \u092a\u093f\u091a\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0940, Johadia \u091c\u094b\u0939\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e and village Beed \u092c\u0940\u0921\u093c. The total area under these johra \u091c\u094b\u0939\u094d\u0921\u093c\u093e was roughly 500 bigha but due to negligence of the villagers and carelessness of the administration, nearly 100 bigha land of common village pastureland stands encroached for farming.  The Johria \u091c\u094b\u0939\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e, village beed \u092c\u0940\u0921\u093c, and the gohas \u0917\u094b\u0939\u093e are completely encroached while others are only peripherally encroached.\n\n==Society and culture==\nVillage society is governed solely by Hindu rituals although the younger generation has been affected by western cultural influences. Parda, the practice of using veils to cover the face and other parts of the body is discouraged.\n\n===Festivals===\nVillagers celebrate all major Hindu festivals. Some of the major festivals are [[Holi]], [[Deepawali]], [[Makar Sankranti]], [[Raksha Bandhan]], [[Sawan]], [[Teej]], and [[Gauga Peer]], [[Gangaur]].\n\nThe saying '\u0924\u0940\u091c \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902\u0939\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0935\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0921\u093c\u094b \u0932\u0947 \u0921\u0942\u092c\u0940 \u0917\u0902\u0917\u094b\u0930' (festivals begin with [[Teej]] and end with [[Gangor]])speaks chronology of Hindu festivals. Each of the festival has its own peculiarity and logic  regarding time of observance, motive, celebration and usefulness.\n\n====Teej====\n*The 3rd day of the [[Shrawan]] month, the day of 'surangi'(colorful)[[Teej]]; middle of rainy season; greenery all around; rows and columns of dark clouds disbursing rains everywhere. The festival celebrates the youthfulness of the nature and humanity. The newlywed daughters are brought to their parental homes. They, singing folk songs on the theme of love and nature, go to village ponds and take bath. Young ladies in pairs can be seen taking ride on \"Jhula\" (swing made from grass rope, two ropes suspended from a branch of a tree and tied to a foot board to stand on). [[Kheer]] is cooked in every home.\n\n====Dipawali====\nThe 15th day of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]]-month at the beginning of winter season, [[Khareef]] crops are ready for harvesting, local fruits are ready in plenty, sisters are brought to parental home from their in-laws place, all the members working away from home in foreign lands return home. The festival is observed to worship Goddess [[Laxmi]]- seeking wealth, prosperity and peace; celebrations begin from \"[[Dhan Teras]]\" followed by Kanti Dipawali. On the night of 15th, every house is illuminated with \"Diya\" (small earthen lamps lighted with ghee/oil). Worship is performed by hanging pictures of [[Laxmi]] along with Lord [[Ganesha]] and putting jewelry and cash interspersed with 'roli', [[incense]], '[[prasad]]' (of cooked rice with ghee and 'shakkar'- powdered gur), dipak of ghee and an ember. The family members dressed in best attires assemble, head lady offers ghee on the ember, if the emerging flame is connected to the flame of the dipak goddess is supposed to be attentive for worship. The lady calls the family members one by one, ties a \"Suha naal\" (auspicious coloured thread) on the wrist and applies \"Tilak\" (spot of liquid vermilion/roli on the fore head) or \"vibhuti\" (burnt ash of the auspicious ember) on the fore head) and the member prays for prosperity/ individual aspirations.\n*\"[[Dhan Teras]]\" - (13th, the auspicious day for wealth), people buy precious metals, new utensils, vehicles etc.\n*[[Kanti Dipawali]]- 14th is day for  [[Kanti Dipawali]] (dipawali without lights).\n*[[Govardhan]]-The next day to Dipawali is for \"Govardhan\" ( Lord of the most useful animal- cow) worship and \"Raam-rumi\" (greeting in the name of lord Rama). A heap of cow dung along with local fruits is put at the gate of every house. The villagers take ferry to each other's house, say raam-rumi and accept sweets.\n*The last of the celebrations is \"Bhaiya-dooj\"(the 2nd day of dipawali for brothers); sisters oblige brothers for remembering and bringing them to parental home to participate in the celebrations.\n*The boys of the village start playing of \"Hidda-lighting\" (tied beams of straws) 15 days before dipawali. In the early night, they gather at the outskirts of the village; light their hiddas, dance, race and sing folk songs. Nice opportunity to prove one's efficiency, making friends and entertaining. How colorful, attractive and purposeful the festival! Children used to count months and days ahead of Dipawali. Interesting to note that in contrast to the cities, no crackers were exploded in the villages during diwali celebrations.\n\n====Holi====\nThe end of [[Falgun]] month; lively fauna and flora; spring season spreads its smell all around; villagers having harvested their crops in leisure ready to enjoy the season. The occasion is Holi festival; the festival of revelries for toiling masses in contrast to Dipawali for affluent ones.\n*According to mythology [[Holika]], sister of mighty demon [[Hiranyakashipu]], had a magical \"Choonri\" (a decorated coloured cloth for woman to cover head and wrap around the body) with a boon that anything covered with it would be immune to fire. She tried to burn child \"Bhakat\" (devotee and worshipper of any god) [[Prahlada|Prahalad]] by covering herself with the 'choonri' and taking the child in her lap and setting fire on but the child remained unscathed while [[Holika]] burnt to ashes. The victory of truth (Prahalad) over evil(Holika) is legend of celebrating Holi. Victory of Prahalad but celebration in the name of Holika, perhaps due to feudal influence in latter stage.\n*[[Holi]] celebrations start from \"fullariya-dooj\"(the 2nd day of [[Falgun]] when flowers are in full bloom), playing on ''chang'' or \"Daph\" (a drum of round circular frame of wood covered with skin of sheep) starts from this day. The Daph is held on shoulder near the ear and beaten/struck with the flap of the palm of hand/fingers. Every evening, a group of people (called 'Rasiya') play on daph while dancing on knees and singing folk ballads in a rhythm at different pitches. The saga is called \"Dhamal\". Young girls  play \"Loor\" (a dance with measured steps and stanza  of a song by each participant). On the day of Holi, a small tree of khejri is planted in the midst of \"Bhintka\" (a heap of straws of a thorny bush) on the outskirts of the village. In the evening, the villagers gather at the spot; the girls throw 'Badkulia' \u092c\u0921\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e (a garland of cow dung pieces) on the Holika, the village head offers a coconut, the 'rasiyas' play on daph, the children explode crackers and [[Holi]] is set on fire. Meanwhile, unmarried youth, aspirant of marriage at the earliest, takes out the planted tree (Prahalad) and 'holika' is burnt to ashes. The wise farmers read omens from the direction of the  flames of burning 'Holika' and voice of birds etc.; others symbolically plough their farms and throw their 'Matira' (a fruit of watermelon category) through the flames and thus the celebration is over. The sweet diet is rice with ghee- shakar.\n*At night all the villagers gather  in the village courtyard to play \"Gindhad\"(Dandya dance in circle around the 'Nagara' - a big drum). The next day is observed as 'Dhulandi'. All the villagers along with 'rasiyas' take a ferry (procession  called 'Gehar') to each house demanding sweats and wine on this or that count. Thus Holi, the most important festival of the villagers, is a good  forum for entertainment and  strengthening brotherhood.\n\n====Makar Sankranti====\nIn the month of Magh, every year fixed on 14 January, when the sun has entered the zodiac sign of Capricorn, signaling end of winter in the northern hemisphere, the festival of makar-sankranti is observed to propitiate the sun god  to protect us from the evil effects of astral bodies. Oil based foods - 'bada', 'Gudgala', 'Pua', cheelda', 'Pakodi', 'Gur-papda' etc. are cooked. But the craze for  kite-flying prevalent in the cities on this occasion is, however, virtually non-existent in the villages.\n\n====Gangaur====\nThe last of the village festivals in a calendar year; the 21st day of [[Chaitra]] month; spring season at the end of its full bloom, aura of smell and greenery; festive atmosphere at the time of equinox; villagers in leisure ; the occasion is festival of [[Gangaur]], predominantly a function of females like '[[Teej]]'. Literally \"gangaur\" means goddess [[Parvati]] mother of 9 'Gans' (nine basic traits of human conscience-owned by lord [[ganesha]] son of [[parvati]]).\n\nAccording to mythology, [[Parvati]] had worshiped lord Shiva to have  him her husband. Therefore, all the aspirant brides worship goddess mother Parvati praying for providing them with husband of their choice. Some 15 days ahead of the festival, each day early in the morning the girls go to outskirts of the village, collect green branches of the local  bush 'Fog' full of smell with its flower 'Ghintal'( by the way ' the smell of the 'ghital' of the then densely found  bush in the desert areas in the month of 'Chaitra-maas' used to be all pervasive making the surroundings lively and festive. but, alas!, with  fast disappearing of the bush it is no more there!); offer water to the branches and worship Parvati.\n\nOn the day of the festival in the evening, competitions of wrestling, kabadi, horse and camel race are organised. The youths of the village participate enthusiastically. The idols of the Gaur are thrown in the village well to get them submerged in the fresh water of the well. A legend also goes that a [[Rajput]] lady Gangaur while at her parental home jumped in the village well followed by her husband Hada and therefore since then the festival is observed. But it might have been added during feudal period just to give the festival a touch of the authority of the ruling class. The special diet on the occasion is '[[Dhokla]]'(berry like pieces of the dough of millet cooked in the steam of water) along with '[[Kheer]]'. It's also note worthy that the girl who worshiped 'Gangaur' is considered duty bound to do 'Gaur-ujna' after her marriage as an offering for fulfilment of her prayers before marriage.\n\n===Music and entertainment===\n[[Folk song|Folk songs]] are sung by women during weddings and on other social occasions. Menfolk sing [[dhamaal]] ( traditional [[Holi]] songs). Many villagers own TV's as well as radios and satellite dishes. The sound of popular Hindi music emanating from stereos and other devices is heard from different houses during the afternoon and evening.\n\n===Games and sports===\nNowadays most of the children play cricket. Some villagers also play volleyball and football. Villagers can be seen playing cards in [[chaupal (public space)|chaupal]] (village common area) and \"chausar\" (choppad-pasa)in some houses. Some of the traditional games & sports are also prevalent.\n*Folk games :\n**'[[Kabaddi|Kabadi]]'(played between two teams, each team having 7 players, one team operates as raiders and the other catchers, if the raider is caught he is out but if he  manages to over power the catchers and comes to the central line, all the catchers touching him are out.\n**'Ghoda- kabadi(a variation of kabadi) is also popular.\n**'Peewani'( a variation of hockey, played at night during 'holi- dipawali' days).\n**'Hardada'(a variation of cricket, played during 'Holi' days.\n**'Guntha'(a variation of golf)\n**'Dharsunda'(seven players in a ring and seven outside it, each of the outside players raids the ring and tries to throw out as many opponents as possible but the opponents are free to hit/catch/fell him and if he is unable to come out of the ring he is out).\n**'Lala-liter'( players sitting in a circle, one of them with a concealed shoe with him and chanting 'Lala- liter 'lewun ke dewun' takes round of them and puts stealthily the shoe  behind any of them, if the person comes to know of it he can beat the raider  with the shoe otherwise he is beaten with the shoe and given out to function as next raider).\n\nThe games were played by children/ youths either at night or during slack season; apart from providing recreation, they also provided fine opportunity to prove one's superiority, make friends and get  training for teamwork. But now they are on the wane - occasional glimpses is the most we can hope for.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130613000740/http://www.rajsec.rajasthan.gov.in/Sarpanch.pdf Details of Sarpanch in Churu]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173701/http://www.rajpanchayat.gov.in/common/sidelinks/panchayat.htm List of all villages of Rajasthan with their Panchayat Samiti]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110902032027/http://churu.nic.in/ Churu District Official Web Page]\n\n[[Category:Villages in Churu district]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2018}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Ginadi\n| other_name              = Ginadi Patta Rajpura, Ginari Tiba, Ginari Chhoti\n| nickname                = \n| settlement_type         = Village\n| image_skyline           = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|28.31|N|74.96|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = {{flag|India}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Churu District]]\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| government_type         = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title            = Sarpanch\n| leader_name             = Shri Tilokaram\n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_rank               = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| population_total        = 998\n| population_as_of        = 2001\n| population_rank         = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      = \n| population_footnotes    = \n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Hindi language|Hindi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 3310001\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| area_code               = 91-1562\n| registration_plate      = RJ-10\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Distance from Churu\n| blank1_info_sec1        = {{convert|18|km|mi}} SW ([[Indian highways|land]])\n| blank1_name_sec2        = Avg. summer temperature\n| blank1_info_sec2        = {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}\n| blank2_name_sec2        = Avg. winter temperature\n| blank2_info_sec2        = {{convert|1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}\n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Ginadi''' is a village in the [[Churu]] [[tehsil|administrative region]] of the eastern corner of the [[Churu district]] of [[Rajasthan]], India. The village is over 450 years old and lies north-east of [[Churu]] and {{Convert|25|km|mi}} from Churu town. Bordering villages include [[Ranwa Ki Dhani]], [[Lalasar]], [[Ginadi Taal]], [[Inderpura]], [[Thalori]] and [[Bhamasi]].\n\nThe 43 [[bigha]] village has an overall population of 998.<ref>http://churu.nic.in/pages/gpcensus/pschuru.pdf{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Pre-Indian Independence==\nOne view is that some 450 years ago, there was a [[jagayat]] centre (authorised resting place for travellers on payment) on the way (sub trade route [[Taranagar]] (RINI) - Churu). The jagayti (contractor owner of the place) had to pay 1 [[gini (coin)|gini]] (a gold coin equal to 1/2 of a [[mohar]]). The centre, therefore, was called Giniwala.\n\nDuring the war between Rai Sigh Rathore (a son of the [[Bika Rathore]] of then newly established state [[Bikaner]]) and the [[Poonia]] chief Kanha Deo of Jhansal (near [[Hisar, India|Hissar]]) many Poonia families were displaced. One Ramkishan [[Poonia]] family migrated from the village Binjawas ([[Rajgadh]]) to adjoining area of [[Shekhawati]] region Neema ki dhani. The Poonia family along with the families of ancestors of Deepa Karel, ancestors of Roopdas Swami and ancestors of Balaram Meghwal further displaced reached the Giniwala Jagayat - centre and established their dhani (residence) there.\n\n===Relics===\nThe \"Theh\" (remains of earthen pots) at Rathion Ki Dhani and south of the village site at farmlands of Kanaram Kulhari and Richhpal Poonia. The Babal Kunds and the Chhatri there, the Bodia Kua and the memorial chabutra of Meghrajot [[Singh]] near or under the house of [[Ramnarayan]].\n\n===Village administration===\nThe village along with 24 others was under the [[jagir]] of Rajpura Thakur. Poonia, Udaram and his ancestors, were village [[Choudhary]] and [[Meghwal]] the village Kotwal. The Choudhary collected land revenue (Rakam) and arbitrated the village disputes. The Kotwal functioned as Ahalkar (messenger-cum-attendant) of the [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]] and Choudhary. Due to untimely death of Choudhary Rajuram and his ailing son Surjaram Poonia, Chimnaram [[Tetarwal]] was appointed as co-choudhary of the village 20 years before abolition of the jagirdari system.\n\n===Housing  and construction===\n[[File:Matka in Village.JPG|thumb|Matka in the Village]]\n\nIn the past there were huts and Saals (room built with clay and limestone and with thatched ceiling). The first pakka room (built with chuna (baked limestone) and khor (nodules of clay) used with Dhandhla stone) was built by Motaram Poonia followed by Bhinwam chamar, Chimnaram Tetarwal & Udaram Poonia.  The four rooms, kua, johra, three kunds (Babal kunds along with the Babal chhatri and the memorial chabutra) were the only pakka structures before independence.\n\n==After independence==\n\n===Village government===\nThe village is governed by Panchayati Raj System. In the first panchayat election, the village along with 14 others, was under Sehjusar gram PANCHYAT. Later on it became part of Inderpura panchayat and now it is a part of Lalasr Banirotan. Presently out of total 9 members of the panchayat 3 panchas are elected from Ginadi. The panchayat is under Vikas Samiti Churu. It is part of the Churu MLA constituency. During first two panchayats, Nyay Samitis at panchayat levels were also constituted. Ch. Magaram Poonia of the village was elected member of the nyay Samiti. Secretary Panchayat, Patwari, Gram Sewak, Vyavsthapak cooperative society, waterman, lineman & Sathin Aanganbari Kendra are village level government functionaries. The village is under Dudhwakhara police station.\n\n===Village economy===\nAlmost all the families of the village are engaged in farming. However, some members of the families are engaged in services & other activities. There are three male government teachers, two female government teachers, five private school teachers, five nurses, one railway, one in the RAC, three state policemen, six in army, three in water Works department, five retired [[Havildars]], 22 work in [[Arab]] countries, there are two accountants, one retired government PG college principal, one private college lecturer, two engineers, three (MBA) managers, two lawyers & twenty persons working in factories outside the village. As can be seen from these figures, out of the 220 families (houses) more than 85 villagers are employed in occupations other than agriculture.\n\nThere are four private schools established and operated by the villagers, two in the  village and two at Jodhpur.\n\nApart from agriculture, live-stock activities are also carried on in the village, almost every household has some sort of animals with it. There are ten 'Rewads'(a herd of sheep and goats), 30 camels, 60 cows with one village bull,160 buffaloes with a common \"Jhota\"( he buffalo), two mares & 4 donkeys. The village is counted as one of the best villages in the tehsil. Almost every household has a pakka room with pakki boundaries & there are good havelis.\n\nBut as compared with the position of the village some 50 years ago, in general, the financial position has worsened. Then, out of 125 households only 25 houses were indebted, but now out of 220 households more than 160 are indebted. Thus indebtedness has risen from 20% to more than 75%.\n\nReasons of rise in indebtedness are many. On one hand are positive changes in lifestyle, raising of living standards, now people eat better, wear better clothes, use amenities and facilities seen in towns. Villagers spend on education, transportation, and medication. But the biggest setback has been the adverse farming conditions. In the past, every member of the family earned: children raised livestock, [[ghee]] was sold to arrange for groceries, every bye-product of farming - woods, fodder etc. - fetched a hefty income. The costs in farming were little, medical expenses almost non-existent, no expense on water-electricity, no education expense, no transportation expense; no expense on detergents & cosmetics. The expenses were very few since the living standards were low and even little income led to an economy of surplus & self-reliance. In addition, farmers do not know where their interests lie. They support rallies that seek to curb prices of farm produces in guise of controlling inflation. As a matter of fact such rallies are to benefit other sections of society at the cost of the farmer.\n\n===Transportation===\nGinadi is connected by a two lane asphalt road to Churu. Churu Railway station, {{Convert|25|km|mi}} from [[Ginari]] is the nearest railway station, which is  well connected to [[Jaipur]], [[Delhi]] and other cities.\n\nAsphalt roads connect the village to surrounding villages. The first village road connecting it to Churu - Taranagar  road was built 1n 2006 with the efforts of the villagers under the leadership of prof. Shivram poonia and his cousin 'Sarpanch'(Gram Panchayat head) sh. Chokharam poonia.[[Camel carts]] and [[bullock carts]] were formerly the chief means of transportation and are being replaced by cycles and other automobiles.\n\nIn the rainy season, womenfolk can be seen bringing grass on their heads for cows and buffaloes.\n\n===Academics===\nPrimary school was established by the government in 1961-62. The school started in a 'khuddi' (a room with mud walls and grass roof). Two pakka rooms were constructed by the villagers in 1963. Now the school has been upgraded to middle level with 8 rooms and 300 students on its roll. Two private primary schools are also operating in the village.\n\n==Religion==\nAll the  villagers follow the [[Hindu]] religion.\n\n===Local deities===\n* [[Thakurji]]: the oldest temple in the village; The Swami clan as its priest; owning a \"Dohli\" (tax-free farm-land allotted by the state for sustenance of the priest family); actually it is a Krishna temple but called Thakurji perhaps due to influence of erstwhile Thakurs (jagirdars); the priest daily in the morning takes a ferry to each house and says \"jai thakurji\" and in turn gets some floor. The villagers go to the temple on the occasions of birth, marriage and death. The temple was housed in a mud walled room till 1980 when the employees of the village, under leadership of prof. Shiv Ram Poonia, got constructed full 'pakka' temple with installation of statues('Pran pratistha').\n* [[Gogaji]] is a Chauhan chieftain born in nearby Jodi village to mata (mother) Bachhal with the blessing of Guru Gorakh Nath and blessed by him to be lord of snakes> He owned the famous magical mere Keshar Kalvi and fought against the plunders to protect cows, and was exiled by his mother due to his killing of his  cousins Arjan-Sharjan. He prayed \"Kalma\" (a religious mantra of the Muslims)and took \"Jinwat Smadhi\"(lively going in the earth)and therefore called [[Goga peer]], perhaps the only deity worshiped  by both the Hindus and the Muslims, his \"smadhi-sathal\" (death place) Gogamedi near Bhadra tehsil is an India level pilgrim centre.\n* In Ginadi there was only a \"than\" (a small triangular structure symbolic of a \"medi\" (full temple) till 2007 when a'pakki' medi was constructed by the villagers under the leadership of haveldar Ishar ram Ishran..In the months of Shrawan-Bhadwa, village girls go to it and offer water while singing and praying for protection from snakes. snake-bites in the area are most common in the months of Shrawan-Bhadwa; snake-bitten person is brought to the medi and a tanti (a thread embedded with the feather of peacock) is tied to him, the person is depoisoned. If not, a \"thali of Kansi\" (plate of alloy) is applied to his back by an expert and the poison is sucked by it. Eighth day of the month of Bhadwa is observed as Goga-day; a \"prashad\" (blessed offering) of chitki (a piece of coconut) and kheer (a liquid preparation of milk-rice) is offered on this day. The Bhakat (devotee priest) prays for landing of \"Jewdees\" (rope like poison -less snakes) and if not obliged, punishes himself with a \"Shankal\" (a ring with iron spokes). The moment is surcharged with emotions for the onlookers.\n* Mawliaji, also called MahamayaJi, is goddess mother of children; there is a 'than' of the deity two km south of the village, along with a pasture land of some 30 ''bighas'' attached to it. The place of the deity is one of its kind in the area and devotees from hundreds of km come to it for worship and to pray for the well being of their newborn babies.  One time worship of the goddess is considered mandatory for every newborn baby.\n* [[Gudganvwali]] Mata for the clan of Harjans, [[Karni Mata]] for the clan of Rajputs, Sedh Mata, Malasi ka Mamliaji, Khetarpalji, Bhomiaji and [[Peerji]] (peerji ka jaant at Manglaram Tetarwal ka Kheda) and Netji  are village deity; [[Netji]] and [[Harsh (deity)|Harsh]] are also clan deities for [[Poonia]] while Gossainji for [[Ishrans]].\n\n==Water resources==\nUnderground water is saline. Underground wells and johdas were main source of water for   animals and domestic requirements. Drinking water was fetched from the nearby village Inderpura.\n\nA Kui \u0915\u0941\u0908 (a narrow vertical tunnel dug to the underground water level) on the west of bodia kua \u092c\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0941\u0906 was built 200 years ago. During the severe drought of [[Vikram Samvat]] 1995 to 1996, under the inspiration of ch. Chimnaram Tetarwal, a 'pakka kua\u2019 was built by Seth Jaydyalji Goenka of [[Churu]]. Later a 60x60x15 (feet cube) size pakka johda along with a 30x15x10 ft size Gaughat  were built.\n\nThere were 4 community kuis of [[Poonia]], [[Sunda clan|Sunda]], [[Thakar tribe|Thakur]], and [[Tetarwal]]. The well was operated though bid system. Livestock heads were counted and per head bidding rates invited. Water was drawn with the help of bullocks. The well was operated daily in the morning and evening. The echo of the sweet songs by the \"kuadias\" \u0915\u0941\u0906\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e( two men operating the well)at 4 [[Ante meridian|AM]] were used to be very refreshing and enlightening. In the evening, operating time of the well was very lively and  entertaining. Both of the elders and the youth would gather in the \"Guaad\" \u0917\u0941\u0906\u0921\u093c(courtyard in the common land); overtly gossiping and discussing village news. But their main attraction would be the \"Paniharins\" \u092a\u0928\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0902 (the newly wed brides in a flock along with their young [[sisters-in-law]] going to fetch water from the well). They used to dress themselves in the best of their decorated traditional attires and ornaments. The elders stealthily glancing and the youths openly and closely; but the moments would be exotic to both.\n\nDuring the month of Falgun, the \"Rasiyas\"(the men in a group dancing, singing and playing on 'Damphs'- circular drums- on the eve of Holi festival) performing with all the vigour and gusto at the time of 'panghat'( the system of fetching water from the village well), the occasion becomes frenetic, memorable to any body to the extent of envy.\n\nThere were only three Kunds of Poonia, Tetarwal & Meghwal. They were underground  tanks with tomb shaped \"Dhoala\" & pakka catchment area to store rain water, the tanks were cylindrical  shaped to withstand pressure of water & their inner sides were coated with a Sunla of Singraj powder to stop leakage of  water. The tanks were main source of precious drinkable water and were cleaned of dirt annually and occasionally sprayed with \"Gangajal\" to prevent pollution.\n\nIn 1974-75, Under the inspiration of Prof. Shiv Ram Poonia, a new well was constructed by Seth Kanhailal Dugar of Sardarshahr and handed over to Public Health Engineering Department [[PHED]]. Almost every house of the village was connected to the storage tanks through pipelines. Recently the village has been connected to German water supply system.\n\n===Electrification===\nThe village was electrified in 1980 due to personal efforts by the villagers under the leadership of late ch. Rikhuram Poonia. The villagers  bought Rural Electrification Bonds of Rs.5,000 (then five thousand!) in order to get electric connectivity; the bonds are still pending redemption due to negligence of the descendants of the buyers.\n\n==Johda \u091c\u094b\u0939\u094d\u0921\u093c\u093e (Common grazing land)==\nThe johdas are earthen ponds with large catchment areas meant for storage of rain water inside Charagah (grazing) lands for animals. The Johdas include Kalra \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0930\u093e (biggest and best with kalar clays famous for preserving water up to 9 months a year and connected to village with Goha \u0917\u094b\u0939\u093e (a wide strip of land meant for animal transit). Kesana (best pasture land) was connected to village with a Goha. Sujania \u0938\u0941\u091c\u093e\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e, Mawliaji ki johadi \u092e\u093e\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0906\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u094b\u0939\u0921\u093c\u0940 are located at village kankad \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0915\u0921\u093c(border). Others are- Ram talai \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0924\u0932\u093e\u0908, Gangania \u0917\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e, Khatayani \u0916\u093e\u0924\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0940, dumani \u0921\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940, Pichparani \u092a\u093f\u091a\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0940, Johadia \u091c\u094b\u0939\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e and village Beed \u092c\u0940\u0921\u093c. The total area under these johra \u091c\u094b\u0939\u094d\u0921\u093c\u093e was roughly 500 bigha but due to negligence of the villagers and carelessness of the administration, nearly 100 bigha land of common village pastureland stands encroached for farming.  The Johria \u091c\u094b\u0939\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e, village beed \u092c\u0940\u0921\u093c, and the gohas \u0917\u094b\u0939\u093e are completely encroached while others are only peripherally encroached.\n\n==Society and culture==\nVillage society is governed solely by Hindu rituals although the younger generation has been affected by western cultural influences. Parda, the practice of using veils to cover the face and other parts of the body is discouraged.\n\n===Festivals===\nVillagers celebrate all major Hindu festivals. Some of the major festivals are [[Holi]], [[Deepawali]], [[Makar Sankranti]], [[Raksha Bandhan]], [[Sawan]], [[Teej]], and [[Gauga Peer]], [[Gangaur]].\n\nThe saying '\u0924\u0940\u091c \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902\u0939\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0935\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0921\u093c\u094b \u0932\u0947 \u0921\u0942\u092c\u0940 \u0917\u0902\u0917\u094b\u0930' (festivals begin with [[Teej]] and end with [[Gangor]])speaks chronology of Hindu festivals. Each of the festival has its own peculiarity and logic  regarding time of observance, motive, celebration and usefulness.\n\n====Teej====\n*The 3rd day of the [[Shrawan]] month, the day of 'surangi'(colorful)[[Teej]]; middle of rainy season; greenery all around; rows and columns of dark clouds disbursing rains everywhere. The festival celebrates the youthfulness of the nature and humanity. The newlywed daughters are brought to their parental homes. They, singing folk songs on the theme of love and nature, go to village ponds and take bath. Young ladies in pairs can be seen taking ride on \"Jhula\" (swing made from grass rope, two ropes suspended from a branch of a tree and tied to a foot board to stand on). [[Kheer]] is cooked in every home.\n\n====Dipawali====\nThe 15th day of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]]-month at the beginning of winter season, [[Khareef]] crops are ready for harvesting, local fruits are ready in plenty, sisters are brought to parental home from their in-laws place, all the members working away from home in foreign lands return home. The festival is observed to worship Goddess [[Laxmi]]- seeking wealth, prosperity and peace; celebrations begin from \"[[Dhan Teras]]\" followed by Kanti Dipawali. On the night of 15th, every house is illuminated with \"Diya\" (small earthen lamps lighted with ghee/oil). Worship is performed by hanging pictures of [[Laxmi]] along with Lord [[Ganesha]] and putting jewelry and cash interspersed with 'roli', [[incense]], '[[prasad]]' (of cooked rice with ghee and 'shakkar'- powdered gur), dipak of ghee and an ember. The family members dressed in best attires assemble, head lady offers ghee on the ember, if the emerging flame is connected to the flame of the dipak goddess is supposed to be attentive for worship. The lady calls the family members one by one, ties a \"Suha naal\" (auspicious coloured thread) on the wrist and applies \"Tilak\" (spot of liquid vermilion/roli on the fore head) or \"vibhuti\" (burnt ash of the auspicious ember) on the fore head) and the member prays for prosperity/ individual aspirations.\n*\"[[Dhan Teras]]\" - (13th, the auspicious day for wealth), people buy precious metals, new utensils, vehicles etc.\n*[[Kanti Dipawali]]- 14th is day for  [[Kanti Dipawali]] (dipawali without lights).\n*[[Govardhan]]-The next day to Dipawali is for \"Govardhan\" ( Lord of the most useful animal- cow) worship and \"Raam-rumi\" (greeting in the name of lord Rama). A heap of cow dung along with local fruits is put at the gate of every house. The villagers take ferry to each other's house, say raam-rumi and accept sweets.\n*The last of the celebrations is \"Bhaiya-dooj\"(the 2nd day of dipawali for brothers); sisters oblige brothers for remembering and bringing them to parental home to participate in the celebrations.\n*The boys of the village start playing of \"Hidda-lighting\" (tied beams of straws) 15 days before dipawali. In the early night, they gather at the outskirts of the village; light their hiddas, dance, race and sing folk songs. Nice opportunity to prove one's efficiency, making friends and entertaining. How colorful, attractive and purposeful the festival! Children used to count months and days ahead of Dipawali. Interesting to note that in contrast to the cities, no crackers were exploded in the villages during diwali celebrations.\n\n====Holi====\nThe end of [[Falgun]] month; lively fauna and flora; spring season spreads its smell all around; villagers having harvested their crops in leisure ready to enjoy the season. The occasion is Holi festival; the festival of revelries for toiling masses in contrast to Dipawali for affluent ones.\n*According to mythology [[Holika]], sister of mighty demon [[Hiranyakashipu]], had a magical \"Choonri\" (a decorated coloured cloth for woman to cover head and wrap around the body) with a boon that anything covered with it would be immune to fire. She tried to burn child \"Bhakat\" (devotee and worshipper of any god) [[Prahlada|Prahalad]] by covering herself with the 'choonri' and taking the child in her lap and setting fire on but the child remained unscathed while [[Holika]] burnt to ashes. The victory of truth (Prahalad) over evil(Holika) is legend of celebrating Holi. Victory of Prahalad but celebration in the name of Holika, perhaps due to feudal influence in latter stage.\n*[[Holi]] celebrations start from \"fullariya-dooj\"(the 2nd day of [[Falgun]] when flowers are in full bloom), playing on ''chang'' or \"Daph\" (a drum of round circular frame of wood covered with skin of sheep) starts from this day. The Daph is held on shoulder near the ear and beaten/struck with the flap of the palm of hand/fingers. Every evening, a group of people (called 'Rasiya') play on daph while dancing on knees and singing folk ballads in a rhythm at different pitches. The saga is called \"Dhamal\". Young girls  play \"Loor\" (a dance with measured steps and stanza  of a song by each participant). On the day of Holi, a small tree of khejri is planted in the midst of \"Bhintka\" (a heap of straws of a thorny bush) on the outskirts of the village. In the evening, the villagers gather at the spot; the girls throw 'Badkulia' \u092c\u0921\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e (a garland of cow dung pieces) on the Holika, the village head offers a coconut, the 'rasiyas' play on daph, the children explode crackers and [[Holi]] is set on fire. Meanwhile, unmarried youth, aspirant of marriage at the earliest, takes out the planted tree (Prahalad) and 'holika' is burnt to ashes. The wise farmers read omens from the direction of the  flames of burning 'Holika' and voice of birds etc.; others symbolically plough their farms and throw their 'Matira' (a fruit of watermelon category) through the flames and thus the celebration is over. The sweet diet is rice with ghee- shakar.\n*At night all the villagers gather  in the village courtyard to play \"Gindhad\"(Dandya dance in circle around the 'Nagara' - a big drum). The next day is observed as 'Dhulandi'. All the villagers along with 'rasiyas' take a ferry (procession  called 'Gehar') to each house demanding sweats and wine on this or that count. Thus Holi, the most important festival of the villagers, is a good  forum for entertainment and  strengthening brotherhood.\n\n====Makar Sankranti====\nIn the month of Magh, every year fixed on 14 January, when the sun has entered the zodiac sign of Capricorn, signaling end of winter in the northern hemisphere, the festival of makar-sankranti is observed to propitiate the sun god  to protect us from the evil effects of astral bodies. Oil based foods - 'bada', 'Gudgala', 'Pua', cheelda', 'Pakodi', 'Gur-papda' etc. are cooked. But the craze for  kite-flying prevalent in the cities on this occasion is, however, virtually non-existent in the villages.\n\n====Gangaur====\nThe last of the village festivals in a calendar year; the 21st day of [[Chaitra]] month; spring season at the end of its full bloom, aura of smell and greenery; festive atmosphere at the time of equinox; villagers in leisure ; the occasion is festival of [[Gangaur]], predominantly a function of females like '[[Teej]]'. Literally \"gangaur\" means goddess [[Parvati]] mother of 9 'Gans' (nine basic traits of human conscience-owned by lord [[ganesha]] son of [[parvati]]).\n\nAccording to mythology, [[Parvati]] had worshiped lord Shiva to have  him her husband. Therefore, all the aspirant brides worship goddess mother Parvati praying for providing them with husband of their choice. Some 15 days ahead of the festival, each day early in the morning the girls go to outskirts of the village, collect green branches of the local  bush 'Fog' full of smell with its flower 'Ghintal'( by the way ' the smell of the 'ghital' of the then densely found  bush in the desert areas in the month of 'Chaitra-maas' used to be all pervasive making the surroundings lively and festive. but, alas!, with  fast disappearing of the bush it is no more there!); offer water to the branches and worship Parvati.\n\nOn the day of the festival in the evening, competitions of wrestling, kabadi, horse and camel race are organised. The youths of the village participate enthusiastically. The idols of the Gaur are thrown in the village well to get them submerged in the fresh water of the well. A legend also goes that a [[Rajput]] lady Gangaur while at her parental home jumped in the village well followed by her husband Hada and therefore since then the festival is observed. But it might have been added during feudal period just to give the festival a touch of the authority of the ruling class. The special diet on the occasion is '[[Dhokla]]'(berry like pieces of the dough of millet cooked in the steam of water) along with '[[Kheer]]'. It's also note worthy that the girl who worshiped 'Gangaur' is considered duty bound to do 'Gaur-ujna' after her marriage as an offering for fulfilment of her prayers before marriage.\n\n===Music and entertainment===\n[[Folk song|Folk songs]] are sung by women during weddings and on other social occasions. Menfolk sing [[dhamaal]] ( traditional [[Holi]] songs). Many villagers own TV's as well as radios and satellite dishes. The sound of popular Hindi music emanating from stereos and other devices is heard from different houses during the afternoon and evening.\n\n===Games and sports===\nNowadays most of the children play cricket. Some villagers also play volleyball and football. Villagers can be seen playing cards in [[chaupal (public space)|chaupal]] (village common area) and \"chausar\" (choppad-pasa)in some houses. Some of the traditional games & sports are also prevalent.\n*Folk games :\n**'[[Kabaddi|Kabadi]]'(played between two teams, each team having 7 players, one team operates as raiders and the other catchers, if the raider is caught he is out but if he  manages to over power the catchers and comes to the central line, all the catchers touching him are out.\n**'Ghoda- kabadi(a variation of kabadi) is also popular.\n**'Peewani'( a variation of hockey, played at night during 'holi- dipawali' days).\n**'Hardada'(a variation of cricket, played during 'Holi' days.\n**'Guntha'(a variation of golf)\n**'Dharsunda'(seven players in a ring and seven outside it, each of the outside players raids the ring and tries to throw out as many opponents as possible but the opponents are free to hit/catch/fell him and if he is unable to come out of the ring he is out).\n**'Lala-liter'( players sitting in a circle, one of them with a concealed shoe with him and chanting 'Lala- liter 'lewun ke dewun' takes round of them and puts stealthily the shoe  behind any of them, if the person comes to know of it he can beat the raider  with the shoe otherwise he is beaten with the shoe and given out to function as next raider).\n\nThe games were played by children/ youths either at night or during slack season; apart from providing recreation, they also provided fine opportunity to prove one's superiority, make friends and get  training for teamwork. But now they are on the wane - occasional glimpses is the most we can hope for.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130613000740/http://www.rajsec.rajasthan.gov.in/Sarpanch.pdf Details of Sarpanch in Churu]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173701/http://www.rajpanchayat.gov.in/common/sidelinks/panchayat.htm List of all villages of Rajasthan with their Panchayat Samiti]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110902032027/http://churu.nic.in/ Churu District Official Web Page]\n\n[[Category:Villages in Churu district]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through; cpy ed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginadi"}

A small community sprang up outside that facility's west gate, taking on the name ''Westgate''. Annexed by the City of Los Angeles on June 14, 1916, Westgate's {{convert|49|mi2|km2}} included large parts of what is now the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] and a small portion of today's [[Bel-Air, Los Angeles|Bel-Air]]. Westgate Avenue is one of the last reminders of that namesake.\n\n[[File:Maypole in Brentwood, California.JPG|thumb|Archer School for Girls maypole tradition]]\nLocal traditions include the annual decoration of San Vicente Boulevard's coral trees with holiday lights and a [[Maypole]] erected each year on the lawn of the [[Archer School for Girls]], carrying on that set by the [[Order of the Eastern Star|Eastern Star]] Home previously housed there. This building was the exterior establishing shot for the \"Mar Vista Rest Home\" that provided a key scene in the 1974 film ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/locations|title=Chinatown (1974)|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1961 Brentwood\u2013Bel Air fire===\n{{Main|Bel Air Fire}}\nOn November 6, 1961, a construction crew working in [[Sherman Oaks]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] north of Brentwood on the far side of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] noticed smoke and flames in a nearby pile of rubbish. Within minutes, [[Santa Ana winds]] gusting up to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} sent burning brush aloft and over the ridge into Brentwood.\n\nMore than 300 police officers helped evacuate 3,500 residents during the 12-hour fire, and some 2,500 firefighters battled the blaze, pumping water from neighborhood swimming pools to douse flames. Pockets of the fire smoldered for several days. Even as firefighters battled what was to become a Bel Air disaster, another fire erupted in [[Santa Ynez Canyon]] to the west. That blaze was contained the next day after consuming nearly {{convert|10000|acre|km2|-1}} and nine structures and burning to within a mile of Bel Air and Brentwood.\n\nThe fires were the fifth-worst conflagration in the nation's history at the time, burning {{convert|16090|acre|km2|0}}, destroying more than 484 homes and 190 other structures and causing an estimated $30 million in damage.\n\n===O.J. Simpson trial===\n{{Main|O.J. Simpson murder case}}\nBrentwood was the site of the 1994 stabbing deaths of [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] and [[Ronald Goldman]], outside Simpson's Bundy Drive condominium townhouse. Nicole's ex-husband, football player and actor [[O.J. Simpson]], was [[O. J. Simpson murder case|acquitted of the murders]], but was later found liable for the deaths in a [[O.J.

Brentwood is on the right side of the street.]]\nBrentwood, like nearby [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], has a temperate climate influenced by marine breezes off the Pacific Ocean.  Residents frequently wake to a \"[[marine layer]],\" a cover of clouds brought in at night which burns off by mid-morning.

A small community sprang up outside that facility's west gate, taking on the name ''Westgate''. Annexed by the City of Los Angeles on June 14, 1916, Westgate's {{convert|49|mi2|km2}} included large parts of what is now the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] and a small portion of today's [[Bel-Air, Los Angeles|Bel-Air]]. Westgate Avenue is one of the last reminders of that namesake.\n\n[[File:Maypole in Brentwood, California.JPG|thumb|Archer School for Girls maypole tradition]]\nLocal traditions include the annual decoration of San Vicente Boulevard's coral trees with holiday lights and a [[Maypole]] erected each year on the lawn of the [[Archer School for Girls]], carrying on that set by the [[Order of the Eastern Star|Eastern Star]] Home previously housed there. This building was the exterior establishing shot for the \"Mar Vista Rest Home\" that provided a key scene in the 1974 film ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/locations|title=Chinatown (1974)|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1961 Brentwood\u2013Bel Air fire===\n{{Main|Bel Air Fire}}\nOn November 6, 1961, a construction crew working in [[Sherman Oaks]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] north of Brentwood on the far side of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] noticed smoke and flames in a nearby pile of rubbish. Within minutes, [[Santa Ana winds]] gusting up to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} sent burning brush aloft and over the ridge into Brentwood.\n\nMore than 300 police officers helped evacuate 3,500 residents during the 12-hour fire, and some 2,500 firefighters battled the blaze, pumping water from neighborhood swimming pools to douse flames. Pockets of the fire smoldered for several days. Even as firefighters battled what was to become a Bel Air disaster, another fire erupted in [[Santa Ynez Canyon]] to the west. That blaze was contained the next day after consuming nearly {{convert|10000|acre|km2|-1}} and nine structures and burning to within a mile of Bel Air and Brentwood.\n\nThe fires were the fifth-worst conflagration in the nation's history at the time, burning {{convert|16090|acre|km2|0}}, destroying more than 484 homes and 190 other structures and causing an estimated $30 million in damage.\n\n===O.J.

Brentwood is on the right side of the street.]]\nBrentwood, like nearby [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], has a temperate climate influenced by marine breezes off the Pacific Ocean.  Residents frequently wake to a \"[[marine layer]],\" a cover of clouds brought in at night which burns off by mid-morning. The [[topography]] is generally split into two characters, broadly divided by [[Sunset Boulevard]]: the area north of Sunset is defined by ridges and canyons of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]]; south of Sunset the area is hilly. The southern district features underground springs which bubble up into a small creek along \"the Gully\" near the Brentwood Country Club, and in the [[Serra Springs (California)|\"Indian Springs\"]] portion of the [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]] campus, formerly the site of a Native American [[Tongva people|Tongva]] village.\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 31,344 residents in the 15.22-square-mile Brentwood [[neighborhood]]\u2014or 2,059 people per square mile, among the lowest [[population densities]] for the city and the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 33,312. In 2000 the median age for residents was 35, which was old for city and county neighborhoods.

Renters occupied 48.4% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 51.6%. The average household size of two people was considered low for Los Angeles.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Nevertheless, if a user finds a scooter outside during the nighttime, they can still unlock it. Bird operates every day of the week.\n\nBird's revenue is lower during winter, and at the beginning of the warmer months, many scooters are taken out of hibernation, an operation internally known as the \"Spring Push\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Locations ===\n\nBird operates{{When|date=April 2020}} its electric scooters in 100 cities across the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bird.co/map/|title=Map}}</ref>\n\n=== Vehicles ===\n\nBird uses [[Motorized scooter|electric scooters]] for its rental service.

The company sends approved Chargers charging equipment, and pays them to charge scooters overnight then place them at designated \"nests\" throughout the company's service area in the morning.
