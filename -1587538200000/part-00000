Adults are silvery-gray above the mask, shading into brown at the crown, with a bold, pale patch just behind the mask. Juveniles are similar but [[buffy (color)|buffier]] below with a smaller mask and without gray above. Most published images of the po{{okina}}ouli are of the juvenile plumage.\n\n==Discovery and taxonomy==\n[[File:Black-faced Honeycreeper.jpg|thumb|left]] \nThe po{{okina}}o-uli was discovered in 1973 when students from the [[University of Hawai\u02bbi]] found the bird on the north-eastern slopes of [[Haleakal\u0101]] on the island of [[Maui]]. It was found during the Hana Rainforest Project at an altitude of {{convert|1980|m|ft}} above sea level. The po{{okina}}o-uli was the first species of Hawaiian honeycreeper to be discovered since 1923. It is dissimilar to other Hawaiian birds. Evidence based on [[DNA]] suggests it belongs to an ancient lineage of Hawaiian honeycreepers{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. It appears to have outlived all its close relatives; that is, if it had any close relatives. No other bird \u2013 living or fossil \u2013 has a structure similar to it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n==Behavior==\nIts diet consists mostly of [[snail]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[spider]]s and it nests in native \u2018\u014dhi\u2018a lehua (''[[Metrosideros polymorpha]]'') forests.\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\nIn the past, according to [[fossil]] records, it seems that the bird lived on the dry half of the island of [[Maui]], across southwestern slope of Haleakal\u0101 at altitudes of {{convert|275|-|1350|m|ft}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} When the species was first discovered, 100\u2013200 po{{okina}}o-uli were estimated to exist. There were only 76 birds per km<sup>2</sup>. By 1981, there were only 15 birds per km<sup>2</sup>. By 1985, there were only 8 per km<sup>2</sup>. That meant that from 1975, when it was first discovered, to 1985, only ten years later, the population had dropped by over 90 percent. In the 1980s, the po{{okina}}o-uli disappeared from the easternmost part of its range and was only found in the western branch of the Hanawi Stream.\n\nTo preserve the po{{okina}}o-uli and other endangered fauna and flora, the State of Hawaii established the {{convert|9500|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Hanawi Natural Area Reserve]]. This connected several protected areas to make one larger protective area. This protection effort was only possible due to the work of several groups: the government, [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], the [[National Park Service]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and several private companies. The land was fenced off and by June 1996 they began to clear out the pigs from the closed areas. Four years and 202 pigs later, the po{{okina}}o-uli pen was completely cleared of pigs. As more pigs were removed from the other two pens, the population of native species that lived there, e.g. the [[Maui parrotbill]] and [[\u02bbAkohekohe|\u02bb\u0101kohekohe]], rose slightly faster than they otherwise would have. Rats, cats, and goats were still being removed from the po{{okina}}o-uli pen.\n[[File:Melamprosops.jpg|thumb|upright|Adult]] \nBy 1997, only three individuals were known to exist. These had home ranges within the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and the adjacent [[Haleakala National Park]].\n\nIn 2002, one of these, a female, was captured and taken to a male's home range in an attempt to get them to breed. The female, however, had flown back to her own territory, which was {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} away, by the next day. There was also a ten-day expedition in 2004. The goal of this was to capture all three birds and bring them to a bird conservation center on the island, in the hope they would produce offspring.\n\nOn September 9, 2004, one of the remaining birds, a male, was captured and taken to the Maui Bird Conservation Center in [[Olinda, Hawaii|Olinda]], in an attempt to breed the bird in captivity. However, biologists could not find a mate for the male before it died on November 26, 2004.<ref>Powell, Alvin (2008) ''The Race to Save the World's Rarest Bird - The Discovery and Death of the Po{{okina}}o-uli'', Stackpole Books: Mechanicsburg, PA, p.26.</ref>\n\nIf the two remaining birds still survive, they are over 20 years of age, nearing the end of their life, and probably have not been [[fertility|fertile]] for years. It is uncertain whether they are a male and female, or both are of the same sex. Since 2004, extensive surveys have failed to locate these or other individuals of this species and it could be extinct, but remains listed as [[critically endangered]] by [[BirdLife International]] (and thereby the [[IUCN]]) until additional surveys have confirmed its extinction beyond reasonable doubt. Tissue samples have been taken from the male captured in 2004 for possible future cloning.\n\nThe dramatic population decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including [[habitat]] loss, [[mosquito]]-borne diseases, predation by [[pig]]s, [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[small Asian mongoose]]s, and a decline in the native tree snails that the po{{okina}}ouli relied on for food.\n\nIn 2019, after continued habitat degradation, presence disease of and invasive species, and a long period with no sightings, the IUCN classified this bird as [[endangered]].<ref name=\"IUCN\"></ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of recently extinct birds]]\n* [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands]]\n* [[Holocene extinction]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* BirdLife International (2007b): [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/search/species_search.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=8926&m=0 Po\u02bbo-uli - BirdLife Species Factsheet].

However, biologists could not find a mate for the male before it died on November 26, 2004.<ref>Powell, Alvin (2008) ''The Race to Save the World's Rarest Bird - The Discovery and Death of the Po{{okina}}o-uli'', Stackpole Books: Mechanicsburg, PA, p.26.</ref>\n\nIf the two remaining birds still survive, they are over 20 years of age, nearing the end of their life, and probably have not been [[fertility|fertile]] for years. It is uncertain whether they are a male and female, or both are of the same sex. Since 2004, extensive surveys have failed to locate these or other individuals of this species and it could be extinct, but remains listed as [[critically endangered]] by [[BirdLife International]] (and thereby the [[IUCN]]) until additional surveys have confirmed its extinction beyond reasonable doubt. Tissue samples have been taken from the male captured in 2004 for possible future cloning.\n\nThe dramatic population decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including [[habitat]] loss, [[mosquito]]-borne diseases, predation by [[pig]]s, [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[small Asian mongoose]]s, and a decline in the native tree snails that the po{{okina}}ouli relied on for food.\n\nIn 2019, after continued habitat degradation, presence disease of and invasive species, and a long period with no sightings, the IUCN classified this bird as [[endangered]].<ref name=\"IUCN\"></ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of recently extinct birds]]\n* [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands]]\n* [[Holocene extinction]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* BirdLife International (2007b): [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/search/species_search.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=8926&m=0 Po\u02bbo-uli - BirdLife Species Factsheet].

From the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]].  In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized, then in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  In 1867, '''Cloud County''' was established.\n\nCloud county was originally named \"Shirley\" county, but civic leaders feared that sounded too much like the name of a prostitute.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdD5adyrRFEC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Kansas Trivia | publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc. | author=Brackman, Barbara | year=1997 | pages=21}}</ref> It was then renamed \"Cloud\" county in honor of Colonel [[William F.

The county was legally organized on September 6, 1866 with Elk Creek designated as the temporary county seat.<ref>[http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/cloud/cloud-co-p2.html#COUNTY_ORGANIZATION History of the State of Kansas] by William G. Cutler, Kansas Collection of Books</ref>\n\nIn 1887, [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] built a branch line from [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]] (3 miles west of [[Strong City, Kansas|Strong City]]) to [[Superior, Nebraska]].  This branch line connected [[Strong City, Kansas|Strong City]], [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]], [[Rockland, Kansas|Rockland]], [[Diamond Springs, Kansas|Diamond Springs]], [[Burdick, Kansas|Burdick]], [[Lost Springs, Kansas|Lost Springs]], [[Jacobs, Kansas|Jacobs]], [[Hope, Kansas|Hope]], [[Navarre, Kansas|Navarre]], [[Enterprise, Kansas|Enterprise]], [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Talmage, Kansas|Talmage]], [[Manchester, Kansas|Manchester]], [[Longford, Kansas|Longford]], [[Oak Hill, Kansas|Oak Hill]], [[Miltonvale, Kansas|Miltonvale]], [[Aurora, Kansas|Aurora]], [[Huscher, Kansas|Huscher]], [[Concordia, Kansas|Concordia]], [[Kackley, Kansas|Kackley]], [[Courtland, Kansas|Courtland]], [[Webber, Kansas|Webber]], [[Superior, Nebraska|Superior]].  At some point, the line from [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]] to [[Lost Springs, Kansas|Lost Springs]] was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned.  This branch line was originally called \"Strong City and Superior line\" but later the name was shortened to the \"Strong City line\".  In 1996, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] merged with [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and renamed to the current [[BNSF Railway]]. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Santa Fe\".\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|718|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|715|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|2.6|sqmi}} (0.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Geographic features===\nThe [[Republican River]] passes through the county, entering from [[Republic County, Kansas|Republic County]] to the north and exiting to [[Clay County, Kansas|Clay County]] to the east. The [[Solomon River]] traverses the southwestern portion of the county, going from [[Mitchell County, KS|Mitchell County]] to [[Ottawa County, Kansas|Ottawa County]]. [[Jamestown Wildlife Area|Jamestown Lake]] lies partially in the northwestern part of the county and partially in southwestern Republic county.\n\n===Major highways===\nCloud County is bisected from north to south by [[U.S. Route 81 (Kansas)|U.S. Route 81]], which runs through the town of [[Concordia, Kansas|Concordia]] and connects north to [[Belleville, Kansas|Belleville]], [[Kansas]] or south to [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Kansas]].

The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.89.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 22.40% under the age of 18, 10.40% from 18 to 24, 21.90% from 25 to 44, 22.20% from 45 to 64, and 23.20% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females there were 90.60 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.60 males.\n\nThe [[Median household income|median income for a household]] in the county was $31,758, and the median income for a family was $39,745. Males had a median income of $27,166 versus $20,114 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the county was $17,536.  About 6.40% of families and 10.80% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 12.10% of those under age 18 and 8.70% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Government==\n\n===Presidential elections===\nCloud County is within the aboriginal territory of the Pawnee tribe, and later became a landscape of free stater colonialists.\n\nAt some point in time, it became commonplace for certain county residents to parade confederate flags around the high school campus during the last week of school. This behavior has always been an inappropriate display of bullying and colonial-imperialist scalawags. At no point in time was Kansas the realm of the confederacy. \n\nIt would be appropriate to return land management to the discretion of the Pawnee Tribe and return the buffalo to their territory when this farce of contemporary politics ends.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential Elections Results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized, then in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  In 1867, '''Cloud County''' was established.\n\nCloud county was originally named \"Shirley\" county, but civic leaders feared that sounded too much like the name of a prostitute.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdD5adyrRFEC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Kansas Trivia | publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc. | author=Brackman, Barbara | year=1997 | pages=21}}</ref> It was then renamed \"Cloud\" county in honor of Colonel [[William F.

The county was legally organized on September 6, 1866 with Elk Creek designated as the temporary county seat.<ref>[http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/cloud/cloud-co-p2.html#COUNTY_ORGANIZATION History of the State of Kansas] by William G. Cutler, Kansas Collection of Books</ref>\n\nIn 1887, [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] built a branch line from [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]] (3 miles west of [[Strong City, Kansas|Strong City]]) to [[Superior, Nebraska]].  This branch line connected [[Strong City, Kansas|Strong City]], [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]], [[Rockland, Kansas|Rockland]], [[Diamond Springs, Kansas|Diamond Springs]], [[Burdick, Kansas|Burdick]], [[Lost Springs, Kansas|Lost Springs]], [[Jacobs, Kansas|Jacobs]], [[Hope, Kansas|Hope]], [[Navarre, Kansas|Navarre]], [[Enterprise, Kansas|Enterprise]], [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Talmage, Kansas|Talmage]], [[Manchester, Kansas|Manchester]], [[Longford, Kansas|Longford]], [[Oak Hill, Kansas|Oak Hill]], [[Miltonvale, Kansas|Miltonvale]], [[Aurora, Kansas|Aurora]], [[Huscher, Kansas|Huscher]], [[Concordia, Kansas|Concordia]], [[Kackley, Kansas|Kackley]], [[Courtland, Kansas|Courtland]], [[Webber, Kansas|Webber]], [[Superior, Nebraska|Superior]].  At some point, the line from [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]] to [[Lost Springs, Kansas|Lost Springs]] was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned.  This branch line was originally called \"Strong City and Superior line\" but later the name was shortened to the \"Strong City line\".  In 1996, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] merged with [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and renamed to the current [[BNSF Railway]].

He has a sister, Shivani. Rudra and Bhavya have a son, Dhruv, and Om and Gauri have a daughter, Radhika. She is married to Varun and harbours a secret enmity against the Oberois. Shivaansh has only one dream - to build a hospital in his parents' memory to provide free treatment for poor children. He is shown to be fighting a terminal disease and has a short time left to live.\n\nAditi Deshmukh, Commissioner of Police, is introduced as a self-made, strong Marathi girl who supports her uncle, aunt, and a younger sister. While her sister, Mahu, is a big fan of Shivaansh, Aditi has a strong prejudice against his fame. Aditi's father is revealed to have gone missing when she was a child making her determined to find him. She is later revealed to be aiding Varun in planning against the Oberois.\n\nMannat Kaur Khurana is an orphan. Poor, unemployed and treated by her relatives as a burden, she is honest and principled. She gets a job at the Oberoi mansion. Meanwhile, Varun realises that Shivaansh may live if a heart transplant is successful so he abducts Mannat's friend, Munni, and starts  blackmailing Mannat. Shivaansh decides to pretend marrying Sonya, an actress, to make his ailing great grandmother happy. Plotting against Shivaansh, Varun swaps Sonya with Mannat and gets them married. Varun then blackmails Mannat to destroy the heart rate tracker crucial for Shivaansh's treatment so Mannat can inherit Shivaansh's wealth after his death but he fails. Eventually, the story ends with Sahil being exposed as Shivaay and Annika's killer and Shivaansh and Mannat confessing their love for each other.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Nakuul Mehta]] as Shivaay

Hayes]]. The purpose of the act \u2013 in concert with the [[Insurrection Act|Insurrection Act of 1807]] \u2013 is to limit the powers of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] in using [[United States Armed Forces|federal military]] personnel to enforce [[Domestic policy|domestic policies]] within the [[United States]]. It was passed as an amendment to an army [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bill]] following the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and was updated in 1956 and 1981.\n\nThe act specifically applies only to the [[United States Army]] and, as amended in 1956, the [[United States Air Force]]. Although the act does not explicitly mention the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] has prescribed regulations that are generally construed to give the act force with respect to those services as well. The act does not prevent the [[Army National Guard]] or the [[Air National Guard|Air]] [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] under [[U.S. state|state]] authority from acting in a [[law enforcement]] capacity within its home state or in an adjacent state if invited by that state's governor. The [[United States Coast Guard]] (under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]) and [[United States Space Force]] (under the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]]) are not covered by the Posse Comitatus Act either, primarily because although both are [[United States Armed Forces|armed service]]s, they also have [[Admiralty law|maritime]] and [[space law]] enforcement missions respectively.\n\nThe title of the act comes from the legal concept of ''[[posse comitatus]]'', the authority under which a county sheriff, or other law officer, conscripts any able-bodied person to assist in keeping the peace.\n\n==History==\nThe Act, \u00a7 15 of the appropriations bill for the Army for 1879, found at {{USStat|20|152}}, was a response to, and subsequent prohibition of, the [[military occupation]] of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] by the [[United States Army]] during the twelve years of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] (1865\u20131877) following the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The president withdrew federal troops from the Southern States as a result of a compromise in one of the most disputed national elections in American history, the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 U.S. presidential election]]. [[Samuel J. Tilden]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of [[Ohio]] in the popular vote. Tilden garnered 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to Hayes' 165; 20 disputed electoral votes remained uncounted. After a bitter fight, Congress struck a deal resolving the dispute and awarded the presidency to Hayes. Known as the [[Compromise of 1877]], this agreement involved allowing South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana to agree to certify Rutherford B. Hayes as the president in exchange for the removal of federal troops from the South, formally ending Reconstruction. <ref name=\"Military Law Review\">[https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/47c2b664085060fc85256e5b00576e6e/$FILE/Volume175Felicetti.pdf \"The Posse Comitatus Act]: Setting the record straight on 124 years of mischief and misunderstanding before any more damage is done,\" ''Military Law Review'', Vol. 175, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] places primary responsibility for the holding of [[election]]s in the hands of the individual states.

The Arkansas governor had opposed desegregation after the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in 1954 in the ''[[Brown v.

Hayes]]. The purpose of the act \u2013 in concert with the [[Insurrection Act|Insurrection Act of 1807]] \u2013 is to limit the powers of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] in using [[United States Armed Forces|federal military]] personnel to enforce [[Domestic policy|domestic policies]] within the [[United States]]. It was passed as an amendment to an army [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bill]] following the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and was updated in 1956 and 1981.\n\nThe act specifically applies only to the [[United States Army]] and, as amended in 1956, the [[United States Air Force]]. Although the act does not explicitly mention the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] has prescribed regulations that are generally construed to give the act force with respect to those services as well. The act does not prevent the [[Army National Guard]] or the [[Air National Guard|Air]] [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] under [[U.S. state|state]] authority from acting in a [[law enforcement]] capacity within its home state or in an adjacent state if invited by that state's governor. The [[United States Coast Guard]] (under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]) and [[United States Space Force]] (under the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]]) are not covered by the Posse Comitatus Act either, primarily because although both are [[United States Armed Forces|armed service]]s, they also have [[Admiralty law|maritime]] and [[space law]] enforcement missions respectively.\n\nThe title of the act comes from the legal concept of ''[[posse comitatus]]'', the authority under which a county sheriff, or other law officer, conscripts any able-bodied person to assist in keeping the peace.\n\n==History==\nThe Act, \u00a7 15 of the appropriations bill for the Army for 1879, found at {{USStat|20|152}}, was a response to, and subsequent prohibition of, the [[military occupation]] of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] by the [[United States Army]] during the twelve years of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] (1865\u20131877) following the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The president withdrew federal troops from the Southern States as a result of a compromise in one of the most disputed national elections in American history, the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 U.S. presidential election]]. [[Samuel J. Tilden]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of [[Ohio]] in the popular vote. Tilden garnered 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to Hayes' 165; 20 disputed electoral votes remained uncounted. After a bitter fight, Congress struck a deal resolving the dispute and awarded the presidency to Hayes. Known as the [[Compromise of 1877]], this agreement involved allowing South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana to agree to certify Rutherford B. Hayes as the president in exchange for the removal of federal troops from the South, formally ending Reconstruction. <ref name=\"Military Law Review\">[https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/47c2b664085060fc85256e5b00576e6e/$FILE/Volume175Felicetti.pdf \"The Posse Comitatus Act]: Setting the record straight on 124 years of mischief and misunderstanding before any more damage is done,\" ''Military Law Review'', Vol. 175, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] places primary responsibility for the holding of [[election]]s in the hands of the individual states.

For example, a U.S. Navy vessel may be used to track, follow, and stop a vessel suspected of drug smuggling, but Coast Guard [[Law Enforcement Detachments]] (LEDETs) embarked aboard the Navy vessel would perform the actual boarding and, if needed, arrest the suspect vessel's crew.<ref name=\"CGLEDET\" />\n\nOn December 20, 2019, the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020]] authorized the creation of the [[United States Space Force]], the sixth U.S. military branch under the [[United States Department of the Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Trump Signs Law Establishing U.S. Space Force|url=https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2046035/trump-signs-law-establishing-us-space-force/|author=Jim Garamone|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|date=December 20, 2019|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref> In February 2020, Air Force Major Generals Dustin L.

It was burned to the ground by Swedish invaders in 1567 during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]]. Half the population was evacuated down the river to what is today known as Fredrikstad, about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} downstream.\n\nMuch of the rebuilt town disappeared into the river [[Glomma]] during a 1702 [[mudslide]]. Again Borg was rebuilt, and it was recreated as a city in 1839, and separated from [[Tune, Norway|Tune]] as a municipality of its own.\n\nThe rural municipalities of Tune, [[Skjeberg]], and [[Varteig]] were merged with the city on 1 January 1992. The population is steadily growing, and during the summer of 2005 it reached 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn 2016 the town celebrated its 1,000th anniversary, and the entire year was commemorated by a special programme that encouraged historic preservation within the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarpsborg2016.no|title=Sarpsborg 1016-2016}}</ref> \n\n{| style=\"float: right;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Number of minorities (1st and 2nd generation) in Sarpsborg by country of origin in 2017'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectvarval/Define.asp?subjectcode=&ProductId=&MainTable=FolkInnvkatLand&nvl=&PLanguage=1&nyTmpVar=true&CMSSubjectArea=befolkning&KortNavnWeb=innvbef&StatVariant=&checked=true |title= Immigrants and Norwegian-born to immigrant parents, by immigration category, country background and percentages of the population|publisher=ssb.no |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n \n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Ancestry\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Number\n|-\n| {{flag|Poland}}||1,447\n|-\n| {{flag|Iraq}}||1,168\n|-\n| {{flag|Bosnia-Herzegovina}}||1,043\n|-\n| ''{{flag|Kosovo}}''||713\n|-\n| {{flag|Somalia}}||529\n|-\n| {{flag|Sweden}}||463\n|-\n| {{flag|Syria}}||301\n|-\n| {{flag|Iran}}||290\n|-\n| {{flag|Vietnam}}||281\n|-\n| {{flag|Afghanistan}}||247\n|-\n| {{flag|Philippines}}||225\n|-\n| {{flag|Lithuania}}||211\n|-\n| {{flag|Thailand}}||198\n|-\n| {{flag|Denmark}}||184\n|-\n| {{flag|Pakistan}}||146\n|}\n[[File:Sarpsborg.jpg|275px|right|thumbnail|Downtown Sarpsborg (Roald Amundsens Gate)]]\n\n==City districts==\n*[[Hasle, \u00d8stfold|Hasle]]\n*Sandbakken\n*Sarpsborg\n*[[Ise, Sarpsborg|Ise]]\n*[[Skjeberg]]\n*[[Alvim, Sarpsborg|Alvim]]\n*[[Sannesund]]\n*[[Gre\u00e5ker]]\n*[[Gr\u00e5lum]]\n*[[Borgenhaugen]]\n*[[Klavestadhaugen]]\n*[[Yven]]\n*[[H\u00f8ysand]]\n*[[Varteig]]\n*[[Hafslund]]\n*[[Hannestad]]\n*[[Gleng]]\n*[[Fritznerbakken]]\n*[[Kurland, Sarpsborg|Kurland]]\n*[[Lande, Sarpsborg|Lande]]\n*[[Valaskjold]]\n*[[Brevik, Sarpsborg|Brevik]]\n*[[Opsund, Sarpsborg|Opsund]]\n\n==Sport==\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Sarpsborg was famous for its [[Association football|football (soccer)]] team, [[Sarpsborg FK]], but is now more known for its [[ice hockey]] team, [[Sparta Warriors]].

The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg.\n\nSarpsborg is part of the fifth [[List of continuously built-up areas in Norway by population|largest urban area in Norway]] when paired with neighbouring [[Fredrikstad]]. As of 1 January 2018, according to [[Statistics Norway]] these two municipalities have a total population of 136,127 with  55,840 in Sarpsborg and 81,278 in Fredrikstad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/folkemengde/kvartal|title=Population 1 January and population changes until now this year.

The city is also the home of [[Borg Bryggerier]], part of the [[Hansa Borg Bryggerier]], which is Norway's second largest [[brewery]]-group.\n\n==General information==\n\n===Name===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nIn [[Norsemen|Norse]] times the city was just called ''Borg'' (from ''borg'' which means \"[[castle]]\"). The background for this was the [[fortification]] built by Olav Haraldsson (see History section).  Later the [[genitive case]] of the name of the [[waterfall]] ''Sarpr'' ([[Sarp Falls]]) was added.\n\nIn Norse times \u00d8stfold county was called ''Borgars\u00fdsla'' which means \"the county (s\u00fdsla) of Borg\" and the law district of southeast Norway was called ''Borgar\u00feing'' meaning \"the [[thing (assembly)|thing]]/court of Borg\".\n\nThe old name has been revived in the [[diocese of Borg]] (1968) and [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] (1995).\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times and was granted on 13 November 1991.  It is based on a coat of arms dating from 1556 and shows a bear above a castle. The bear was introduced as early as some time in the 13th century, by the [[earl]] of Sarpsborg ''(Comes de Saresburgh)'', [[Alv Erlingsson]]. He used the bear to symbolise his strength.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The castle symbolises the fortress (borg) that gave the city its original name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarpsborg.com/portal/page?_pageid=33,3140&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&articleId=11573&artSectionId=1246|title=Vedtak om bruk av byv\u00e5penet i den nye kommunen|publisher=Sarpsborg|accessdate=2008-12-15|language=no}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded as ''Borg'' by the Viking King [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav Haraldsson]] (Saint Olaf) in 1016. It was burned to the ground by Swedish invaders in 1567 during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]]. Half the population was evacuated down the river to what is today known as Fredrikstad, about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} downstream.\n\nMuch of the rebuilt town disappeared into the river [[Glomma]] during a 1702 [[mudslide]]. Again Borg was rebuilt, and it was recreated as a city in 1839, and separated from [[Tune, Norway|Tune]] as a municipality of its own.\n\nThe rural municipalities of Tune, [[Skjeberg]], and [[Varteig]] were merged with the city on 1 January 1992. The population is steadily growing, and during the summer of 2005 it reached 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn 2016 the town celebrated its 1,000th anniversary, and the entire year was commemorated by a special programme that encouraged historic preservation within the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarpsborg2016.no|title=Sarpsborg 1016-2016}}</ref> \n\n{| style=\"float: right;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Number of minorities (1st and 2nd generation) in Sarpsborg by country of origin in 2017'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectvarval/Define.asp?subjectcode=&ProductId=&MainTable=FolkInnvkatLand&nvl=&PLanguage=1&nyTmpVar=true&CMSSubjectArea=befolkning&KortNavnWeb=innvbef&StatVariant=&checked=true |title= Immigrants and Norwegian-born to immigrant parents, by immigration category, country background and percentages of the population|publisher=ssb.no |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n \n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Ancestry\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Number\n|-\n| {{flag|Poland}}||1,447\n|-\n| {{flag|Iraq}}||1,168\n|-\n| {{flag|Bosnia-Herzegovina}}||1,043\n|-\n| ''{{flag|Kosovo}}''||713\n|-\n| {{flag|Somalia}}||529\n|-\n| {{flag|Sweden}}||463\n|-\n| {{flag|Syria}}||301\n|-\n| {{flag|Iran}}||290\n|-\n| {{flag|Vietnam}}||281\n|-\n| {{flag|Afghanistan}}||247\n|-\n| {{flag|Philippines}}||225\n|-\n| {{flag|Lithuania}}||211\n|-\n| {{flag|Thailand}}||198\n|-\n| {{flag|Denmark}}||184\n|-\n| {{flag|Pakistan}}||146\n|}\n[[File:Sarpsborg.jpg|275px|right|thumbnail|Downtown Sarpsborg (Roald Amundsens Gate)]]\n\n==City districts==\n*[[Hasle, \u00d8stfold|Hasle]]\n*Sandbakken\n*Sarpsborg\n*[[Ise, Sarpsborg|Ise]]\n*[[Skjeberg]]\n*[[Alvim, Sarpsborg|Alvim]]\n*[[Sannesund]]\n*[[Gre\u00e5ker]]\n*[[Gr\u00e5lum]]\n*[[Borgenhaugen]]\n*[[Klavestadhaugen]]\n*[[Yven]]\n*[[H\u00f8ysand]]\n*[[Varteig]]\n*[[Hafslund]]\n*[[Hannestad]]\n*[[Gleng]]\n*[[Fritznerbakken]]\n*[[Kurland, Sarpsborg|Kurland]]\n*[[Lande, Sarpsborg|Lande]]\n*[[Valaskjold]]\n*[[Brevik, Sarpsborg|Brevik]]\n*[[Opsund, Sarpsborg|Opsund]]\n\n==Sport==\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Sarpsborg was famous for its [[Association football|football (soccer)]] team, [[Sarpsborg FK]], but is now more known for its [[ice hockey]] team, [[Sparta Warriors]].

Considered a leading composer of the late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and early [[20th-century classical music|modern]] eras, he has been described as a successor of [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Franz Liszt]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> Along with [[Gustav Mahler]], he represents the late flowering of [[German Romanticism]] after Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of [[orchestration]] are combined with an advanced [[harmony|harmonic]] style.\n\nStrauss's compositional output began in 1870 when he was just six years old and lasted until his death nearly eighty years later. While his output of works encompasses nearly every type of classical compositional form, Strauss achieved his greatest success with [[tone poem]]s and [[opera]]s. His first tone poem to achieve wide acclaim was ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1889), and this was followed by other lauded works of this kind, including ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1890), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1905), and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1915). His first opera to achieve international fame was ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1905) which used a libretto by [[Hedwig Lachmann]] that was a German translation of the French play ''[[Salome (play)|Salom\u00e9]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]. This was followed by several critically acclaimed operas with librettist [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]: ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). His last operas, ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1938), ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1938), ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942) used libretti written by [[Joseph Gregor]], the Viennese theatre historian. Other well-known works by Strauss include two symphonies, [[lied]]er (especially his ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' from 1948),  the [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882), the [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883), [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1943),  his [[Oboe Concerto (Strauss)|Oboe Concerto]] and other instrumental works such as ''[[Metamorphosen]]'' (1945).\n\nStrauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. He was chiefly admired for his interpretations of the works of Liszt, Mozart, and Wagner in addition to his own works. A conducting disciple of [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], Strauss began his conducting career as B\u00fclow's assistant with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] in 1883. After B\u00fclow resigned in 1885, Strauss served as that orchestra's primary conductor for five months before being appointed to the conducting staff of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] where he worked as third conductor from 1886\u20131889. He then served as principal conductor of the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar]] from 1889\u20131894. In 1894 he made his conducting debut at the [[Bayreuth Festival]], conducting Wagner's ''[[Tannh\u00e4user]]'' with his wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], singing Elisabeth. He then returned to the Bavarian State Opera, this time as principal conductor, from 1894\u20131898, after which he was principal conductor of the [[Berlin State Opera]] from 1898\u20131913. From 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]], and in 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]]. In addition to these posts, Strauss was a frequent guest conductor in opera houses and with orchestras internationally.\n\nIn 1933 Strauss was appointed to two important positions in the musical life of [[Nazi Germany]]: head of the [[Reichsmusikkammer]] and principal conductor of the Bayreuth Festival. The latter role he accepted after conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] had resigned from the position in protest of the Nazi party. These positions have led some to criticize Strauss for his seeming collaboration with the Nazis. However, Strauss's daughter-in-law, Alice Grab Strauss [n\u00e9e von Hermannsw\u00f6rth], was Jewish and much of his apparent acquiescence to the Nazi Party was done in order to save her life and the lives of her children (his grandchildren). He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post in order to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist, Stefan Zweig, for his opera ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935) which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera ''Friedenstag'', which premiered just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrong doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.\n\n==Early life and career (1864\u20131886)==\n[[File:Richard Strauss 20OCT1886.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Strauss aged 22]]\nStrauss was born on 11 June 1864 in [[Munich]], the son of Josephine (n\u00e9e Pschorr) and [[Franz Strauss]], who was the principal [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] player at the Court Opera in Munich and a professor at the [[K\u00f6nigliche Musikschule]].<ref name=\"g1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Richard_Strauss.aspx|title=Richard Strauss facts, information, pictures|website=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> His mother was the daughter of Georg Pschorr, a financially prosperous [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery|brewer from Munich]].<ref name=\"g1\">{{harvnb|Gilliam|Youmans|2001}}</ref>\n\nStrauss began his musical studies at the age of four, studying piano with August Tombo who was the harpist in the Munich Court Orchestra.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He soon after began attending the rehearsals of the orchestra, and began getting lessons in music theory and orchestration from the ensemble's assistant conductor. He wrote his first composition at the age of six, and continued to write music almost until his death.  In 1872, he started receiving violin instruction from [[Benno Walter]], the director of the Munich Court Orchestra and his father's cousin, and at 11 began five years of compositional study with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1882 he graduated from the Ludwigsgymnasium and afterwards attended only one year at the [[University of Munich]] in 1882\u20131883.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn addition to his formal teachers, Strauss was profoundly influenced musically by his father who made instrumental music-making central to the Strauss home. The Strauss family was frequently joined in their home for music making, meals, and other activities by the orphaned composer and music theorist [[Ludwig Thuille]] who was viewed as an adopted member of the family.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Strauss's father taught his son the music of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Schubert.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further assisted his son with his musical composition during the 1870s and into the early 1880s, providing advice, comments, and criticisms.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further provided support by showcasing his sons compositions in performance with the \u2018Wilde Gung'l\u2019, an amateur orchestra he conducted from 1875\u20131896. Many of his early symphonic compositions were written for this ensemble.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His compositions at this time were indebted to the style of [[Robert Schumann]] or [[Felix Mendelssohn]], true to his father's teachings. His father undoubtedly had a crucial influence on his son's developing taste, not least in Strauss's abiding love for the horn. His [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]], is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1874, Strauss heard his first [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas, ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1878 he attended performances of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' and ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'' in Munich, and in 1879 he attended performances of the entire ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring Cycle]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'', and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The influence of Wagner's music on Strauss's style was to be profound, but at first his musically conservative father forbade him to study it. Indeed, in the Strauss household, the music of Richard Wagner was viewed with deep suspicion, and it was not until the age of 16 that Strauss was able to obtain a score of ''Tristan und Isolde''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1882 he went to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to hear his father perform in the world premiere of Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]''; after which surviving letters to his father and to Thuille detail his seemingly negative impression of Wagner and his music.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In later life, Strauss said that he deeply regretted the conservative hostility to Wagner's progressive works.<ref name=\"B\">{{harvnb|Boyden|1999|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1882, in Vienna, Strauss gave the first performance of his [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]], playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] as assistant conductor to [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's ''Serenade (Op. 7)'' for wind instruments, composed when he was only 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing B\u00fclow in rehearsal. B\u00fclow was very fond of the young man, and Strauss considered him as his greatest conducting mentor, often crediting him as teaching him \"the art of interpretation\".<ref name=\"g1\"/> Notably, under B\u00fclow's baton he made his first major appearance as a concert pianist, performing Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 24]], for which he composed his own [[cadenza]]s.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1885, B\u00fclow unexpectedly resigned from his post, and Strauss was left to lead the Meiningen Court Orchestra as interim principal conductor for the remainder of the artistic season through April 1886.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He notably helped prepare the orchestra for the world premiere performance of [[Johannes Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]], which Brahms himself conducted. He also conducted his [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] for Brahms, who advised Strauss: \"Your symphony contains too much playing about with themes. This piling up of many themes based on a triad, which differ from one another only in rhythm, has no value.\"<ref name=\"g1\"/> Brahms' music, like Wagner's, also left a tremendous impression upon Strauss, and he often referred to this time of his life as his \u2018Brahmsschw\u00e4rmerei\u2019 (\u2018Brahms adoration\u2019) during which several his compositions clearly show Brahms' influence, including ''Wandrers Sturmlied'' (1884) and ''Burleske'' (1885\u201386).\"<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\n==Strauss finds success in conducting and tone poems (1885\u20131898)==\n[[File:Pauline Strauss de Ahna.jpg|thumb|Pauline de Ahna Strauss, c. 1900]]\nIn 1885 Strauss met the composer [[Alexander Ritter]] who was a violinist in the Meiningen orchestra and the husband of one of [[Richard Wagner]]'s nieces. An avid champion of the ideals of Wagner and [[Franz Liszt]], Ritter had a tremendous impact on the trajectory of Strauss' work as a composer from 1885 onward. Ritter convinced Strauss to abandon his more conservative style of composing and embrace the \"music of the future\" by modeling his compositional style off of Wagner and Liszt.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He further influenced Strauss by engaging him in studies and conversations on the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Wagner, and Friedrich von Hausegger. All of this together gave a new aesthetic anchor to Strauss which first became evident in his embrace of the [[tone poem]] genre.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter leaving his post in Meiningen in 1886, Strauss spent several weeks traveling throughout Italy before assuming a new post as third conductor at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] (then known as the Munich Hofoper). While traveling he wrote down descriptions of the various sites he was seeing along with tonal impressions that went with those descriptions. These he communicated in a letter to his mother, and they ultimately were used as the beginning of his first [[tone poem]], ''[[Aus Italien]]'' (1886).<ref name=\"g1\" /> Shortly after Strauss assumed his opera conducting duties in Munich, Ritter himself moved to the city in September 1886. For the next three years the two men would meet regularly, often joined by Thuille and [[Anton Seidl]], in order to discuss music, particularly Wagner and Liszt, and discuss poetry, literature, and philosophy.<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\nStrauss's tenure at the Bavarian State Opera was not a happy one. With the death of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] in June 1886, the opera house was not as well financially supported by his successor [[Otto of Bavaria]] which meant that much of the more ambitious and expensive repertoire that he wanted to stage, such as Wagner's operas, were unfeasible. The opera assignments he was given, works by Boieldieu, Auber and Donizetti, bored him, and to make matters worse Hermann Levi, the senior conductor at the house, was often ill and Strauss was required to step in at the last minute to conduct performance for operas which he had never rehearsed. This caused problems for him, the singers, and the orchestra. During this time, Strauss did find much more enjoyable conducting work outside Munich in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig. In the latter city he met and befriended the composer [[Gustav Mahler]] in the autumn of 1887. Also happily, Strauss met his future wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], in 1887. De Ahna was then a voice student at the [[Munich Musikschule]], but soon switched to private lessons with Strauss who became her principal teacher.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn May 1889 Strauss left his post with the Bavarian State Opera after being appointed [[Kapellmeister]] to [[Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in Weimar, beginning in the Autumn of 1889. During the Summer of 1889 he served as the assistant conductor of the [[Bayreuth Festival]] during which time he befriended [[Cosima Wagner]] who became a longterm close friend.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Pauline De Ahna went with Strauss to Weimar and he later married her on 10 September 1894. She was famous for being irascible, garrulous, eccentric and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was a great source of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of 1948, he preferred the [[soprano|soprano voice]] to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles. In Weimar she created the role of Freihild in Strauss's first opera, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'', in 1894. The opera was received with mixed reviews in Weimar, but its later production in Munich was met with scorn and was Strauss's first major failure.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n[[File:Strauss Haus Garmisch.JPG|thumb|Strauss villa at [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]. Built 1906. Architect: Emanuel Seidl.]]\nIn spite of the failure of his first opera, Strauss's tenure in Weimar brought about several important successes for his career. His tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' premiered in Weimar on 11 November 1889 to tremendous critical response, and the work quickly brought him international fame and success. This was followed by another lauded achievement, the premiere of his tone poem ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' in 1890. Both of these works, along with the earlier ''Burleske'', became internationally known and established him as a leading modernist composer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also had much success as a conductor in Weimar, particularly with the symphonic poems of Liszt and an uncut production of ''Tristan und Isolde'' in 1892.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn the Summer of 1894 Strauss made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's ''Tannh\u00e4user'' with Pauline singing Elisabeth. Just prior to their marriage the following September, Strauss left his post in Weimar when he was appointed Kapellmeister, or first conductor, of the Bavarian State Opera where he became responsible for the operas of Wagner. While working in Munich for the next four years he had his largest creative period period of tone poem composition, producing ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), and ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898).<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in 1894\u20131895.

By this time in his career, he was in constant demand as a guest conductor internationally and enjoyed celebrity status as a conductor; particularly in the works of Wagner, Mozart, and Liszt in addition to his own compositions.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He became president of the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein]] in 1901, and that same year became leader of the [[Berliner Tonk\u00fcnstlerverein]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as editor of the book series ''Die Musik''. He used all of these posts to champion contemporary German composers like Mahler. His own compositions were becoming increasingly popular, and the first major orchestra to perform an entire concert of only his music was the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1901.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1903 Strauss Festivals dedicated to his music were established in London and Heidelberg. At the latter festival his cantata ''[[Taillefer (Strauss)|Taillefer]]'' was given its world premiere.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1904 Strauss embarked on his first North American tour, with stops in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and Pittsburgh. At [[Carnegie Hall]] he conducted the world premiere of his ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' on March 21, 1904 with the [[Wetzler Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Wetzler\">{{cite news|title=Herman Wetzler, Composer, 72, Dies|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 30, 1943|page=26}}</ref> He also conducted several other works in collaboration with composer [[Hermann Hans Wetzler]] and his orchestra that year at Carnegie Hall, and also performed a concert of leider with his wife.<ref name=\"Wetzler\"/> During this trip he was working intensively on composing his third opera, ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', based on [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1891 play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''. The work, which premiered in Dresden in 1905, became Strauss's greatest triumph in his career up to that point, and opera houses all over the world quickly began programing the opera.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter ''Salome'', Strauss had a string of critically successful operas which he created with the librettist and poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. These operas included ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933).<ref name=\"g1\"/> While all of these works remain part of the opera repertoire, his opera ''Der Rosenkavalier'' is generally considered his finest achievement.<ref name=\"g1\"/> During this time he continued to work internationally as a celebrity conductor, and from 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]] with Reinhardt and the set designer Alfred Rolle. In 1924 Strauss's opera ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' premiered at the [[Semperoper|Dresden Semperoper]] with both the music and the libretto by Strauss. For this opera, Strauss wanted to move away from post-Wagnerian metaphysics which had been the philosophical framework of Hofmannsthal's libretti, and instead embrace a modern domestic comedy to Hofmannsthal's chagrin.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The work proved to be a success.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1924 Strauss's son Franz married Alice von Grab-Hermannsw\u00f6rth, daughter of a Jewish industrialist, in a Roman Catholic ceremony.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Franz and Alice had two sons, Richard and Christian.<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Strauss in Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945)==\n\n===''Reichsmusikkammer''===\nIn March 1933, when Strauss was 68, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rose to power]]. Strauss never joined the Nazi party, and studiously avoided [[Nazi salute|Nazi forms of greeting]]. For reasons of expediency, however, he was initially drawn into cooperating with the early Nazi regime in the hope that Hitler\u2014an ardent Wagnerian and music lover who had admired Strauss' work since viewing ''Salome'' in 1907\u2014would promote German art and culture. Strauss's need to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law and Jewish grandchildren also motivated his behavior,<ref name=\"g1\" /> in addition to his determination to preserve and conduct the music of banned composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Claude Debussy]].\n\nIn 1933, Strauss wrote in his private notebook:\n<blockquote>I consider the [[Julius Streicher|Streicher]]-Goebbels Jew-baiting as a disgrace to German honour, as evidence of incompetence\u2014the basest weapon of untalented, lazy mediocrity against a higher intelligence and greater talent.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 274.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, far from being an admirer of Strauss's work, [[Joseph Goebbels]] maintained expedient cordiality with Strauss only for a period. Goebbels wrote in his diary:\n<blockquote>Unfortunately we still need him, but one day we shall have our own music and then we shall have no further need of this decadent neurotic.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 293</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Strauss Time 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Strauss was on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' in 1927 and (here) 1938]]\nNevertheless, because of Strauss's international eminence, in November 1933 he was appointed to the post of president of the newly founded ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', the Reich Music Chamber. Strauss, who had lived through numerous political regimes and had no interest in politics, decided to accept the position but to remain apolitical, a decision which would eventually become untenable. He wrote to his family, \"I made music under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]], and under [[Friedrich Ebert|Ebert]]. I'll survive under this one as well.\"<ref name=em/> In 1935 he wrote in his journal:\n<blockquote>In November 1933, the minister Goebbels nominated me president of the ''Reichsmusikkammer'' without obtaining my prior agreement. I was not consulted. I accepted this honorary office because I hoped that I would be able to do some good and prevent worse misfortunes, if from now onwards German musical life were going to be, as it was said, \"reorganized\" by amateurs and ignorant place-seekers.<ref name=em>Quoted on [http://exploringmusic.wfmt.com/listen-to-the-show/151/strauss-richard ''[[Exploring Music]]'' (2004) on the WFMT Radio Network; Episode 5 of 5 of \"Richard Strauss\"], first aired 9 January 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nStrauss privately scorned Goebbels and called him \"a pipsqueak\".<ref>Reuth 1993, p. 402</ref> However, in 1933 he dedicated an orchestral song, \"''Das B\u00e4chlein''\" (\"The Little Brook\"), to Goebbels, in order to gain his cooperation in extending German music copyright laws from 30 years to 50 years.<ref>Kennedy 1999, pp. 281\u2013282</ref> Also in 1933, he replaced [[Arturo Toscanini]] as director of the Bayreuth Festival after Toscanini had resigned in protest to the Nazi regime.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nStrauss attempted to ignore Nazi bans on performances of works by Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. He also continued to work on a comic opera, ''Die schweigsame Frau'', with his Jewish friend and librettist Stefan Zweig. When the opera was premiered in Dresden in 1935, Strauss insisted that Zweig's name appear on the theatrical billing, much to the ire of the Nazi regime. Hitler and Goebbels avoided attending the opera, and it was halted after three performances and subsequently banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 285</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1935, Strauss wrote a letter to Stefan Zweig, in which he stated:\n<blockquote>Do you believe I am ever, in any of my actions, guided by the thought that I am 'German'? Do you suppose Mozart was consciously 'Aryan' when he composed? I recognise only two types of people: those who have talent and those who have none.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis letter to Zweig was intercepted by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to Hitler. Strauss was subsequently [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from his post as ''Reichsmusikkammer'' president in 1935. The [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Summer Olympics]] nevertheless used Strauss's ''[[Olympische Hymne]]'', which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, \"To Strauss the composer I take off my hat; to Strauss the man I put it back on again\", when Strauss had accepted the presidency of the ''Reichsmusikkammer''.<ref>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (1978), Review of \"A Confidential Matter: The Letters of Richard Strauss and Stefan Zweig, 1931\u20131935\" in ''[[Music & Letters]]'', Vol.&nbsp;59, No.&nbsp;4, October 1978. pp.&nbsp;472\u2013475.</ref> Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 316</ref>\n\n===Operas with Joseph Gregor and work to save his Jewish daughter-in-law ===\n[[File:Strauss 1938.jpg|thumb|240px|Strauss at Garmisch in 1938]]\nFrustrated that he could no longer work with Zweig as his librettist, Strauss turned to [[Joseph Gregor]], a Viennese theatre historian, at Gregor's request. The first opera they worked on together was ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'', but it ultimately became the second of their operas to be premiered. Their first work to be staged was in 1938, when the entire nation was preparing for war, they presented ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (''Peace Day''), a one-act opera set in a besieged fortress during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The work is essentially a hymn to peace and a thinly veiled criticism of the Third Reich. With its contrasts between freedom and enslavement, war and peace, light and dark, this work has a close affinity with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]''. Productions of the opera ceased shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939. The two men collaborated on two more operas which proved to be Strauss's last: ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942).<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nWhen his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice was placed under house arrest in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in 1938, Strauss used his connections in Berlin, including opera-house General Intendant [[Heinz Tietjen]], to secure her safety. He drove to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in order to argue, albeit unsuccessfully, for the release of Alice's grandmother, Paula Neumann. In the end, Neumann and 25 other relatives were murdered in the camps.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/06/arts/music-richard-strauss-and-hitler-s-reich-jupiter-in-hell.html \"Music; Richard Strauss and Hitler's Reich: Jupiter in Hell\"] by [[Michael Hans Kater]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 January 2002</ref> While Alice's mother, Marie von Grab, was safe in Lucerne, Switzerland, Strauss also wrote several letters to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] pleading for the release of her children who were also held in camps; his letters were ignored.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 339</ref>\n\nIn 1942, Strauss moved with his family back to Vienna, where Alice and her children could be protected by [[Baldur von Schirach]], the [[Gauleiter]] of Vienna. However, Strauss was unable to protect his Jewish relatives completely; in early 1944, while Strauss was away, Alice and his son Franz were abducted by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two nights. Strauss's personal intervention at this point saved them, and he was able to take them back to Garmisch, where the two remained under house arrest until the end of the war.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n===''Metamorphosen'' and apprehension by USA troops===\nStrauss completed the composition of ''[[Metamorphosen]]'', a work for 23 solo strings, in 1945. The title and inspiration for the work comes from a profoundly self-examining poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], which Strauss had considered setting as a choral work.<ref name=Ross338>Ross (2009), p. 338</ref> Generally regarded as one of the masterpieces of the string repertoire, ''Metamorphosen'' contains Strauss's most sustained outpouring of tragic emotion. Conceived and written during the blackest days of [[World War II]], the piece expresses Strauss's mourning of, among other things, the destruction of German culture\u2014including the bombing of every great opera house in the nation. At the end of the war, Strauss wrote in his private diary:\n<blockquote>The most terrible period of human history is at an end, the twelve year reign of bestiality, ignorance and anti-culture under the greatest criminals, during which Germany's 2000 years of cultural evolution met its doom.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 361</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn April 1945, Strauss was apprehended by American soldiers at his Garmisch estate. As he descended the staircase he announced to Lieutenant Milton Weiss of the U.S. Army, \"I am Richard Strauss, the composer of ''Rosenkavalier'' and ''Salome''.\" Lt. Weiss, who was also a musician, nodded in recognition. An \"Off Limits\" sign was subsequently placed on the lawn to protect Strauss.<ref>Ross 2009, p. 373</ref> The American oboist [[John de Lancie (oboist)|John de Lancie]], who knew Strauss's orchestral writing for oboe thoroughly, was in the army unit, and asked Strauss to compose an oboe concerto.

Now elderly and with very few resources remaining, Strauss and his wife left Germany for Switzerland in October 1945 where they settled in a hotel just outside Z\u00fcrich. There they met the Swiss music critic [[Willi Schuh (musicologist)|Willy Schuh]], who became Strauss's biographer. Strapped for cash, in 1947 Strauss embarked on his last international tour, a three-week trip to London, in which he conducted several of his tone poems and excerpts of his operas, and was present during a complete staging of ''Elektra'' by the [[BBC]]. The trip was a critical success and provided him and his wife with some much needed money.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nFrom May\u2013September 1948, just before his death, Strauss composed the ''Four Last Songs'' which deal with the subject of dying. The last one, \"Im Abendrot\" (At Sunset), ends with the line \"Is this perhaps death?\" The question is not answered in words, but instead Strauss quotes the \"transfiguration theme\" from his earlier tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''\u2014meant to symbolize the transfiguration and fulfilment of the soul after death. In June 1948, he was cleared of any wrong-doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.<ref name=\"g1\"/> That same month he orchestrated ''[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]'', a song that he had originally composed in 1894.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1948 Strauss was hospitalized for several weeks after undergoing bladder surgery.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His health rapidly deteriorated after that, and he conducted his last performance, the end of Act 2 of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' at the [[Prinzregententheater]] in Munich, during celebrations of his 85th birthday on June 10, 1949.

These pieces include early compositions for piano solo in a conservative harmonic style, many of which are lost: two piano trios (1877 and 1878), a string quartet (1881), a [[Sonata for piano in B minor, Op. 5|piano sonata]] (1882), a [[Cello Sonata (Strauss)|cello sonata]] (1883), a piano quartet (1885), a [[Violin Sonata (Strauss)|violin sonata]] (1888), as well as a serenade (1882) and a longer suite (1884), both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns and contrabassoon.\n\nAfter 1890, Strauss composed very infrequently for chamber groups, his energies being almost completely absorbed with large-scale orchestral works and operas. Four of his chamber pieces are actually arrangements of portions of his operas, including the ''Daphne-Etude'' for solo violin and the String Sextet, which is the overture to his final opera ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]''. His last independent chamber work, an Allegretto in E major for violin and piano, dates from 1948.\n\nHe also composed two large-scale works for wind ensemble during this period: Sonatina No. 1 \"From an Invalid's Workshop\" (1943) and Sonatina No. 2 \"Happy Workshop\" (1946)\u2014both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns, a third clarinet in C, bassett horn, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon.\n\n===Tone poems and other orchestral works===\n{{Main|Tone poems (Strauss)}}\nStrauss wrote two early symphonies: [[Symphony No. 1 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 1]] (1880) and [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] (1884). However, Strauss's style began to truly develop and change when, in 1885, he met [[Alexander Ritter]], a noted composer and violinist, and the husband of one of Richard Wagner's nieces. It was Ritter who persuaded Strauss to abandon the conservative style of his youth and begin writing [[tone poem]]s. He also introduced Strauss to the essays of Wagner and the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Strauss went on to conduct one of Ritter's operas, and at Strauss's request Ritter later wrote a poem describing the events depicted in Strauss's tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Also Sprach Zarathustra.ogg|title=Also Sprach Zarathustra|description=\"Sunrise fanfare\"}}\nThe new influences from Ritter resulted in what is widely regarded<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 69</ref> as Strauss's first piece to show his mature personality, the tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1888), which displays a new kind of virtuosity in its bravura orchestral manner. Strauss went on to write a series of increasingly ambitious tone poems: ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1889), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1903) and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1911\u20131915). One commentator has observed of these works that \"no orchestra could exist without his tone poems, written to celebrate the glories of the post-Wagnerian symphony orchestra.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 395</ref>\n\nJames Hepokoski notes a shift in Strauss's technique in the tone poems, occurring between 1892 and 1893. It was after this point that Strauss rejected the philosophy of Schopenhauer and began more forcefully critiquing the institution of the symphony and the symphonic poem, thereby differentiating the second cycle of tone poems from the first.\n\n===Solo instrument with orchestra===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Neal O'Doan - Burleske.ogg|title=''Burleske''|description=''[[Burleske]]'' (1885\u201386), performed by Neal O'Doan with the [[Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra]]}}\nStrauss's output of works for solo instrument or instruments with orchestra was fairly extensive. The most famous include two concertos for horn, which are still part of the standard repertoire of most horn soloists\u2014[[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883) and [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1942); the [[Romanze for Cello and orchestra (Strauss)|Romanze for cello and orchestra]] (1883); a [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882); the [[Burleske|''Burleske'' for piano and orchestra]] (1885, revised 1889); the tone poem ''Don Quixote'' for cello, viola and orchestra (1897); the well-known late Oboe Concerto in D major (1945); and the Duett-Concertino for clarinet and bassoon with string orchestra, which was one of his last works (1948).\n\n===Opera===\n{{See also|List of operas by Richard Strauss}}\nAround the end of the 19th century, Strauss turned his attention to opera. His first two attempts in the genre, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'' (1894) and ''[[Feuersnot]]'' (1901), were controversial works: ''Guntram'' was the first significant critical failure of Strauss's career, and ''Feuersnot'' was considered obscene by some critics.<ref>Tim Ashley, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/reviews/story/0,3604,404766,00.html Feuersnot]\". ''[[The Guardian]]''. London. 30 November 2000. Retrieved 27 October 2007.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schmutzer-Richard Strauss.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Richard Strauss engraved by Ferdinand Schmutzer (1922)]]\nIn 1905, Strauss produced ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the [[Salome (play)|play]] by [[Oscar Wilde]], which produced a passionate reaction from audiences. The premiere was a major success, with the artists taking more than 38 curtain calls.<ref>Derrick Puffett ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ABrNsZOXIr4C ''Richard Strauss: \"Salome\"''] (1989), p. 4</ref> Many later performances of the opera were also successful, not only with the general public but also with Strauss's peers: [[Maurice Ravel]] said that ''Salome'' was \"stupendous\",<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 145</ref> and [[Gustav Mahler]] described it as \"a live volcano, a subterranean fire\".<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 149</ref> Strauss reputedly financed his house in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] completely from the revenues generated by the opera. As with the later ''Elektra'', ''Salome'' features an extremely taxing lead soprano role. Strauss often remarked that he preferred writing for the female voice, which is apparent in these two sister operas\u2014the male parts are almost entirely smaller roles, included only to supplement the soprano's performance.\n\nStrauss's next opera was ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), which took his use of dissonance even further, in particular with the [[Elektra chord]]. ''Elektra'' was also the first opera in which Strauss collaborated with the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] as his librettist. The two subsequently worked together on numerous occasions. For his later works with Hofmannsthal, Strauss moderated his harmonic language: he used a more lush, melodic late-Romantic style based on Wagnerian chromatic harmonies that he had used in his tone poems, with much less dissonance, and exhibiting immense virtuosity in orchestral writing and tone color. This resulted in operas such as ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911) having great public success. Strauss continued to produce operas at regular intervals until 1942. With Hofmannsthal he created ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). For ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' (1924) Strauss provided his own libretto. ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935), was composed with [[Stefan Zweig]] as librettist; ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1935\u201336) and ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1937) both had a libretto by [[Joseph Gregor]] and Stefan Zweig; and ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) was with Joseph Gregor. Strauss's final opera, ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942), had a libretto by [[Clemens Krauss]], although the genesis for it came from Stefan Zweig and Joseph Gregor.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by [[Operabase]], in number of operas performed worldwide over the five seasons from 2008/09 to 2012/13, Strauss was the second-most performed 20th-century opera composer, ahead of [[Benjamin Britten]] and behind only [[Giacomo Puccini]].<ref name=operabase200820013>[http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en& The five seasons 2008/9 to 2012/13: Composers].

He often composed them with the voice of his wife in mind. His lieder were written for voice and piano, and he orchestrated several of them after the fact. In 1894\u20131895, around the age of 30, he published several well-known songs including \"[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]\", \"[[C\u00e4cilie (Strauss)|C\u00e4cilie]]\", \"[[Morgen!]]\", \"[[Heimliche Aufforderung]]\", and \"[[Traum durch die D\u00e4mmerung]]\". In 1918, after a long hiatus devoted to opera, he wrote [[Sechs Lieder, Op. 68 (Strauss)|''Sechs Lieder'', Op. 68]], also called ''Brentano Lieder''. He completed his works in the genre in 1948 with ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' for soprano and orchestra. He reportedly composed these with [[Kirsten Flagstad]] in mind and she gave the first performance, which was recorded. Strauss's songs have always been popular with audiences and performers, and are generally considered by musicologists\u2014along with many of his other compositions\u2014to be masterpieces.\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Richard Strauss young portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Strauss]]\nUntil the 1980s, Strauss was regarded by some post-modern musicologists as a conservative, backward-looking composer, but re-examination of and new research on the composer has re-evaluated his place as that of a modernist,<ref>Shirley, Hugo (2012). \"In Search of Strauss\" in ''Journal of the Royal Musical Association'', vol. 137, issue 1, pp. 187\u2013192</ref> albeit one who still utilized and sometimes revered tonality and lush orchestration.<ref>Hepokoski, James, \"The Second Cycle of Tone Poems\" in Youmans (ed.), p. 78</ref> Strauss is noted for his pioneering subtleties of orchestration, combined with an advanced harmonic style; when he first played Strauss at a university production of ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', the conductor [[Mark Elder]] \"was flabbergasted.

[[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] heard ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' in 1902, and later said that the work \"contained the seeds for a new life\"; a Straussian influence is clearly present in his works of that period, including his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|First String Quartet]], ''[[Kossuth (Bart\u00f3k)|Kossuth]]'', and ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]''.<ref>Elliott Antokoletz and Paolo Susanni, ''B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k: A Research and Information Guide'', 2nd Revised edition (1997), Routledge, London, {{ISBN|978-0815320883}}, Introduction p. xxi.</ref> [[Karol Szymanowski]] was also greatly influenced by Strauss, reflected in such pieces as his ''Concert Overture'' and his first and [[Symphony No. 2 (Szymanowski)|second]] symphonies,<ref>Paul Caldrin, \"Orchestra music and orchestration\", pp. 166\u2013169 in  Paul Cadrin and Stephen Downes (editors), ''The Szymanowski Companion'', Routledge, London, Revised edition (2015). {{ISBN|978-0754661511}}</ref> and his opera ''[[Hagith (opera)|Hagith]]'' which was modeled after ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''.  English composers were also influenced by Strauss, from [[Edward Elgar]] in his concert overture ''[[In the South (Alassio)]]'' and other works<ref>Ian Parrott, ''Elgar (Master Musician)'', Everyman Ltd, London, First Edition (1971), p. 60.</ref> to [[Benjamin Britten]] in his opera writing.

The style of his musical depictions of character (Don Juan, Till Eulenspiegel, the Hero) and emotions found their way into the lexicon of film music. Film music historian Timothy Schuerer wrote, \"The elements of post (late) romantic music that had greatest impact on scoring are its lush sound, expanded harmonic language, chromaticism, use of program music and use of [[Leitmotifs]]. Hollywood composers found the post-romantic idiom compatible with their efforts in scoring film\".<ref>Timothy Scheurer, ''Music and Mythmaking in Film'', Mcfarland, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0786431908}}. p. 41.</ref> [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Korngold]] came from the same musical world as Strauss and were quite naturally drawn to write in his style. As film historian Roy Prendergast wrote, \"When confronted with the kind of dramatic problem films presented to them, Steiner, Korngold and [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Newman]] ... looked to Wagner, [[Puccini]], Verdi and Strauss for the answers to dramatic film scoring.\"<ref>Roy Prendergast, ''Film Music: A neglected Art'', W.W Norton & Company, 1992, {{ISBN|978 0393308747}}.</ref> Later, the opening to ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' became one of the best-known pieces of film music when [[Stanley Kubrick]] used it in his 1968 movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. The film music of [[John Williams]] has continued the Strauss influence, in scores for mainstream hits such as ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/richard-strausss-influence-film-music/|title=WQXR \u2013 New York's Classical Music Radio Station|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nStrauss has always been popular with audiences in the concert hall and continues to be so.

The ranking is Debussy, Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Strauss, Prokofiev.</ref>\n\n==Strauss as a conductor==\n[[File:DBPB 1954 124 Richard Strauss.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Stamp issued in 1954]]\nStrauss, as conductor, made a large number of recordings, both of his own music as well as music by German and Austrian composers. His 1929 performances of ''Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks'' and ''Don Juan'' with the [[Berlin State Opera Orchestra]] have long been considered the best of his early electrical recordings. In the first complete performance of his ''An Alpine Symphony'', made in 1941 and later released by [[EMI]], Strauss used the full complement of percussion instruments required in this work.\n\n[[Koch records|Koch Legacy]] has also released Strauss's recordings of overtures by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Peter Cornelius]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. The preference for German and Austrian composers in Germany in the 1920s through the 1940s was typical of the German nationalism that existed after [[World War I]]. Strauss clearly capitalized on national pride for the great German-speaking composers.\n\nThere were many other recordings, including some taken from radio broadcasts and concerts during the 1930s and early 1940s. The sheer volume of recorded performances would undoubtedly yield some definitive performances from a very capable and rather forward-looking conductor.\n\nIn 1944, Strauss celebrated his 80th birthday and conducted the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in recordings of his own major orchestral works, as well as his seldom-heard ''[[Schlagobers]]'' (''Whipped Cream'') ballet music. Some find more feeling in these performances than in Strauss's earlier recordings, which were recorded on the [[Magnetophon]] tape recording equipment. [[Vanguard Records]] later issued the recordings on LPs. Some of these recordings have been reissued on CD by Preiser.  The last recording made by Strauss was on 19 October 1947 live at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where he conducted the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] in his Burleske for piano and orchestra (Alfred Blumen piano), Don Juan and Sinfonia Domestica.<ref>Richard Strauss: The last concerts, CD issued by Testament SBT2 1441, 2009</ref>\n\nStrauss also made live-recording [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld system and in 1906 ten recordings for the [[reproducing piano]] [[Welte-Mignon]] all of which survive today. Strauss was also the composer of the music on the first CD to be commercially released: [[Deutsche Grammophon]]'s 1983 release of their 1980 recording of [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the ''Alpine Symphony''.\n\n===Modern critical reception of selected recordings conducted by Strauss===\n[[File:The orchestra and its instruments (1917) (14780185164).jpg|thumb|300px|Strauss conducting (circa 1900)]]\n[[Pierre Boulez]] has said that Strauss the conductor was \"a complete master of his trade\".{{sfn|Boulez|2003|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}} Music critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]] writes that, while Strauss was a very fine conductor, he often put scant effort into his recordings.<ref>Schonberg, p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Schonberg focused primarily on Strauss's recordings of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 40]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], as well as noting that Strauss played a breakneck version of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] in about 45 minutes. Concerning Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Schonberg wrote, \"There is almost never a ''ritard'' or a change in expression or nuance. The slow movement is almost as fast as the following ''vivace''; and the last movement, with a big cut in it, is finished in 4 minutes, 25 seconds. (It should run between 7 and 8 minutes.)\" <ref>Schonberg (1967), p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> He also complained that the Mozart symphony had \"no force, no charm, no inflection, with a metronomic rigidity.\"\n\n[[Peter Gutmann (journalist)|Peter Gutmann]]'s 1994 review for ''ClassicalNotes.com'' says the performances of the Beethoven 5th and 7th symphonies, as well as Mozart's last three symphonies, are actually quite good, even if they are sometimes unconventional. Gutmann wrote:\n<blockquote>It is true, as the critics suggest, that the readings forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead is a solid sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. It is also true that Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with our modern outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news sound bites than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.<ref>Peter Gutmann, [http://www.classicalnotes.net/reviews/strauss.html  \"Richard Strauss Conducts\"] on classicalnotes.net</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, Richard Strauss (40).jpg|thumb|upright|Star on the Walk of Fame, Vienna]]\nHis honors included:<ref>Listed in Wilhelm, Kurt (1989), pp. 298\u201399.

Considered a leading composer of the late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and early [[20th-century classical music|modern]] eras, he has been described as a successor of [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Franz Liszt]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> Along with [[Gustav Mahler]], he represents the late flowering of [[German Romanticism]] after Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of [[orchestration]] are combined with an advanced [[harmony|harmonic]] style.\n\nStrauss's compositional output began in 1870 when he was just six years old and lasted until his death nearly eighty years later. While his output of works encompasses nearly every type of classical compositional form, Strauss achieved his greatest success with [[tone poem]]s and [[opera]]s. His first tone poem to achieve wide acclaim was ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1889), and this was followed by other lauded works of this kind, including ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1890), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1905), and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1915). His first opera to achieve international fame was ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1905) which used a libretto by [[Hedwig Lachmann]] that was a German translation of the French play ''[[Salome (play)|Salom\u00e9]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]. This was followed by several critically acclaimed operas with librettist [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]: ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). His last operas, ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1938), ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1938), ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942) used libretti written by [[Joseph Gregor]], the Viennese theatre historian. Other well-known works by Strauss include two symphonies, [[lied]]er (especially his ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' from 1948),  the [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882), the [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883), [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1943),  his [[Oboe Concerto (Strauss)|Oboe Concerto]] and other instrumental works such as ''[[Metamorphosen]]'' (1945).\n\nStrauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. He was chiefly admired for his interpretations of the works of Liszt, Mozart, and Wagner in addition to his own works. A conducting disciple of [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], Strauss began his conducting career as B\u00fclow's assistant with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] in 1883. After B\u00fclow resigned in 1885, Strauss served as that orchestra's primary conductor for five months before being appointed to the conducting staff of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] where he worked as third conductor from 1886\u20131889. He then served as principal conductor of the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar]] from 1889\u20131894. In 1894 he made his conducting debut at the [[Bayreuth Festival]], conducting Wagner's ''[[Tannh\u00e4user]]'' with his wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], singing Elisabeth. He then returned to the Bavarian State Opera, this time as principal conductor, from 1894\u20131898, after which he was principal conductor of the [[Berlin State Opera]] from 1898\u20131913. From 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]], and in 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]]. In addition to these posts, Strauss was a frequent guest conductor in opera houses and with orchestras internationally.\n\nIn 1933 Strauss was appointed to two important positions in the musical life of [[Nazi Germany]]: head of the [[Reichsmusikkammer]] and principal conductor of the Bayreuth Festival. The latter role he accepted after conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] had resigned from the position in protest of the Nazi party. These positions have led some to criticize Strauss for his seeming collaboration with the Nazis. However, Strauss's daughter-in-law, Alice Grab Strauss [n\u00e9e von Hermannsw\u00f6rth], was Jewish and much of his apparent acquiescence to the Nazi Party was done in order to save her life, and the lives of her children (his grandchildren). He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post in order to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist, Stefan Zweig, for his opera ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935) which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera ''Friedenstag'', which premiered just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrong doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.\n\n==Early life and career (1864\u20131886)==\n[[File:Richard Strauss 20OCT1886.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Strauss aged 22]]\nStrauss was born on 11 June 1864 in [[Munich]], the son of Josephine (n\u00e9e Pschorr) and [[Franz Strauss]], who was the principal [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] player at the Court Opera in Munich and a professor at the [[K\u00f6nigliche Musikschule]].<ref name=\"g1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Richard_Strauss.aspx|title=Richard Strauss facts, information, pictures|website=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> His mother was the daughter of Georg Pschorr, a financially prosperous [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery|brewer from Munich]].<ref name=\"g1\">{{harvnb|Gilliam|Youmans|2001}}</ref>\n\nStrauss began his musical studies at the age of four, studying piano with August Tombo who was the harpist in the Munich Court Orchestra.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He soon after began attending the rehearsals of the orchestra, and began getting lessons in music theory and orchestration from the ensemble's assistant conductor. He wrote his first composition at the age of six, and continued to write music almost until his death.  In 1872, he started receiving violin instruction from [[Benno Walter]], the director of the Munich Court Orchestra and his father's cousin, and at 11 began five years of compositional study with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1882 he graduated from the Ludwigsgymnasium and afterwards attended only one year at the [[University of Munich]] in 1882\u20131883.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn addition to his formal teachers, Strauss was profoundly influenced musically by his father who made instrumental music-making central to the Strauss home. The Strauss family was frequently joined in their home for music making, meals, and other activities by the orphaned composer and music theorist [[Ludwig Thuille]] who was viewed as an adopted member of the family.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Strauss's father taught his son the music of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Schubert.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further assisted his son with his musical composition during the 1870s and into the early 1880s, providing advice, comments, and criticisms.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His father further provided support by showcasing his sons compositions in performance with the \u2018Wilde Gung'l\u2019, an amateur orchestra he conducted from 1875\u20131896. Many of his early symphonic compositions were written for this ensemble.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His compositions at this time were indebted to the style of [[Robert Schumann]] or [[Felix Mendelssohn]], true to his father's teachings. His father undoubtedly had a crucial influence on his son's developing taste, not least in Strauss's abiding love for the horn. His [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]], is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1874, Strauss heard his first [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] operas, ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1878 he attended performances of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' and ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'' in Munich, and in 1879 he attended performances of the entire ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring Cycle]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'', and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The influence of Wagner's music on Strauss's style was to be profound, but at first his musically conservative father forbade him to study it. Indeed, in the Strauss household, the music of Richard Wagner was viewed with deep suspicion, and it was not until the age of 16 that Strauss was able to obtain a score of ''Tristan und Isolde''.<ref name=\"B\"/> In 1882 he went to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to hear his father perform in the world premiere of Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]''; after which surviving letters to his father and to Thuille detail his seemingly negative impression of Wagner and his music.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In later life, Strauss said that he deeply regretted the conservative hostility to Wagner's progressive works.<ref name=\"B\">{{harvnb|Boyden|1999|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1882, in Vienna, Strauss gave the first performance of his [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]], playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post with the [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]] as assistant conductor to [[Hans von B\u00fclow]], who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's ''Serenade (Op. 7)'' for wind instruments, composed when he was only 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing B\u00fclow in rehearsal. B\u00fclow was very fond of the young man, and Strauss considered him as his greatest conducting mentor, often crediting him as teaching him \"the art of interpretation\".<ref name=\"g1\"/> Notably, under B\u00fclow's baton he made his first major appearance as a concert pianist, performing Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 24]], for which he composed his own [[cadenza]]s.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1885, B\u00fclow unexpectedly resigned from his post, and Strauss was left to lead the Meiningen Court Orchestra as interim principal conductor for the remainder of the artistic season through April 1886.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He notably helped prepare the orchestra for the world premiere performance of [[Johannes Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]], which Brahms himself conducted. He also conducted his [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] for Brahms, who advised Strauss: \"Your symphony contains too much playing about with themes. This piling up of many themes based on a triad, which differ from one another only in rhythm, has no value.\"<ref name=\"g1\"/> Brahms' music, like Wagner's, also left a tremendous impression upon Strauss, and he often referred to this time of his life as his \u2018Brahmsschw\u00e4rmerei\u2019 (\u2018Brahms adoration\u2019) during which several his compositions clearly show Brahms' influence, including ''Wandrers Sturmlied'' (1884) and ''Burleske'' (1885\u201386).\"<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\n==Strauss finds success in conducting and tone poems (1885\u20131898)==\n[[File:Pauline Strauss de Ahna.jpg|thumb|Pauline de Ahna Strauss, c. 1900]]\nIn 1885 Strauss met the composer [[Alexander Ritter]] who was a violinist in the Meiningen orchestra and the husband of one of [[Richard Wagner]]'s nieces. An avid champion of the ideals of Wagner and [[Franz Liszt]], Ritter had a tremendous impact on the trajectory of Strauss' work as a composer from 1885 onward. Ritter convinced Strauss to abandon his more conservative style of composing and embrace the \"music of the future\" by modeling his compositional style off of Wagner and Liszt.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He further influenced Strauss by engaging him in studies and conversations on the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Wagner, and Friedrich von Hausegger. All of this together gave a new aesthetic anchor to Strauss which first became evident in his embrace of the [[tone poem]] genre.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter leaving his post in Meiningen in 1886, Strauss spent several weeks traveling throughout Italy before assuming a new post as third conductor at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] (then known as the Munich Hofoper). While traveling he wrote down descriptions of the various sites he was seeing along with tonal impressions that went with those descriptions. These he communicated in a letter to his mother, and they ultimately were used as the beginning of his first [[tone poem]], ''[[Aus Italien]]'' (1886).<ref name=\"g1\" /> Shortly after Strauss assumed his opera conducting duties in Munich, Ritter himself moved to the city in September 1886. For the next three years the two men would meet regularly, often joined by Thuille and [[Anton Seidl]], in order to discuss music, particularly Wagner and Liszt, and discuss poetry, literature, and philosophy.<ref name=\"g1\" />\n\nStrauss's tenure at the Bavarian State Opera was not a happy one. With the death of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] in June 1886, the opera house was not as well financially supported by his successor [[Otto of Bavaria]] which meant that much of the more ambitious and expensive repertoire that he wanted to stage, such as Wagner's operas, were unfeasible. The opera assignments he was given, works by Boieldieu, Auber and Donizetti, bored him, and to make matters worse Hermann Levi, the senior conductor at the house, was often ill and Strauss was required to step in at the last minute to conduct performance for operas which he had never rehearsed. This caused problems for him, the singers, and the orchestra. During this time, Strauss did find much more enjoyable conducting work outside Munich in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig. In the latter city he met and befriended the composer [[Gustav Mahler]] in the autumn of 1887. Also happily, Strauss met his future wife, soprano [[Pauline de Ahna]], in 1887. De Ahna was then a voice student at the [[Munich Musikschule]], but soon switched to private lessons with Strauss who became her principal teacher.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn May 1889 Strauss left his post with the Bavarian State Opera after being appointed [[Kapellmeister]] to [[Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in Weimar, beginning in the Autumn of 1889. During the Summer of 1889 he served as the assistant conductor of the [[Bayreuth Festival]] during which time he befriended [[Cosima Wagner]] who became a longterm close friend.<ref name=\"g1\"/> Pauline De Ahna went with Strauss to Weimar and he later married her on 10 September 1894. She was famous for being irascible, garrulous, eccentric and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was a great source of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of 1948, he preferred the [[soprano|soprano voice]] to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles. In Weimar she created the role of Freihild in Strauss's first opera, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'', in 1894. The opera was received with mixed reviews in Weimar, but its later production in Munich was met with scorn and was Strauss's first major failure.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n[[File:Strauss Haus Garmisch.JPG|thumb|Strauss villa at [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]. Built 1906. Architect: Emanuel Seidl.]]\nIn spite of the failure of his first opera, Strauss's tenure in Weimar brought about several important successes for his career. His tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' premiered in Weimar on 11 November 1889 to tremendous critical response, and the work quickly brought him international fame and success. This was followed by another lauded achievement, the premiere of his tone poem ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' in 1890. Both of these works, along with the earlier ''Burleske'', became internationally known and established him as a leading modernist composer.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also had much success as a conductor in Weimar, particularly with the symphonic poems of Liszt and an uncut production of ''Tristan und Isolde'' in 1892.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn the Summer of 1894 Strauss made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's ''Tannh\u00e4user'' with Pauline singing Elisabeth. Just prior to their marriage the following September, Strauss left his post in Weimar when he was appointed Kapellmeister, or first conductor, of the Bavarian State Opera where he became responsible for the operas of Wagner. While working in Munich for the next four years he had his largest creative period period of tone poem composition, producing ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), and ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898).<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in 1894\u20131895.

By this time in his career, he was in constant demand as a guest conductor internationally and enjoyed celebrity status as a conductor; particularly in the works of Wagner, Mozart, and Liszt in addition to his own compositions.<ref name=\"g1\"/> He became president of the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein]] in 1901, and that same year became leader of the [[Berliner Tonk\u00fcnstlerverein]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> He also served as editor of the book series ''Die Musik''. He used all of these posts to champion contemporary German composers like Mahler. His own compositions were becoming increasingly popular, and the first major orchestra to perform an entire concert of only his music was the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1901.<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1903 Strauss Festivals dedicated to his music were established in London and Heidelberg. At the latter festival his cantata ''[[Taillefer (Strauss)|Taillefer]]'' was given its world premiere.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1904 Strauss embarked on his first North American tour, with stops in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and Pittsburgh. At [[Carnegie Hall]] he conducted the world premiere of his ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' on March 21, 1904 with the [[Wetzler Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Wetzler\">{{cite news|title=Herman Wetzler, Composer, 72, Dies|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 30, 1943|page=26}}</ref> He also conducted several other works in collaboration with composer [[Hermann Hans Wetzler]] and his orchestra that year at Carnegie Hall, and also performed a concert of leider with his wife.<ref name=\"Wetzler\"/> During this trip he was working intensively on composing his third opera, ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', based on [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1891 play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''. The work, which premiered in Dresden in 1905, became Strauss's greatest triumph in his career up to that point, and opera houses all over the world quickly began programing the opera.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nAfter ''Salome'', Strauss had a string of critically successful operas which he created with the librettist and poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. These operas included ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933).<ref name=\"g1\"/> While all of these works remain part of the opera repertoire, his opera ''Der Rosenkavalier'' is generally considered his finest achievement.<ref name=\"g1\"/> During this time he continued to work internationally as a celebrity conductor, and from 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the [[Vienna State Opera]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> In 1920 he co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]] with Reinhardt and the set designer Alfred Rolle. In 1924 Strauss's opera ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' premiered at the [[Semperoper|Dresden Semperoper]] with both the music and the libretto by Strauss. For this opera, Strauss wanted to move away from post-Wagnerian metaphysics which had been the philosophical framework of Hofmannsthal's libretti, and instead embrace a modern domestic comedy to Hofmannsthal's chagrin.<ref name=\"g1\"/> The work proved to be a success.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn 1924 Strauss's son Franz married Alice von Grab-Hermannsw\u00f6rth, daughter of a Jewish industrialist, in a Roman Catholic ceremony.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Franz and Alice had two sons, Richard and Christian.<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Strauss in Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945)==\n\n===''Reichsmusikkammer''===\nIn March 1933, when Strauss was 68, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rose to power]]. Strauss never joined the Nazi party, and studiously avoided [[Nazi salute|Nazi forms of greeting]]. For reasons of expediency, however, he was initially drawn into cooperating with the early Nazi regime in the hope that Hitler\u2014an ardent Wagnerian and music lover who had admired Strauss' work since viewing ''Salome'' in 1907\u2014would promote German art and culture. Strauss's need to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law and Jewish grandchildren also motivated his behavior,<ref name=\"g1\" /> in addition to his determination to preserve and conduct the music of banned composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Claude Debussy]].\n\nIn 1933, Strauss wrote in his private notebook:\n<blockquote>I consider the [[Julius Streicher|Streicher]]-Goebbels Jew-baiting as a disgrace to German honour, as evidence of incompetence\u2014the basest weapon of untalented, lazy mediocrity against a higher intelligence and greater talent.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 274.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, far from being an admirer of Strauss's work, [[Joseph Goebbels]] maintained expedient cordiality with Strauss only for a period. Goebbels wrote in his diary:\n<blockquote>Unfortunately we still need him, but one day we shall have our own music and then we shall have no further need of this decadent neurotic.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 293</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Strauss Time 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Strauss was on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' in 1927 and (here) 1938]]\nNevertheless, because of Strauss's international eminence, in November 1933 he was appointed to the post of president of the newly founded ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', the Reich Music Chamber. Strauss, who had lived through numerous political regimes and had no interest in politics, decided to accept the position but to remain apolitical, a decision which would eventually become untenable. He wrote to his family, \"I made music under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]], and under [[Friedrich Ebert|Ebert]]. I'll survive under this one as well.\"<ref name=em/> In 1935 he wrote in his journal:\n<blockquote>In November 1933, the minister Goebbels nominated me president of the ''Reichsmusikkammer'' without obtaining my prior agreement. I was not consulted. I accepted this honorary office because I hoped that I would be able to do some good and prevent worse misfortunes, if from now onwards German musical life were going to be, as it was said, \"reorganized\" by amateurs and ignorant place-seekers.<ref name=em>Quoted on [http://exploringmusic.wfmt.com/listen-to-the-show/151/strauss-richard ''[[Exploring Music]]'' (2004) on the WFMT Radio Network; Episode 5 of 5 of \"Richard Strauss\"], first aired 9 January 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nStrauss privately scorned Goebbels and called him \"a pipsqueak\".<ref>Reuth 1993, p. 402</ref> However, in 1933 he dedicated an orchestral song, \"''Das B\u00e4chlein''\" (\"The Little Brook\"), to Goebbels, in order to gain his cooperation in extending German music copyright laws from 30 years to 50 years.<ref>Kennedy 1999, pp. 281\u2013282</ref> Also in 1933, he replaced [[Arturo Toscanini]] as director of the Bayreuth Festival after Toscanini had resigned in protest to the Nazi regime.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nStrauss attempted to ignore Nazi bans on performances of works by Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. He also continued to work on a comic opera, ''Die schweigsame Frau'', with his Jewish friend and librettist Stefan Zweig. When the opera was premiered in Dresden in 1935, Strauss insisted that Zweig's name appear on the theatrical billing, much to the ire of the Nazi regime. Hitler and Goebbels avoided attending the opera, and it was halted after three performances and subsequently banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 285</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1935, Strauss wrote a letter to Stefan Zweig, in which he stated:\n<blockquote>Do you believe I am ever, in any of my actions, guided by the thought that I am 'German'? Do you suppose Mozart was consciously 'Aryan' when he composed? I recognise only two types of people: those who have talent and those who have none.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 297</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis letter to Zweig was intercepted by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to Hitler. Strauss was subsequently [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from his post as ''Reichsmusikkammer'' president in 1935. The [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Summer Olympics]] nevertheless used Strauss's ''[[Olympische Hymne]]'', which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, \"To Strauss the composer I take off my hat; to Strauss the man I put it back on again\", when Strauss had accepted the presidency of the ''Reichsmusikkammer''.<ref>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (1978), Review of \"A Confidential Matter: The Letters of Richard Strauss and Stefan Zweig, 1931\u20131935\" in ''[[Music & Letters]]'', Vol.&nbsp;59, No.&nbsp;4, October 1978. pp.&nbsp;472\u2013475.</ref> Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 316</ref>\n\n===Operas with Joseph Gregor and work to save his Jewish daughter-in-law ===\n[[File:Strauss 1938.jpg|thumb|240px|Strauss at Garmisch in 1938]]\nFrustrated that he could no longer work with Zweig as his librettist, Strauss turned to [[Joseph Gregor]], a Viennese theatre historian, at Gregor's request. The first opera they worked on together was ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'', but it ultimately became the second of their operas to be premiered. Their first work to be staged was in 1938, when the entire nation was preparing for war, they presented ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (''Peace Day''), a one-act opera set in a besieged fortress during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The work is essentially a hymn to peace and a thinly veiled criticism of the Third Reich. With its contrasts between freedom and enslavement, war and peace, light and dark, this work has a close affinity with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]''. Productions of the opera ceased shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939. The two men collaborated on two more operas which proved to be Strauss's last: ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942).<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nWhen his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice was placed under house arrest in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in 1938, Strauss used his connections in Berlin, including opera-house General Intendant [[Heinz Tietjen]], to secure her safety. He drove to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in order to argue, albeit unsuccessfully, for the release of Alice's grandmother, Paula Neumann. In the end, Neumann and 25 other relatives were murdered in the camps.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/06/arts/music-richard-strauss-and-hitler-s-reich-jupiter-in-hell.html \"Music; Richard Strauss and Hitler's Reich: Jupiter in Hell\"] by [[Michael Hans Kater]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 January 2002</ref> While Alice's mother, Marie von Grab, was safe in Lucerne, Switzerland, Strauss also wrote several letters to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] pleading for the release of her children who were also held in camps; his letters were ignored.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 339</ref>\n\nIn 1942, Strauss moved with his family back to Vienna, where Alice and her children could be protected by [[Baldur von Schirach]], the [[Gauleiter]] of Vienna. However, Strauss was unable to protect his Jewish relatives completely; in early 1944, while Strauss was away, Alice and his son Franz were abducted by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two nights. Strauss's personal intervention at this point saved them, and he was able to take them back to Garmisch, where the two remained under house arrest until the end of the war.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\n===''Metamorphosen'' and apprehension by USA troops===\nStrauss completed the composition of ''[[Metamorphosen]]'', a work for 23 solo strings, in 1945. The title and inspiration for the work comes from a profoundly self-examining poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], which Strauss had considered setting as a choral work.<ref name=Ross338>Ross (2009), p. 338</ref> Generally regarded as one of the masterpieces of the string repertoire, ''Metamorphosen'' contains Strauss's most sustained outpouring of tragic emotion. Conceived and written during the blackest days of [[World War II]], the piece expresses Strauss's mourning of, among other things, the destruction of German culture\u2014including the bombing of every great opera house in the nation. At the end of the war, Strauss wrote in his private diary:\n<blockquote>The most terrible period of human history is at an end, the twelve year reign of bestiality, ignorance and anti-culture under the greatest criminals, during which Germany's 2000 years of cultural evolution met its doom.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 361</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn April 1945, Strauss was apprehended by American soldiers at his Garmisch estate. As he descended the staircase he announced to Lieutenant Milton Weiss of the U.S. Army, \"I am Richard Strauss, the composer of ''Rosenkavalier'' and ''Salome''.\" Lt. Weiss, who was also a musician, nodded in recognition. An \"Off Limits\" sign was subsequently placed on the lawn to protect Strauss.<ref>Ross 2009, p. 373</ref> The American oboist [[John de Lancie (oboist)|John de Lancie]], who knew Strauss's orchestral writing for oboe thoroughly, was in the army unit, and asked Strauss to compose an oboe concerto.

Now elderly and with very few resources remaining, Strauss and his wife left Germany for Switzerland in October 1945 where they settled in a hotel just outside Z\u00fcrich. There they met the Swiss music critic [[Willi Schuh (musicologist)|Willy Schuh]], who became Strauss's biographer. Strapped for cash, in 1947 Strauss embarked on his last international tour, a three-week trip to London, in which he conducted several of his tone poems and excerpts of his operas, and was present during a complete staging of ''Elektra'' by the [[BBC]]. The trip was a critical success and provided him and his wife with some much needed money.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nFrom May\u2013September 1948, just before his death, Strauss composed the ''Four Last Songs'' which deal with the subject of dying. The last one, \"Im Abendrot\" (At Sunset), ends with the line \"Is this perhaps death?\" The question is not answered in words, but instead Strauss quotes the \"transfiguration theme\" from his earlier tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''\u2014meant to symbolize the transfiguration and fulfilment of the soul after death. In June 1948, he was cleared of any wrong-doing by a [[denazification]] tribunal in Munich.<ref name=\"g1\"/> That same month he orchestrated ''[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]'', a song that he had originally composed in 1894.<ref name=\"g1\"/>\n\nIn December 1948 Strauss was hospitalized for several weeks after undergoing bladder surgery.<ref name=\"g1\"/> His health rapidly deteriorated after that, and he conducted his last performance, the end of Act 2 of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' at the [[Prinzregententheater]] in Munich, during celebrations of his 85th birthday on June 10, 1949. On August 15 he suffered from a [[heart attack]] and he died of [[kidney failure]] quietly, in his sleep, shortly after 2 p.m. on 8 September 1949, in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[West Germany]].<ref name=\"g1\"/> From his death-bed, typical for his enduring sense of humour, he commented to his daughter-in-law  Alice, \"dying is just as I composed it in Tod und Verkl\u00e4rung.\" <ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 113</ref>[[Georg Solti]], who had arranged Strauss's 85th birthday celebration, also directed an orchestra during Strauss's burial.<ref>''Portrait of Sir Georg Solti.'', documentary (1984), directed by Valerie Pitts</ref> The conductor later described how, during the singing of the famous trio from ''Rosenkavalier'', \"each singer broke down in tears and dropped out of the ensemble, but they recovered themselves and we all ended together.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 394</ref> Strauss's wife, Pauline de Ahna, died eight months later, on 13 May 1950, at the age of 88.<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 395</ref>\n\nStrauss's late works, modelled on \"the divine [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] at the end of a life full of thankfulness,\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 365</ref> are widely considered by music critics as the greatest works by any octogenarian composer.\nStrauss himself declared in 1947 with characteristic self-deprecation: \"I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-class second-rate composer.\" The Canadian pianist [[Glenn Gould]] described Strauss in 1962 as \"the greatest musical figure who has lived in this century.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 3</ref>\n\n==Strauss as composer==\n[[File:Componist Richard Strauss-29152.ogv|{{largethumb}}|thumbtime=0:08|Strauss in Amsterdam (short film 1924)]]\n===Solo and chamber works and large ensembles===\nSome of Strauss's first compositions were solo instrumental and chamber works. These pieces include early compositions for piano solo in a conservative harmonic style, many of which are lost: two piano trios (1877 and 1878), a string quartet (1881), a [[Sonata for piano in B minor, Op. 5|piano sonata]] (1882), a [[Cello Sonata (Strauss)|cello sonata]] (1883), a piano quartet (1885), a [[Violin Sonata (Strauss)|violin sonata]] (1888), as well as a serenade (1882) and a longer suite (1884), both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns and contrabassoon.\n\nAfter 1890, Strauss composed very infrequently for chamber groups, his energies being almost completely absorbed with large-scale orchestral works and operas. Four of his chamber pieces are actually arrangements of portions of his operas, including the ''Daphne-Etude'' for solo violin and the String Sextet, which is the overture to his final opera ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]''. His last independent chamber work, an Allegretto in E major for violin and piano, dates from 1948.\n\nHe also composed two large-scale works for wind ensemble during this period: Sonatina No. 1 \"From an Invalid's Workshop\" (1943) and Sonatina No. 2 \"Happy Workshop\" (1946)\u2014both scored for double wind quintet plus two additional horns, a third clarinet in C, bassett horn, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon.\n\n===Tone poems and other orchestral works===\n{{Main|Tone poems (Strauss)}}\nStrauss wrote two early symphonies: [[Symphony No. 1 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 1]] (1880) and [[Symphony No. 2 (Strauss)|Symphony No. 2]] (1884). However, Strauss's style began to truly develop and change when, in 1885, he met [[Alexander Ritter]], a noted composer and violinist, and the husband of one of Richard Wagner's nieces. It was Ritter who persuaded Strauss to abandon the conservative style of his youth and begin writing [[tone poem]]s. He also introduced Strauss to the essays of Wagner and the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Strauss went on to conduct one of Ritter's operas, and at Strauss's request Ritter later wrote a poem describing the events depicted in Strauss's tone poem ''Death and Transfiguration''.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Also Sprach Zarathustra.ogg|title=Also Sprach Zarathustra|description=\"Sunrise fanfare\"}}\nThe new influences from Ritter resulted in what is widely regarded<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 69</ref> as Strauss's first piece to show his mature personality, the tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' (1888), which displays a new kind of virtuosity in its bravura orchestral manner. Strauss went on to write a series of increasingly ambitious tone poems: ''[[Death and Transfiguration]]'' (1889), ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' (1895), ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1896), ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' (1897), ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' (1898), ''[[Symphonia Domestica]]'' (1903) and ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]'' (1911\u20131915). One commentator has observed of these works that \"no orchestra could exist without his tone poems, written to celebrate the glories of the post-Wagnerian symphony orchestra.\"<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 395</ref>\n\nJames Hepokoski notes a shift in Strauss's technique in the tone poems, occurring between 1892 and 1893. It was after this point that Strauss rejected the philosophy of Schopenhauer and began more forcefully critiquing the institution of the symphony and the symphonic poem, thereby differentiating the second cycle of tone poems from the first.\n\n===Solo instrument with orchestra===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Richard Strauss - Neal O'Doan - Burleske.ogg|title=''Burleske''|description=''[[Burleske]]'' (1885\u201386), performed by Neal O'Doan with the [[Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra]]}}\nStrauss's output of works for solo instrument or instruments with orchestra was fairly extensive. The most famous include two concertos for horn, which are still part of the standard repertoire of most horn soloists\u2014[[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 1]] (1883) and [[Horn Concerto No. 2 (Strauss)|Horn Concerto No. 2]] (1942); the [[Romanze for Cello and orchestra (Strauss)|Romanze for cello and orchestra]] (1883); a [[Violin Concerto (Strauss)|Violin Concerto in D minor]] (1882); the [[Burleske|''Burleske'' for piano and orchestra]] (1885, revised 1889); the tone poem ''Don Quixote'' for cello, viola and orchestra (1897); the well-known late Oboe Concerto in D major (1945); and the Duett-Concertino for clarinet and bassoon with string orchestra, which was one of his last works (1948).\n\n===Opera===\n{{See also|List of operas by Richard Strauss}}\nAround the end of the 19th century, Strauss turned his attention to opera. His first two attempts in the genre, ''[[Guntram (opera)|Guntram]]'' (1894) and ''[[Feuersnot]]'' (1901), were controversial works: ''Guntram'' was the first significant critical failure of Strauss's career, and ''Feuersnot'' was considered obscene by some critics.<ref>Tim Ashley, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/reviews/story/0,3604,404766,00.html Feuersnot]\". ''[[The Guardian]]''. London. 30 November 2000. Retrieved 27 October 2007.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schmutzer-Richard Strauss.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Richard Strauss engraved by Ferdinand Schmutzer (1922)]]\nIn 1905, Strauss produced ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', a somewhat dissonant modernist opera based on the [[Salome (play)|play]] by [[Oscar Wilde]], which produced a passionate reaction from audiences. The premiere was a major success, with the artists taking more than 38 curtain calls.<ref>Derrick Puffett ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ABrNsZOXIr4C ''Richard Strauss: \"Salome\"''] (1989), p. 4</ref> Many later performances of the opera were also successful, not only with the general public but also with Strauss's peers: [[Maurice Ravel]] said that ''Salome'' was \"stupendous\",<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 145</ref> and [[Gustav Mahler]] described it as \"a live volcano, a subterranean fire\".<ref>Kennedy 1999, p. 149</ref> Strauss reputedly financed his house in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] completely from the revenues generated by the opera. As with the later ''Elektra'', ''Salome'' features an extremely taxing lead soprano role. Strauss often remarked that he preferred writing for the female voice, which is apparent in these two sister operas\u2014the male parts are almost entirely smaller roles, included only to supplement the soprano's performance.\n\nStrauss's next opera was ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), which took his use of dissonance even further, in particular with the [[Elektra chord]]. ''Elektra'' was also the first opera in which Strauss collaborated with the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] as his librettist. The two subsequently worked together on numerous occasions. For his later works with Hofmannsthal, Strauss moderated his harmonic language: he used a more lush, melodic late-Romantic style based on Wagnerian chromatic harmonies that he had used in his tone poems, with much less dissonance, and exhibiting immense virtuosity in orchestral writing and tone color. This resulted in operas such as ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911) having great public success. Strauss continued to produce operas at regular intervals until 1942. With Hofmannsthal he created ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1933). For ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' (1924) Strauss provided his own libretto. ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (1935), was composed with [[Stefan Zweig]] as librettist; ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1935\u201336) and ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'' (1937) both had a libretto by [[Joseph Gregor]] and Stefan Zweig; and ''[[Die Liebe der Danae]]'' (1940) was with Joseph Gregor. Strauss's final opera, ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' (1942), had a libretto by [[Clemens Krauss]], although the genesis for it came from Stefan Zweig and Joseph Gregor.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by [[Operabase]], in number of operas performed worldwide over the five seasons from 2008/09 to 2012/13, Strauss was the second-most performed 20th-century opera composer, ahead of [[Benjamin Britten]] and behind only [[Giacomo Puccini]].<ref name=operabase200820013>[http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en& The five seasons 2008/9 to 2012/13: Composers].

He often composed them with the voice of his wife in mind. His lieder were written for voice and piano, and he orchestrated several of them after the fact. In 1894\u20131895, around the age of 30, he published several well-known songs including \"[[Ruhe, meine Seele!]]\", \"[[C\u00e4cilie (Strauss)|C\u00e4cilie]]\", \"[[Morgen!]]\", \"[[Heimliche Aufforderung]]\", and \"[[Traum durch die D\u00e4mmerung]]\". In 1918, after a long hiatus devoted to opera, he wrote [[Sechs Lieder, Op. 68 (Strauss)|''Sechs Lieder'', Op. 68]], also called ''Brentano Lieder''. He completed his works in the genre in 1948 with ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' for soprano and orchestra. He reportedly composed these with [[Kirsten Flagstad]] in mind and she gave the first performance, which was recorded. Strauss's songs have always been popular with audiences and performers, and are generally considered by musicologists\u2014along with many of his other compositions\u2014to be masterpieces.\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Richard Strauss young portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Strauss]]\nUntil the 1980s, Strauss was regarded by some post-modern musicologists as a conservative, backward-looking composer, but re-examination of and new research on the composer has re-evaluated his place as that of a modernist,<ref>Shirley, Hugo (2012). \"In Search of Strauss\" in ''Journal of the Royal Musical Association'', vol. 137, issue 1, pp. 187\u2013192</ref> albeit one who still utilized and sometimes revered tonality and lush orchestration.<ref>Hepokoski, James, \"The Second Cycle of Tone Poems\" in Youmans (ed.), p. 78</ref> Strauss is noted for his pioneering subtleties of orchestration, combined with an advanced harmonic style; when he first played Strauss at a university production of ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', the conductor [[Mark Elder]] \"was flabbergasted.

[[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] heard ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' in 1902, and later said that the work \"contained the seeds for a new life\"; a Straussian influence is clearly present in his works of that period, including his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|First String Quartet]], ''[[Kossuth (Bart\u00f3k)|Kossuth]]'', and ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]''.<ref>Elliott Antokoletz and Paolo Susanni, ''B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k: A Research and Information Guide'', 2nd Revised edition (1997), Routledge, London, {{ISBN|978-0815320883}}, Introduction p. xxi.</ref> [[Karol Szymanowski]] was also greatly influenced by Strauss, reflected in such pieces as his ''Concert Overture'' and his first and [[Symphony No. 2 (Szymanowski)|second]] symphonies,<ref>Paul Caldrin, \"Orchestra music and orchestration\", pp. 166\u2013169 in  Paul Cadrin and Stephen Downes (editors), ''The Szymanowski Companion'', Routledge, London, Revised edition (2015). {{ISBN|978-0754661511}}</ref> and his opera ''[[Hagith (opera)|Hagith]]'' which was modeled after ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''.  English composers were also influenced by Strauss, from [[Edward Elgar]] in his concert overture ''[[In the South (Alassio)]]'' and other works<ref>Ian Parrott, ''Elgar (Master Musician)'', Everyman Ltd, London, First Edition (1971), p. 60.</ref> to [[Benjamin Britten]] in his opera writing. Many contemporary composers recognise a debt to Strauss, including [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[John Corigliano]].<ref>Ross, Alex (2010). \"Strauss's Place in the Twentieth Century\".

The style of his musical depictions of character (Don Juan, Till Eulenspiegel, the Hero) and emotions found their way into the lexicon of film music. Film music historian Timothy Schuerer wrote, \"The elements of post (late) romantic music that had greatest impact on scoring are its lush sound, expanded harmonic language, chromaticism, use of program music and use of [[Leitmotifs]]. Hollywood composers found the post-romantic idiom compatible with their efforts in scoring film\".<ref>Timothy Scheurer, ''Music and Mythmaking in Film'', Mcfarland, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0786431908}}. p. 41.</ref> [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Korngold]] came from the same musical world as Strauss and were quite naturally drawn to write in his style. As film historian Roy Prendergast wrote, \"When confronted with the kind of dramatic problem films presented to them, Steiner, Korngold and [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Newman]] ... looked to Wagner, [[Puccini]], Verdi and Strauss for the answers to dramatic film scoring.\"<ref>Roy Prendergast, ''Film Music: A neglected Art'', W.W Norton & Company, 1992, {{ISBN|978 0393308747}}.</ref> Later, the opening to ''Also sprach Zarathustra'' became one of the best-known pieces of film music when [[Stanley Kubrick]] used it in his 1968 movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. The film music of [[John Williams]] has continued the Strauss influence, in scores for mainstream hits such as ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/richard-strausss-influence-film-music/|title=WQXR \u2013 New York's Classical Music Radio Station|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nStrauss has always been popular with audiences in the concert hall and continues to be so.

The ranking is Debussy, Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Strauss, Prokofiev.</ref>\n\n==Strauss as a conductor==\n[[File:DBPB 1954 124 Richard Strauss.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Stamp issued in 1954]]\nStrauss, as conductor, made a large number of recordings, both of his own music as well as music by German and Austrian composers. His 1929 performances of ''Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks'' and ''Don Juan'' with the [[Berlin State Opera Orchestra]] have long been considered the best of his early electrical recordings. In the first complete performance of his ''An Alpine Symphony'', made in 1941 and later released by [[EMI]], Strauss used the full complement of percussion instruments required in this work.\n\n[[Koch records|Koch Legacy]] has also released Strauss's recordings of overtures by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Peter Cornelius]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. The preference for German and Austrian composers in Germany in the 1920s through the 1940s was typical of the German nationalism that existed after [[World War I]]. Strauss clearly capitalized on national pride for the great German-speaking composers.\n\nThere were many other recordings, including some taken from radio broadcasts and concerts during the 1930s and early 1940s. The sheer volume of recorded performances would undoubtedly yield some definitive performances from a very capable and rather forward-looking conductor.\n\nIn 1944, Strauss celebrated his 80th birthday and conducted the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in recordings of his own major orchestral works, as well as his seldom-heard ''[[Schlagobers]]'' (''Whipped Cream'') ballet music. Some find more feeling in these performances than in Strauss's earlier recordings, which were recorded on the [[Magnetophon]] tape recording equipment. [[Vanguard Records]] later issued the recordings on LPs. Some of these recordings have been reissued on CD by Preiser.  The last recording made by Strauss was on 19 October 1947 live at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where he conducted the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] in his Burleske for piano and orchestra (Alfred Blumen piano), Don Juan and Sinfonia Domestica.<ref>Richard Strauss: The last concerts, CD issued by Testament SBT2 1441, 2009</ref>\n\nStrauss also made live-recording [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld system and in 1906 ten recordings for the [[reproducing piano]] [[Welte-Mignon]] all of which survive today. Strauss was also the composer of the music on the first CD to be commercially released: [[Deutsche Grammophon]]'s 1983 release of their 1980 recording of [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting the ''Alpine Symphony''.\n\n===Modern critical reception of selected recordings conducted by Strauss===\n[[File:The orchestra and its instruments (1917) (14780185164).jpg|thumb|300px|Strauss conducting (circa 1900)]]\n[[Pierre Boulez]] has said that Strauss the conductor was \"a complete master of his trade\".{{sfn|Boulez|2003|p={{Page needed|date=December 2013}}}} Music critic [[Harold C. Schonberg]] writes that, while Strauss was a very fine conductor, he often put scant effort into his recordings.<ref>Schonberg, p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Schonberg focused primarily on Strauss's recordings of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 40]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], as well as noting that Strauss played a breakneck version of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] in about 45 minutes. Concerning Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Schonberg wrote, \"There is almost never a ''ritard'' or a change in expression or nuance. The slow movement is almost as fast as the following ''vivace''; and the last movement, with a big cut in it, is finished in 4 minutes, 25 seconds. (It should run between 7 and 8 minutes.)\" <ref>Schonberg (1967), p. {{Page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> He also complained that the Mozart symphony had \"no force, no charm, no inflection, with a metronomic rigidity.\"\n\n[[Peter Gutmann (journalist)|Peter Gutmann]]'s 1994 review for ''ClassicalNotes.com'' says the performances of the Beethoven 5th and 7th symphonies, as well as Mozart's last three symphonies, are actually quite good, even if they are sometimes unconventional. Gutmann wrote:\n<blockquote>It is true, as the critics suggest, that the readings forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead is a solid sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. It is also true that Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with our modern outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news sound bites than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.<ref>Peter Gutmann, [http://www.classicalnotes.net/reviews/strauss.html  \"Richard Strauss Conducts\"] on classicalnotes.net</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, Richard Strauss (40).jpg|thumb|upright|Star on the Walk of Fame, Vienna]]\nHis honors included:<ref>Listed in Wilhelm, Kurt (1989), pp. 298\u201399.
