The credit for this is not borne out by his age, but rather by the legacy of the forcefulness of the ''barbarogenie'', the precipitate of a true artistic rebellion characteristic of this part of the Balkans. This combination of a Central European thinking of the world and a violent, Mici\u0107 would say 'savage', spirit and momentum, now dark, now cheeky, is the peculiarity of the writer Stefanovi\u0107. \u2014 Dubravka Kne\u017eevi\u0107, afterword for ''Slavic Orpheus and other plays'', Belgrade, 1995.<ref>Kne\u017eevi\u0107, Dubravka.

[...] He creates a multifaceted and dense manuscript that, quite sovereignly, survives beyond the theater scene.

A record crowd of 158,000 attended in 2003, before an advance-ticket-only admission policy came into force; attendance was subsequently capped at 150,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/what-is-it/history.aspx|title=History of Festival of Speed|publisher=Goodwood.co.uk|accessdate=2011-01-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306074806/http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/what-is-it/history.aspx|archivedate=2011-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nThe Goodwood Festival of Speed was founded in 1993 by [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara|Lord March]] in order to bring motor racing back to the Goodwood estate&nbsp;\u2014 a location steeped in British motor racing history. Shortly after taking over the estate in the early 1990s, Lord March (who later became Duke of Richmond) wanted to bring back motor racing to [[Goodwood Circuit]], but did not have the necessary permit to host a race there. Therefore, he instead hosted it on his own grounds. With a small selection of entrants made up of invited historic vehicles, the first event that took place on Sunday 13 June proved to be a success, taking in a crowd of 25,000 despite a date clash with the [[1993 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans that year]]. After the first event's date clash, Lord March would ensure that the event would never be allowed to clash with either Le Mans or [[Formula One]] races.\nIn 1994, Saturday was added, making it a weekend event. In 1996, Friday was added, making it a three-day event. In 2010, the [[#The Moving Motor Show|Moving Motor Show]] was added on the Thursday.\n\n===Features and attractions===\n====Hillclimb====\n[[File:2019FOS 1970GulfPorsche.jpg|left|thumb|1970 Porsche 917 going up the hill at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed]]\n[[File:Ligier-01(1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ligier JS P3]] at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed]]\nThe event is classified as a [[hillclimbing|hill climb]] and visitors are accorded close access to that part of the track. The 1890&nbsp;m track climbs 92.7&nbsp;metres (has average gradient of 4.9%). Its record time was set in 2019 by [[Romain Dumas]] in an electric [[Volkswagen I.D. R]] at 39.9 seconds. The record time for a Formula 1 car is 41.6&nbsp;s by Nick Heidfeld in 1999 in a McLaren MP4/13.<ref>{{cite web |title=The measure of Volkswagen\u2019s Festival of Speed success |url=https://www.goodwood.com/media-centre/the-measure-of-volkswagens-festival-of-speed-success/ |website=Goodwood.com |date=16 July 2019}}</ref> For safety reasons Formula 1 cars can no longer do official timed runs so instead perform demonstrations.\n\nIn 2016 to commemorate 40 years since [[James Hunt]] won the F1 World Championship, McLaren commissioned [[Bruno Senna]] to speed a P1 GTR up the course.<ref>{{cite web |title=James Hunt inspired McLaren P1 GTR to feature at Goodwood |publisher=Evo |url=http://www.evo.co.uk/mclaren/p1/17842/james-hunt-inspired-mclaren-p1-gtr-to-feature-at-goodwood |accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Soapbox challenge====\nFrom 2000 to 2004 this was a downhill race for gravity-powered cars. Starting from just below the hill-climb finish line, to a finish line in front of the house.\nIt included entries from [[Cosworth]], [[Prodrive]], and other top companies.  With some famous riders/drivers piloting them, including [[Barry Sheene]]. However, there were frequent accidents. Despite an official cap on the cost of cars, the unofficial costs were becoming too high, so it did not return in 2005. However, it did return in 2013. Companies such as Bentley and McLaren competed.\n\n====Forest Rally Stage====\n[[File:Mini Cooper S (34911594793).jpg|thumb|[[Mini Cooper S]] crossing the finish line of Forest Rally Stage]]\nFrom 2005 to present there has been a demonstration area for the rally cars at the top of the hill.\nInitially, in 2005, the track through the forest was widened, and the rally cars ran down through the forest, turned on the tarmac section just outside the wood, and returned up the same track. This meant that the cars could only run one-at-a-time.\n\nIn 2006, a full forest stage was introduced, designed by [[Hannu Mikkola]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/goodwood-festival-of-speed/9325106/Goodwood-Festival-of-Speed-Forest-Rally-Stage.html|title=Goodwood Festival of Speed: Forest Rally Stage - Telegraph}}</ref> this was a complete circuit, with a separate start and finish line at the top of the wood. This allowed the cars to start at timed intervals, allowing many more cars to run. Ever since its inception Southern Car Club have been entrusted with the organization of the rally stage, held under an MSA permit.\n\n====Supercar run====\nSince 2000, there has been a '''''Michelin'' Supercar Run (Formally sponsored by Microsoft Windows and The Times)''', for road-going [[supercar]]s. Since 2014 cars could opt to do a timed run. It is now common for specialty car manufacturers to show off their latest sports model, including newly released mass-produced sports models and working [[concept car|concept models]].\n\n====Cartier Style et Luxe====\nSince 1995<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrc.goodwood.com/festival-of-speed/explore-the-event/concours|title=Cartier &#039;Style et Luxe&#039; at Goodwood Festival of Speed}}</ref> this is an [[auto show]] which takes place to the west of the house. It is a similar format to the [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]]. Entry is usually by invitation, and this provides some leeway as to which type of vehicle can enter, usually resulting in a more varied event than usual [[Concours d'Elegance]]. Unlike most concours shows, the ''Cartier Style et Luxe'' is judged by a panel of selected judges consisting of celebrities from all around the world to car designers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewelleryeditor.com/2013/07/cartier-hosts-annual-style-et-luxe-competition-at-goodwood-festival-of-speed/|title=Cartier hosts annual Style et Luxe competition at Goodwood Festival of Speed}}</ref>\n\n====Moving Motor Show====\nSince 2010, the '''Moving Motor Show''', was added. Mainly in response to the cancellation of the [[British International Motor Show]] aimed exclusively for buyers of new cars, allowing them a chance to test the cars on the course.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/goodwood-festival-of-speed/7638388/Goodwood-Festival-of-Speed-Moving-Motor-Show.html|title=Goodwood Festival of Speed: Moving Motor Show |accessdate=2010-07-05|work=telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=David | last=Williams | date=2010-04-29}}</ref> Following its success, it was announced the MMS would return in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/news-and-coverage/articles/mms-and-auto-trader-for-2011.aspx |title=MMS and Auto Trader for 2011 |publisher=Goodwood.co.uk |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2011-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218025207/http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/news-and-coverage/articles/mms-and-auto-trader-for-2011.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-18 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mclaren mp4-12c goodwood festival of speed 2010.jpg|thumb|right|McLaren MP4-12C at the 2010 Festival of Speed]]\nThe 2010 event also included the running of the new McLaren MP4-12C.\n\nThe official website lists the Festival of speed dates as the Friday to Sunday, but the weekend tickets for the Festival include a moving motor show ticket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ticketing.goodwood.com/Tickets.html|title=tickets|publisher=Goodwood.co.uk|accessdate=2014-11-10}}</ref> So it's not strictly part of the Festival of Speed, but it is a part of the Festival of Speed weekend.\n\n====Other====\nOther popular attractions at the event are the real life replicas of the [[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]] cars (Thursday is now known as Press preview day but still incorporates The Moving Motor Show), which serves to provide lunchtime entertainment for the crowds, and the [[airshow]]s, which usually include the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] and [[Red Arrows]], and in 2004 and 2005 a low-flying [[Boeing 747]]; a low-flying [[Airbus A380]] appeared at the 2008 event.\n\nFrom the festival's beginning, poster art had been illustrated by renowned motor racing artist Peter Hearsey until his retirement in 2015. In 2016, the poster art was designed by Klaus Wagger, who rose to prominence as a racing artist when he won a competition to design the official poster for [[Mille Miglia]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/goodwood-festival-of-speed/11532648/Goodwood-announces-new-Festival-of-Speed-poster-artist.html |title=Goodwood announces new Festival of Speed poster artist |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, they have also put on the GAS Arena (Goodwood Action Sports) who showcase extreme stunts such as Freestyle Motorcross, BMX and Trial bike Riding <ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrc.goodwood.com/festival-of-speed/explore-the-event/gas |title=Goodwood Action Sports (GAS) at the Festival of Speed |publisher=Grrc.goodwood.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, for the first time at the Festival, a driverless Roborace racing car negotiated the course, and a virtual passenger seat experience was made available online.<ref>[https://newatlas.com/roborace-robocar-hill-climb-goodwood-video/55456/ \"Video: Ride along with Roborace's autonomous race car at Goodwood\"] New Atlas, July 13, 2018</ref> In 2019, the car made an official run in 66.96 seconds.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49420570|title=The robo racing cars accelerating driverless tech|date=27 August 2019|author=Padraig Belton|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other events===\nThe Festival of Speed has a sister event, the [[Goodwood Revival Meeting]]. This event, normally held in early September, relives the glory days of motor racing at the [[Goodwood Motor Racing Circuit]].\n\n==Incidents==\nThere have been two fatal accidents at the event.\n\nThe first was during its inaugural meeting in 1993, when vintage racing motorcyclist Chas Guy was killed in practice following the completion of the course when his Vincent motorcycle developed a steering wobble known as a [[tank slapper]], throwing the rider into a tree.

A record crowd of 158,000 attended in 2003, before an advance-ticket-only admission policy came into force; attendance was subsequently capped at 150,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/what-is-it/history.aspx|title=History of Festival of Speed|publisher=Goodwood.co.uk|accessdate=2011-01-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306074806/http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/what-is-it/history.aspx|archivedate=2011-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nThe Goodwood Festival of Speed was founded in 1993 by [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara|Lord March]] in order to bring motor racing back to the Goodwood estate&nbsp;\u2014 a location steeped in British motor racing history. Shortly after taking over the estate in the early 1990s, Lord March (who later became Duke of Richmond) wanted to bring back motor racing to [[Goodwood Circuit]], but did not have the necessary permit to host a race there. Therefore, he instead hosted it on his own grounds. With a small selection of entrants made up of invited historic vehicles, the first event that took place on Sunday 13 June proved to be a success, taking in a crowd of 25,000 despite a date clash with the [[1993 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans that year]]. After the first event's date clash, Lord March would ensure that the event would never be allowed to clash with either Le Mans or [[Formula One]] races.\nIn 1994, Saturday was added, making it a weekend event. In 1996, Friday was added, making it a three-day event. In 2010, the [[#The Moving Motor Show|Moving Motor Show]] was added on the Thursday.\n\n===Features and attractions===\n====Hillclimb====\n[[File:2019FOS 1970GulfPorsche.jpg|left|thumb|1970 Porsche 917 going up the hill at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed]]\n[[File:Ligier-01(1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ligier JS P3]] at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed]]\nThe event is classified as a [[hillclimbing|hill climb]] and visitors are accorded close access to that part of the track. The 1890&nbsp;m track climbs 92.7&nbsp;metres (has average gradient of 4.9%). Its record time was set in 2019 by [[Romain Dumas]] in an electric [[Volkswagen I.D. R]] at 39.9 seconds. The record time for a Formula 1 car is 41.6&nbsp;s by Nick Heidfeld in 1999 in a McLaren MP4/13.<ref>{{cite web |title=The measure of Volkswagen\u2019s Festival of Speed success |url=https://www.goodwood.com/media-centre/the-measure-of-volkswagens-festival-of-speed-success/ |website=Goodwood.com |date=16 July 2019}}</ref> For safety reasons Formula 1 cars can no longer do official timed runs so instead perform demonstrations.\n\nIn 2016 to commemorate 40 years since [[James Hunt]] won the F1 World Championship, McLaren commissioned [[Bruno Senna]] to speed a P1 GTR up the course.<ref>{{cite web |title=James Hunt inspired McLaren P1 GTR to feature at Goodwood |publisher=Evo |url=http://www.evo.co.uk/mclaren/p1/17842/james-hunt-inspired-mclaren-p1-gtr-to-feature-at-goodwood |accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Soapbox challenge====\nFrom 2000 to 2004 this was a downhill race for gravity-powered cars. Starting from just below the hill-climb finish line, to a finish line in front of the house.\nIt included entries from [[Cosworth]], [[Prodrive]], and other top companies.  With some famous riders/drivers piloting them, including [[Barry Sheene]]. However, there were frequent accidents. Despite an official cap on the cost of cars, the unofficial costs were becoming too high, so it did not return in 2005. However, it did return in 2013. Companies such as Bentley and McLaren competed.\n\n====Forest Rally Stage====\n[[File:Mini Cooper S (34911594793).jpg|thumb|[[Mini Cooper S]] crossing the finish line of Forest Rally Stage]]\nFrom 2005 to present there has been a demonstration area for the rally cars at the top of the hill.\nInitially, in 2005, the track through the forest was widened, and the rally cars ran down through the forest, turned on the tarmac section just outside the wood, and returned up the same track. This meant that the cars could only run one-at-a-time.\n\nIn 2006, a full forest stage was introduced, designed by [[Hannu Mikkola]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/goodwood-festival-of-speed/9325106/Goodwood-Festival-of-Speed-Forest-Rally-Stage.html|title=Goodwood Festival of Speed: Forest Rally Stage - Telegraph}}</ref> this was a complete circuit, with a separate start and finish line at the top of the wood. This allowed the cars to start at timed intervals, allowing many more cars to run. Ever since its inception Southern Car Club have been entrusted with the organization of the rally stage, held under an MSA permit.\n\n====Supercar run====\nSince 2000, there has been a '''''Michelin'' Supercar Run (Formally sponsored by Microsoft Windows and The Times)''', for road-going [[supercar]]s. Since 2014 cars could opt to do a timed run. It is now common for specialty car manufacturers to show off their latest sports model, including newly released mass-produced sports models and working [[concept car|concept models]].\n\n====Cartier Style et Luxe====\nSince 1995<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrc.goodwood.com/festival-of-speed/explore-the-event/concours|title=Cartier &#039;Style et Luxe&#039; at Goodwood Festival of Speed}}</ref> this is an [[auto show]] which takes place to the west of the house. It is a similar format to the [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]]. Entry is usually by invitation, and this provides some leeway as to which type of vehicle can enter, usually resulting in a more varied event than usual [[Concours d'Elegance]]. Unlike most concours shows, the ''Cartier Style et Luxe'' is judged by a panel of selected judges consisting of celebrities from all around the world to car designers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewelleryeditor.com/2013/07/cartier-hosts-annual-style-et-luxe-competition-at-goodwood-festival-of-speed/|title=Cartier hosts annual Style et Luxe competition at Goodwood Festival of Speed}}</ref>\n\n====Moving Motor Show====\nSince 2010, the '''Moving Motor Show''', was added. Mainly in response to the cancellation of the [[British International Motor Show]] aimed exclusively for buyers of new cars, allowing them a chance to test the cars on the course.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/goodwood-festival-of-speed/7638388/Goodwood-Festival-of-Speed-Moving-Motor-Show.html|title=Goodwood Festival of Speed: Moving Motor Show |accessdate=2010-07-05|work=telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=David | last=Williams | date=2010-04-29}}</ref> Following its success, it was announced the MMS would return in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/news-and-coverage/articles/mms-and-auto-trader-for-2011.aspx |title=MMS and Auto Trader for 2011 |publisher=Goodwood.co.uk |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2011-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218025207/http://www.goodwood.co.uk/festival-of-speed/news-and-coverage/articles/mms-and-auto-trader-for-2011.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-18 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mclaren mp4-12c goodwood festival of speed 2010.jpg|thumb|right|McLaren MP4-12C at the 2010 Festival of Speed]]\nThe 2010 event also included the running of the new McLaren MP4-12C.\n\nThe official website lists the Festival of speed dates as the Friday to Sunday, but the weekend tickets for the Festival include a moving motor show ticket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ticketing.goodwood.com/Tickets.html|title=tickets|publisher=Goodwood.co.uk|accessdate=2014-11-10}}</ref> So it's not strictly part of the Festival of Speed, but it is a part of the Festival of Speed weekend.\n\n====Other====\nOther popular attractions at the event are the real life replicas of the [[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]] cars (Thursday is now known as Press preview day but still incorporates The Moving Motor Show), which serves to provide lunchtime entertainment for the crowds, and the [[airshow]]s, which usually include the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] and [[Red Arrows]], and in 2004 and 2005 a low-flying [[Boeing 747]]; a low-flying [[Airbus A380]] appeared at the 2008 event.\n\nFrom the festival's beginning, poster art had been illustrated by renowned motor racing artist Peter Hearsey until his retirement in 2015. In 2016, the poster art was designed by Klaus Wagger, who rose to prominence as a racing artist when he won a competition to design the official poster for [[Mille Miglia]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/goodwood-festival-of-speed/11532648/Goodwood-announces-new-Festival-of-Speed-poster-artist.html |title=Goodwood announces new Festival of Speed poster artist |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, they have also put on the GAS Arena (Goodwood Action Sports) who showcase extreme stunts such as Freestyle Motorcross, BMX and Trial bike Riding <ref>{{cite web|url=https://grrc.goodwood.com/festival-of-speed/explore-the-event/gas |title=Goodwood Action Sports (GAS) at the Festival of Speed |publisher=Grrc.goodwood.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, for the first time at the Festival, a driverless Roborace racing car negotiated the course, and a virtual passenger seat experience was made available online.<ref>[https://newatlas.com/roborace-robocar-hill-climb-goodwood-video/55456/ \"Video: Ride along with Roborace's autonomous race car at Goodwood\"] New Atlas, July 13, 2018</ref> In 2019, the car made an official run in 66.96 seconds.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49420570|title=The robo racing cars accelerating driverless tech|date=27 August 2019|author=Padraig Belton|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other events===\nThe Festival of Speed has a sister event, the [[Goodwood Revival Meeting]]. This event, normally held in early September, relives the glory days of motor racing at the [[Goodwood Motor Racing Circuit]].\n\n==Incidents==\nThere have been two fatal accidents at the event.\n\nThe first was during its inaugural meeting in 1993, when vintage racing motorcyclist Chas Guy was killed in practice following the completion of the course when his Vincent motorcycle developed a steering wobble known as a [[tank slapper]], throwing the rider into a tree. Since then, motorcycles are not timed for their run.\n\nIn 2000, driver John Dawson-Damer lost control of his [[Lotus 63]], and crashed into the finish line [[gantry (road sign)|gantry]], killing himself and marshal Andrew Carpenter. Another marshal, Steve Tarrant, survived but sustained serious injuries to the lower part of his right leg.<ref>{{cite web |title=incidents Mar Goodwood Festival of Speed |work=Atlas F1 |publisher=Haymarket Publishing |url=http://www.atlasf1.com/news/2000/jun/report.php?id=2573 |date=2000-06-28}}</ref>\n\n==Central display==\n[[Aston Martin]] set up a central display for the first FOS in 1993.<ref name=define>{{cite news |first=David |last=Williams |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/goodwood-festival-of-speed/8474150/Sculptures-that-define-the-Goodwood-Festival-of-Speed.html |title=Sculptures that define the Goodwood Festival of Speed |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=2011-05-03 }}</ref> Since 1997, the display erected on the lawn in front of Goodwood House has been designed by the sculptor [[Gerry Judah]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rbs.org.uk/artists/gerry-judah |title=Gerry Judah FRBS |publisher=Royal British Society of Sculptors |accessdate=2017-09-17 }}</ref> The displays honoured car marques until 2017, when for the first time it honoured a career, that of [[Bernie Ecclestone]].
