It is part of the parish of All Saints', St Mary's and St Peter's, Nottingham.\n\nThe church is [[Grade I listed]] by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1255013 |desc=Grade I |accessdate=27 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSt Peter's is one of the three mediaeval parish churches in Nottingham, the others being [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham|St Mary's]] and [[St Nicholas Church, Nottingham|St Nicholas]]. The parish of [[St. James' Church, Standard Hill]], founded in 1807 was united with St Peter's in 1933 and the official title \"St Peter with St James\" came into being. (St James's was demolished a few years later; some monuments from St James's are preserved in St Peter's.)\n\nThe church shows traces of many stages of construction from about 1180 onwards (the original church of around 1100 was destroyed by fire).\n\n===List of incumbents===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*1241 - ?

The Organist & Director of Music since 2007 is Peter Siepmann.\n\n===Choir===\n\nThe choral tradition at St Peter's was developed by Vincent Trivett (Organist 1906-1947), Kendrick Partington (Organist 1957-1994) and others.  The choir sings in church every Sunday and frequently has concert performances. The choir often sings in other churches and cathedrals across the UK and abroad. This began with a visit to [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in 1969. In 2008 the choir sang the services for several days at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghamchurches.org/music/stpeterschoir/|title=St Peter's Choir - Nottingham Churches|website=www.nottinghamchurches.org}}</ref>\n\n===Concerts===\n\nSt Peter's has a regular series of Saturday morning 'coffee break' concerts. These were started in 1988. The church also occasionally hosts more formal evening performances.\n\n===Organ===\nThe first organ since the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth period]] was installed by Lincoln in 1812. This was enlarged by [[Charles Lloyd (organ builder)|Lloyd and Dudgeon]] in 1863<ref>[[Nottinghamshire Guardian]] - Friday 8 May 1863</ref> and has been adapted and restored several times since by [[E. Wragg & Son]], [[Henry Willis & Sons]] and [[Hill, Norman & Beard]]. In 1952, much of the organ of [[St Columba's Church, Nottingham|St Columba, Mansfield Road]] was incorporated into the St Peter's instrument.\n\nA new organ was installed in 2010, and combines some ranks of new and re-used pipes with digital simulations of most stops. It is situated in the North-East corner of the church, retaining a historic eighteenth century case. The organ has been designed as a recital instrument, and to provide support for congregational singing, as well as accompanying the church's choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghamchurches.org/music/theorgans/stpetersorgan/|title=St Peter's organ - Nottingham Churches|website=www.nottinghamchurches.org}}</ref>\n\n====Organists====\nThere are notes of payments to organists in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\n*1481-1482 And for 5s paid to the organist (lusori ad organa) in the aforesaid Church in this year.<ref name=\"auto\">Thoroton Society Record Series Volume VII (1939).

It is part of the parish of All Saints', St Mary's and St Peter's, Nottingham.\n\nThe church is [[Grade I listed]] by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1255013 |desc=Grade I |accessdate=27 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSt Peter's is one of the three mediaeval parish churches in Nottingham, the others being St Mary's and St Nicholas'. The parish of [[St. James' Church, Standard Hill]], founded in 1807 was united with St Peter's in 1933 and the official title \"St Peter with St James\" came into being. (St James's was demolished a few years later; some monuments from St James's are preserved in St Peter's.)\n\nThe church shows traces of many stages of construction from about 1180 onwards (the original church of around 1100 was destroyed by fire).\n\n===List of incumbents===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*1241 - ?

The Organist & Director of Music since 2007 is Peter Siepmann.\n\n===Choir===\n\nThe choral tradition at St Peter's was developed by Vincent Trivett (Organist 1906-1947), Kendrick Partington (Organist 1957-1994) and others.  The choir sings in church every Sunday and frequently has concert performances. The choir often sings in other churches and cathedrals across the UK and abroad. This began with a visit to [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in 1969. In 2008 the choir sang the services for several days at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghamchurches.org/music/stpeterschoir/|title=St Peter's Choir - Nottingham Churches|website=www.nottinghamchurches.org}}</ref>\n\n===Concerts===\n\nSt Peter's has a regular series of Saturday morning 'coffee break' concerts. These were started in 1988. The church also occasionally hosts more formal evening performances.\n\n===Organ===\nThe first organ since the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth period]] was installed by Lincoln in 1812. This was enlarged by [[Charles Lloyd (organ builder)|Lloyd and Dudgeon]] in 1863<ref>[[Nottinghamshire Guardian]] - Friday 8 May 1863</ref> and has been adapted and restored several times since by [[E. Wragg & Son]], [[Henry Willis & Sons]] and [[Hill, Norman & Beard]]. In 1952, much of the organ of [[St Columba's Church, Nottingham|St Columba, Mansfield Road]] was incorporated into the St Peter's instrument.\n\nA new organ was installed in 2010, and combines some ranks of new and re-used pipes with digital simulations of most stops. It is situated in the North-East corner of the church, retaining a historic eighteenth century case. The organ has been designed as a recital instrument, and to provide support for congregational singing, as well as accompanying the church's choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghamchurches.org/music/theorgans/stpetersorgan/|title=St Peter's organ - Nottingham Churches|website=www.nottinghamchurches.org}}</ref>\n\n====Organists====\nThere are notes of payments to organists in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\n*1481-1482 And for 5s paid to the organist (lusori ad organa) in the aforesaid Church in this year.<ref name=\"auto\">Thoroton Society Record Series Volume VII (1939).

The 1941 design would continue in an aborted 1942 model year and would be restarted in 1946 and produced until 1948 when the more modern [[1949 Ford]]s were ready.  During the initial year of this car, it evolved considerably.  The front fenders came in three pieces, the theory being that small damages could be replaced easily.  During the year, it evolved into two pieces with the lower front and back sections being joined.  The hood risers changed, the early ones being the same as 1940 Fords, changing during the year to the better later version.  The 1941 Convertible had no rear side windows, the only side windows being in the doors; in 1942, quarter windows were added so the rear occupants could see out.\nFive different coil/distributor arrangements were used during 1941, causing confusion for mechanics. Other variations were: two different positions for the generator, and three for the cooling fan \u2014 front of the crankshaft, front of the generator (rare) and on a bracket.  This is thought to be the first Ford to offer a replaceable cartridge oil filter as an option.  The two interior heaters were a \"Southwind\" gasoline burner, which had the advantage of keeping one warm in winter at drive-in movies (provided a small electric fuel pump was used), and a more ordinary hot-water type.  Both had window defrosters.  It had an excellent radio, which could consume the battery in about two hours. Electric windshield wipers were available in addition to the vacuum-powered wipers.  Three different convertible power top mechanisms (vacuum, electric screw, and hydraulic) and two different header bar latching systems were used.  Rear suspensions sometimes had a sway bar, most did not.  It had excellent brakes and among the best handling of ordinary cars of the time. It served a transitional role in Ford\u2019s lineup.\n\nThe two previous Ford car lines, Standard and De Luxe, had blossomed into three, Special, De Luxe, and Super De Luxe. Ford vehicles had been V8-only since 1935, but dealer requests for an \"economy\" engine option prompted the introduction of a six cylinder unit. The entry-level 136&nbsp;CID (2.2&nbsp;L) [[V8 engine|V8]] was switched in favor of a new 226&nbsp;[[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] (3.7&nbsp;L) [[Ford Straight-6 engine|L-head]] [[straight-6]], the first Ford six since the 1906 [[Ford Model K|Model K]].  The popular 221&nbsp;CID (3.6&nbsp;L) V8 remained as the top-line engine and was standard in De Luxe models.  Both engines were rated at 90&nbsp;hp. The 239 CID engine, introduced in 1939 for Mercury and trucks, was continued in the Mercury models.  The chassis was longer, with a 114-in (2.9-m) wheelbase.\n\nThe \"ignition key\" for these cars was actually used to operate a bolt lock which, on one end, unlocked the steering column (a feature destined to return, mandated, decades later), and on the other end unblocked the ignition switch, allowing it to be operated.  Starting the car was then accomplished by pressing a [[Push-button|pushbutton]] on the dashboard, another feature destined to return with the advent of \"[[smart key]]s\".\n\nAlthough starting [[Crank (mechanism)#Using a hand|cranks]] had been replaced by [[electric starter]]s for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an [[antidote]] to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-[[lug wrench]] served as a handle (also for the [[Jack (device)#Mechanical jack|jack]]) and the jack shaft with [[Bayonet mount|bayonet]]-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine [[crankshaft]].  A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the [[Ford flathead engine|flat head V8]], and the bayonet coupling was self-disengaging for safety.\n\n==1941==\n[[File:1941 ford super deluxe.png|left|thumb|1941 Ford Super Deluxe Convertible Coupe]]\nFords for 1941 were much more modern with a wide body that nearly covered the [[running board]]s. The front and rear fenders were still pronounced, but were now integrated more into the body and the headlights were pushed all the way up and out over the front wheels. The 1941 grille was a three-part affair with a tall center section bookended by twin kidneys low on the fenders and vertical bars all around. The 1941 was a bigger car with a 194.3-in (4.935-m) overall length and a width increased to 73.12-in.<ref>{{cite web |title=1941-1948 Ford Super DeLuxe |url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1941-1948-ford-super-deluxe1.htm |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1941%20Ford/1941%20Ford%20Deluxe%20Foldout/image3.html</ref> Body styles included two-door and four-door sedans, a sedan coupe, a business coupe, and convertible coupe, sedan delivery wagon, and woody station wagon. The Super Deluxe had several amenities of higher quality over the base models, including more chrome, leather seats, and a wood-grain dashboard.<ref>https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1941-1948-ford-super-deluxe2.html</ref> The pickup truck continued with the 1940 standard Ford styling. Production of the 1941 models was disrupted by a sudden labor strike in April 1941; Henry Ford, having resisted unionization well after the rest of the American automobile industry accepted it, finally gave in and signed a contract with the [[UAW]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==1942==\n[[File:1942 Ford Super Deluxe.JPG|right|thumb|250px|1942 Ford Super Deluxe Tudor Sedan]]\nThe 1942 model year lasted only four months before the government ordered a halt to civilian automobile production starting on February 10, 1942. Changes were made to the car besides a three-part \"electric shaver\" grille &mdash; and the parking lights were moved from the top of the fenders to between the grill and headlights.  Tail lights were enlarged and moved from vertical to horizontal. The frame was lowered and softer springs were used to improve the ride. The dashboard was changed, moving the radio from the top of the dash to low down, and the linear speedometer and clock were replaced with round ones.  The radio had an optional floor button so the driver could change preselected stations without using hands. War rationing required auto makers to black out their chrome trim - Ford used silver paint - and a special four-door model was produced with no chrome at all for military use.  The pickup received new styling, as well, with heavy vertical bars, and truck production lasted through March 3.\n\nThe 1942-style Ford cars certainly continued to be produced as military staff cars from March 1942 through summer 1945. These would have been registered as 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945 models. Additionally, a large number of 1942 (and a few 1941) cars held in dealer stocks by government edict, to be doled out to essential users during the conflict, were Fords. Some states titled cars by the year of sale, so it is possible to find 1943, 1944, and 1945 models by virtue of their registrations and titles.\n{{-}}\n\n==1946==\n[[File:Biffs 46 Ford.jpg|thumb|[[Biff Tannen]]'s 1946 Ford Super De Luxe Convertible Club Coupe from the ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'' franchise.]]\n[[File:'46 Ford Pickup (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).JPG|thumb|left|A 1946 Ford pickup.]]\nFollowing the official surrender of Japan in September 1945, civilian car production slowly resumed. The 1946 Ford was identical to the 1942 model under the skin, though a heavy new grille with horizontal bars and red accents refreshed the styling. The hood was widened by adding a center strip. One notable change was to use the 239 CID engine which since 1939 had been used in Mercurys and trucks, and capable of 100&nbsp;hp (75&nbsp;kW) for the first time.  With steel in short supply, Ford produced a distinctive \"Sportsman\" convertible with wood side panels, supplied from the [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant]]. The convertible had an electric top instead of manual one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1946_Ford/1946_Ford_Brochure/1946%20Ford-15.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1946_Ford/1946_Ford_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1985 film ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and its sequel ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', the car which [[Biff Tannen]] owns in 1955 was a black 1946 Ford Super De Luxe convertible. In BTTF 1, during the skateboard chase scene, note carefully the park lights: some shots are a 1946 model year, some are a 1947 model year. Looking at the \"top boot\" area shape, it appears the '47 is a real convertible and the '46 manure car is the removed top coupe.  During production, a black 1946 Ford Super De Luxe coupe had the top cut off to resemble a convertible. In BTTF 2, some trim is different suggesting a possible third car.  After the film, the car was kept by Universal and displayed in their back lot tour. The 1946 car is now in a private collection.<ref>{{cite web |author=theAFICIONAUTO |title=1946 Ford Coupe - BIFF'S BACK TO THE FUTURE FORD |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EZWiwSzMMY&a |website=YouTube |accessdate=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==1947==\n[[File:1947 Ford V8 76 Super De Luxe Convertible Club Coupe UWU575.jpg|thumb|right|A 1947 Ford convertible]]\nThe 1947 Ford line was similar to the short 1946.  Visual differences included the removal of the red accents from the grill and the two small lights located just above it. Ford began titling 1947s in February 1947. For the first few weeks, the 1947 model was identical to the 1946. Ford then restyled the body slightly first by moving the parking lights from above the grill to below each headlight. Exterior moldings were changed from grooved to a smooth design. A new hood ornament with a blue plastic insert was installed. A new hubcap design became available in March. The interior dash color was changed from red accent to gold.  By September, the roof-mounted antenna was moved to the cowl. Horns were moved to in front of the radiator from the engine compartment.

The 1941 design would continue in an aborted 1942 model year and would be restarted in 1946 and produced until 1948 when the more modern [[1949 Ford]]s were ready.  During the initial year of this car, it evolved considerably.  The front fenders came in three pieces, the theory being that small damages could be replaced easily.  During the year, it evolved into two pieces with the lower front and back sections being joined.  The hood risers changed, the early ones being the same as 1940 Fords, changing during the year to the better later version.  The 1941 Convertible had no rear side windows, the only side windows being in the doors; in 1942, quarter windows were added so the rear occupants could see out.\nFive different coil/distributor arrangements were used during 1941, causing confusion for mechanics. Other variations were: two different positions for the generator, and three for the cooling fan \u2014 front of the crankshaft, front of the generator (rare) and on a bracket.  This is thought to be the first Ford to offer a replaceable cartridge oil filter as an option.  The two interior heaters were a \"Southwind\" gasoline burner, which had the advantage of keeping one warm in winter at drive-in movies (provided a small electric fuel pump was used), and a more ordinary hot-water type.  Both had window defrosters.  It had an excellent radio, which could consume the battery in about two hours. Electric windshield wipers were available in addition to the vacuum-powered wipers.  Three different convertible power top mechanisms (vacuum, electric screw, and hydraulic) and two different header bar latching systems were used.  Rear suspensions sometimes had a sway bar, most did not.  It had excellent brakes and among the best handling of ordinary cars of the time. It served a transitional role in Ford\u2019s lineup.\n\nThe two previous Ford car lines, Standard and De Luxe, had blossomed into three, Special, De Luxe, and Super De Luxe. Ford vehicles had been V8-only since 1935, but dealer requests for an \"economy\" engine option prompted the introduction of a six cylinder unit. The entry-level 136&nbsp;CID (2.2&nbsp;L) [[V8 engine|V8]] was switched in favor of a new 226&nbsp;[[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] (3.7&nbsp;L) [[Ford Straight-6 engine|L-head]] [[straight-6]], the first Ford six since the 1906 [[Ford Model K|Model K]].  The popular 221&nbsp;CID (3.6&nbsp;L) V8 remained as the top-line engine and was standard in De Luxe models.  Both engines were rated at 90&nbsp;hp. The 239 CID engine, introduced in 1939 for Mercury and trucks, was continued in the Mercury models.  The chassis was longer, with a 114-in (2.9-m) wheelbase.\n\nThe \"ignition key\" for these cars was actually used to operate a bolt lock which, on one end, unlocked the steering column (a feature destined to return, mandated, decades later), and on the other end unblocked the ignition switch, allowing it to be operated.  Starting the car was then accomplished by pressing a [[Push-button|pushbutton]] on the dashboard, another feature destined to return with the advent of \"[[smart key]]s\".\n\nAlthough starting [[Crank (mechanism)#Using a hand|cranks]] had been replaced by [[electric starter]]s for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an [[antidote]] to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-[[lug wrench]] served as a handle (also for the [[Jack (device)#Mechanical jack|jack]]) and the jack shaft with [[Bayonet mount|bayonet]]-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine [[crankshaft]].

A 'Zealot' with capital Z, however, would suggest a member of the particular ''Zealots'', the group that emerged in Jerusalem ca. AD 6 according to Josephus, see above. In the two cited verses Paul literally declares himself as one who is ''loyal'' to God, or an ''ardent'' observer of the Law, but the relationship of [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]] is still debated. This does not necessarily prove Paul was revealing himself as a Zealot. A translation (the ''Modern King James Version'' of [[Jay P. Green]]) renders it as 'a zealous one'. Two modern translations ([[Complete Jewish Bible|Jewish New Testament]] and [[Alternate Literal Translation]]) render it as 'a zealot'.

{"title_page": "Rate (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Rate (disambiguation){{!}}Rate}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}\nMicheal Jordan is a fish [[mathematics]], a '''rate''' is the [[ratio]] between two related [[quantity|quantities]] in different units.<ref>See Webster's new international dictionary of the English language, second edition, unabridged.  Merriam Webster Co. 2016. p.2065 definition 3.\nwhile this definition doesn't say \"related\" and while the ratio of two non-related quantities is technically a ratio, such a ratio has little (if any meaning).  For example, what would be the utility of finding the ratio of such unrelated numbers as ratio of the weight of ones residence to an integer selected at random between -10<sup>\u22129</sup> and +10<sup>9</sup>?</ref>  If the denominator of the ratio is expressed as a single unit of one of these quantities, and if it is assumed that this quantity can be changed systematically (i.e., is an [[independent variable]]), then the numerator of the ratio expresses the corresponding ''rate of change'' in the other [[dependent variable|(dependent)]] variable.  \n\npeyton is goated\", such as [[speed]], [[heart rate]] and [[flux]]. Ratios that have a non-time denominator include [[exchange rate]]s, [[literacy rate]]s and [[electric field]] (in volts/meter).\n\nIn describing the units of a rate, the word \"per\" is used to separate the units of the two measurements used to calculate the rate (for example a [[heart rate]] is expressed \"beats per minute\"). A rate defined using two numbers of the same [[Units of measurement|units]] (such as [[tax rate]]s) or counts (such as [[literacy rate]]) will result in a [[dimensionless quantity]], which can be expressed as a [[percentage]] (for example, the global [[literacy rate]] in 1998 was 80%) or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or as a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]].\n\nOften ''rate'' is a synonym of [[rhythm]] or [[frequency]], a count per second (i.e., [[Hertz]]); e.g., [[radio frequencies]] or [[heart rate]] or [[sample rate]].\n\n==Introduction==\n\nRates and ratios often vary with time, location, particular element (or subset) of a set of objects, etc.  Thus they are often [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical functions]].  For example, velocity v (distance tracity on segment i (v is a function of index i).  Here each segment i, of the trip is a subset of the trip route.\n\nA rate (or ratio) may often be thought of as an output-input ratio,  [[benefit-cost ratio]], all considered in the broad sense. For example, miles per hour in transportation is the output (or benefit) in terms of miles of travel, which one gets from spending an hour (a cost in time) of traveling (at this velocity).\n\nA set of sequential indices i may be used to enumerate elements (or subsets) of a set of ratios under study.  For example, in finance, one could define i by assigning consecutive integers to companies, to political subdivisions (such as states), to different investments, etc.  The reason for using indices i, is so a set of ratios (i=0,N) can be used in an equation so as to calculate a function of the rates such as an average of a set of ratios.  For example, the average velocity found from the set of v<sub>i</sub>'s mentioned above.  Finding averages may involve using weighted averages and possibly using the [[Harmonic mean]].\n\nA ratio r=a/b has both a numerator a and a denominator b. a and/or b may be a [[real number]] or [[integer]].  The inverse of a ratio r is 1/r  = b/a.\n\nRates occur in many areas of real life. For example:\n''How fast are you driving?'' Miles per hour is a rate. ''What interest does your savings account pay you?''

Merriam Webster Co. 2016. p.2065 definition 3.\nwhile this definition doesn't say \"related\" and while the ratio of two non-related quantities is technically a ratio, such a ratio has little (if any meaning).  For example, what would be the utility of finding the ratio of such unrelated numbers as ratio of the weight of ones residence to an integer selected at random between -10<sup>\u22129</sup> and +10<sup>9</sup>?</ref>  If the denominator of the ratio is expressed as a single unit of one of these quantities, and if it is assumed that this quantity can be changed systematically (i.e., is an [[independent variable]]), then the numerator of the ratio expresses the corresponding ''rate of change'' in the other [[dependent variable|(dependent)]] variable.  \n\npeyton is goated\", such as [[speed]], [[heart rate]] and [[flux]]. Ratios that have a non-time denominator include [[exchange rate]]s, [[literacy rate]]s and [[electric field]] (in volts/meter).\n\nIn describing the units of a rate, the word \"per\" is used to separate the units of the two measurements used to calculate the rate (for example a [[heart rate]] is expressed \"beats per minute\"). A rate defined using two numbers of the same [[Units of measurement|units]] (such as [[tax rate]]s) or counts (such as [[literacy rate]]) will result in a [[dimensionless quantity]], which can be expressed as a [[percentage]] (for example, the global [[literacy rate]] in 1998 was 80%) or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or as a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]].\n\nOften ''rate'' is a synonym of [[rhythm]] or [[frequency]], a count per second (i.e., [[Hertz]]); e.g., [[radio frequencies]] or [[heart rate]] or [[sample rate]].\n\n==Introduction==\n\nRates and ratios often vary with time, location, particular element (or subset) of a set of objects, etc.  Thus they are often [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical functions]].  For example, velocity v (distance tracity on segment i (v is a function of index i).  Here each segment i, of the trip is a subset of the trip route.\n\nA rate (or ratio) may often be thought of as an output-input ratio,  [[benefit-cost ratio]], all considered in the broad sense. For example, miles per hour in transportation is the output (or benefit) in terms of miles of travel, which one gets from spending an hour (a cost in time) of traveling (at this velocity).\n\nA set of sequential indices i may be used to enumerate elements (or subsets) of a set of ratios under study.  For example, in finance, one could define i by assigning consecutive integers to companies, to political subdivisions (such as states), to different investments, etc.  The reason for using indices i, is so a set of ratios (i=0,N) can be used in an equation so as to calculate a function of the rates such as an average of a set of ratios.  For example, the average velocity found from the set of v<sub>i</sub>'s mentioned above.  Finding averages may involve using weighted averages and possibly using the [[Harmonic mean]].\n\nA ratio r=a/b has both a numerator a and a denominator b. a and/or b may be a [[real number]] or [[integer]].  The inverse of a ratio r is 1/r  = b/a.\n\nRates occur in many areas of real life. For example:\n''How fast are you driving?'' Miles per hour is a rate. ''What interest does your savings account pay you?'' Interest paid / year is a rate.\n\n==Rate of change{{anchor|Of change}}==\nConsider the case where the numerator <math>f</math> of a rate is a function <math>f(a)</math> where <math>a</math> happens to be the denominator of the rate <math>\\delta f/\\delta a</math>.
