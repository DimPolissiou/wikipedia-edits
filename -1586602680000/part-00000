{"title_page": "List of largest sports contracts", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of the largest sports contracts'''. These figures include [[signing bonus]]es but exclude options, [[buyout]]s, and endorsement deals. This list does not reflect the highest annual salaries or career earnings, only the top 100 largest contracts and thus is largely limited to athletes in [[team sports]] and [[auto racing]]. Athletes in [[individual sport]]s, such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[boxing]], are not employed by a team and usually earn money primarily through event winnings.  This list also does not necessarily reflect actual money collected by the athletes, since some contracts are eventually terminated (usually due to an athlete either retiring or invoking their opt-out clause).\n\nEntries in this list also require an individual citation of the contract, so a number of the highest salaried athletes (according to ''[[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|Forbes]]'') are not included as their contract details have not been officially confirmed, including the likes of [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Roger Federer]], [[Lionel Messi]], and [[Lewis Hamilton]]. This also skews the list towards sports with salary caps where salaries are therefore public knowledge and easy to cite.\n\nThe contract figures referenced below are presented at face value and do not reflect potential pre or post-tax treatments. For example, contracts with European sports teams are typically quoted on a post-tax basis.\n\n==Largest sports contracts==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\"\n!

These figures include [[signing bonus]]es but exclude options, [[buyout]]s, and endorsement deals. This list does not reflect the highest annual salaries or career earnings, only the top 100 largest contracts and thus is largely limited to athletes in [[team sports]] and [[auto racing]]. Athletes in [[individual sport]]s, such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[boxing]], are not employed by a team and usually earn money primarily through event winnings.  This list also does not necessarily reflect actual money collected by the athletes, since some contracts are eventually terminated (usually due to an athlete either retiring or invoking their opt-out clause).\n\nEntries in this list also require an individual citation of the contract, so a number of the highest salaried athletes (according to ''[[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|Forbes]]'') are not included as their contract details have not been officially confirmed, including the likes of [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Roger Federer]], [[Lionel Messi]], and [[Lewis Hamilton]]. This also skews the list towards sports with salary caps where salaries are therefore public knowledge and easy to cite.\n\nThe contract figures referenced below are presented at face value and do not reflect potential pre or post-tax treatments. For example, contracts with European sports teams are typically quoted on a post-tax basis.\n\n==Largest sports contracts==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\"\n!

The platform buildings and goods shed are largely intact. The Woodlawn mine loader is intrusive on the heritage precinct.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nTarago Railway Precinct is of state significance as a significant Victorian period railway precinct that retains several original or early items from the 1880s including the 1884 roadside station building and the {{circa|1884}} goods shed. The extant railway buildings and structures form an important landmark for the small town at Tarago and are important elements within the wider townscape. The station building and goods shed are good representative examples of a series of similar items located on the Main Southern Line and on the Bombala Line.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\nTarago railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has historic significance through its ability to demonstrate the late 19th Century development of the NSW railways. The site includes several items dating from the opening of the line at Tarago in 1884 and demonstrates the layout of a late 19th Century railway precinct.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has aesthetic significance as a railway precinct that retains several original items that demonstrate railway design in the 1880s. The 1884 station building is a fine example of a Victorian third class roadside station building with fabric and fine detailing typical of the period. The railway buildings, structures and the site are important elements within the wider townscape of Tarago.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe site is of social significance to the local community on account of its lengthy association for providing an important source of employment, trade and social interaction for the local area. The site is significant for its ability to contribute to the local community's sense of place, is a distinctive feature of the daily life of many community members, and provides a connection to the local community's past.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe station building has representative significance as a fine example of a third class, brick standard roadside station building, similar in design to station buildings at Bungendore, [[Michelago]] and other locations in NSW. The goods shed is also a good representative example of a standard late 19th century goods shed. The collection of buildings demonstrate widespread late 19th and early 20th Century railway customs, activities and design in NSW and are representative of similar items that are found at other railway sites across the state.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Tarago Railway Station group|dno=5012238|id=01262|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Transport for New South Wales railway stations|Southern Region=y|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1884]]\n[[Category:Regional railway stations in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox station\n|name                = Tarago\n|type                = \n|style               = NSW TrainLink regional\n|image               = TaragoRailwayStation.JPG\n|image_size          = \n|image_caption       = Southbound view in July 2007\n|address             = Tarago Road, [[Tarago]]\n|country             = \n|coordinates         = {{coord|-35.0700|149.6513|region:AU-NSW_type:railwaystation|format=dms|display=inline}} \n|elevation           = \n|distance            = 282.51 kilometres from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]]\n|line                = [[Bombala railway line, New South Wales|Bombala]]\n|other               = \n|structure           = Ground\n|platform            = 1\n|depth               = \n|levels              = \n|tracks              = 3\n|parking             = \n|bicycle             = \n|baggage_check       = \n|opened              = 3 January 1884\n|closed              = \n|rebuilt             = \n|electrified         = \n|disabled            = \n|code                = [[List of New South Wales railway station codes|TGO]]\n|owned               = [[RailCorp]]\n|operator            = [[NSW TrainLink]]\n|zone                = \n|former              = \n|passengers          = \n|pass_year           = \n|pass_percent        = \n|pass_system         = \n|mpassengers         = \n|services            = \n{{s-rail|title=NSW TrainLink}}\n{{s-line|system=NSW TrainLink|line=Southern|branch=Canberra Xplorer|previous=Bungendore|next=Goulburn}}\n|map_locator         =\n|web                 = \n|route_map           = \n|map_state           = }}\n\n'''Tarago railway station''' is a heritate-listed railway station located on the [[Bombala railway line|Bombala line]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia.

The extant railway buildings and structures form an important landmark for the small town at Tarago and are important elements within the wider townscape. The station building and goods shed are good representative examples of a series of similar items located on the Main Southern Line and on the Bombala Line.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\nTarago railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has historic significance through its ability to demonstrate the late 19th Century development of the NSW railways. The site includes several items dating from the opening of the line at Tarago in 1884 and demonstrates the layout of a late 19th Century railway precinct.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has aesthetic significance as a railway precinct that retains several original items that demonstrate railway design in the 1880s. The 1884 station building is a fine example of a Victorian third class roadside station building with fabric and fine detailing typical of the period. The railway buildings, structures and the site are important elements within the wider townscape of Tarago.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe site is of social significance to the local community on account of its lengthy association for providing an important source of employment, trade and social interaction for the local area. The site is significant for its ability to contribute to the local community's sense of place, is a distinctive feature of the daily life of many community members, and provides a connection to the local community's past.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe station building has representative significance as a fine example of a third class, brick standard roadside station building, similar in design to station buildings at Bungendore, [[Michelago]] and other locations in NSW. The goods shed is also a good representative example of a standard late 19th century goods shed. The collection of buildings demonstrate widespread late 19th and early 20th Century railway customs, activities and design in NSW and are representative of similar items that are found at other railway sites across the state.<ref name=nswshr-1262/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Tarago Railway Station group|dno=5012238|id=01262|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Transport for New South Wales railway stations|Southern Region=y|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1884]]\n[[Category:Regional railway stations in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n", "name_user": "Fork99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed minor typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarago_railway_station"}

As engineered by [[Alec Issigonis]], the compact arrangement located the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sump &mdash; despite disparate lubricating requirements &mdash; and had the engine's radiator mounted to the side of the engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine.

Also in 1971, the Sport Coup\u00e9, an all-new coup\u00e9 body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the Turin Show. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines.\n\nThe 128 range underwent a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1972, featuring a revised grille. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body. In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coup\u00e9. In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978.

By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout's disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential [[torque steer]], the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.\n\nThe compact and efficient layout &mdash; a transversely-mounted engine with transmission mounted beside the engine driving the front wheels through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts &mdash; subsequently became common with competitors<ref name=\"lampredi\" /> and arguably an industry standard.<ref name=\"octane\">{{cite web |title=1969-1984 FIAT 128 Saloon |publisher=Classic and Performance Car |quote=It\u2019s the recipe for technical orthodoxy that has since been adopted by the entire industry. |url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3994 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211929/http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3994 |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe layout was sufficiently flexible that Fiat reconfigured the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the [[Fiat X1/9]].\n\n==Design==\nThe all new 1.1 litre [[Fiat SOHC]] engine, engineered by noted engine designer [[Aurelio Lampredi]], featured an iron block mated to an aluminum head along with a belt-driven single overhead camshaft producing 49&nbsp;hp.<ref name=\"lampredi\">{{cite web |title=Collectible Classic: 1971-1979 Fiat 128 |publisher=Automobile Magazine, August 2012 |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/1208_collectible_classic_1971_1979_fiat_128/}}</ref>\n\nThe 128 was styled similarly to the 124 and 125 and featured rack-and-pinion steering, front disc brakes, independent rear suspension with a transverse leaf spring, and a strut-type front suspension with integral anti-roll bar.<ref name=\"lampredi\" />\n\n[[File:Fiat 128-Mk2 Front-view.JPG|thumb|left|Second series (1976) Fiat 128 with new rectangular headlights]]\nInitially, the 128 was available as a two-door or four-door sedan. At the 1970 [[Turin Motor Show]] a three-door [[station wagon]] model called \"Familiare\" was added to the line-up.<ref name=\"AU71\" /> The car was only available with a 1116&nbsp;cc engine on launch, though the two-door-only 128 Rally edition launched in 1971 used a 1,290&nbsp;cc unit. Also in 1971, the Sport Coup\u00e9, an all-new coup\u00e9 body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the Turin Show. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines.\n\nThe 128 range underwent a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1972, featuring a revised grille. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body. In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coup\u00e9. In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978. In 1980 production of the small three-door station wagon Panorama was dropped from the range and 128 production finally ended in 1985.<ref name=Greats/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Road test==\nThe British \"[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]\" magazine tested a Fiat 128 in April 1970, shortly after its UK launch.  The car had a top speed of {{convert|85.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15.5 seconds. An \"overall\" fuel consumption of {{convert|27.5|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded.

Despite the greater opportunities BBC radio offered to women, gender discrimination remained: Line was one of six new producers, three men and three women, but the three permanent staff posts went to the men and the three temporary posts to the women; the rationale for this was that the men probably had families to support while the women had only themselves and were likely to get married eventually.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n\nLine was, however, delighted to be a producer \"in the last glow of the golden days of Radio.

She was Chief Assistant to [[David Hatch]], who was Controller of Radio 2 and then of Radio 4. An especially challenging task in this role was the scheduling of Radio 4 bulletins on the [[Falklands War]], which Line discharged successfully. Throughout the war Radio 4 kept all its listeners and gained many hundreds of thousands more who still used radio, rather than television, as their primary information source.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n\nIn late 1985, Line returned to Radio 2 as the network's first woman Head of Music; Bryant Marriott was the Controller at that time. Line aimed to clarify the station's musical identity in terms that would enhance its appeal to older listeners; her keywords were \"melody, familiarity, excellence and breadth\"'.<ref>Carmody, Robin (28 November 2003).\n[https://www.transdiffusion.org/2003/11/28/outofthelight2  \"Out of the Light 2\"]. Retrieved 4 May 2018.</ref> Line was quoted in the ''Times'' (21 January 1986) as saying: \u201cRadio 2 had been drifting about without a clear music policy. The youth audience has been overindulged and now it is time to return to the over-40s. There are an awful lot of over-40s in the country and perhaps some of them have given us up in the past\".<ref name=\"Music\">\"Music for over-40s on Radio 2\", ''The Times'' (21 January 1986), p. 5.</ref>  Big band and jazz would predominate on Mondays, \"big strings sounds\" and a series about past and present musical stars on Tuesdays, and folk music on Wednesdays. Line's focus was on daytime programming, when Radio 2 had the most listeners, but she did recruit [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], an actor and once the singer with the group [[Manfred Mann]], to host a new blues and country music series in the evening.<ref name=\"Music\"/>\n\nNot everyone welcomed the over-40s emphasis: DJ [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David Hamilton]], for example, departed from Radio 2 in high dudgeon, calling the network \"geriatric\" and complaining that \"there\u2019s only so much [[Max Bygraves]] and [[Vera Lynn]] you can play\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Aylett|first=Glenn|url=https://www.transdiffusion.org/2005/01/01/justforyou|title=Just for You|work=Transdiffusion|date=1 January 2005|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> But Line's changes proved popular with a substantial audience.\n \nOne of Line's most notable achievements in this phase of her career was to persuade Bryant Marriott that the network should hire [[Derek Jameson]], whom she had seen on a BBC 2 TV programme called ''Do They Mean Us?''  and thought would be the person for radio. Jameson began presenting Radio 2's breakfast show on 7 April 1986; in mid-May the BBC declared that he had \"increased the number of listeners by 500,000, or 25 per cent\" and Jameson himself was reported as claiming that listeners' letters \"were coming in at the rate of 500 a week and all but a handful approved of his style\"<ref>''Times'' (20 May 1986). \"Jameson's style sets radio record\".</ref>\n\nAt the end of the decade Line succeeded Bryant Marriott as Controller.\n\n==Line as Controller==\nOn 1 January 1990, Line took up her post as Controller of Radio 2.<ref name=\"Times31089\"/> Her aim was \"to make Radio 2 as good as I possibly could, and the top station\"'.<ref name=\"Farrall\"/> Over the next five years she turned it from a network that had been \"something of a joke\" into one that started to be \"taken much more seriously\", as Robert Hanks put it in an [[The Independent|Independent]] article in 1996.<ref name=\"Hanks\"/>\n\nLine quickly established her authority and stamped her vision on the station: in her first three months, she moved Brian Matthew from the ''Round Midnight'' slot he had occupied for 12 years to the Saturday morning programme ''[[Sounds of the '60s]]'', and dismissed [[Adrian Love]]. A ''[[Daily Mail]]'' article called her \"The axe woman of the airwaves\" and drew attention to the fact that she had even shortened the show presented by her own husband, Jim Lloyd, from 90 to 60 minutes. The article also, however, quoted Line's rationale for her actions: \"I do not make decisions on a whim ... there's a good reason for everything\". She argued that Brian Matthew's show \"was no longer relevant to the 1990s\" and that his audience was \"extremely loyal\" but \"small\", while Adrian Love's audience figures were falling and his removal would enable Line to extend [[Gloria Hunniford]]'s very popular programme and \"bring in more 'stars'\"<ref>Ross, Deborah (22 March 1990). \"The axe woman of the airwaves\". ''Daily Mail'', p. 7.</ref>\n \nAs Controller, Line pursued a programming policy that combined music aimed at listeners in their fifties, as she herself was at the time, with a thrice-weekly arts series, and discussions on contemporary issues. She recruited [[Sheridan Morley]] to present a weekend arts programme that, in Sue Gaisford's view, proved to be as good as, and sometimes better than, its competitors on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] and Radio 4;<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/> moved Derek Jameson, in January 1992, from the breakfast show to a four-day-a-week late-night slot between 10.30pm and 12.00 midnight with his wife, Ellen; persuaded [[Terry Wogan]] to return to Radio 2 in January 1993, where he took over the breakfast show ''Good Morning UK!'' (duly renamed ''Wake Up to Wogan'') from the Australian broadcaster [[Brian Hayes (broadcaster)|Brian Hayes]]; inaugurated Hayes's own weekly phone-in current affairs programme ''Hayes over Britain'', and his Saturday and  Sunday slots; secured [[Michael Aspel]]'s services for a Sunday morning programme;<ref name=\"Farrall\"/> and, in 1993, brought in [[Sarah Kennedy]] to front the early morning show ''The Dawn Patrol''.\n\nThe BBC Annual Report in July 1994 praised Radio 2 for keeping its audience share the year before in spite of greater competition and for retaining the loyalty of its older listeners.<ref name=\"Hanks\"/> Radio Joint Audience Research ([[RAJAR]]) figures released on 24 October 1994 showed it had become Britain's most popular radio station in terms of audience share - 12.9 per cent compared to its nearest rival, Radio 1, which had 11.8 per cent (though the latter still had more listeners).<ref>\"Media / Talk of the Trade: Radio 2 is tops\", ''The Independent'' (25 October 1994).</ref>\n\nDuring 1994, Radio 2 featured appearances by a constellation of stars - for example, [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]], [[Cybill Shepherd]] and Dame [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], some of whom performed exclusively for the network. It also offered a series of classic musicals such as ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'',<ref name=\"BBC94\">\"1994: A year in the life of BBC Radio 2\" (London: BBC Radio 2.</ref> implementing one of Line's clear policy objectives: \"In the same way that Radio 3 is the home of the opera, we have consciously decided that Radio 2 is to be the home of the musical\".<ref name=\"Farrall\"/>\n\nRadio 2 also offered programmes tackling controversial and difficult topics such as testicular cancer and prostate problems, in the July 1994 campaign ''Man Matters'', and domestic violence, in the October 1994 programme ''When Home Is Where The Hurt Is''.<ref name=\"BBC94\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1995, Radio 2 was named UK Station of the Year at the [[Sony Radio Awards]].<ref>Brown, Maggie. \"'Cinderella of radio' is station of the year\". ''The Independent'' (27 April 1995).</ref> In the same year, Line was elected a Fellow of the [[Radio Academy]]<ref>\"The Line Family\", [http://line.david.free.fr/fml.html \"Frances Mary Line OBE]. Retrieved 6 May 2018.</ref> and in the [[1996 New Year Honours]] list she was appointed OBE for services to broadcasting.\n \nLine knew that her network lost around 200,000 listeners annually to what was called in the BBC \"Radio Grim Reaper\" and she aimed to attract younger people to Radio 2 by scheduling \"access points\" for \"the Beatles generation\" - itself, of course, growing older - while retaining the loyalty of its core audience.<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/> She could still, however, sometimes anger segments of that core audience. Her temporary substitution of a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] season for programmes by two much-loved Sunday presenters - [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]] and [[Alan Dell]] - provoked a phalanx of elderly listeners to picket Broadcasting House in protest, bearing banners declaring \"LINE IS OUT OF ORDER\".<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n\nHate mail was frequent, as Line recalled: \"I've lost count of the number of letters which began 'You cow... ' or 'Are You completely mad...'\".<ref name=\"Forty\"/> Once when she moved [[David Jacobs (broadcaster)|David Jacobs]]'s programme, she received a picture of herself, cut from a newspaper, with her eyes poked out.<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/>\n\nLine's husband Jim Lloyd thought she received more insults because she was a woman; she was also menaced by a stalker and, for over five years, by a never-identified person completing small advertisements in her name so that she received a hearing aid and then several daily phone calls from people selling insurance or double glazing or proposing to deliver concrete to her home.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n \nThere were also, however, many accolades from listeners, for instance from \"Norm\", who cut out cartoon strips of [[Garfield the Cat]], whited out the words in the balloons, and put in his own texts praising Radio 2. A \"Mr S\" from Hull invoked [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in a laudatory verse:\n<poem>\nFor she doth teach the torches to burn bright\nAnd entertains me late into the night\nWith harmony, and melody and mirth\nOn Radio 2 - the greatest show on earth.<ref name=\"Forty\"/></poem>\n\nLine retired from \"the greatest show on earth\" in February 1996<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/> and [[James Moir|Jim Moir]] replaced her.<ref name=\"Hanks\"/>\n\n==Life after retirement==\nLine moved with her husband to Eastbourne, where she had once enjoyed the concert parties that contributed to her desire to enter show business. Under her married name of Frances Lloyd, she is a Vice-President of the Eastbourne Society and a member of the Eastbourne Ashridge Circle, possibly Britain's largest lecture society; she has been a Director of Marlborough Court (Eastbourne) Ltd since 2012<ref>Companies House.

She went on to work with many popular music stars of the time, including [[Victor Sylvester]], [[Edmundo Ros]], the [[Oscar Rabin Band]], [[Cyril Stapleton]] and [[Acker Bilk]].<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n\nWhen the Light Programme morphed into Radio 2 in 1967, Line became a producer of the series ''Roundabout''<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/62ed01231ae847caa70d5e197c42a089 ''Radio Times'' (3 October 1967)].</ref> and then produced ''Folk on Friday'', introduced by her future husband, Jim Lloyd, who had an extensive knowledge of the folk scene.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/48488315ea0044f08749c4b1ab2dc3d8 ''Radio Times'' (10 April 1970)];</ref>; <ref name=\"Forty\"/> Line and Lloyd would marry in 1972; she has two step-children from Lloyd's first marriage.\n\nLine also produced [[Tony Brandon]]'s afternoon show;<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/516fe19ac06e4676813d7408d65a3d48 ''Radio Times''(8 July 1974)].</ref> [[Sam Costa]]'s late afternoon show;<ref>; [http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/70f7099ed07f4d26b749d38e96bd7081 ''Radio Times'' (20 October 1975)].</ref> [[Joe \"Mr Piano\" Henderson]]'s afternoon show;  early morning shows hosted by [[Tom Edwards (broadcaster)|Tom Edwards]]<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/9695293e0add44a4bed163df7fa6fd6a ''Radio Times'' (12 March 1977)].</ref> and [[Colin Berry]];<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c3896f6698b64a239aa93593f1059306 ''Radio Times'' (14 March 1977)].</ref> and [[John Churchill Dunn|John Dunn]]'s ''Drivetime''.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/0181063a1cec4df4b8d20a4a68136766 ''Radio Times'' (18 April 1977)].</ref>\n\n==From Chief Assistant to Controller==\nBy 1980, Line had decided to move from production into management; she became a Chief Assistant, a Controller's right-hand person with particular responsibility for network scheduling. She was Chief Assistant to [[David Hatch]], who was Controller of Radio 2 and then of Radio 4. An especially challenging task in this role was the scheduling of Radio 4 bulletins on the [[Falklands War]], which Line discharged successfully. Throughout the war Radio 4 kept all its listeners and gained many hundreds of thousands more who still used radio, rather than television, as their primary information source.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n\nIn late 1985, Line returned to Radio 2 as the network's first woman Head of Music; Bryant Marriott was the Controller at that time. Line aimed to clarify the station's musical identity in terms that would enhance its appeal to older listeners; her keywords were \"melody, familiarity, excellence and breadth\"'.<ref>Carmody, Robin (28 November 2003).\n[https://www.transdiffusion.org/2003/11/28/outofthelight2  \"Out of the Light 2\"]. Retrieved 4 May 2018.</ref> Line was quoted in the ''Times'' (21 January 1986) as saying: \u201cRadio 2 had been drifting about without a clear music policy. The youth audience has been overindulged and now it is time to return to the over-40s. There are an awful lot of over-40s in the country and perhaps some of them have given us up in the past\".<ref name=\"Music\">\"Music for over-40s on Radio 2\", ''The Times'' (21 January 1986), p. 5.</ref>  Big band and jazz would predominate on Mondays, \"big strings sounds\" and a series about past and present musical stars on Tuesdays, and folk music on Wednesdays. Line's focus was on daytime programming, when Radio 2 had the most listeners, but she did recruit [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], an actor and once the singer with the group [[Manfred Mann]], to host a new blues and country music series in the evening.<ref name=\"Music\"/>\n\nNot everyone welcomed the over-40s emphasis: DJ [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David Hamilton]], for example, departed from Radio 2 in high dudgeon, calling the network \"geriatric\" and complaining that \"there\u2019s only so much [[Max Bygraves]] and [[Vera Lynn]] you can play\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Aylett|first=Glenn|url=https://www.transdiffusion.org/2005/01/01/justforyou|title=Just for You|work=Transdiffusion|date=1 January 2005|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> But Line's changes proved popular with a substantial audience.\n \nOne of Line's most notable achievements in this phase of her career was to persuade Bryant Marriott that the network should hire [[Derek Jameson]], whom she had seen on a BBC 2 TV programme called ''Do They Mean Us?''  and thought would be the person for radio. Jameson began presenting Radio 2's breakfast show on 7 April 1986; in mid-May the BBC declared that he had \"increased the number of listeners by 500,000, or 25 per cent\" and Jameson himself was reported as claiming that listeners' letters \"were coming in at the rate of 500 a week and all but a handful approved of his style\"<ref>''Times'' (20 May 1986). \"Jameson's style sets radio record\".</ref> \n\nAt the end of the decade Line succeeded Bryant Marriott as Controller.\n\n==Line as Controller==\nOn 1 January 1990, Line took up her post as Controller of Radio 2.<ref name=\"Times31089\"/> Her aim was \"to make Radio 2 as good as I possibly could, and the top station\"'.<ref name=\"Farrall\"/> Over the next five years she turned it from a network that had been \"something of a joke\" into one that started to be \"taken much more seriously\", as Robert Hanks put it in an [[The Independent|Independent]] article in 1996.<ref name=\"Hanks\"/>  \n\nLine quickly established her authority and stamped her vision on the station: in her first three months, she moved Brian Matthew from the ''Round Midnight'' slot he had occupied for 12 years to the Saturday morning programme ''[[Sounds of the '60s]]'', and dismissed [[Adrian Love]]. A ''[[Daily Mail]]'' article called her \"The axe woman of the airwaves\" and drew attention to the fact that she had even shortened the show presented by her own husband, Jim Lloyd, from 90 to 60 minutes. The article also, however, quoted Line's rationale for her actions: \"I do not make decisions on a whim ... there's a good reason for everything\". She argued that Brian Matthew's show \"was no longer relevant to the 1990s\" and that his audience was \"extremely loyal\" but \"small\", while Adrian Love's audience figures were falling and his removal would enable Line to extend [[Gloria Hunniford]]'s very popular programme and \"bring in more 'stars'\"<ref>Ross, Deborah (22 March 1990). \"The axe woman of the airwaves\". ''Daily Mail'', p. 7.</ref>\n \nAs Controller, Line pursued a programming policy that combined music aimed at listeners in their fifties, as she herself was at the time, with a thrice-weekly arts series, and discussions on contemporary issues. She recruited [[Sheridan Morley]] to present a weekend arts programme that, in Sue Gaisford's view, proved to be as good as, and sometimes better than, its competitors on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] and Radio 4;<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/> moved Derek Jameson, in January 1992, from the breakfast show to a four-day-a-week late-night slot between 10.30pm and 12.00 midnight with his wife, Ellen; persuaded [[Terry Wogan]] to return to Radio 2 in January 1993, where he took over the breakfast show ''Good Morning UK!'' (duly renamed ''Wake Up to Wogan'') from the Australian broadcaster [[Brian Hayes (broadcaster)|Brian Hayes]]; inaugurated Hayes's own weekly phone-in current affairs programme ''Hayes over Britain'', and his Saturday and  Sunday slots; secured [[Michael Aspel]]'s services for a Sunday morning programme;<ref name=\"Farrall\"/> and, in 1993, brought in [[Sarah Kennedy]] to front the early morning show ''The Dawn Patrol''. \n\nThe BBC Annual Report in July 1994 praised Radio 2 for keeping its audience share the year before in spite of greater competition and for retaining the loyalty of its older listeners.<ref name=\"Hanks\"/> Radio Joint Audience Research ([[RAJAR]]) figures released on 24 October 1994 showed it had become Britain's most popular radio station in terms of audience share - 12.9 per cent compared to its nearest rival, Radio 1, which had 11.8 per cent (though the latter still had more listeners).<ref>\"Media / Talk of the Trade: Radio 2 is tops\", ''The Independent'' (25 October 1994).</ref> \n\nDuring 1994, Radio 2 featured appearances by a constellation of stars - for example, [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]], [[Cybill Shepherd]] and Dame [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], some of whom performed exclusively for the network. It also offered a series of classic musicals such as ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''<ref name=\"BBC94\">\"1994: A year in the life of BBC Radio 2\" (London: BBC Radio 2.</ref>, implementing one of Line's clear policy objectives: \"In the same way that Radio 3 is the home of the opera, we have consciously decided that Radio 2 is to be the home of the musical\".<ref name=\"Farrall\"/> \n\nRadio 2 also offered programmes tackling controversial and difficult topics such as testicular cancer and prostate problems, in the July 1994 campaign ''Man Matters'', and domestic violence, in the October 1994 programme ''When Home Is Where The Hurt Is''.<ref name=\"BBC94\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1995, Radio 2 was named UK Station of the Year at the [[Sony Radio Awards]].<ref>Brown, Maggie. \"'Cinderella of radio' is station of the year\". ''The Independent'' (27 April 1995).</ref>. In the same year, Line was elected a Fellow of the [[Radio Academy]]<ref>\"The Line Family\", [http://line.david.free.fr/fml.html \"Frances Mary Line OBE]. Retrieved 6 May 2018.</ref> and in the [[1996 New Year Honours]] list she was appointed OBE for services to broadcasting.\n \nLine knew that her network lost around 200,000 listeners annually to what was called in the BBC \"Radio Grim Reaper\" and she aimed to attract younger people to Radio 2 by scheduling \"access points\" for \"the Beatles generation\" - itself, of course, growing older - while retaining the loyalty of its core audience.<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/> She could still, however, sometimes anger segments of that core audience. Her temporary substitution of a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] season for programmes by two much-loved Sunday presenters - [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]] and [[Alan Dell]] - provoked a phalanx of elderly listeners to picket Broadcasting House in protest, bearing banners declaring \"LINE IS OUT OF ORDER\".<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n\nHate mail was frequent, as Line recalled: \"I've lost count of the number of letters which began 'You cow... ' or 'Are You completely mad...'\".<ref name=\"Forty\"/> Once when she moved [[David Jacobs (broadcaster)|David Jacobs]]'s programme, she received a picture of herself, cut from a newspaper, with her eyes poked out.<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/>\n\nLine's husband Jim Lloyd thought she received more insults because she was a woman; she was also menaced by a stalker and, for over five years, by a never-identified person completing small advertisements in her name so that she received a hearing aid and then several daily phone calls from people selling insurance or double glazing or proposing to deliver concrete to her home.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>\n \nThere were also, however, many accolades from listeners, for instance from \"Norm\", who cut out cartoon strips of [[Garfield the Cat]], whited out the words in the balloons, and put in his own texts praising Radio 2. A \"Mr S\" from Hull invoked [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in a laudatory verse:\n<poem>\nFor she doth teach the torches to burn bright\nAnd entertains me late into the night\nWith harmony, and melody and mirth\nOn Radio 2 - the greatest show on earth.<ref name=\"Forty\"/></poem>\n\nLine retired from \"the greatest show on earth\" in February 1996<ref name=\"Gaisford070595\"/> and [[James Moir|Jim Moir]] replaced her.<ref name=\"Hanks\"/>\n\n==Life after retirement==\nLine moved with her husband to Eastbourne, where she had once enjoyed the concert parties that contributed to her desire to enter show business. Under her married name of Frances Lloyd, she is a Vice-President of the Eastbourne Society and a member of the Eastbourne Ashridge Circle, possibly Britain's largest lecture society; she has been a Director of Marlborough Court (Eastbourne) Ltd since 2012<ref>Companies House. [https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03910201/officers.html\"Marlborough Court (Eastbourne) Limited\"].

The Cathedral rebuilding project was completed in full by March 13, 1868, and rededicated four days later on St. Patrick's Day by Archbishop McCloskey, and assisted by the pastor of the Cathedral, Father William Starrs.

However, the Cardinal encouraged the boy in his vocation after visiting with him. In response, the General condemned McCloskey in a [[St. Louis, Missouri]] newspaper in offensive terms and accused him of robbing him of a son.

[[Union representative|Shop steward]] Jack puts Stan in charge of the canteen. Stan has to find a cook and gives the job to Mrs Sharma, his colleague's wife, after telling Stan that she had previously worked as a cook in a bus depot. On the next day, Stan realises that Mrs Sharma can't speak English and previously worked for an Indian bus depot, not an English bus depot. The Indian food she gives the busmen isn't the food they want, so Stan fires Mrs Sharma and gives the job to Olive, who is helped by Mum. They were unable to cook anything, so Stan goes to a local fish and chip shop and buys the food for the busmen there. The management take control of the canteen again after the canteen has lost more money than ever before as a result of Stan's actions.{{sfn|Fisher|2011|p=56}}{{sfn|Walker|2009|p=31}}\n|LineColor=ffe699\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|On the Buses (series 1)\n|EpisodeNumber=7\n|EpisodeNumber2=7\n|Title=The Darts Match\n|DirectedBy=Stuart Allen\n|WrittenBy=Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1969|4|11|df=yes}}\n|ShortSummary=The clippies Iris and Jenny challenge Stan and Jack to a darts match, with bets being placed on the result.
