Their 21st-place finish in the 2008\u201309 season meant it was their sixth successive season playing in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. Their campaign ended disappointingly as they were relegated to [[Football League One|League One]] with 11 wins, 8 draws, and 27 losses from 46 matches. The club exited both domestic cup competitions at the first stage, being eliminated by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]] and by [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the first round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. The club changed managers in December due to a string of poor results as [[Paul Sturrock]] was replaced by [[Paul Mariner]].\n\nThe club began their league campaign with two draws, but defeat by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] marked the beginning of a seven-game losing streak. Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner. Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures during the Christmas period, including a 4\u20131 win against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]; their best of the season. The club signed [[Damien Johnson]] in the winter transfer window from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and made a number of signings on loan, including [[Kenny Cooper]] and [[David Stockdale]], in order to try to improve their league position. A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February, which prompted Mariner to make more signings.\n\nArgyle lost three of their next nine matches to give themselves a chance of avoiding relegation, but their win at [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] proved to be the last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and away to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] left the club on the brink of a return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] won 2\u20130 at [[Home Park]] to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on the final day of the season, eight points adrift of safety. [[Jamie Mackie]] finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain [[Carl Fletcher (Welsh footballer)|Carl Fletcher]] was voted [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.

Their 21st-place finish in the 2008\u201309 season meant it was their sixth successive season playing in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. Their campaign ended disappointingly as they were relegated to [[Football League One|League One]] with 11 wins, 8 draws, and 27 losses from 46 matches. The club exited both domestic cup competitions at the first stage, being eliminated by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]] and by [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the first round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. The club changed managers in December due to a string of poor results as [[Paul Sturrock]] was replaced by [[Paul Mariner]].\n\nThe club began their league campaign with two draws, but defeat by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] marked the beginning of a seven-game losing streak. Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner. Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures during the Christmas period, including a 4\u20131 win against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]; their best of the season. The club signed [[Damien Johnson]] in the winter transfer window from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and made a number of signings on loan, including [[Kenny Cooper]] and [[David Stockdale]], in order to try to improve their league position. A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February, which prompted Mariner to make more signings.\n\nArgyle lost three of their next nine matches to give themselves a chance of avoiding relegation, but their win at [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] proved to be the last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and away to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] left the club on the brink of a return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] won 2\u20130 at [[Home Park]] to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on the final day of the season, eight points adrift of safety. [[Jamie Mackie]] finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain [[Carl Fletcher (Welsh footballer)|Carl Fletcher]] was voted [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.

{"title_page": "Rainbow table", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Rainbow Codes}}\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\nA '''rainbow table''' is a [[precomputed]] [[Lookup table|table]] for reversing [[cryptographic hash function]]s, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a [[password]] (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a [[space\u2013time tradeoff]], using less computer processing time and more storage than a [[brute-force attack]] which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple [[lookup table]] with one entry per hash. Use of a [[key derivation function]] that employs a [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] makes this \nattack infeasible.\n\nRainbow tables were invented by Philippe Oechslin<ref name=\"ophpaper\"/> as an application of an earlier, simpler algorithm by [[Martin Hellman]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hellman | first1 =  M.

Because the tables are vulnerable to theft, storing the plaintext password is dangerous. Most databases, therefore, store a [[cryptographic hash]] of a user's password in the database. In such a system, no one &ndash; including the authentication system &ndash; can determine what a user's password is by merely looking at the value stored in the database. Instead, when a user enters a password for authentication, the system computes the hash value for the provided password, and that hash value is compared to the stored hash for that user. Authentication is successful if the two hashes match.\n\nAfter gathering a password hash, using the said hash as a password would fail since the authentication system would hash it a second time.  To learn a user's password, a password that produces the same hashed value must be found, usually through a brute-force or dictionary attack.\n\nRainbow tables are one type of tool that have been developed to derive a password by looking only at a hashed value.\n\nRainbow tables are not always needed as there are more straightforward methods of hash reversal available. [[Brute-force attack]]s and [[dictionary attack]]s are the most straightforward methods available. However, these are not adequate for systems that use long passwords because of the difficulty of storing all the options available and searching through such an extensive database to perform a reverse lookup of a hash.\n\nTo address this issue of scale, reverse lookup tables were generated that stored only a smaller selection of hashes that when reversed could make long chains of passwords.  Although the reverse lookup of a hash in a chained table takes more computational time, the lookup table itself can be much smaller, so hashes of longer passwords can be stored.  Rainbow tables are a refinement of this chaining technique and provide a solution to a problem called chain collisions.\n\n==Precomputed hash chains==\n{{For|hash chains other than what is mentioned here|hash chain}}\nSuppose we have a password hash function H and a finite set of passwords P. The goal is to precompute a data structure that, given any output ''h'' of the hash function, can either locate an element ''p'' in P such that H(''p'') = ''h'', or determine that there is no such ''p'' in P. The simplest way to do this is compute H(''p'') for all ''p'' in P, but then storing the table requires [[Big-O notation|\u0398]](|P|''n'') bits of space, where |P| is the size of the set P and ''n'' is the size of an output of H, which is prohibitive for large |P|.\n\nHash chains are a technique for decreasing this space requirement. The idea is to define a ''reduction function'' R that maps hash values back into values in P. Note, however, that the reduction function is not actually an inverse of the hash function, but rather a different function with a swapped [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] of the hash function. By alternating the hash function with the reduction function, ''chains'' of alternating passwords and hash values are formed. For example, if P were the set of lowercase alphabetic 6-character passwords, and hash values were 32 bits long, a chain might look like this:\n\n:<math>{\\color{Red}\\mathtt{aaaaaa}}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{281DAF40}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{sgfnyd}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{920ECF10}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,{\\color{Violet}\\mathtt{kiebgt}}</math>\n\nThe only requirement for the reduction function is to be able to return a \"plain text\" value in a specific size.\n\nTo generate the table, we choose a random set of ''initial passwords'' from P, compute chains of some fixed length ''k'' for each one, and store ''only'' the first and last password in each chain. The first password is called the ''starting point'' and the last one is called the ''endpoint''. In the example chain above, \"aaaaaa\" would be the starting point and \"kiebgt\" would be the endpoint, and none of the other passwords (or the hash values) would be stored.\n\nNow, given a hash value ''h'' that we want to invert (find the corresponding password for), compute a chain starting with ''h'' by applying R, then H, then R, and so on. If at any point we observe a value matching one of the endpoints in the table, we get the corresponding starting point and use it to recreate the chain. There's a good chance that this chain will contain the value ''h'', and if so, the immediately preceding value in the chain is the password ''p'' that we seek.\n\nFor example, if we're given the hash {{mono|920ECF10}}, we would compute its chain by first applying R:\n\n:<math>\\mathtt{920ECF10}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,{\\color{Violet}\\mathtt{kiebgt}}</math>\n\nSince \"{{mono|kiebgt}}\" is one of the endpoints in our table, we then take the corresponding starting password \"{{mono|aaaaaa}}\" and follow its chain until 920ECF10 is reached:\n\n:<math>{\\color{Red}\\mathtt{aaaaaa}}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{281DAF40}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{sgfnyd}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{920ECF10}</math>\n\nThus, the password is \"{{mono|sgfnyd}}\" (or a different password that has the same hash value).\n\nNote however that this chain does not ''always'' contain the hash value ''h''; it may so happen that the chain starting at ''h'' merges with a chain having a different starting point. For example, we may be given a hash value FB107E70, and when we follow its chain, we get kiebgt:\n\n:<math>\\mathtt{FB107E70}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{bvtdll}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{0EE80890}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,{\\color{Violet}\\mathtt{kiebgt}}</math>\n\nBut {{mono|FB107E70}} is not in the chain starting at \"aaaaaa\". This is called a ''false alarm''. In this case, we ignore the match and continue to extend the chain of ''h'' looking for another match. If the chain of ''h'' gets extended to length ''k'' with no good matches, then the password was never produced in any of the chains.\n\nThe table content does not depend on the hash value to be inverted. It is created once and then repeatedly used for the lookups unmodified. Increasing the length of the chain decreases the size of the table. It also increases the time required to perform lookups, and this is the time-memory trade-off of the rainbow table. In a simple case of one-item chains, the lookup is very fast, but the table is very big. Once chains get longer, the lookup slows, but the table size goes down.\n\nSimple hash chains have several flaws.  Most serious if at any point two chains ''collide'' (produce the same value), they will merge and consequently the table will not cover as many passwords despite having paid the same computational cost to generate. Because previous chains are not stored in their entirety, this is impossible to detect efficiently. For example, if the third value in chain 3 matches the second value in chain 7, the two chains will cover almost the same sequence of values, but their final values will not be the same. The hash function H is unlikely to produce collisions as it is usually considered an important security feature not to do so, but the reduction function R, because of its need to correctly cover the likely plaintexts, can not be collision resistant.\n\nOther difficulties result from the importance of choosing the correct function for R.  Picking R to be the identity is little better than a brute force approach.  Only when the attacker has a good idea of what the likely plaintexts will be they can choose a function R that makes sure time and space are only used for likely plaintexts, not the entire space of possible passwords.  In effect R shepherds the results of prior hash calculations back to likely plaintexts but this benefit comes with the drawback that R likely won't produce every possible plaintext in the class the attacker wishes to check denying certainty to the attacker that no passwords came from their chosen class. Also it can be difficult to design the function R to match the expected distribution of plaintexts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Rainbow tables ==\nRainbow tables effectively solve the problem of collisions with ordinary hash chains by replacing the single reduction function R with a sequence of related reduction functions R<sub>1</sub> through R<sub>''k''</sub>. In this way, for two chains to collide and merge they must hit the same value ''on the same iteration''. Consequently, the final values in each chain will be identical. A final postprocessing pass can sort the chains in the table and remove any \"duplicate\" chains that have the same final values as other chains. New chains are then generated to fill out the table. These chains are not ''collision-free'' (they may overlap briefly) but they will not merge, drastically reducing the overall number of collisions.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nUsing sequences of reduction functions changes how lookup is done: because the hash value of interest may be found at any location in the chain, it's necessary to generate ''k'' different chains. The first chain assumes the hash value is in the last hash position and just applies R<sub>''k''</sub>; the next chain assumes the hash value is in the second-to-last hash position and applies R<sub>''k''\u22121</sub>, then H, then R<sub>''k''</sub>; and so on until the last chain, which applies all the reduction functions, alternating with H. This creates a new way of producing a false alarm: if we \"guess\" the position of the hash value wrong, we may needlessly evaluate a chain.\n\nAlthough rainbow tables have to follow more chains, they make up for this by having fewer tables: simple hash chain tables cannot grow beyond a certain size without rapidly becoming inefficient due to merging chains; to deal with this, they maintain multiple tables, and each lookup must search through each table. Rainbow tables can achieve similar performance with tables that are ''k'' times larger, allowing them to perform a factor of ''k'' fewer lookups.\n\n===Example===\n#Starting from the hash (\"re3xes\") in the image below, one computes the last reduction used in the table and checks whether the password appears in the last column of the table (step 1).\n#If the test fails (''rambo'' doesn't appear in the table), one computes a chain with the two last reductions (these two reductions are represented at step 2)\n#:Note: If this new test fails again, one continues with 3 reductions, 4 reductions, etc. until the password is found. If no chain contains the password, then the attack has failed.\n# If this test is positive (step 3, ''linux23'' appears at the end of the chain and in the table), the password is retrieved at the beginning of the chain that produces ''linux23''. Here we find ''passwd'' at the beginning of the corresponding chain stored in the table.\n# At this point (step 4), one generates a chain and compares at each iteration the hash with the target hash. The test is valid and we find the hash ''re3xes'' in the chain. The current password (''culture'') is the one that produced the whole chain: the attack is successful.\n\n[[Image:simple_rainbow_search.svg|650px]]\n\nRainbow tables use a refined algorithm with a different reduction function for each \"link\" in a chain, so that when there is a hash collision in two or more chains, the chains will not merge as long as the collision doesn't occur at the same position in each chain. This increases the probability of a correct crack for a given table size, at the cost of squaring the number of steps required per lookup, as the lookup routine now also needs to iterate through the index of the first reduction function used in the chain.<ref name=\"ophpaper\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://lasec.epfl.ch/pub/lasec/doc/Oech03.pdf|title=Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO 2003|last1=Oechslin|first1=P.|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=978-3-540-40674-7|series=[[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]]|volume=2729|location=|pages=617\u2013630|chapter=Making a Faster Cryptanalytic Time-Memory Trade-Off|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_36}}</ref>\n\nRainbow tables are specific to the hash function they were created for e.g., [[MD5]] tables can crack only MD5 hashes. The theory of this technique was invented by Philippe Oechslin<ref>[http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/philippe.shtml Lasecwww.epfl.ch]</ref> as a fast form of [[space\u2013time tradeoff|time/memory tradeoff]],<ref name=\"ophpaper\"/> which he implemented in the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Password cracking|password cracker]] [[Ophcrack]].  The more powerful [[RainbowCrack]] program was later developed that can generate and use rainbow tables for a variety of character sets and hashing algorithms, including [[LM hash]], [[MD5]], and [[SHA-1]].\n\nIn the simple case where the reduction function and the hash function have no collision, given a complete rainbow table (one that makes you sure to find the corresponding password given any hash) the size of the password set |''P''|, the time ''T'' that had been needed to compute the table, the length of the table ''L'' and the average time ''t'' needed to find a password matching a given hash are directly related:{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n:<math>T = |P| </math>\n\n:<math>t = \\frac {|P|}{2L}</math>\n\nThus the 8-character lowercase alphanumeric passwords case (|''P''| \u2243 3&times;10<sup>12</sup>) would be easily tractable with a personal computer while the 16-character lowercase alphanumeric passwords case (|''P''| \u2243 10<sup>25</sup>) would be completely intractable.\n\n==Defense against rainbow tables==\nA rainbow table is ineffective against one-way hashes that include large [[Salt (cryptography)|salts]]. For example, consider a password hash that is generated using the following function (where \"<tt>||</tt>\" is the [[concatenation]] operator):\n\n<code>saltedhash(password) = hash(password || salt)</code>\n\nOr\n\n<code>saltedhash(password) = hash(hash(password) || salt)</code>\n\nThe salt value is not secret and may be generated at random and stored with the password hash. A large salt value prevents precomputation attacks, including rainbow tables, by ensuring that each user's password is hashed uniquely. This means that two users with the same password will have different password hashes (assuming different salts are used). In order to succeed, an attacker needs to precompute tables for each possible salt value. The salt must be large enough, otherwise an attacker can make a table for each salt value. For older [[Crypt (C)|Unix passwords]] which used a 12-bit salt this would require 4096 tables, a significant increase in cost for the attacker, but not impractical with terabyte hard drives.

When stretching is used, the salt, password, and some intermediate hash values are run through the underlying hash function multiple times to increase the computation time required to hash each password.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Ferguson\n  | first = Neils\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=Bruce Schneier\n   | title = Practical Cryptography\n  | publisher = John Wiley & Sons\n  | year = 2003\n  | location = Indianapolis\n  | isbn = 978-0-471-22357-3 }}</ref> For instance, MD5-Crypt uses a 1000 iteration loop that repeatedly feeds the salt, password, and current intermediate hash value back into the underlying MD5 hash function.<ref name=\"alexander\" /> The user's password hash is the concatenation of the salt value (which is not secret) and the final hash.

However, tables can be generated that take into account common ways in which users attempt to choose more secure passwords, such as adding a number or special character. Because of the sizable investment in computing processing, rainbow tables beyond fourteen places in length are not yet common. So, choosing a password that is longer than fourteen characters may force an attacker to resort to brute-force methods.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nSpecific intensive efforts focused on [[LM hash]], an older hash algorithm used by Microsoft, are publicly available. LM hash is particularly vulnerable because passwords longer than 7 characters are broken into two sections, each of which is hashed separately. Choosing a password that is fifteen characters or longer guarantees that an LM hash will not be generated.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299656 How to prevent Windows from storing a LAN manager hash of your password in Active Directory and local SAM databases], [[Microsoft]]</ref>\n\n==Common uses==\nNearly all distributions and variations of [[Unix]], [[Linux]], and [[BSD]] use hashes with salts, though many applications use just a hash (typically [[MD5]]) with no salt.

Tables are usually used in recovering a [[password]] (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a [[space\u2013time tradeoff]], using less computer processing time and more storage than a [[brute-force attack]] which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple [[lookup table]] with one entry per hash. Use of a [[key derivation function]] that employs a [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] makes this \nattack infeasible.\n\nRainbow tables were invented by Philippe Oechslin<ref name=\"ophpaper\"/> as an application of an earlier, simpler algorithm by [[Martin Hellman]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hellman | first1 =  M.

Because the tables are vulnerable to theft, storing the plaintext password is dangerous. Most databases, therefore, store a [[cryptographic hash]] of a user's password in the database. In such a system, no one &ndash; including the authentication system &ndash; can determine what a user's password is by merely looking at the value stored in the database. Instead, when a user enters a password for authentication, the system computes the hash value for the provided password, and that hash value is compared to the stored hash for that user. Authentication is successful if the two hashes match.\n\nAfter gathering a password hash, using the said hash as a password would fail since the authentication system would hash it a second time.  To learn a user's password, a password that produces the same hashed value must be found, usually through a brute-force or dictionary attack.\n\nRainbow tables are one type of tool that have been developed to derive a password by looking only at a hashed value.\n\nRainbow tables are not always needed as there are more straightforward methods of hash reversal available. [[Brute-force attack]]s and [[dictionary attack]]s are the most straightforward methods available. However, these are not adequate for systems that use long passwords because of the difficulty of storing all the options available and searching through such an extensive database to perform a reverse lookup of a hash.\n\nTo address this issue of scale, reverse lookup tables were generated that stored only a smaller selection of hashes that when reversed could make long chains of passwords.  Although the reverse lookup of a hash in a chained table takes more computational time, the lookup table itself can be much smaller, so hashes of longer passwords can be stored.  Rainbow tables are a refinement of this chaining technique and provide a solution to a problem called chain collisions.\n\n== Precomputed hash chains ==\n: ''Note: The hash chains described in this article are a different kind of chain from those described in the [[hash chain]]s article.''\nSource:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSuppose we have a password hash function H and a finite set of passwords P. The goal is to precompute a data structure that, given any output ''h'' of the hash function, can either locate an element ''p'' in P such that H(''p'') = ''h'', or determine that there is no such ''p'' in P. The simplest way to do this is compute H(''p'') for all ''p'' in P, but then storing the table requires [[Big-O notation|\u0398]](|P|''n'') bits of space, where |P| is the size of the set P and ''n'' is the size of an output of H, which is prohibitive for large |P|.\n\nHash chains are a technique for decreasing this space requirement. The idea is to define a ''reduction function'' R that maps hash values back into values in P. Note, however, that the reduction function is not actually an inverse of the hash function, but rather a different function with a swapped [[Domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] of the hash function. By alternating the hash function with the reduction function, ''chains'' of alternating passwords and hash values are formed. For example, if P were the set of lowercase alphabetic 6-character passwords, and hash values were 32 bits long, a chain might look like this:\n\n:<math>{\\color{Red}\\mathtt{aaaaaa}}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{281DAF40}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{sgfnyd}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{920ECF10}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,{\\color{Violet}\\mathtt{kiebgt}}</math>\n\nThe only requirement for the reduction function is to be able to return a \"plain text\" value in a specific size.\n\nTo generate the table, we choose a random set of ''initial passwords'' from P, compute chains of some fixed length ''k'' for each one, and store ''only'' the first and last password in each chain. The first password is called the ''starting point'' and the last one is called the ''endpoint''. In the example chain above, \"aaaaaa\" would be the starting point and \"kiebgt\" would be the endpoint, and none of the other passwords (or the hash values) would be stored.\n\nNow, given a hash value ''h'' that we want to invert (find the corresponding password for), compute a chain starting with ''h'' by applying R, then H, then R, and so on. If at any point we observe a value matching one of the endpoints in the table, we get the corresponding starting point and use it to recreate the chain. There's a good chance that this chain will contain the value ''h'', and if so, the immediately preceding value in the chain is the password ''p'' that we seek.\n\nFor example, if we're given the hash {{mono|920ECF10}}, we would compute its chain by first applying R:\n\n:<math>\\mathtt{920ECF10}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,{\\color{Violet}\\mathtt{kiebgt}}</math>\n\nSince \"{{mono|kiebgt}}\" is one of the endpoints in our table, we then take the corresponding starting password \"{{mono|aaaaaa}}\" and follow its chain until 920ECF10 is reached:\n\n:<math>{\\color{Red}\\mathtt{aaaaaa}}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{281DAF40}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{sgfnyd}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{920ECF10}</math>\n\nThus, the password is \"{{mono|sgfnyd}}\" (or a different password that has the same hash value).\n\nNote however that this chain does not ''always'' contain the hash value ''h''; it may so happen that the chain starting at ''h'' merges with a chain having a different starting point. For example, we may be given a hash value FB107E70, and when we follow its chain, we get kiebgt:\n\n:<math>\\mathtt{FB107E70}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{bvtdll}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;H\\;]{}\\,\\mathtt{0EE80890}\\,\\xrightarrow[\\;R\\;]{}\\,{\\color{Violet}\\mathtt{kiebgt}}</math>\n\nBut {{mono|FB107E70}} is not in the chain starting at \"aaaaaa\". This is called a ''false alarm''. In this case, we ignore the match and continue to extend the chain of ''h'' looking for another match. If the chain of ''h'' gets extended to length ''k'' with no good matches, then the password was never produced in any of the chains.\n\nThe table content does not depend on the hash value to be inverted. It is created once and then repeatedly used for the lookups unmodified. Increasing the length of the chain decreases the size of the table. It also increases the time required to perform lookups, and this is the time-memory trade-off of the rainbow table. In a simple case of one-item chains, the lookup is very fast, but the table is very big. Once chains get longer, the lookup slows, but the table size goes down.\n\nSimple hash chains have several flaws.  Most serious if at any point two chains ''collide'' (produce the same value), they will merge and consequently the table will not cover as many passwords despite having paid the same computational cost to generate. Because previous chains are not stored in their entirety, this is impossible to detect efficiently. For example, if the third value in chain 3 matches the second value in chain 7, the two chains will cover almost the same sequence of values, but their final values will not be the same. The hash function H is unlikely to produce collisions as it is usually considered an important security feature not to do so, but the reduction function R, because of its need to correctly cover the likely plaintexts, can not be collision resistant.\n\nOther difficulties result from the importance of choosing the correct function for R.  Picking R to be the identity is little better than a brute force approach.  Only when the attacker has a good idea of what the likely plaintexts will be they can choose a function R that makes sure time and space are only used for likely plaintexts, not the entire space of possible passwords.  In effect R shepherds the results of prior hash calculations back to likely plaintexts but this benefit comes with the drawback that R likely won't produce every possible plaintext in the class the attacker wishes to check denying certainty to the attacker that no passwords came from their chosen class.  Also it can be difficult to design the function R to match the expected distribution of plaintexts.\n\n\n== Rainbow tables ==\nRainbow tables effectively solve the problem of collisions with ordinary hash chains by replacing the single reduction function R with a sequence of related reduction functions R<sub>1</sub> through R<sub>''k''</sub>. In this way, for two chains to collide and merge they must hit the same value ''on the same iteration''. Consequently, the final values in each chain will be identical. A final postprocessing pass can sort the chains in the table and remove any \"duplicate\" chains that have the same final values as other chains. New chains are then generated to fill out the table. These chains are not ''collision-free'' (they may overlap briefly) but they will not merge, drastically reducing the overall number of collisions.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nUsing sequences of reduction functions changes how lookup is done: because the hash value of interest may be found at any location in the chain, it's necessary to generate ''k'' different chains. The first chain assumes the hash value is in the last hash position and just applies R<sub>''k''</sub>; the next chain assumes the hash value is in the second-to-last hash position and applies R<sub>''k''\u22121</sub>, then H, then R<sub>''k''</sub>; and so on until the last chain, which applies all the reduction functions, alternating with H. This creates a new way of producing a false alarm: if we \"guess\" the position of the hash value wrong, we may needlessly evaluate a chain.\n\nAlthough rainbow tables have to follow more chains, they make up for this by having fewer tables: simple hash chain tables cannot grow beyond a certain size without rapidly becoming inefficient due to merging chains; to deal with this, they maintain multiple tables, and each lookup must search through each table. Rainbow tables can achieve similar performance with tables that are ''k'' times larger, allowing them to perform a factor of ''k'' fewer lookups.\n\n=== Example ===\n#Starting from the hash (\"re3xes\") in the image below, one computes the last reduction used in the table and checks whether the password appears in the last column of the table (step 1).\n#If the test fails (''rambo'' doesn't appear in the table), one computes a chain with the two last reductions (these two reductions are represented at step 2)\n#:Note: If this new test fails again, one continues with 3 reductions, 4 reductions, etc. until the password is found. If no chain contains the password, then the attack has failed.\n# If this test is positive (step 3, ''linux23'' appears at the end of the chain and in the table), the password is retrieved at the beginning of the chain that produces ''linux23''. Here we find ''passwd'' at the beginning of the corresponding chain stored in the table.\n# At this point (step 4), one generates a chain and compares at each iteration the hash with the target hash. The test is valid and we find the hash ''re3xes'' in the chain. The current password (''culture'') is the one that produced the whole chain: the attack is successful.\n\n[[Image:simple_rainbow_search.svg|650px]]\n\nRainbow tables use a refined algorithm with a different reduction function for each \"link\" in a chain, so that when there is a hash collision in two or more chains, the chains will not merge as long as the collision doesn't occur at the same position in each chain. This increases the probability of a correct crack for a given table size, at the cost of squaring the number of steps required per lookup, as the lookup routine now also needs to iterate through the index of the first reduction function used in the chain.<ref name=\"ophpaper\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://lasec.epfl.ch/pub/lasec/doc/Oech03.pdf|title=Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO 2003|last1=Oechslin|first1=P.|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=978-3-540-40674-7|series=[[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]]|volume=2729|location=|pages=617\u2013630|chapter=Making a Faster Cryptanalytic Time-Memory Trade-Off|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_36}}</ref>\n\nRainbow tables are specific to the hash function they were created for e.g., [[MD5]] tables can crack only MD5 hashes.

However, tables can be generated that take into account common ways in which users attempt to choose more secure passwords, such as adding a number or special character. Because of the sizable investment in computing processing, rainbow tables beyond fourteen places in length are not yet common. So, choosing a password that is longer than fourteen characters may force an attacker to resort to brute-force methods.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nSpecific intensive efforts focused on [[LM hash]], an older hash algorithm used by Microsoft, are publicly available. LM hash is particularly vulnerable because passwords longer than 7 characters are broken into two sections, each of which is hashed separately. Choosing a password that is fifteen characters or longer guarantees that an LM hash will not be generated.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299656 How to prevent Windows from storing a LAN manager hash of your password in Active Directory and local SAM databases], [[Microsoft]]</ref>\n\n== Common uses ==\nNearly all distributions and variations of [[Unix]], [[Linux]], and [[BSD]] use hashes with salts, though many applications use just a hash (typically [[MD5]]) with no salt. The Microsoft Windows NT/2000 family uses the [[LM hash|LAN Manager]] and [[NTLM|NT LAN Manager]] hashing method (based on [[MD4]]) and is also unsalted, which makes it one of the most popularly generated tables.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[A5/1]]\n* [[Brute-force attack]]\n* [[DistrRTgen]]\n* [[Pollard's kangaroo algorithm]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n*  {{Cite book\n | url = https://lasec.epfl.ch/pub/lasec/doc/Oech03.pdf\n | title = Making a Faster Cryptanalytical Time-Memory Trade-Off\n | first = Philippe | last = Oechslin | journal = Advances in Cryptology: Proceedings of CRYPTO 2003, 23rd Annual International Cryptology Conference\n | volume = 2729\n | pages = 617\u2013630\n | location =  [[Santa Barbara, California]], USA | date = 2003-08-17 | isbn  = 978-3-540-40674-7 | publisher = Springer | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_36\n }}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

The agreement stated that the players would have an increased base pay and improved match bonuses. These changes could increase their previous pay from $200,000 to $300,000. This 2017 CBA, however, does not guarantee the U.S national women's team equal pay with the men's national team. The CBA's five-year term, through 2021, ensured that the next negotiation would not become an issue for the team in its next major competitions. On top of this CBA, U.S Soccer had agreed to pay the players for two years' worth of unequal per-diem payments.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-soccer-labor-deal-contract.html |title=Long Days, Google Docs and Anonymous Surveys: How the U.S. Soccer Team Forged a Deal |last=Das |first=Andrew |date=April 5, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=March 8, 2019  |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOn March 8, 2019, all 28 members of the U.S. team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination |last=Das |first=Andrew |date=March 8, 2019 |work=The New York Times|access-date=March 8, 2019  |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Los Angeles, accused the Federation of \"institutional gender discrimination.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/653-us-womens-soccer-complaint/f9367608e2eaf10873f4/optimized/full.pdf#page=1 |title=Case No. 2:19-CV-01717 |last=Winston & Strawn LLP |date=March 8, 2019 }}</ref> The lawsuit claims that the discrimination affects not only the amount the players are paid but also their playing, training, and travel conditions.\n\n==Staff==\n'''Coaching staff'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A tall right-handed middle-order batsman, a left-arm bowler who varied his pace between medium-paced seamers and slow spinners, and a spectacularly good close catcher, specialising in fielding at short-leg, he played all his county cricket for [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]].<ref name=\"Cap\"/>\n\nFor a few years at the beginning of his cricket career, he also played during the English winters for the South African provincial sides, [[Transvaal cricket team|Transvaal]] and [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province]].\n\nAs a batsman, Walker made 1,000 runs in a season eleven times, often seeming to do well when his colleagues faltered. Nevertheless, in seventeen years of [[first-class cricket]] he made only thirteen centuries, and his career average of 26 reflected soundness rather than flair, on the unpredictable surfaces that applied in the days of uncovered pitches. His bowling was effective more than penetrating, but, in 1961, he took 101 wickets to achieve the [[Double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, and he was not far short in 1959 and 1962. As a fielder, he ranks among the best of all time: he took 697 catches in 469 career matches, and his 73 catches in 1961 \u2013 to go alongside his 1,000 runs and 100 wickets \u2013 is the third highest figure for a fielder in a single English cricket season, after [[Wally Hammond]] and [[Mickey Stewart]]; and the best 'treble' \u2013 runs, wickets and catches ever recorded in the history of the first-class game.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nWalker was picked for three Tests against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] who toured England in 1960; he batted well down the order in all three games and hardly bowled at all, but probably did well enough to have expected further chances. But at a time of batting riches for England and [[Spin bowling|spin]] competition from [[David Allen (cricketer)|David Allen]], [[Ray Illingworth]] and [[Fred Titmus]], he never got back into contention after playing in the first three Tests, all of which England won.<ref name=\"Cap\"/>\n\nHe, [[M.J.K.

A tall right-handed middle-order batsman, a left-arm bowler who varied his pace between medium-paced seamers and slow spinners, and a spectacularly good close catcher, specialising in fielding at short-leg, he played all his county cricket for [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]].<ref name=\"Cap\"/>\n\nFor a few years at the beginning of his cricket career, he also played during the English winters for the South African provincial sides, [[Transvaal cricket team|Transvaal]] and [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province]].\n\nAs a batsman, Walker made 1,000 runs in a season eleven times, often seeming to do well when his colleagues faltered. Nevertheless, in seventeen years of [[first-class cricket]] he made only thirteen centuries, and his career average of 26 reflected soundness rather than flair, on the unpredictable surfaces that applied in the days of uncovered pitches. His bowling was effective more than penetrating, but, in 1961, he took 101 wickets to achieve the [[Double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, and he was not far short in 1959 and 1962. As a fielder, he ranks among the best of all time: he took 697 catches in 469 career matches, and his 73 catches in 1961 \u2013 to go alongside his 1,000 runs and 100 wickets \u2013 is the third highest figure for a fielder in a single English cricket season, after [[Wally Hammond]] and [[Mickey Stewart]]; and the best 'treble' \u2013 runs, wickets and catches ever recorded in the history of the first-class game.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nWalker was picked for three Tests against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] who toured England in 1960; he batted well down the order in all three games and hardly bowled at all, but probably did well enough to have expected further chances. But at a time of batting riches for England and [[Spin bowling|spin]] competition from [[David Allen (cricketer)|David Allen]], [[Ray Illingworth]] and [[Fred Titmus]], he never got back into contention after playing in the first three Tests, all of which England won.<ref name=\"Cap\"/>\n\nHe, [[M.J.K.
