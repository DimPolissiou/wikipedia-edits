Among the more occasional hosts were [[Steve Rider]], [[Des Lynam]], [[Sue Barker]] and [[Lee McKenzie]].\n\n==Production==\nIn the early days of the programme, all races were commentated at [[BBC Television Centre]] in [[London]] due to the high costs of travelling to races with live broadcasts done on location.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title=Lunch with...Murray Walker|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-2011/70/lunch-murray-walker|publisher=MotorSport Magazine|date=April 2011|accessdate=}}</ref> <ref>F1 Racing, Issue: April 2012, Page 35</ref> The team would not usually travel to non-European races to commentate unless another broadcaster paid for the travel expenses. Murray Walker would usually be flown to the location of the tracks to record a short scene before returning to England to watch the race from London with some broadcasts having commentary live with highlights aired or recorded commentary in highlights. On occasions the BBC employed a \"ghost commentator\" which was someone who would be in touch with the production team in London and gained access to timing monitors so that cameras could record what was occurring off the track. The first \"ghost commentator\" was Mark Fogarty with [[Joe Saward]] taking over in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saward|first=Joe|title=Behind the scenes at the BBC|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00239.html|publisher=grandprix.com|date=1 September 1996|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Conception==\nFollowing the excitement and interest of the [[1976 Formula One season]], the [[BBC]] decided to cover all races from 1978.

By the 1990s all of the European races were broadcast live with the summer races shown as part of ''[[Sunday Grandstand]]'', with highlights on the Grand Prix programme. Some races were shown on Grand Prix due to either race times in the morning/evening or because ''[[Grandstand]]'' was showing another major event at the same time. 1992 saw [[Jonathan Palmer]] join as a pit reporter for the live races but following the [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix]], Hunt died from a heart attack and was replaced in the commentary box by Jonathan Palmer. For the following race in France, BBC aired a tribute show to Hunt following their highlights show. In 1995, all the races were shown live and all qualifying sessions were shown live in 1996 - previously, qualifying was shown as a brief report during [[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]], apart from qualifying for the [[British Grand Prix]] which was generally shown live and in full. Many of these live races were fronted by [[Steve Rider]]. \n\n===End of ''Grand Prix''===\nIn 1995 it was announced that the [[BBC]] had lost the television broadcast rights to Formula One to [[ITV Network|ITV]] for the 1997 season. Murray Walker would continue in his role as the lead commentator.<ref>F1 Racing, Issue: September 2011, Page 33</ref> The final race broadcast by the programme was the [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix]] in which viewers saw [[Damon Hill]] win his only world championship. The loss of coverage was an example of [[BBC Sport]] department's decline in the late 1990s.\n===2009-2011===\nIn March 2008, ITV announced the coverage would be transferred to the BBC from the 2009 season. BBC hired\n\n===2012-2015===\nIn July 2011, BBC announced that half their races would be live from 2012 and got a contract to 2018 with [[Sky Sports]] covering all races. Brundle and Kravitz left BBC for Sky and the end of 2011 and were replaced by [[Ben Edwards (commentator)|Ben Edwards]] as lead commentator and former [[Jordan Grand Prix]] designer [[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|Gary Anderson]] joining as reporter and technical analyst. Jake Humphrey continued to host, Eddie Jordan analysed on live races and David Coulthard stayed as color Commentator. Humphrey was forced to skip Canada and Europe due to him hosting [[Euro 2012]] for [[BBC]]'s [[Match of the Day]] and then skipped Germany and Hungary due to him hosting the [[2012 Olympics]] for [[BBC]], Lee McKenzie filled in for him at these races and her role was taken by [[Tom Clarkson]]. Humphrey left at the end of 2012 to join [[BT Sport]] and was replaced by [[Suzi Perry]], Allan Mcnish joined as analyst and Clarkson joined full Time. BBC aired all three practice session for their live races on [[BBC Two]] or [[BBC Three]]. Anderson left at the end of 2013.\n\n===''Grand Prix'' Axed===\nIn late 2015, BBC wanted a budget cut of \u00a321 million to the sports department.

Many of these live races were fronted by [[Steve Rider]]. \n\n===End of ''Grand Prix''===\nIn 1995 it was announced that the [[BBC]] had lost the television broadcast rights to Formula One to [[ITV Network|ITV]] for the 1997 season. Murray Walker would continue in his role as the lead commentator.<ref>F1 Racing, Issue: September 2011, Page 33</ref> The final race broadcast by the programme was the [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix]] in which viewers saw [[Damon Hill]] win his only world championship. The loss of coverage was an example of [[BBC Sport]] department's decline in the late 1990s.\n===2009-2011===\nIn March 2008, ITV announced the coverage would be transferred to the BBC from the 2009 season. BBC hired\n\n===2012-2015===\nIn July 2011, BBC announced that half their races would be live from 2012 and got a contract to 2018 with [[Sky Sports]] covering all races. Brundle and Kravitz left BBC for Sky and the end of 2011 and were replaced by [[Ben Edwards]] as lead commentator and former [[Jordan Grand Prix]] designer [[Gary Anderson]] joining as reporter and technical analyst. Jake Humphrey continued to host, Eddie Jordan analysed on live races and David Coulthard stayed as color Commentator. Humphrey was forced to skip Canada and Europe due to him hosting [[Euro 2012]] for [[BBC]]'s [[Match of the Day]] and then skipped Germany and Hungary due to him hosting the [[2012 Olympics]] for [[BBC]], Lee McKenzie filled in for him at these races and her role was taken by [[Tom Clarkson]]. Humphrey left at the end of 2012 to join [[BT Sport]] and was replaced by [[Suzi Perry]], Allan Mcnish joined as analyst and Clarkson joined full Time. BBC aired all three practice session for their live races on [[BBC Two]] or [[BBC Three]]. Anderson left at the end of 2013.\n\n===''Grand Prix'' Axed===\nIn late 2015, BBC wanted a budget cut of \u00a321 million to the sports department. In December 2015, BBC axed Grand Prix as part of their budget cuts and was replaced by [[Channel 4]] from 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/3/7516.html|title= The BBC wins rights to UK Formula One coverage|publisher=formula1.com}}</ref>\n\nSome episodes are still available but hidden on the BBC's website.\n\n==Broadcast History==\nHere's the history of the broadcasts BBC did on [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[BBC Three]], [[BBC HD]] or [[BBC Red Button]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forums.autosport.com/topic/112436-a-detailed-look-into-uk-f1-television-ratings/page-19|title= F1 ratings|publisher=Autosport.com}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|-\n!

The Governor performs the same constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as does the [[Governor-General of Australia]] at the national level. In accordance with the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government, the Governor nearly always acts solely on the advice of the head of the elected government, the [[Premier of South Australia]]. Nevertheless, the Governor retains the [[reserve powers]] of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier. As from June 2014, the Queen, upon the recommendation of the Premier, accorded all current, future and living former Governors the title 'The Honourable' for life.<ref>[http://www.governmentgazette.sa.gov.au/2014/june/2014_043.pdf SA Government Gazette]</ref> The first six Governors oversaw the colony from [[Proclamation Day (South Australia)|proclamation]] in 1836 until [[self-government]] and an elected [[Parliament of South Australia]] was enacted in the year prior to the inaugural [[1857 South Australian colonial election|1857 election]].\n\nThe first Australian-born Governor of South Australia was [[James Harrison (Australian governor)|Major-General Sir James Harrison]] (appointed 1968), and most subsequent governors have been Australian-born. The first South Australian-born governor was [[Mark Oliphant|Sir Mark Oliphant]] (appointed 1971), and the first Aboriginal governor was [[Douglas Nicholls|Sir Douglas Nicholls]] (appointed 1976).

Constitutional powers bestowed upon the Governor and used with the consent and advice of the Executive Council include:\n\n* to appoint and dismiss Ministers.\n* exercising the prerogative of mercy.\n* issuing regulations and proclamations under existing laws.\n* giving Royal Assent to bills passed by Parliament.\n* appointing judges, royal commissioners and senior public servants.\n* dissolving Parliament and issuing writs for elections.\n\nThe Governor additionally maintains 'reserve powers' which can be used without the consent of the Executive Council.

The Governor performs the same constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as does the [[Governor-General of Australia]] at the national level. In accordance with the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government, the Governor nearly always acts solely on the advice of the head of the elected government, the [[Premier of South Australia]]. Nevertheless, the Governor retains the [[reserve powers]] of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier. As from June 2014, the Queen, upon the recommendation of the Premier, accorded all current, future and living former Governors the title 'The Honourable' for life.<ref>[http://www.governmentgazette.sa.gov.au/2014/june/2014_043.pdf SA Government Gazette]</ref> The first six Governors oversaw the colony from [[Proclamation Day (South Australia)|proclamation]] in 1836 until [[self-government]] and an elected [[Parliament of South Australia]] was enacted in the year prior to the inaugural [[1857 South Australian colonial election|1857 election]].\n\nThe first Australian-born Governor of South Australia was [[James Harrison (Australian governor)|Major-General Sir James Harrison]] (appointed 1968), and most subsequent governors have been Australian-born.

Currently, the Governor is responsible for safeguarding the South Australian Constitution and facilitating the work of the Parliament and state government.\n\nThe Governor exercises power on the advice of Ministers, conveyed through the Executive Council. Constitutional powers bestowed upon the Governor and used with the consent and advice of the Executive Council include:\n\n* to appoint and dismiss Ministers.\n* exercising the prerogative of mercy.\n* issuing regulations and proclamations under existing laws.\n* giving Royal Assent to bills passed by Parliament.\n* appointing judges, royal commissioners and senior public servants.\n* dissolving Parliament and issuing writs for elections.\n\nThe Governor additionally maintains 'reserve powers' which can be used without the consent of the Executive Council.

In [[Inner Mongolia]] in modern-day [[China]], the [[Daur people|Daur]] people have been playing ''[[beikou]]'', a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\n==Game play and equipment==\nThe exact rules of game play, and whether these rules were consistent from region to region, are unknown.  [[England|English]] rules recorded in [[Charles Cotton]]'s ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674), for an indoor version played on a [[billiard table]], indicate that the general offensive goal of the game is to use a club-like [[Cue stick|cue]], called the ''{{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}'' or ''tack'', to drive one's own [[Billiard ball|ball]] through a hoop, called the ''pass'', ''port'', ''argolis'', or ''ring'', thus earning a chance to shoot at the upright ''king pin'' or ''sprigg'', and to use defensive {{Cuegloss|Position play|position play}} to thwart an opponent's ability to do likewise, e.g. by {{Cuegloss|Kiss|kissing}} an opposing ball to an unfavorable location.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /><ref name=\"Shamos 1999 265\" />  Points were scored for touching the king pin with one's ball, without knocking the pin over (which would cost the loss of a point).<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" />  Games were played to a set number of points, such as 5 or 7, and could be between two (or sometimes more) individual competitors or doubles teams, each with one ball.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> {{Cuegloss|Object ball|Object balls}} were not used, in Cotton's work or in any contemporary illustrations.  Cotton's indoor version made use of [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]] in the sides of the table as {{Cuegloss|Hazard|hazards}}, with additional scoring opportunities,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> and some outdoor ground-billiards courts may have used [[golf]]-style holes for the same purpose.<ref name=\"book_TheL\" />\n\nAn outdoor form of the game that survived, sometimes without a king pin, until the early 20th century was [[trucco]], among other names, with rules well-documented in works like the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] advice book ''[[Enquire Within upon Everything]]'', which also called it simply \"lawn billiards\" (and which covered the related game [[croquet]] separately).  Trucco, in this well-documented form, was played in a round area at least {{convert|8|yards}} in diameter, by two players (or more, in two teams). The game used large, heavy balls and iron-headed maces like giant spoons which were used to toss rather than roll one's ball toward the port, by this stage a freely rotating metal ring mounted on a stake, and almost flush with the ground.  Scoring shots included passing one's ball through the port, and striking an opponent's ball with one's own (a {{cuegloss|cannon}} or {{cuegloss|carom}} shot, in billiards terms, or in [[croquet]] called a {{cuegloss|roquet}}). Part of the strategy of this form of the game was using cannon shots to get close enough to the port for a shot at it to be easier (failing to go dead-center would likely result in not just a miss but rotation of the ring to an unpredictable position, or even in knocking the ring down, which was a foul with a penalty).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />  A prior form, illustrated in an early-17th-century English painting, shows a smaller and rectangular court, and only one ball between two players.  Some continental forms did involve a king pin.\n\nThe [[Billiard ball|balls]], mace, and other equipment were probably most commonly made of [[wood]]. ''The Complete Gamester'', covering only the indoor variant, favored by the well-to-do, recommended hardwood such as [[lignum vitae]] for maces, and expensive [[ivory]] for balls and other equipment,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> but ivory's fragility would have made it impractical for the larger-scale and necessarily more forceful outdoor version of the game. ''Enquire Within'' suggested lignum vitae or [[boxwood]] for the balls. Some illustrations suggest port hoops made of decorative wrought iron, while others are clearly of wood, stone, or another carved substance, and later examples are thin and wiry, similar to modern croquet hoops (wickets).  The nature of the mace appears to move from crude to elegant over time, with earlier illustrations showing simple hammer-like implements, with players stooping, while later woodcuts and tapestries show a long, thin device more like a golf club, and in basic form very similar to later, more delicate and ornate maces used for table billiards before leather-tipped straight cues became the norm in those games.  Similarly, the nature of the playing court appears to evolve from any informal patch of ground to courts of turf or clay bounded by low (often wicker) barriers,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|4&ndash;47}} though trucco, as an informal game played mostly at pubs and [[country house]]s, could be played anywhere the ground was relatively flat (the conventional Victorian rules simply called for at least {{convert|4|yards}} from the outer edge of the playing area to the ring).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />\n\nMost woodcuts and other illustrations of the game show two players. A few show more, but it is unclear if these represent teams, doubles, or individual players.\n\n===Modern revival===\nA mid-20th-century version of ground billiards (aside from the aforementioned box hockey) has been played on a 30&nbsp;by&nbsp;60&nbsp;[[Foot (length)|ft]] (approximately 9&nbsp;by&nbsp;19&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) clay court.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\" />{{Rp|117}}  This may have been a croquet influence, as [[roque]], an early-20th-century [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] variant of croquet, used a court of the same dimensions.<ref name=\"spring.net\" />\n\n===\"King pin\"===\nThe term \"king pin\" or \"kingpin\", which today may refer to essential components of any system, from bosses of [[organized crime]] syndicates, to the main support bolt in the axle assemblies or \"trucks\" of [[skateboard]]s, appears to derive from its usage as a key component of ground billiards, early skittle bowling, and related games.<ref name=\"etym_king\" /> There are some records that some of the early king pins in ground billiard games were made of bone.<ref name=\"book_TheS\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Clare\">{{Cite book |title=Billiards and Snooker Bygones |last=Clare |first=Norman |publisher=Shire Publications |location=Princes Risborough, England |date=1996 |orig-year=1985 |edition=amended |isbn=978-0-85263-730-2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\">{{Cite book |first1=Leila C. |last1=Dorion |first2=Julia A. |last2=Shepherd |title=History of Bowling and Billiards |location=Kansas City, Missouri |publisher=Constable-Hurd Printing Co. |date=1928 |pages=28, 65, 68 |url= http://www.archive.org/details/historyofbowling008027mbp}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Twardy 1937\">{{Cite news |first=E.

[[England|English]] rules recorded in [[Charles Cotton]]'s ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674), for an indoor version played on a [[billiard table]], indicate that the general offensive goal of the game is to use a club-like [[Cue stick|cue]], called the ''{{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}'' or ''tack'', to drive one's own [[Billiard ball|ball]] through a hoop, called the ''pass'', ''port'', ''argolis'', or ''ring'', thus earning a chance to shoot at the upright ''king pin'' or ''sprigg'', and to use defensive {{Cuegloss|Position play|position play}} to thwart an opponent's ability to do likewise, e.g. by {{Cuegloss|Kiss|kissing}} an opposing ball to an unfavorable location.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\">{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Cotton |author-link=Charles Cotton |title=The {{Sic|hide=y|Compleat}} Gamester: Or, Instruction How to Play at All Manner of Usual and Most Genteel Games |location=London |publisher=Henry Brome &#91;reprinted Barre, Massachusettes: Imprint Society&#93; |orig-year=1674 |date=1970 |pages=25&ndash;33}}</ref><ref name=\"Shamos 1999 265\">{{Shamos 1999|265}}</ref>  Points were scored for touching the king pin with one's ball, without knocking the pin over (which would cost the loss of a point).<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" />  Games were played to a set number of points, such as 5 or 7, and could be between two (or sometimes more) individual competitors or doubles teams, each with one ball.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> {{Cuegloss|Object ball|Object balls}} were not used, in Cotton's work or in any contemporary illustrations.  Cotton's indoor version made use of [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]] in the sides of the table as {{Cuegloss|Hazard|hazards}}, with additional scoring opportunities,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> and some outdoor ground-billiards courts may have used [[golf]]-style holes for the same purpose.<ref name=\"book_TheL\"/>\n\nAn outdoor form of the game that survived, sometimes without a king pin, until the early 20th century was [[trucco]], among other names, with rules well-documented in works like the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] advice book ''[[Enquire Within upon Everything]]'', which also called it simply \"lawn billiards\" (and which covered the related game [[croquet]] separately).  Trucco, in this well-documented form, was played in a round area at least {{convert|8|yards}} in diameter, by two players (or more, in two teams). The game used large, heavy balls and iron-headed maces like giant spoons which were used to toss rather than roll one's ball toward the port, by this stage a freely rotating metal ring mounted on a stake, and almost flush with the ground.  Scoring shots included passing one's ball through the port, and striking an opponent's ball with one's own (a {{cuegloss|cannon}} or {{cuegloss|carom}} shot, in billiards terms, or in [[croquet]] called a {{cuegloss|roquet}}). Part of the strategy of this form of the game was using cannon shots to get close enough to the port for a shot at it to be easier (failing to go dead-center would likely result in not just a miss but rotation of the ring to an unpredictable position, or even in knocking the ring down, which was a foul with a penalty).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\">{{cite book |title=Enquire Within upon Everything |editor-first=Robert |editor-last=Kemp Philp |editor-link=Robert Kemp Philp |chapter=2595.

The rules of this and other outdoor games did not appear in editions much older than this.</ref>  A prior form, illustrated in an early-17th-century English painting, shows a smaller and rectangular court, and only one ball between two players.  Some continental forms did involve a king pin.\n\nThe [[Billiard ball|balls]], mace, and other equipment were probably most commonly made of [[wood]]. ''The Complete Gamester'', covering only the indoor variant, favored by the well-to-do, recommended hardwood such as [[lignum vitae]] for maces, and expensive [[ivory]] for balls and other equipment,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> but ivory's fragility would have made it impractical for the larger-scale and necessarily more forceful outdoor version of the game. ''Enquire Within'' suggested lignum vitae or [[boxwood]] for the balls. Some illustrations suggest port hoops made of decorative wrought iron, while others are clearly of wood, stone, or another carved substance, and later examples are thin and wiry, similar to modern croquet hoops (wickets).  The nature of the mace appears to move from crude to elegant over time, with earlier illustrations showing simple hammer-like implements, with players stooping, while later woodcuts and tapestries show a long, thin device more like a golf club, and in basic form very similar to later, more delicate and ornate maces used for table billiards before leather-tipped straight cues became the norm in those games.  Similarly, the nature of the playing court appears to evolve from any informal patch of ground to courts of turf or clay bounded by low (often wicker) barriers,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\">{{Stein & Rubino 2008}}</ref>{{Rp|4&ndash;47}} though trucco, as an informal game played mostly at pubs and [[country house]]s, could be played anywhere the ground was relatively flat (the conventional Victorian rules simply called for at least {{convert|4|yards}} from the outer edge of the playing area to the ring).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />\n\nMost woodcuts and other illustrations of the game show two players. A few show more, but it is unclear if these represent teams, doubles, or individual players.\n\n===Modern revival===\nA mid-20th-century version of ground billiards (aside from the aforementioned box hockey) has been played on a 30&nbsp;by&nbsp;60&nbsp;[[Foot (length)|ft]] (approximately 9&nbsp;by&nbsp;19&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) clay court.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\" />{{Rp|117}}  This may have been a croquet influence, as [[roque]], an early-20th-century [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] variant of croquet, used a court of the same dimensions.<ref name=\"spring.net\">{{Cite web |url= http://www.spring.net/sports/roque/rules.html |title=Official Rules and Regulations |last1=McGowan |first1=B.

In the [[Tony Blair]] era, the committee's role declined and its membership was reformed, but it remains the administrative authority of the party. Its former policy development function is now largely carried out by the [[National Policy Forum]]. One of its committees has disciplinary powers including the ability to expel members of the party who have brought it into disrepute or to readmit previously expelled members.\n\nUp until 1997, Members of Parliament could stand for CLP section seats on the NEC, but thereafter MPs and MEPs could not stand in this section.<ref name=independent-19970930>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/labour-conference-left-jubilant-as-mandelson-fails-in-nec-election-1242024.html |title=Labour Conference: Left jubilant as Mandelson fails in NEC election |last=Abrams |first=Fran |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 September 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 Conference saw the creation of four additional NEC seats: one in the trade union section and three in the CLP section.

'''National Executive Committee''' ('''NEC''') is the governing body of the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]], setting the overall strategic direction of the party and policy development.\n\nIts composition has changed over the years, and includes representatives of [[affiliated trade unions]], the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] and [[European Parliamentary Labour Party]], [[constituency Labour parties]] (CLP), and [[socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]], as well as ''ex officio'' members such as the Party Leader and Deputy Leader and several of their appointees.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 1980s, the NEC had a major role in policy-making and was often at the heart of disputes over party policy.  In the [[Tony Blair]] era, the committee's role declined and its membership was reformed, but it remains the administrative authority of the party. Its former policy development function is now largely carried out by the [[National Policy Forum]]. One of its committees has disciplinary powers including the ability to expel members of the party who have brought it into disrepute or to readmit previously expelled members.\n\nUp until 1997, Members of Parliament could stand for CLP section seats on the NEC, but thereafter MPs and MEPs could not stand in this section.<ref name=independent-19970930>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/labour-conference-left-jubilant-as-mandelson-fails-in-nec-election-1242024.html |title=Labour Conference: Left jubilant as Mandelson fails in NEC election |last=Abrams |first=Fran |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 September 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 Conference saw the creation of four additional NEC seats: one in the trade union section and three in the CLP section.
