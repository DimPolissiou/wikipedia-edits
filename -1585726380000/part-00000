He first began to take art seriously, at the age of 14, following his father's death, when his mother (abdulla al shamsi) sent him to [[Kuwait]] to live with his sister. He considered himself, \u201clucky because the Kuwaiti government was supporting art at that time so I had access to all the art materials I needed for free.\u201d<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/inside-the-dubai-home-studio-of-emirati-artist-abdul-qader-al-rais-1.2788|title=Inside the Dubai home studio of Emirati artist Abdul Qader Al Rais|website=The National|accessdate=October 12, 2019}}</ref> He showed an early talent, which he attributed as a \"gift from God.\"<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nHe remained with his sister in Kuwait until he was 18 yrs old by which time he had completed his basic education at the grammar school. Undoubtedly, Abdul Qader\u2019s early experiences in Kuwait, including the teachings impacted his development both artistically and intellectually.\n\n==Career==\nOn his return to the Emirates, in 1974, he worked at the Ministry of Labour as a labour inspector and pursued his further education by earning a degree in [[Sharia Law]] at the [[United Arab Emirates University]], [[Al Ain]]. From 1974, he discontinued painting altogether and did not pick up a paint-brush for another 12 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.g-1.com/product-category/wall-art/artists/abdul-qader-al-rais/|title=GalleryOne, \"Abdul Qader Al Rais,\" Biographical Notes|accessdate=October 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen he began painting again, he focussed on producing sweeping landscapes, architectural studies and abstract forms.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> As a young artist, he was awarded first honour for his artwork inspired by the movie, ''The Agony and the Ecstasy.''  This signaled the beginning of his career in art. Abdul Qader\u2019s incessant pencil and watercolour sketches clearly defined his role in life as an artist. These early works has led to continued success, as he received multiple awards, which garnered the attention of national and international media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mojeh.com/lifestyle/in-the-beginning-abdul-qader-al-rais/|title=In the Beginning: Abdul Qader Al Rais|date=July 7, 2014|website=MOJEH|accessdate=October 12, 2019}}</ref> Abdul Qader Al Rais became a household name in the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] world of fine arts.\n\nAs an artist, he is largely self-taught. His interest in old local architecture gems and nature were depicted in romantic realism. His early work explores local scenery, coastlines and idyllic landscape in the UAE.

In 1909, French troops invaded the Kingdom and established a garrison in Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9. [[France]] took power, forcing the sultan to renounce his throne.  At that time, Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 was the largest city in Chad with 28,000 people, but major epidemics reduced the population to 6000 in 1919. In 1935, the sultanate was restored by orders of the French government, and Muhammed Ouarada, heir to the throne after his father became king. Once one of the strongholds of the Arabic slave trade route, the city is known today for its [[Market (place)|market]]s, [[mosque]]s, [[Church (building)|church]], square (the Place de l'Ind\u00e9pendance) and for its sultan's [[palace]]. Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 has several schools, a hospital, a university and is one of the major garrisons of the Armee Nationale du Tchad ANT . There is a small [[airport]] {{Airport codes|AEH|FTTC}}, Airport ID: AE, operated sunrise to sunset (SR-SS) with flights to [[N'Djam\u00e9na]].\n\nOn 25 November 2006, the city was taken by the [[Union of Forces for Democracy]], a rebel group that seeks to depose president [[Idriss D\u00e9by]]. Extensive looting took place during the night. On the same day, nearby [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]] was captured by the  [[Rally of Democratic Forces (rebel group)|Rally of Democratic Forces]], another rebel group. A day later, both cities were retaken by the Chadian army.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6185074.stm|title=Chad denies rebel move on capital|publisher=BBC News|date=26 November 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909093638/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6185074.stm|archivedate=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2007, the city came to international attention when 17 French volunteers working for the charity [[Zo\u00e9's Ark]] were arrested there for alleged [[child abduction]].\n\nAbeche is the centrum for the delivery of humanitarian assistance for approx. 240,000 Darfurian refugees living in 12 camps east of the town, in the border region to Sudan.

In 1909, French troops invaded the Kingdom and established a garrison in Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9. [[France]] took power, forcing the sultan to renounce his throne.  At that time, Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 was the largest city in Chad with 28,000 people, but major epidemics reduced the population to 6000 in 1919. In 1935, the sultanate was restored by orders of the French government, and Muhammed Ouarada, heir to the throne after his father became king. Once one of the strongholds of the Arabic slave trade route, the city is known today for its [[Market (place)|market]]s, [[mosque]]s, [[Church (building)|church]], square (the Place de l'Ind\u00e9pendance) and for its sultan's [[palace]]. Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 has several schools, a hospital, a university and is one of the major garrisons of the Armee Nationale du Tchad ANT . There is a small [[airport]] {{Airport codes|AEH|FTTC}}, Airport ID: AE, operated sunrise to sunset (SR-SS) with flights to [[N'Djam\u00e9na]].\n\nOn 25 November 2006, the city was taken by the [[Union of Forces for Democracy]], a rebel group that seeks to depose president [[Idriss D\u00e9by]]. Extensive looting took place during the night. On the same day, nearby [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]] was captured by the  [[Rally of Democratic Forces (rebel group)|Rally of Democratic Forces]], another rebel group. A day later, both cities were retaken by the Chadian army.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6185074.stm|title=Chad denies rebel move on capital|publisher=BBC News|date=26 November 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909093638/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6185074.stm|archivedate=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2007, the city came to international attention when 17 French volunteers working for the charity [[Zo\u00e9's Ark]] were arrested there for alleged [[child abduction]].\n\nAbeche is the centrum for the delivery of humanitarian assistance for approx. 240,000 Darfurian refugees living in 12 camps east of the town, in the border region to Sudan.

September 11, 2001 precipitated this change, where \"powers quickly shifted quickly to the Presidency as the call went up for centralized decision making in a traumatized nation where, quick, decisive action was considered necessary. It was considered politically dangerous and even unpatriotic to question this shift, lest one be accused of impeding national safety during a time of war.\"<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\">{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=Jim|title=Congressional Abdication|journal=The National Interest|date=March\u2013April 2013|issue= 124|url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/congressional-abdication-8138|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSince that time, Webb thinks Congress has become largely irrelevant in shaping and executing of U.S. foreign policy. He cites the [[Strategic Framework Agreement]] (SFA), the [[U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement]], and the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] as examples of growing legislative irrelevance. Regarding the SFA, \"Congress was not consulted in any meaningful way. Once the document was finalized, Congress was not given the opportunity to debate the merits of the agreement, which was specifically designed to shape the structure of our long-term relations in Iraq\" (11). \"Congress did not debate or vote on this agreement, which set U.S. policy toward an unstable regime in an unstable region of the world.\"<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" /> The [[Iraqi Parliament]], by contrast, voted on the measure twice. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement is described by the Obama Administration has a \"legally binding executive agreement\" that outlines the future of U.S.-Afghan relations and designated Afghanistan a [[major non-NATO ally]]. \"It is difficult to understand how any international agreement negotiated, signed, and authored only by our executive branch of government can be construed as legally binding in our constitutional system,\" Webb argues.<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" />\n\nFinally, Webb identifies the U.S. intervention in Libya as a troubling historical precedent. \"The issue in play in Libya was not simply whether the president should ask Congress for a declaration of war. Nor was it wholly about whether Obama violated the edicts of the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]], which in this writer's view he clearly did. The issue that remains to be resolved is whether a president can unilaterally begin, and continue, a military campaign for reasons that he alone defines as meeting the demanding standards of a vital national interest worth of risking American lives and expending billions of dollars of taxpayer money.\"<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" /> When the military campaign lasted months, President [[Barack Obama]] did not seek approval of Congress to continue military activity.<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" />\n\n==Government structure==\n===Executive branch and trumps farts===\n====Presidential incompetency====\nOne difficulty of the American government is that the lack of oversight for Presidents offers no safeguards for presidential incompetency.

In addition, the presidency is the head of a [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]]. As a result, it is tough for one person to manage disparate tasks, in one view.

Clearly the record of past presidents confirms this, and that presidents who have had extensive diplomatic, military, and foreign policy experience have been the exception, not the rule. In recent years, presidents had relatively more experience in such tasks as peanut farming, [[Show business|acting]] and governing [[State government (United States)|governorships]] than in international affairs. It has been debated whether voters are sufficiently skillful to assess the foreign policy potential of presidential candidates, since foreign policy experience is only one of a long list of attributes in which voters tend to select candidates.<ref name=\"tws21dec314a\"/> President Obama has been widely criticized as too inexperienced for the job, having only served in government for three years before his presidential election. However, party leadership and donors were adamant in their advocacy due his broad appeal, leading to a nominee with little experience.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-01-16-obama-experience-cover_x.htm | title=The big question about Barack Obama | work=USA Today | accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, an increasing difficulty for providing well-versed Presidents is that the American people in recent years are, in increasing numbers, more distrustful of their government and longterm, career politicians.

September 11, 2001 precipitated this change, where \"powers quickly shifted quickly to the Presidency as the call went up for centralized decision making in a traumatized nation where, quick, decisive action was considered necessary. It was considered politically dangerous and even unpatriotic to question this shift, lest one be accused of impeding national safety during a time of war.\"<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\">{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=Jim|title=Congressional Abdication|journal=The National Interest|date=March\u2013April 2013|issue= 124|url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/congressional-abdication-8138|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSince that time, Webb thinks Congress has become largely irrelevant in shaping and executing of U.S. foreign policy. He cites the [[Strategic Framework Agreement]] (SFA), the [[U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement]], and the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] as examples of growing legislative irrelevance. Regarding the SFA, \"Congress was not consulted in any meaningful way. Once the document was finalized, Congress was not given the opportunity to debate the merits of the agreement, which was specifically designed to shape the structure of our long-term relations in Iraq\" (11). \"Congress did not debate or vote on this agreement, which set U.S. policy toward an unstable regime in an unstable region of the world.\"<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" /> The [[Iraqi Parliament]], by contrast, voted on the measure twice. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement is described by the Obama Administration has a \"legally binding executive agreement\" that outlines the future of U.S.-Afghan relations and designated Afghanistan a [[major non-NATO ally]]. \"It is difficult to understand how any international agreement negotiated, signed, and authored only by our executive branch of government can be construed as legally binding in our constitutional system,\" Webb argues.<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" />\n\nFinally, Webb identifies the U.S. intervention in Libya as a troubling historical precedent. \"The issue in play in Libya was not simply whether the president should ask Congress for a declaration of war. Nor was it wholly about whether Obama violated the edicts of the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]], which in this writer's view he clearly did. The issue that remains to be resolved is whether a president can unilaterally begin, and continue, a military campaign for reasons that he alone defines as meeting the demanding standards of a vital national interest worth of risking American lives and expending billions of dollars of taxpayer money.\"<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" /> When the military campaign lasted months, President [[Barack Obama]] did not seek approval of Congress to continue military activity.<ref name=\"Jim Webb NA\" />\n\n==Government structure==\n===Executive branch===\n====Presidential incompetency====\nOne difficulty of the American government is that the lack of oversight for Presidents offers no safeguards for presidential incompetency.
