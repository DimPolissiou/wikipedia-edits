The 9\u20139\u20139 Plan gets Washington D.C. out of the business of picking winners and losers, using the tax code to dole out favors, and dividing the country with class warfare. It is fair, simple, transparent and efficient. It taxes everything once and nothing twice. It taxes the broadest possible base at the lowest possible rates. It is neutral with respect to savings and consumption, capital and labor, imports and exports and whether companies pay dividends or retain earnings.<ref name=autogenerated3 /></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the analysis of Howard Gleckman the [[Tax Policy Center]],\n\n<blockquote>When you get right down to it, Cain's [9\u20139\u20139] plan is a 25 percent flat-rate consumption tax \u2014 not all that different from the FAIR tax that he says is his ultimate goal. This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again at the cash register as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services.

These are split between gender-inclusive clubs recognized by the College, and unrecognized single-gender clubs which are subject to College sanctions. The oldest, dating to 1791, are the traditionally all-male final clubs.

These are split between gender-inclusive clubs recognized by the College, and unrecognized single-gender clubs which are subject to College sanctions. The oldest, dating to 1791, are the traditionally all-male final clubs. Fraternities were prominent in the late 19th century as well, until their initial expulsions and then eventual resurrection off Harvard's campus in the 1990s. From 1991 onwards, all-female final clubs as well as sororities began to appear. Between 1984 and 2018, no social organizations were recognized by the school due to the clubs' refusal to become gender-inclusive. \n\nBeginning with the [[Spee Club]] in 2015, a number of formerly single-gender organizations began to admit new members regardless of gender.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/11/4/spee-elects-coed-class/ |title = Spee Club Elects First Class of Men and Women &#124; News &#124; the Harvard Crimson}}</ref> In 2016, Harvard announced sanctions on members of remaining single-gender clubs, aiming to push them to become coed.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/12/6/sanctions-explainer-v2/ |title = Harvard's Sanctions, Explained (Again) &#124; News &#124; the Harvard Crimson}}</ref> Eventually, on September 8, 2018, Harvard announced that it would recognize an initial list of fifteen social organizations that either already were gender-inclusive or had committed to becoming gender-inclusive.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/9/8/15-groups-recognized/ |title = Fox, Delphic-Bee Clubs Among 15 Social Groups to Promise Co-Ed Status, Escaping Sanctions &#124; News &#124; the Harvard Crimson}}</ref> Eleven clubs remain single-gender, and remain unrecognized by the College. \n\n== Origins ==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\nThe historical basis for the name \"final clubs\" dates to the late 19th century, a time when Harvard had a variety of clubs for students of each class year.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} During that period, Harvard College freshmen could join a freshman club, then a \"waiting club,\" and eventually, as they neared completion of their studies, a \"final club.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Hence, students of different years joined different clubs, and the \"final clubs\" were so named because they were the last social club a person could join before graduation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Harvard's final clubs for women date to 1991 with the founding of the Bee Club.<ref name=CrimsonFeltonWhartonRetrosp>{{cite journal | authors = Felton, Lena K. & Wharton, Molly E. | date = October 10, 2013 | title=Female Final Clubs: A Retrospection | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/10/10/female-final-clubs-a-retrospection/ | journal = [[The Harvard Crimson]] | format = online article  | access-date=May 11, 2016 | quote =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Francis | first=A.M. | title=Secret Societies Vol. 3: The Collegiate Secret Societies of America | publisher=LULU Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-312-93285-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp5sCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 | accessdate=June 2, 2016 | page=8}}</ref>\n\nMany of the clubs were founded in the 19th century, after Harvard banned traditional fraternities in the 1850s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Of the final clubs still in existence (see below), only the Fox was initially founded as a final club.

According to Vodouists, Bondye does not intercede in human affairs, and thus they direct their worship toward spirits subservient to Bondye, called [[loa]].{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=48}} Every loa is responsible for a particular aspect of life, with the dynamic and changing personalities of each loa reflecting the many possibilities inherent to the aspects of life over which they preside.{{sfn|Brown|1991|p=6}} To navigate daily life, vodouists cultivate personal relationships with the loa through the presentation of offerings, the creation of personal altars and devotional objects, and participation in elaborate ceremonies of music, dance, and [[spirit possession]].{{sfn|Brown|1991|p=4\u20137}}\n\nVodou originated in what is now [[Benin]] and developed in the [[French colonial empire]] in the 18th century among West African peoples who were enslaved, when African religious practice was actively suppressed, and enslaved Africans were [[Forced conversion|forced to convert]] to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Religious practices of contemporary Vodou are descended from, and closely related to, [[West African Vodun]] as practiced by the [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]].

These two peoples composed a sizable number of the early enslaved population in [[St. Dominigue]]. In Haiti, practitioners occasionally use \"Vodou\" to refer to Haitian religion generically, but it is more common for practitioners to refer to themselves as those who \"serve the spirits\" (''s\u00e8vit\u00e8'') by participating in ritual ceremonies, usually called a \"service to the loa\" (''s\u00e8vis lwa'') or an \"African service\" (''s\u00e8vis gine'').{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} These terms also refer to the religion as a whole.\n\nOutside of Haiti, the term ''Vodou'' refers to the entirety of traditional Haitian religious practice.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} \nOriginally written as ''vodun'', it is first recorded in ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', a 1658 document written by the King of [[Allada]]'s ambassador to the court of [[Philip IV of Spain]].{{sfn|Blier|1995|p=61}} In the following centuries, ''Vodou'' was eventually taken up by non-Haitians as a generic descriptive term for traditional Haitian religion.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} There are many used orthographies for this word. Today, the spelling ''Vodou'' is the most commonly accepted orthography in English.{{sfn|Cosentino|1995a|p=xiv}} Other potential spellings include ''Vodoun'', ''vaudou'', and ''voodoo'', with ''vau-'' or ''vou-'' prefix variants reflecting French orthography, and a final ''-n'' reflecting the nasal vowel in West African or older, non-urbanized, Haitian Creole pronunciations.\n\nThe spelling ''voodoo'', once very common, is now generally avoided by Haitian practitioners and scholars when referring to the Haitian religion.{{sfn|Courlander|1988|p=88}}{{sfn|Lane|1949|p=1162}}{{sfn|Thompson|1983|p=163}}{{sfn|Cosentino|1988|p=77}} This is both to avoid confusion with [[Louisiana Voodoo]],{{sfn|Fandrich|2007|p=780}} a related but distinct set of religious practices, as well as to separate Haitian Vodou from the negative connotations and misconceptions the term \"voodoo\" has acquired in popular culture.{{sfn|Fandrich|2007|p=775}}{{sfn|Hurbon|1995|p=181-197}} Over the years, practitioners and their supporters have called on various institutions including the [[Associated Press]] to redress this misrepresentation by adopting \"Vodou\" in reference to the Haitian religion. In October 2012, the [[Library of Congress]] decided to change their [[subject heading]] from \"Voodooism\" to Vodou in response to a petition by a group of scholars and practitioners in collaboration with [[KOSANBA]], the scholarly association for the study of Haitian Vodou based at University of California Santa Barbara.<ref>For a fuller description of transitions in spelling, see: [http://www.bulldozia.com/projects/index.php?id=583 From Voodoo to Vodou]</ref>\n\n==Beliefs==\n{{Voodoo sidebar| Beliefs}}\n[[File:PortAuPrinceMarche.jpg|right|thumb|Vodou paraphernalia, [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti.]]\nVodou is popularly described as not simply a religion, but rather an experience that ties body and soul together. The concept of tying that exists in Haitian religious culture is derived from the Congolese tradition of ''kanga'', the practice of tying one's soul to something tangible. This \"tying of soul\" is evident in many Haitian Vodou practices that are still exercised today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rey|first=Terry|author2=Karen Richman|title=The Somatics of Syncretism: Tying Body and Soul in Haitian Religion|journal=Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses|year=2010|volume=39|issue=3|pages=279\u2013403|doi=10.1177/0008429810373321|url=http://sir.sagepub.com/content/41/2/231.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits===\nVodouisants believe in a Supreme God called Bondye, from the [[French language|French]] (''Bon Dieu'' = Good God).<ref>Haitian Vodouisants believe in Damballah. In her book \"Tell My Horse\", [[Zora Neale Hurston]] writes that \"Damballah is the highest and most powerful of all the gods, but never is he referred to as the father of the gods as was Jupiter, Odin, and great Zeus...whenever any of the gods meet him they bow themselves and sing, \"Ohe', Ohe'! Ce Papa nous qui pe' passe'!\" (It is our papa who passes.)\" (Hurston, pg. 118</ref> When it came in contact with Roman Catholicism, the Supreme Creator was associated with the [[Christianity|Christian]] God, and the ''loa'' associated with the [[saints]].\n\n====Loa====\n[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|right|thumbnail|A large sequined Vodou \"drapo\" or flag by the artist George Valris, depicting the [[veve]], or symbol, of the loa [[Loko Atison]].]]\nSince Bondye (God) is considered unreachable, Vodouisants aim their prayers to lesser entities, the spirits known as [[loa]], or ''mist\u00e8''. The most notable loa include [[Papa Legba]] (guardian of the crossroads), [[Erzulie#Ma\u00eetresse Mambo Erzulie Fr\u00e9da Dahomey|Erzulie Freda]] (the spirit of love), [[Simbi]] (the spirit of rain and magicians), [[Azaka Medeh|Kouzin Zaka]] (the spirit of agriculture), and [[Marassa Jumeaux|The Marasa]], divine twins considered to be the first children of Bondye.{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=54}}\n\nThese loa can be divided into 21 nations, which include the Petro, Rada, Congo, and Nago.{{sfn|Alvarado|2011}}\n\nEach of the loa is associated with a particular Roman Catholic saint. For example, Legba is associated with [[Anthony the Hermit|St. Anthony the Hermit]], and [[Damballa]] is associated with [[Saint Patrick|St. Patrick]].<ref>Simpson, George (1978). Black Religions in the New World.

Each family is associated with a specific aspect, for instance the Ogou family are soldiers, the Ezili govern the feminine spheres of life, the Azaka govern agriculture, the Ghede govern the sphere of death and fertility.\n\nA [[Simbi]] is a Loa which represents magic. A Simbi is portrayed as a green snake.

There is also a notion of relative propriety\u2014and what is appropriate to someone with [[Damballah|Dambala Wedo]]  as their head may be different from someone with [[Ogoun|Ogou Feray]] as their head. For example, one spirit is very cool and the other is very hot. Coolness overall is valued, and so is the ability and inclination to protect oneself and one's own if necessary. Love and support within the family of the Vodou society seem to be the most important considerations. Generosity in giving to the community and to the poor is also an important value. One's blessings come through the community, and one should be willing to give back. There are no \"solitaries\" in Vodou\u2014only people separated geographically from their elders and house. A person without a relationship of some kind with elders does not practice Vodou as it is understood in Haiti and among Haitians; additionally, Haitian Vodou emphasizes the 'wholeness of being' not just with elders and the material world, but also unity with the interconnected forces of nature.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Michel|first1=Claudine|title=Women's Moral and Spiritual Leadership in Haitian Vodou: The Voice of Mama Lola and Karen McCarthy Brown|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|date=September 1, 2001|volume=17|issue=2}}</ref>\n\nThere is a diversity of practice in Vodou across the country of Haiti and the Haitian diaspora. For instance, in the north of Haiti, the ''lave t\u00e8t'' (\"head washing\")<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daniels|first1=Kyrah Malika|title=The Coolness of Cleansing: Sacred Waters, Medicinal Plants and Ritual Baths of Haiti and Peru|journal=Revista: Harvard Review of Latin America|date=Fall 2016|volume=16|issue=1|pages=21\u201324}}</ref> or ''kanzwe'' may be the only initiation, as it is in the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Puerto Rico,  whereas in Port-au-Prince and the south they practice the ''kanzo'' rites<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Richman|first1=Karen E.|title=Peasants, Migrants and the Discovery of African Traditions: Ritual and Social Change in Lowland Haiti|journal=Journal of Religion in Africa|date=August 1, 2007|volume=37|issue=3|pages=383\u2013387}}</ref> with three grades of initiation{{spaced ndash}}kanzo senp, si pwen, and asogwe{{spaced ndash}}and the latter is the most familiar mode of practice outside Haiti. Some lineages combine both, as [[Mambo (Vodou)|Mambo]] [[Katherine Dunham]] reports from her personal experience in her book ''Island Possessed''.\n\nWhile the overall tendency in Vodou is conservative in accord with its African roots, there is no singular, definitive form, only what is right in a particular house or lineage. Small details of service and the spirits served vary from house to house, and information in books or on the internet therefore may seem contradictory. There is no central authority or  \"[[pope]]\" in Haitian Vodou, since \"every [[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]] and houngan is the head of their own house\", as a popular Haitian saying goes. Another consideration in terms of Haitian diversity are the many sects besides the S\u00e8vi Gine in Haiti such as the Makaya, Rara, and other secret societies, each of which has its own distinct pantheon of spirits.\n\n===Soul===\nAccording to Vodou, the soul consists of two aspects, in a type of [[soul dualism]]: the ''gros bon ange'' (big good angel) and the ''ti bon ange'' (little good angel). The ''gros bon ange'' is the part of the soul that is essentially responsible for the basic biological functions, such as the flow of blood through the body and breathing. On the other hand, the ''ti bon ange'' is the source of personality, character and willpower. \"As the ''gros bon ange'' provides each person with the power to act, it is the ''ti bon ange'' that molds the individual sentiment within each act\".<ref>Thomas, Kette. \"Haitian Zombie, Myth, and Modern Identity.\" CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture 12.2 (2010): n. pag. Web. 29 Oct. 2013.</ref> While the latter is an essential element for the survival of one's individual identity, it is not necessary to keep the body functioning properly in biological terms, and therefore a person can continue to exist without it.\n\n==Practices==\n\n===Liturgy and practice===\n[[File:JacmelVodou.jpg|right|thumb|Vodou ceremony, [[Jacmel]], [[Haiti]].]]\nA Haitian Vodou temple is called a [[Peristil]].{{sfn|Kilson|Rotberg|1976|p=345}} After a day or two of preparation setting up altars at an Hounfour, and ritually preparing and cooking fowl and other foods, a Haitian Vodou service begins with a series of prayers and songs in French, then a litany in [[Haitian Creole]] and [[Haitian Vodoun Culture Language|Langaj]] that goes through all the European and African saints and loa honored by the house, and then a series of verses for all the main spirits of the house. This is called the \"Priy\u00e8 Gine\" or the African Prayer. After more introductory songs, beginning with saluting Hounto, the spirit of the drums, the songs for all the individual spirits are sung, starting with the [[Legba]] family through all the Rada spirits, then there is a break and the Petro part of the service begins, which ends with the songs for the [[Gu\u00e9d\u00e9|Gede]] family.\n\nAs the songs are sung, participants believe that spirits come to visit the ceremony, by taking [[Spirit possession#In Haitian Vodou and African traditions|possession]] of individuals and speaking and acting through them. When a ceremony is made, only the family of those possessed is benefited.  At this time it is believed that devious mambo or houngan can take away the luck of the worshippers through particular actions. For instance, if a priest asks for a drink of champagne, a wise participant refuses. Sometimes these ceremonies may include dispute among the singers as to how a hymn is to be sung. In Haiti, these Vodou ceremonies, depending on the Priest or Priestess, may be more organized.  But in the United States, many vodouists and clergy take it as a sort of non-serious party or \"folly\". In a serious rite, each spirit is saluted and greeted by the initiates present and gives readings, advice, and cures to those who ask for help. Many hours later, as morning dawns, the last song is sung, the guests leave, and the exhausted hounsis, houngans, and mambos can go to sleep.[[File:VOODOO PERISTILE Croix des Mission, Haiti 1980.jpg|thumb|VOODOO PERISTILE Croix des Mission, Haiti 1980]]\n\nVodou practitioners believe that if one follows all taboos imposed by their particular loa and is punctilious about all offerings and ceremonies, the loa will aid them. Vodou practitioners also believe that if someone ignores their loa it can result in sickness, the failure of crops, the death of relatives, and other misfortunes.<ref>Simpson, George (1978). ''Black Religions in the New World''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 86.</ref>\nAnimals are sometimes sacrificed in Haitian Vodou. A variety of animals are sacrificed, such as pigs, goats, chickens, and bulls.\n\"The intent and emphasis of sacrifice is not upon the death of the animal, it is upon the transfusion of its life to the loa; for the understanding is that flesh and blood are of the essence of life and vigor, and these will restore the divine energy of the god.\"<ref>[[Deren, Maya]] (1953). ''[[Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti]]''. New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 216.</ref>\n\nOn the individual's household level, a Vodouisant or \"s\u00e8vit\u00e8\"/\"serviteur\" may have one or more tables set out for their ancestors and the spirit or spirits that they serve with pictures or statues of the spirits, perfumes, foods, and other things favored by their spirits. The most basic set up is just a white candle and a clear glass of water and perhaps flowers. On a particular spirit's day, one lights a candle and says an [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] and [[Hail Mary]], salutes Papa Legba and asks him to open the gate, and then one salutes and speaks to the particular spirit as an elder family member. Ancestors are approached directly, without the mediating of Papa Legba, since they are said to be \"in the blood\".\n\nIn a Vodou home, the only recognizable religious items are often images of saints and candles with a rosary. In other homes, where people may more openly show their devotion to the spirits, noticeable items may include an altar with Catholic saints and iconographies, rosaries, bottles, jars, rattles, perfumes, oils, and dolls. Some Vodou devotees have less paraphernalia in their homes because they had no option but to hide their beliefs. Haiti is a rural society and the cult of ancestors guard the traditional values of the peasant class.  The ancestors are linked to family life and the land. Haitian peasants serve the spirits daily and sometime gather with their extended family on special occasions for ceremonies, which may celebrate the birthday of a spirit or a particular event. In very remote areas, people may walk for days to partake in ceremonies that take place as often as several times a month. Vodou is closely tied to the division and administration of land as well as to the residential economy. The cemeteries and many crossroads are meaningful places for worship: the cemetery acts as a repository of spirits and the crossroads acts as points of access to the world of the invisible.<ref>Michel, Claudine (Aug 1996). \"Of Worlds Seen and Unseen: The Educational Character of Haitian Vodou\".

They also conduct ceremonies that usually take place \"amba peristil\" (under a Vodou temple). However, non-Houngan or non-Mambo as Vodouisants are not [[Initiation|initiated]], and are referred to as being \"bossale\"; it is not a requirement to be an initiate to serve one's spirits. There are clergy in Haitian vodou whose responsibility it is to preserve the rituals and songs and maintain the relationship between the spirits and the community as a whole (though some of this is the responsibility of the whole community as well). They are entrusted with leading the service of all of the spirits of their lineage. Sometimes they are \"called\" to serve in a process called ''being reclaimed'', which they may resist at first.{{sfn|McAlister|1993|pp=10\u201327}} Below the houngans and mambos are the hounsis, who are initiates who act as assistants during ceremonies and who are dedicated to their own personal mysteries.\n\nThe ''asson'' (calabash rattle) is the symbol for one who has acquired the status of houngan or mambo (priest or priestess) in Haitian Vodou. The calabash is taken from the calabasse courante or calabasse ordinaire tree, which is associated with Danbhalah-W\u00e9do. A houngan or mambo traditionally holds the asson in their hand, along with a clochette (bell). The asson contains stones and snake vertebrae that give it its sound. The asson is covered with a web of porcelain beads.<ref>Rigaud, Milo (2001). Secrets of Voodoo. New York: City Lights Publishers. pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nA ''bokor'' is a sorcerer or magician who casts spells on request. They are not necessarily priests, and may be practitioners of \"darker\" things, and are often not accepted by the mambo or the houngan.\n \n''Bokor'' can also be a Haitian term for a Vodou priest or other practitioner who works with both the light and dark arts of magic.<ref>[[Bokor]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=December 2017}} The bokor, in that sense, deals in ''baka' (malevolent spirits contained in the form of various animals).<ref>Deren, Maya (1953).

Some Vodou families believe that a person's spirit leaves the body, but is trapped in water, over mountains, in grottoes\u2014or anywhere else a voice may call out and echo\u2014for one year and one day. After then, a ceremonial celebration commemorates the deceased for being released into the world to live again. In the words of Edwidge Danticat, author of \"A Year and a Day\"\u2014an article about death in Haitian society published in the New Yorker\u2014and a Vodou practitioner, \"The year-and-a-day commemoration is seen, in families that believe in it and practice it, as a tremendous obligation, an honorable duty, in part because it assures a transcendental continuity of the kind that has kept us Haitians, no matter where we live, linked to our ancestors for generations.\" After the soul of the deceased leaves its resting place, it can occupy trees, and even become a hushed voice on the wind. Though other Haitian and West African families believe there is an afterlife in paradise in the realm of God.<ref>Danticat, Edwidge. \"A Year And A Day.\" The New Yorker 17 Jan. 2011: 19.

The God-Creator is the [[cosmogonical]] principle and does not trifle with the mundane; the voduns(s) are the God-Actor(s) who actually govern earthly issues. The [[Dahomey mythology|pantheon of vodoun]] is quite large and complex.\n\nWest African Vodun has its primary emphasis on ancestors, with each family of spirits having its own specialized priest and priestess, which are often hereditary. In many African clans, deities might include [[Mami Wata]], who are gods and goddesses of the waters; [[Legba]], who in some clans is virile and young in contrast to the old man form he takes in Haiti and in many parts of Togo; [[Ogoun|Gu]] (or Ogoun), ruling iron and smithcraft; [[Sakpata]], who rules diseases; and many other spirits distinct in their own way to West Africa.\n\nA significant portion of Haitian Vodou often overlooked by scholars until recently is the input from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]]. The entire northern area of Haiti is heavily influenced by [[Kongo people|Kongo practices]]. In northern Haiti, it is often called the [[Kongo Rite]] or Lemba, from the Lemba rituals of the [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] area and [[Mayombe]]. In the south, Kongo influence is called [[Petwo]] (Petro). Many loa (a Kikongo term) are of Kongo origin such as Basimba belonging to the [[Basimba people]] and the Lemba.<ref>{{citation |title= The Book of Life, Knowledge and Confidence| publisher= Pacific Press|year=2012| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1471734633|pp=112}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the Vodun religion (distinct from Haitian Vodou) already existed in the United States previously to Haitian immigration, having been brought by enslaved West Africans, specifically from the Ewe, Fon, Mina, Kabaye, and Nago groups. Some of the more enduring forms survive in the [[Gullah|Gullah Islands]].\n\nEuropean [[colonialism]], followed by totalitarian regimes in West Africa, suppressed Vodun as well as other forms of the religion. However, because the Vodun deities are born to each African clan-group, and its clergy is central to maintaining the moral, social, and political order and ancestral foundation of its villagers, it proved to be impossible to eradicate the religion.\n\n===1685-1791: Vodou in colonial Saint-Domingue===\nThe majority of the Africans who were brought as slaves to Haiti were from Western and Central Africa. The survival of the belief systems in the [[New World]] is remarkable, although the traditions have changed with time and have even taken on some Catholic forms of worship.{{sfn|Stevens-Arroyo|2002|}} Two important factors, however, characterize the uniqueness of Haitian Vodou as compared to African Vodun; the transplanted Africans of Haiti, similar to those of [[Cuba]] and Brazil, were obliged to disguise their loa or spirits as [[Roman Catholic]] [[saint]]s, an element of a process called [[syncretism]].\n\nTwo keys provisions of the [[Code Noir]] by King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1685 severely limited the ability of enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue to practice African religions. First, the Code Noir explicitly forbade the open practice of all African religions.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Second, it forced all slaveholders to convert their slaves to Catholicism within eight days of their arrival in Saint-Domingue.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Despite French efforts, enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue were able to cultivate their own religious practices.  Enslaved Africans spent their Sunday and holiday nights expressing themselves. While bodily autonomy was strictly controlled during the day at night, the enslaved Africans wielded a degree of agency. They began to continue their religious practices but also used the time to cultivate community and reconnect the fragmented pieces of their various heritages. These late night reprieves were a form of resistance against white domination and also created community cohesion between people from vastly different ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"Slavery and Slave Society,\" in the Making of Haiti|last=Fick|first=Carolyn|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}</ref> While Catholicism was used as a tool for suppression, enslaved Haitians, partly out of necessity, would go on to incorporate aspects of Christianity into their Vodou.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} [[M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Louis \u00c9lie Moreau de Saint-M\u00e9ry]], a French observer writing in 1797, noted this religious [[syncretism]], commenting that the Catholic-style altars and votive candles used by Africans in Haiti were meant to conceal the Africanness of the religion,{{sfn|Moreau de Saint-M\u00e9ry|1797}} but the connection goes much further than that.

Vodou thus gave slaves a way both a symbolic and physical space of subversion against their French masters.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPolitical leaders such as [[Boukman Dutty]], a slave who helped plan the 1791 revolt, also served as religious leader, connecting Vodou spirituality with political action.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|last=Dubois|first=Laurent|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}</ref> Bois Caiman has often been cited as the start of the [[Haitian Revolution]] but the slave uprising had already been planned weeks in advance,<ref name=\":1\" /> proving that the thirst for freedom had always been present. The revolution would free the Haitian people from French [[French colonial empires|colonial]] rule in 1804 and establish the first black people's [[republic]] in the history of the world and the second independent nation in the Americas. Haitian nationalists have frequently drawn inspiration by imagining their ancestors' gathering of unity and courage. Since the 1990s, some neo-evangelicals have interpreted the politico-religious ceremony at Bois Ca\u00efman to have been a pact with demons. This extremist view is not considered credible by mainstream Protestants, however conservatives such as Pat Robertson repeat the idea.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McAlister|first=Elizabeth|title=From Slave Revolt to a Blood Pact with Satan: The Evangelical Rewriting of Haitian History|journal=Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|pages=187\u2013215|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&context=elizabeth_mcalister|doi=10.1177/0008429812441310}}</ref>\n\n===Vodou in 19th-century Haiti===\n\n====1804: Liberty, Isolation, Boycott====\nOn 1 January 1804 the former slave Jean-Jaqcues Dessalines (as [[Jacques I]]) declared the independence of St. Domingue as the First Black Empire; two years later, after his assassination, it became the Republic of Haiti. This was the second nation to gain independence from European rule (after the United States), and the only state to have arisen from the liberation of slaves. No nation recognized the new state, which was instead met with isolation and boycotts. This exclusion from the global market led to major economic difficulties for the new state.\n\nMany of the leaders of the revolt disassociated themselves from Vodou. They strived to be accepted as Frenchmen and good Catholics rather than as free Haitians. Yet most practitioners of Vodou saw, and still see, no contradiction between Vodou and Catholicism, and also take part in Catholic masses.\n\n====1835: Vodou made punishable, secret societies====\nThe new Haitian state did not recognize Vodou as an official religion. In 1835, the government made practising Vodou punishable. Secret Vodou societies therefore continued to be important. These societies also provided the poor with protection and solidarity against the exercising of power by the elite. They had their own symbols and codes.\n\n===20th century to the present===\nToday, Vodou is practiced not only by Haitians but by Americans and people of many other nations who have been exposed to Haitian culture. Related forms of Vodou exist in other countries in the forms of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Dominican Vud\u00fa|Vud\u00fa]], Cuban [[Cuban Vod\u00fa|Vod\u00fa]],{{sfn|Stevens-Arroyo|2002|pp=37\u201358}}, [[Brazil|Brazilian]] [[Candombl\u00e9 Jej\u00e9|Vodum]], and also in places to which Haitians have immigrated. There has been a re-emergence of the Vodun traditions in the United States, maintaining the same ritual and cosmological elements as in West Africa.\n\nFormer president of Haiti [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] (also known as Papa Doc) played a role in elevating the status of Vodou into a national doctrine. Duvalier was involved in the noirisme movement and hoped to re-value cultural practices that had their origins in Africa. Duvalier manipulated Vodou to suit his purposes throughout his Reign of Terror. He organized the Vodou priests in the countryside and had them advance his agenda, instilling fear through promoting the belief that he had supernatural powers playing into the religion's mysticism.<ref>Time Magazine (Jan 17, 2011). \"The Death and Legacy of Papa Doc Duvalier\" Retrieved May 13, 2015.</ref><ref>Apter, Andrew (May 2002). \"On African Origins: Creolization and Connaissance in Haitian Vodou\". American Ethnologist (Wiley on behalf of the American Anthropological Association) 29. Retrieved Dec 8, 2013.</ref>\n\nMany Haitians involved in the practice of Vodou have been initiated as Houngans or Mambos. In January 2010, after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]] traditional ceremonies were organized to appease the spirits and seek the blessing of ancestors for the Haitians. Also a ''\"purification ceremony\"'' was planned for Haiti.\n\n=== Controversy after the 2010 earthquake ===\nFollowing the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], there were verbal and physical attacks against vodou practitioners in Haiti perpetrated by those who felt that vodouists were partially responsible for the natural disaster. Furthermore, during a [[2010s Haiti cholera outbreak|Cholera outbreak in 2010]] several Vodou priests were lynched by mobs who believed them to be spreading the disease.{{sfn|Valme|2010|}}\n\n==Demographics and geographic distribution==\nBecause of the religious syncretism between Catholicism and Vodou, it is difficult to estimate the number of Vodouists in Haiti. The CIA currently estimates that approximately 50% of Haiti's population practices Vodou, with nearly all Vodouists participating in one of Haiti's Christian denominations.{{sfn|CIA World Factbook}}hi\n\n==Gallery of Haitian Vodou objects==\n<gallery>\nFile:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou.jpg|Ceremonial suit\nFile:Haitian Vodou fetish statue devil with twelve eyes.jpg|Statue of a [[djab]], a quick-working wild spirit.\nFile:Antique Haitian Vodou ceremonial drum.jpg|Ceremonial drum\nFile:Trop Pou Te Haitian Vodou banners.jpg|Banner reading \"Trop Pou Te\" in the [[Haitian Creole language]]\nFile:Vodou mirror museum exhibit.jpg|Mirrors represent doorways to the world of the dead.\n</gallery>\n\n==Misconceptions==\n[[File:Affaire de Bizoton 1864.png|thumb|The ''Affaire de Bizoton'' of 1864. The murder and alleged canibalization of a woman's body by eight voodoo devotees caused a scandal worldwide and was taken as proof of the evil nature of voodoo.]]\n\nVodou has often been associated in popular culture with [[Satanism]], [[witchcraft]], [[zombie]]s and \"voodoo dolls\". Zombie creation has been referenced within rural Haitian culture,{{sfn|Davis|1988|}} but is not a part of Vodou. Such manifestations fall under the auspices of the ''[[bokor]]'' or sorcerer, rather than the priest of the loa. The practice of sticking pins in voodoo dolls has history in folk magic. \"Voodoo dolls\" are often associated with [[Louisiana Voodoo|New Orleans Voodoo]] and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] as well the magical devices of the [[poppet]] and the ''[[nkisi]]'' or ''bocio'' of West and Central Africa.\n\nThe general fear of Vodou in the US can be traced back to the end of the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791-1804). There is a legend that Haitians were able to beat the French during the Haitian Revolution because their Vodou deities made them invincible. The US, seeing the tremendous potential Vodou had for rallying its followers and inciting them to action, feared the events at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] could spill over onto American soil. After the Haitian Revolution many Haitians fled as refugees to New Orleans. Free and enslaved Haitians who moved to New Orleans brought their religious beliefs with them and reinvigorated the Voodoo practices that were already present in the city. Eventually, Voodoo in New Orleans became hidden and the magical components were left present in the public sphere. This created what is called hoodoo in the southern part of the United States. Because hoodoo is folk magic, Voodoo and Afro-diasporic religions in the U.S. became synonymous with fraud. This is one origin of the stereotype that Haitian Vodou, New Orleans Voodoo, and hoodoo are all tricks used to make money off the gullible.<ref>Long, Carolyn Morrow (Oct 2002). \"Perceptions of New Orleans Voodoo: Sin, Fraud, Entertainment and Religion\". Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions (University of California Pres) 6. Retrieved Dec 5, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe elites preferred to view it as folklore in an attempt to render it relatively harmless as a curiosity that might continue to inspire music and dance.<ref>Bellegarde-Smith, P. (2006). ''Haitian Vodou: Spirit, Myth and Reality''. (p. 25).  Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press</ref>\n\nFearing an uprising in opposition to the [[US occupation of Haiti]] (1915-1934), political and religious elites, along with Hollywood and the film industry, sought to trivialize the practice of Vodou. Hollywood often depicts Vodou as evil and having ties to Satanic practices in movies such as ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'', ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', and in children's movies like ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', though this last example countered this trope with a kindly voodoo priestess who helps the main characters.\n\nIn 2010, a [[2010 Haiti earthquake|7.0 earthquake]] that devastated Haiti brought negative attention to Vodou. [[Televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]] stated that the country had cursed itself after the events at Bois Ca\u00efman, because he claimed they had engaged in Satanic practices in the ceremony preceding the Haitian Revolution. \"They were under the heel of the French, you know, Napoleon the third and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince.' True story. And so the devil said, 'Ok it's a deal.' And they kicked the French out. The Haitians revolted and got something themselves free. But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-12017-504083.html|title=Pat Robertson: Haiti \"Cursed\" After \"Pact to the Devil\" - Crimesider - CBS News|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=2 August 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106024225/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-12017-504083.html|archivedate=6 November 2012}}</ref><ref>See also (or, instead) this [[CBS News]] (\"\u00a9 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.\") web page: {{cite web\n |url         = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pat-robertson-haiti-cursed-after-pact-to-the-devil/\n |title       = Pat Robertson: Haiti \"Cursed\" After \"Pact to the Devil\"\n |author      = Smith, Ryan\n |date        = January 13, 2010\n |accessdate  = January 7, 2015\n |archivedate = January 7, 2015\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/6VPecOTR3?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pat-robertson-haiti-cursed-after-pact-to-the-devil/\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>\n\n==KOSANBA==\nScholarly research on Vodou and other African spiritual retentions in Haiti started in the early 20th century with chronicles such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]]'s \"Tell My Horse\", amongst others.

In April 1997, thirteen scholars gathered at the University of California Santa Barbara for a colloquium on Haitian Vodou.  From that meeting the ''Congress of Santa Barbara'' was created, also known as [[KOSANBA]].{{sfn|KOSANBA|}}  These scholars felt there was a need for access to scholarly resources and course offerings studying Haitian Vodou, and pledged, \"...to create a space where scholarship on Vodou can be augmented.\"<ref name=\"ucsb.edu\">{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613040659/http://research.ucsb.edu/cbs/projects/haiti/kosanba/declaration.html |title = KOSANBA: A Scholarly Association for the Study of Haitian Vodou}}</ref> As further described in the Congress\u2019 declaration:\n\n\"The presence, role, and importance of Vodou in Haitian history, society, and culture are unarguable, and recognizably a part of the national ethos. The impact of the religion qua spiritual and intellectual disciplines on popular national institutions, human and gender relations, the family, that plastic arts, philosophy and ethics, oral and written literature, language, popular and sacred music, science and technology and the healing arts, is indisputable. It is the belief of the Congress that Vodou plays, and shall continue to play, a major role in the grand scheme of Haitian development and in the socio-economic, political, and cultural arenas.  Development, when real and successful, always comes from the modernization of ancestral traditions, anchored in the rich cultural expressions of a people.\"<ref name=\"ucsb.edu\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2012, KOSANBA successfully petitioned the Library of Congress to change the terms \"voodoo\" and \"voodooism\" to the correct spelling \"Vodou\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100611173100/http://research.ucsb.edu/cbs/projects/haiti/kosanba/index.html]</ref>\n\n==Organizations==\nIn the aftermath of the [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] dictatorship, a number of individuals, including many houngan, sought to organize means of defense for Haitian Vodou from defamation by Christian missionaries and congregations. One of the first leading houngan to formally organize other houngan in solidarity was [[Wesner Morency]] (1959\u20132007), who established the Vodou Church of Haiti in 1998 (registered in 2001 by the Ministry of Justice) and the Commission Nationale pour la Structuration de Vodou (CONAVO). Another individual who has pursued the organization of houngan is the late [[Max Beauvoir]], who established and heads the [[National Confederation of Haitian Vodou]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Afro-American religion]]\n** [[Santer\u00eda]]\n** [[Candombl\u00e9]]\n** [[Umbanda]]\n* [[Haitian mythology]]\n* [[Haitian Vodou art]]\n* [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]]\n* [[Juju]]\n* [[Louisiana Voodoo]]\n* [[West African Vodun]]\n* [[Witch doctor]]\n* [[Simbi]]\n{{Portal|Traditional African religion}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Alvarado\n  | first1 = Denise\n  | year = 2011\n  | title = The Voodoo Hoodoo Spellbook\n  | publisher = Weiser Books\n  | location =\n  | isbn = 978-1-57863-513-9\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Blier\n  | first = Suzanne Preston\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | year = 1995\n  | pages = 61\u201387\n  | chapter = Vodun: West African Roots of Vodou\n  | isbn = 0-930741-47-1\n  | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Brown\n  | first1 = Karen McCarthy\n  | year = 1991\n  | title = Mama Lola: A Vodou Priestess in Brooklyn\n  | publisher = University of California Press\n  | location = Berkeley\n  | isbn = 0-520-22475-2\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Brown\n  | first = Karen McCarthy\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | year = 1995\n  | pages = 205\u2013223\n  | chapter = Serving the Spirits: The Ritual Economy of Haitian Vodou\n  | isbn = 0-930741-47-1\n  | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite web |ref=harv\n  |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html\n  |title = Haiti\n  |last1 = CIA World Factbook\n  |website =\n  |publisher = Central Intelligence Agency\n  |accessdate = 28 March 2012\n  }}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv\n  | last = Cosentino\n  | first = Donald J.\n  | title = More On Voodoo\n  | journal = African Arts \n  | volume = 21 \n  | issue = 3 (May) \n  | pages = 77 \n  | year = 1988 \n  | jstor = 3336454 \n  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Cosentino\n  | first = Donald J.\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | date = 1995b\n  | pages = 25\u201355\n  | chapter = Introduction: Imagine Heaven\n  | isbn = 0-930741-47-1\n  | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | last = Cosentino\n  | first = Henrietta B.\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | date = 1995a\n  | pages = xiii\u2013xiv\n  | chapter = The Sacred Arts of What?

Practitioners are called \"vodouists\" ([[French language|French]]: ''vodouisants'' {{IPA-fr|voduiz\u0251\u0303|}}) or \"servants of the spirits\" ([[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]]: ''s\u00e8vit\u00e8'').{{sfn|Cosentino|1995b|p=25}}\n\nVodouists believe in a distant and unknowable [[Creator deity|Supreme Creator]], ''Bondye'' (derived from the French ''Bon Dieu'', meaning \"good [[God]]\"). According to Vodouists, Bondye does not intercede in human affairs, and thus they direct their worship toward spirits subservient to Bondye, called [[loa]].{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=48}} Every loa is responsible for a particular aspect of life, with the dynamic and changing personalities of each loa reflecting the many possibilities inherent to the aspects of life over which they preside.{{sfn|Brown|1991|p=6}} To navigate daily life, vodouists cultivate personal relationships with the loa through the presentation of offerings, the creation of personal altars and devotional objects, and participation in elaborate ceremonies of music, dance, and [[spirit possession]].{{sfn|Brown|1991|p=4\u20137}}\n\nVodou originated in what is now [[Benin]] and developed in the [[French colonial empire]] in the 18th century among West African peoples who were enslaved, when African religious practice was actively suppressed, and enslaved Africans were [[Forced conversion|forced to convert]] to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Religious practices of contemporary Vodou are descended from, and closely related to, [[West African Vodun]] as practiced by the [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]]. Vodou also incorporates elements and symbolism from other African peoples including the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Kongo people|Kongo]]; as well as [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] religious beliefs, [[Roman Catholicism]], and European spirituality including [[mysticism]] and other influences.{{sfn|Cosentino|1995b|p=25-55}}\n\nIn Haiti, some Catholics combine aspects of Catholicism with aspects of Vodou, a practice forbidden by the Church and denounced as diabolical by [[Protestantism in Haiti|Haitian Protestants]].<ref>{{Cite book|URL = https://books.google.com/books?id=40SIdXeUEhUC|title = Crossing the Water and Keeping the Faith:Haitian Religion in Miami|last = Rey|first = Terry|last2 = Stepick|first2 = Alex|date = 2013-08-19|publisher = NYU Press|ISBN = 9781479820771|language = en}}</ref>\n\n==Names and etymology==\n''Vodou'' is a [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]] word that formerly referred to only a small subset of Haitian rituals.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} The word derives from an [[Ayizo language|Ayizo]] word referring to mysterious forces or powers that govern the world and the lives of those who reside within it, but also a range of artistic forms that function in conjunction with these ''vodun'' energies.{{sfn|Blier|1995|p=61}} Two of the major speaking populations of Ayizo are the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] and the [[Fon people|Fon]]\u2014European slavers called both the Arada. These two peoples composed a sizable number of the early enslaved population in [[St. Dominigue]]. In Haiti, practitioners occasionally use \"Vodou\" to refer to Haitian religion generically, but it is more common for practitioners to refer to themselves as those who \"serve the spirits\" (''s\u00e8vit\u00e8'') by participating in ritual ceremonies, usually called a \"service to the loa\" (''s\u00e8vis lwa'') or an \"African service\" (''s\u00e8vis gine'').{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} These terms also refer to the religion as a whole.\n\nOutside of Haiti, the term ''Vodou'' refers to the entirety of traditional Haitian religious practice.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} \nOriginally written as ''vodun'', it is first recorded in ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', a 1658 document written by the King of [[Allada]]'s ambassador to the court of [[Philip IV of Spain]].{{sfn|Blier|1995|p=61}} In the following centuries, ''Vodou'' was eventually taken up by non-Haitians as a generic descriptive term for traditional Haitian religion.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} There are many used orthographies for this word. Today, the spelling ''Vodou'' is the most commonly accepted orthography in English.{{sfn|Cosentino|1995a|p=xiv}} Other potential spellings include ''Vodoun'', ''vaudou'', and ''voodoo'', with ''vau-'' or ''vou-'' prefix variants reflecting French orthography, and a final ''-n'' reflecting the nasal vowel in West African or older, non-urbanized, Haitian Creole pronunciations.\n\nThe spelling ''voodoo'', once very common, is now generally avoided by Haitian practitioners and scholars when referring to the Haitian religion.{{sfn|Courlander|1988|p=88}}{{sfn|Lane|1949|p=1162}}{{sfn|Thompson|1983|p=163}}{{sfn|Cosentino|1988|p=77}} This is both to avoid confusion with [[Louisiana Voodoo]],{{sfn|Fandrich|2007|p=780}} a related but distinct set of religious practices, as well as to separate Haitian Vodou from the negative connotations and misconceptions the term \"voodoo\" has acquired in popular culture.{{sfn|Fandrich|2007|p=775}}{{sfn|Hurbon|1995|p=181-197}} Over the years, practitioners and their supporters have called on various institutions including the [[Associated Press]] to redress this misrepresentation by adopting \"Vodou\" in reference to the Haitian religion. In October 2012, the [[Library of Congress]] decided to change their [[subject heading]] from \"Voodooism\" to Vodou in response to a petition by a group of scholars and practitioners in collaboration with [[KOSANBA]], the scholarly association for the study of Haitian Vodou based at University of California Santa Barbara.<ref>For a fuller description of transitions in spelling, see: [http://www.bulldozia.com/projects/index.php?id=583 From Voodoo to Vodou]</ref>\n\n==Beliefs==\n{{Voodoo sidebar| Beliefs}}\n[[File:PortAuPrinceMarche.jpg|right|thumb|Vodou paraphernalia, [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti.]]\nVodou is popularly described as not simply a religion, but rather an experience that ties body and soul together. The concept of tying that exists in Haitian religious culture is derived from the Congolese tradition of ''kanga'', the practice of tying one's soul to something tangible. This \"tying of soul\" is evident in many Haitian Vodou practices that are still exercised today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rey|first=Terry|author2=Karen Richman|title=The Somatics of Syncretism: Tying Body and Soul in Haitian Religion|journal=Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses|year=2010|volume=39|issue=3|pages=279\u2013403|doi=10.1177/0008429810373321|url=http://sir.sagepub.com/content/41/2/231.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits===\nVodouisants believe in a Supreme God called Bondye, from the [[French language|French]] (''Bon Dieu'' = Good God).<ref>Haitian Vodouisants believe in Damballah. In her book \"Tell My Horse\", [[Zora Neale Hurston]] writes that \"Damballah is the highest and most powerful of all the gods, but never is he referred to as the father of the gods as was Jupiter, Odin, and great Zeus...whenever any of the gods meet him they bow themselves and sing, \"Ohe', Ohe'! Ce Papa nous qui pe' passe'!\" (It is our papa who passes.)\" (Hurston, pg. 118</ref> When it came in contact with Roman Catholicism, the Supreme Creator was associated with the [[Christianity|Christian]] God, and the ''loa'' associated with the [[saints]].\n\n====Loa====\n[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|right|thumbnail|A large sequined Vodou \"drapo\" or flag by the artist George Valris, depicting the [[veve]], or symbol, of the loa [[Loko Atison]].]]\nSince Bondye (God) is considered unreachable, Vodouisants aim their prayers to lesser entities, the spirits known as [[loa]], or ''mist\u00e8''. The most notable loa include [[Papa Legba]] (guardian of the crossroads), [[Erzulie#Ma\u00eetresse Mambo Erzulie Fr\u00e9da Dahomey|Erzulie Freda]] (the spirit of love), [[Simbi]] (the spirit of rain and magicians), [[Azaka Medeh|Kouzin Zaka]] (the spirit of agriculture), and [[Marassa Jumeaux|The Marasa]], divine twins considered to be the first children of Bondye.{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=54}}\n\nThese loa can be divided into 21 nations, which include the Petro, Rada, Congo, and Nago.{{sfn|Alvarado|2011}}\n\nEach of the loa is associated with a particular Roman Catholic saint. For example, Legba is associated with [[Anthony the Hermit|St. Anthony the Hermit]], and [[Damballa]] is associated with [[Saint Patrick|St. Patrick]].<ref>Simpson, George (1978). Black Religions in the New World.

Each family is associated with a specific aspect, for instance the Ogou family are soldiers, the Ezili govern the feminine spheres of life, the Azaka govern agriculture, the Ghede govern the sphere of death and fertility.\n\nA [[Simbi]] is a Loa which represents magic. A Simbi is portrayed as a green snake. This Loa (Simbi) is used to contact the dead.<ref name=\"MDM\">{{cite web |title=Voodoo History Basic Principles \n |url=https://www.white-magic-help.net/About_White_Magic/Voodoo_History_Basic_Principles_Background.html |website=white-magic |publisher=Marion Daghan-Malenky |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Morality===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2010}}\n{{See also|Haitian Vodou and sexual orientation}}\nVodou's moral code focuses on the vices of dishonor and greed. There is also a notion of relative propriety\u2014and what is appropriate to someone with [[Damballah|Dambala Wedo]]  as their head may be different from someone with [[Ogoun|Ogou Feray]] as their head. For example, one spirit is very cool and the other is very hot. Coolness overall is valued, and so is the ability and inclination to protect oneself and one's own if necessary. Love and support within the family of the Vodou society seem to be the most important considerations. Generosity in giving to the community and to the poor is also an important value. One's blessings come through the community, and one should be willing to give back. There are no \"solitaries\" in Vodou\u2014only people separated geographically from their elders and house. A person without a relationship of some kind with elders does not practice Vodou as it is understood in Haiti and among Haitians; additionally, Haitian Vodou emphasizes the 'wholeness of being' not just with elders and the material world, but also unity with the interconnected forces of nature.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Michel|first1=Claudine|title=Women's Moral and Spiritual Leadership in Haitian Vodou: The Voice of Mama Lola and Karen McCarthy Brown|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|date=September 1, 2001|volume=17|issue=2}}</ref>\n\nThere is a diversity of practice in Vodou across the country of Haiti and the Haitian diaspora.

Some lineages combine both, as [[Mambo (Vodou)|Mambo]] [[Katherine Dunham]] reports from her personal experience in her book ''Island Possessed''.\n\nWhile the overall tendency in Vodou is conservative in accord with its African roots, there is no singular, definitive form, only what is right in a particular house or lineage. Small details of service and the spirits served vary from house to house, and information in books or on the internet therefore may seem contradictory. There is no central authority or  \"[[pope]]\" in Haitian Vodou, since \"every [[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]] and houngan is the head of their own house\", as a popular Haitian saying goes. Another consideration in terms of Haitian diversity are the many sects besides the S\u00e8vi Gine in Haiti such as the Makaya, Rara, and other secret societies, each of which has its own distinct pantheon of spirits.\n\n===Soul===\nAccording to Vodou, the soul consists of two aspects, in a type of [[soul dualism]]: the ''gros bon ange'' (big good angel) and the ''ti bon ange'' (little good angel). The ''gros bon ange'' is the part of the soul that is essentially responsible for the basic biological functions, such as the flow of blood through the body and breathing. On the other hand, the ''ti bon ange'' is the source of personality, character and willpower. \"As the ''gros bon ange'' provides each person with the power to act, it is the ''ti bon ange'' that molds the individual sentiment within each act\".<ref>Thomas, Kette. \"Haitian Zombie, Myth, and Modern Identity.\" CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture 12.2 (2010): n. pag. Web. 29 Oct. 2013.</ref> While the latter is an essential element for the survival of one's individual identity, it is not necessary to keep the body functioning properly in biological terms, and therefore a person can continue to exist without it.\n\n==Practices==\n\n===Liturgy and practice===\n[[File:JacmelVodou.jpg|right|thumb|Vodou ceremony, [[Jacmel]], [[Haiti]].]]\nA Haitian Vodou temple is called a [[Peristil]].{{sfn|Kilson|Rotberg|1976|p=345}} After a day or two of preparation setting up altars at an Hounfour, and ritually preparing and cooking fowl and other foods, a Haitian Vodou service begins with a series of prayers and songs in French, then a litany in [[Haitian Creole]] and [[Haitian Vodoun Culture Language|Langaj]] that goes through all the European and African saints and loa honored by the house, and then a series of verses for all the main spirits of the house. This is called the \"Priy\u00e8 Gine\" or the African Prayer. After more introductory songs, beginning with saluting Hounto, the spirit of the drums, the songs for all the individual spirits are sung, starting with the [[Legba]] family through all the Rada spirits, then there is a break and the Petro part of the service begins, which ends with the songs for the [[Gu\u00e9d\u00e9|Gede]] family.\n\nAs the songs are sung, participants believe that spirits come to visit the ceremony, by taking [[Spirit possession#In Haitian Vodou and African traditions|possession]] of individuals and speaking and acting through them. When a ceremony is made, only the family of those possessed is benefited.  At this time it is believed that devious mambo or houngan can take away the luck of the worshippers through particular actions. For instance, if a priest asks for a drink of champagne, a wise participant refuses. Sometimes these ceremonies may include dispute among the singers as to how a hymn is to be sung. In Haiti, these Vodou ceremonies, depending on the Priest or Priestess, may be more organized.  But in the United States, many vodouists and clergy take it as a sort of non-serious party or \"folly\". In a serious rite, each spirit is saluted and greeted by the initiates present and gives readings, advice, and cures to those who ask for help. Many hours later, as morning dawns, the last song is sung, the guests leave, and the exhausted hounsis, houngans, and mambos can go to sleep.[[File:VOODOO PERISTILE Croix des Mission, Haiti 1980.jpg|thumb|VOODOO PERISTILE Croix des Mission, Haiti 1980]]\n\nVodou practitioners believe that if one follows all taboos imposed by their particular loa and is punctilious about all offerings and ceremonies, the loa will aid them. Vodou practitioners also believe that if someone ignores their loa it can result in sickness, the failure of crops, the death of relatives, and other misfortunes.<ref>Simpson, George (1978). ''Black Religions in the New World''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 86.</ref>\nAnimals are sometimes sacrificed in Haitian Vodou. A variety of animals are sacrificed, such as pigs, goats, chickens, and bulls.\n\"The intent and emphasis of sacrifice is not upon the death of the animal, it is upon the transfusion of its life to the loa; for the understanding is that flesh and blood are of the essence of life and vigor, and these will restore the divine energy of the god.\"<ref>[[Deren, Maya]] (1953). ''[[Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti]]''. New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 216.</ref>\n\nOn the individual's household level, a Vodouisant or \"s\u00e8vit\u00e8\"/\"serviteur\" may have one or more tables set out for their ancestors and the spirit or spirits that they serve with pictures or statues of the spirits, perfumes, foods, and other things favored by their spirits. The most basic set up is just a white candle and a clear glass of water and perhaps flowers. On a particular spirit's day, one lights a candle and says an [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] and [[Hail Mary]], salutes Papa Legba and asks him to open the gate, and then one salutes and speaks to the particular spirit as an elder family member. Ancestors are approached directly, without the mediating of Papa Legba, since they are said to be \"in the blood\".\n\nIn a Vodou home, the only recognizable religious items are often images of saints and candles with a rosary. In other homes, where people may more openly show their devotion to the spirits, noticeable items may include an altar with Catholic saints and iconographies, rosaries, bottles, jars, rattles, perfumes, oils, and dolls. Some Vodou devotees have less paraphernalia in their homes because they had no option but to hide their beliefs. Haiti is a rural society and the cult of ancestors guard the traditional values of the peasant class.  The ancestors are linked to family life and the land. Haitian peasants serve the spirits daily and sometime gather with their extended family on special occasions for ceremonies, which may celebrate the birthday of a spirit or a particular event. In very remote areas, people may walk for days to partake in ceremonies that take place as often as several times a month. Vodou is closely tied to the division and administration of land as well as to the residential economy. The cemeteries and many crossroads are meaningful places for worship: the cemetery acts as a repository of spirits and the crossroads acts as points of access to the world of the invisible.<ref>Michel, Claudine (Aug 1996). \"Of Worlds Seen and Unseen: The Educational Character of Haitian Vodou\".

His or her tendency is to do good by helping and protecting others from spells, however they sometimes use their supernatural power to hurt or kill people. They also conduct ceremonies that usually take place \"amba peristil\" (under a Vodou temple). However, non-Houngan or non-Mambo as Vodouisants are not [[Initiation|initiated]], and are referred to as being \"bossale\"; it is not a requirement to be an initiate to serve one's spirits. There are clergy in Haitian vodou whose responsibility it is to preserve the rituals and songs and maintain the relationship between the spirits and the community as a whole (though some of this is the responsibility of the whole community as well). They are entrusted with leading the service of all of the spirits of their lineage. Sometimes they are \"called\" to serve in a process called ''being reclaimed'', which they may resist at first.{{sfn|McAlister|1993|pp=10\u201327}} Below the houngans and mambos are the hounsis, who are initiates who act as assistants during ceremonies and who are dedicated to their own personal mysteries.\n\nThe ''asson'' (calabash rattle) is the symbol for one who has acquired the status of houngan or mambo (priest or priestess) in Haitian Vodou. The calabash is taken from the calabasse courante or calabasse ordinaire tree, which is associated with Danbhalah-W\u00e9do. A houngan or mambo traditionally holds the asson in their hand, along with a clochette (bell). The asson contains stones and snake vertebrae that give it its sound. The asson is covered with a web of porcelain beads.<ref>Rigaud, Milo (2001). Secrets of Voodoo. New York: City Lights Publishers. pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nA ''bokor'' is a sorcerer or magician who casts spells on request. They are not necessarily priests, and may be practitioners of \"darker\" things, and are often not accepted by the mambo or the houngan.\n \n''Bokor'' can also be a Haitian term for a Vodou priest or other practitioner who works with both the light and dark arts of magic.<ref>[[Bokor]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=December 2017}} The bokor, in that sense, deals in ''baka' (malevolent spirits contained in the form of various animals).<ref>Deren, Maya (1953).

New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 75.</ref>\n\n===Death and the afterlife===\nPractitioners of Vodou revere death, and believe it is a great transition from one life to another, or to the afterlife. Some Vodou families believe that a person's spirit leaves the body, but is trapped in water, over mountains, in grottoes\u2014or anywhere else a voice may call out and echo\u2014for one year and one day. After then, a ceremonial celebration commemorates the deceased for being released into the world to live again. In the words of Edwidge Danticat, author of \"A Year and a Day\"\u2014an article about death in Haitian society published in the New Yorker\u2014and a Vodou practitioner, \"The year-and-a-day commemoration is seen, in families that believe in it and practice it, as a tremendous obligation, an honorable duty, in part because it assures a transcendental continuity of the kind that has kept us Haitians, no matter where we live, linked to our ancestors for generations.\" After the soul of the deceased leaves its resting place, it can occupy trees, and even become a hushed voice on the wind. Though other Haitian and West African families believe there is an afterlife in paradise in the realm of God.<ref>Danticat, Edwidge. \"A Year And A Day.\" The New Yorker 17 Jan. 2011: 19. Popular Culture Collection.\nWeb. 26 September. 2013.\n</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1685: From Africa to the Caribbean===\n[[File:Gbe languages.png|thumb|Area of [[West African Vodun]] practice, the religion with the greatest influence on Haitian Vodou.]]\n\nThe cultural area of the [[Fon people|Fon]], [[Ewe people|Ewe]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] peoples share a common [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] conception of a dual [[Cosmology|cosmological]] divine principle consisting of [[Nana Buluku]], the [[God]]-Creator, and the voduns(s) or God-Actor(s), daughters and sons of the Creator's twin children [[Mawu]] (goddess of the moon) and [[Lisa (mythology)|Lisa]] (god of the sun). The God-Creator is the [[cosmogonical]] principle and does not trifle with the mundane; the voduns(s) are the God-Actor(s) who actually govern earthly issues. The [[Dahomey mythology|pantheon of vodoun]] is quite large and complex.\n\nWest African Vodun has its primary emphasis on ancestors, with each family of spirits having its own specialized priest and priestess, which are often hereditary. In many African clans, deities might include [[Mami Wata]], who are gods and goddesses of the waters; [[Legba]], who in some clans is virile and young in contrast to the old man form he takes in Haiti and in many parts of Togo; [[Ogoun|Gu]] (or Ogoun), ruling iron and smithcraft; [[Sakpata]], who rules diseases; and many other spirits distinct in their own way to West Africa.\n\nA significant portion of Haitian Vodou often overlooked by scholars until recently is the input from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]]. The entire northern area of Haiti is heavily influenced by [[Kongo people|Kongo practices]]. In northern Haiti, it is often called the [[Kongo Rite]] or Lemba, from the Lemba rituals of the [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] area and [[Mayombe]]. In the south, Kongo influence is called [[Petwo]] (Petro). Many loa (a Kikongo term) are of Kongo origin such as Basimba belonging to the [[Basimba people]] and the Lemba.<ref>{{citation |title= The Book of Life, Knowledge and Confidence| publisher= Pacific Press|year=2012| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1471734633|pp=112}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the Vodun religion (distinct from Haitian Vodou) already existed in the United States previously to Haitian immigration, having been brought by enslaved West Africans, specifically from the Ewe, Fon, Mina, Kabaye, and Nago groups. Some of the more enduring forms survive in the [[Gullah|Gullah Islands]].\n\nEuropean [[colonialism]], followed by totalitarian regimes in West Africa, suppressed Vodun as well as other forms of the religion. However, because the Vodun deities are born to each African clan-group, and its clergy is central to maintaining the moral, social, and political order and ancestral foundation of its villagers, it proved to be impossible to eradicate the religion.\n\n===1685-1791: Vodou in colonial Saint-Domingue===\nThe majority of the Africans who were brought as slaves to Haiti were from Western and Central Africa. The survival of the belief systems in the [[New World]] is remarkable, although the traditions have changed with time and have even taken on some Catholic forms of worship.{{sfn|Stevens-Arroyo|2002|}} Two important factors, however, characterize the uniqueness of Haitian Vodou as compared to African Vodun; the transplanted Africans of Haiti, similar to those of [[Cuba]] and Brazil, were obliged to disguise their loa or spirits as [[Roman Catholic]] [[saint]]s, an element of a process called [[syncretism]].\n\nTwo keys provisions of the [[Code Noir]] by King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1685 severely limited the ability of enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue to practice African religions. First, the Code Noir explicitly forbade the open practice of all African religions.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Second, it forced all slaveholders to convert their slaves to Catholicism within eight days of their arrival in Saint-Domingue.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Despite French efforts, enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue were able to cultivate their own religious practices.  Enslaved Africans spent their Sunday and holiday nights expressing themselves. While bodily autonomy was strictly controlled during the day at night, the enslaved Africans wielded a degree of agency. They began to continue their religious practices but also used the time to cultivate community and reconnect the fragmented pieces of their various heritages. These late night reprieves were a form of resistance against white domination and also created community cohesion between people from vastly different ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"Slavery and Slave Society,\" in the Making of Haiti|last=Fick|first=Carolyn|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}</ref> While Catholicism was used as a tool for suppression, enslaved Haitians, partly out of necessity, would go on to incorporate aspects of Christianity into their Vodou.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} [[M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Louis \u00c9lie Moreau de Saint-M\u00e9ry]], a French observer writing in 1797, noted this religious [[syncretism]], commenting that the Catholic-style altars and votive candles used by Africans in Haiti were meant to conceal the Africanness of the religion,{{sfn|Moreau de Saint-M\u00e9ry|1797}} but the connection goes much further than that.

Haitian nationalists have frequently drawn inspiration by imagining their ancestors' gathering of unity and courage. Since the 1990s, some neo-evangelicals have interpreted the politico-religious ceremony at Bois Ca\u00efman to have been a pact with demons. This extremist view is not considered credible by mainstream Protestants, however conservatives such as Pat Robertson repeat the idea.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McAlister|first=Elizabeth|title=From Slave Revolt to a Blood Pact with Satan: The Evangelical Rewriting of Haitian History|journal=Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|pages=187\u2013215|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&context=elizabeth_mcalister|doi=10.1177/0008429812441310}}</ref>\n\n===Vodou in 19th-century Haiti===\n\n====1804: Liberty, Isolation, Boycott====\nOn 1 January 1804 the former slave Jean-Jaqcues Dessalines (as [[Jacques I]]) declared the independence of St. Domingue as the First Black Empire; two years later, after his assassination, it became the Republic of Haiti. This was the second nation to gain independence from European rule (after the United States), and the only state to have arisen from the liberation of slaves. No nation recognized the new state, which was instead met with isolation and boycotts. This exclusion from the global market led to major economic difficulties for the new state.\n\nMany of the leaders of the revolt disassociated themselves from Vodou. They strived to be accepted as Frenchmen and good Catholics rather than as free Haitians. Yet most practitioners of Vodou saw, and still see, no contradiction between Vodou and Catholicism, and also take part in Catholic masses.\n\n====1835: Vodou made punishable, secret societies====\nThe new Haitian state did not recognize Vodou as an official religion. In 1835, the government made practising Vodou punishable. Secret Vodou societies therefore continued to be important. These societies also provided the poor with protection and solidarity against the exercising of power by the elite. They had their own symbols and codes.\n\n===20th century to the present===\nToday, Vodou is practiced not only by Haitians but by Americans and people of many other nations who have been exposed to Haitian culture. Related forms of Vodou exist in other countries in the forms of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Dominican Vud\u00fa|Vud\u00fa]], Cuban [[Cuban Vod\u00fa|Vod\u00fa]],{{sfn|Stevens-Arroyo|2002|pp=37\u201358}}, [[Brazil|Brazilian]] [[Candombl\u00e9 Jej\u00e9|Vodum]], and also in places to which Haitians have immigrated. There has been a re-emergence of the Vodun traditions in the United States, maintaining the same ritual and cosmological elements as in West Africa.\n\nFormer president of Haiti [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] (also known as Papa Doc) played a role in elevating the status of Vodou into a national doctrine. Duvalier was involved in the noirisme movement and hoped to re-value cultural practices that had their origins in Africa. Duvalier manipulated Vodou to suit his purposes throughout his Reign of Terror. He organized the Vodou priests in the countryside and had them advance his agenda, instilling fear through promoting the belief that he had supernatural powers playing into the religion's mysticism.<ref>Time Magazine (Jan 17, 2011). \"The Death and Legacy of Papa Doc Duvalier\" Retrieved May 13, 2015.</ref><ref>Apter, Andrew (May 2002). \"On African Origins: Creolization and Connaissance in Haitian Vodou\". American Ethnologist (Wiley on behalf of the American Anthropological Association) 29. Retrieved Dec 8, 2013.</ref>\n\nMany Haitians involved in the practice of Vodou have been initiated as Houngans or Mambos. In January 2010, after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]] traditional ceremonies were organized to appease the spirits and seek the blessing of ancestors for the Haitians. Also a ''\"purification ceremony\"'' was planned for Haiti.\n\n=== Controversy after the 2010 earthquake ===\nFollowing the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], there were verbal and physical attacks against vodou practitioners in Haiti perpetrated by those who felt that vodouists were partially responsible for the natural disaster. Furthermore, during a [[2010s Haiti cholera outbreak|Cholera outbreak in 2010]] several Vodou priests were lynched by mobs who believed them to be spreading the disease.{{sfn|Valme|2010|}}\n\n==Demographics and geographic distribution==\nBecause of the religious syncretism between Catholicism and Vodou, it is difficult to estimate the number of Vodouists in Haiti. The CIA currently estimates that approximately 50% of Haiti's population practices Vodou, with nearly all Vodouists participating in one of Haiti's Christian denominations.{{sfn|CIA World Factbook}}\n\n==Gallery of Haitian Vodou objects==\n<gallery>\nFile:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou.jpg|Ceremonial suit\nFile:Haitian Vodou fetish statue devil with twelve eyes.jpg|Statue of a [[djab]], a quick-working wild spirit.\nFile:Antique Haitian Vodou ceremonial drum.jpg|Ceremonial drum\nFile:Trop Pou Te Haitian Vodou banners.jpg|Banner reading \"Trop Pou Te\" in the [[Haitian Creole language]]\nFile:Vodou mirror museum exhibit.jpg|Mirrors represent doorways to the world of the dead.\n</gallery>\n\n==Misconceptions==\n[[File:Affaire de Bizoton 1864.png|thumb|The ''Affaire de Bizoton'' of 1864. The murder and alleged canibalization of a woman's body by eight voodoo devotees caused a scandal worldwide and was taken as proof of the evil nature of voodoo.]]\n\nVodou has often been associated in popular culture with [[Satanism]], [[witchcraft]], [[zombie]]s and \"voodoo dolls\". Zombie creation has been referenced within rural Haitian culture,{{sfn|Davis|1988|}} but is not a part of Vodou. Such manifestations fall under the auspices of the ''[[bokor]]'' or sorcerer, rather than the priest of the loa. The practice of sticking pins in voodoo dolls has history in folk magic. \"Voodoo dolls\" are often associated with [[Louisiana Voodoo|New Orleans Voodoo]] and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] as well the magical devices of the [[poppet]] and the ''[[nkisi]]'' or ''bocio'' of West and Central Africa.\n\nThe general fear of Vodou in the US can be traced back to the end of the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791-1804). There is a legend that Haitians were able to beat the French during the Haitian Revolution because their Vodou deities made them invincible. The US, seeing the tremendous potential Vodou had for rallying its followers and inciting them to action, feared the events at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] could spill over onto American soil. After the Haitian Revolution many Haitians fled as refugees to New Orleans. Free and enslaved Haitians who moved to New Orleans brought their religious beliefs with them and reinvigorated the Voodoo practices that were already present in the city. Eventually, Voodoo in New Orleans became hidden and the magical components were left present in the public sphere. This created what is called hoodoo in the southern part of the United States. Because hoodoo is folk magic, Voodoo and Afro-diasporic religions in the U.S. became synonymous with fraud. This is one origin of the stereotype that Haitian Vodou, New Orleans Voodoo, and hoodoo are all tricks used to make money off the gullible.<ref>Long, Carolyn Morrow (Oct 2002). \"Perceptions of New Orleans Voodoo: Sin, Fraud, Entertainment and Religion\". Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions (University of California Pres) 6. Retrieved Dec 5, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe elites preferred to view it as folklore in an attempt to render it relatively harmless as a curiosity that might continue to inspire music and dance.<ref>Bellegarde-Smith, P. (2006). ''Haitian Vodou: Spirit, Myth and Reality''. (p. 25).  Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press</ref>\n\nFearing an uprising in opposition to the [[US occupation of Haiti]] (1915-1934), political and religious elites, along with Hollywood and the film industry, sought to trivialize the practice of Vodou. Hollywood often depicts Vodou as evil and having ties to Satanic practices in movies such as ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'', ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', and in children's movies like ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', though this last example countered this trope with a kindly voodoo priestess who helps the main characters.\n\nIn 2010, a [[2010 Haiti earthquake|7.0 earthquake]] that devastated Haiti brought negative attention to Vodou. [[Televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]] stated that the country had cursed itself after the events at Bois Ca\u00efman, because he claimed they had engaged in Satanic practices in the ceremony preceding the Haitian Revolution. \"They were under the heel of the French, you know, Napoleon the third and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince.' True story. And so the devil said, 'Ok it's a deal.' And they kicked the French out. The Haitians revolted and got something themselves free. But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-12017-504083.html|title=Pat Robertson: Haiti \"Cursed\" After \"Pact to the Devil\" - Crimesider - CBS News|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=2 August 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106024225/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-12017-504083.html|archivedate=6 November 2012}}</ref><ref>See also (or, instead) this [[CBS News]] (\"\u00a9 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.\") web page: {{cite web\n |url         = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pat-robertson-haiti-cursed-after-pact-to-the-devil/\n |title       = Pat Robertson: Haiti \"Cursed\" After \"Pact to the Devil\"\n |author      = Smith, Ryan\n |date        = January 13, 2010\n |accessdate  = January 7, 2015\n |archivedate = January 7, 2015\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/6VPecOTR3?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pat-robertson-haiti-cursed-after-pact-to-the-devil/\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>\n\n==KOSANBA==\nScholarly research on Vodou and other African spiritual retentions in Haiti started in the early 20th century with chronicles such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]]'s \"Tell My Horse\", amongst others. Other notable early scholars of Haitian Vodou one could cite are Milo Rigaud, [[Alfred Metraux]] and [[Maya Deren]], for example. In April 1997, thirteen scholars gathered at the University of California Santa Barbara for a colloquium on Haitian Vodou.  From that meeting the ''Congress of Santa Barbara'' was created, also known as [[KOSANBA]].{{sfn|KOSANBA|}}  These scholars felt there was a need for access to scholarly resources and course offerings studying Haitian Vodou, and pledged, \"...to create a space where scholarship on Vodou can be augmented.\"<ref name=\"ucsb.edu\">{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613040659/http://research.ucsb.edu/cbs/projects/haiti/kosanba/declaration.html |title = KOSANBA: A Scholarly Association for the Study of Haitian Vodou}}</ref> As further described in the Congress\u2019 declaration:\n\n\"The presence, role, and importance of Vodou in Haitian history, society, and culture are unarguable, and recognizably a part of the national ethos. The impact of the religion qua spiritual and intellectual disciplines on popular national institutions, human and gender relations, the family, that plastic arts, philosophy and ethics, oral and written literature, language, popular and sacred music, science and technology and the healing arts, is indisputable. It is the belief of the Congress that Vodou plays, and shall continue to play, a major role in the grand scheme of Haitian development and in the socio-economic, political, and cultural arenas.  Development, when real and successful, always comes from the modernization of ancestral traditions, anchored in the rich cultural expressions of a people.\"<ref name=\"ucsb.edu\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2012, KOSANBA successfully petitioned the Library of Congress to change the terms \"voodoo\" and \"voodooism\" to the correct spelling \"Vodou\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100611173100/http://research.ucsb.edu/cbs/projects/haiti/kosanba/index.html]</ref>\n\n==Organizations==\nIn the aftermath of the [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] dictatorship, a number of individuals, including many houngan, sought to organize means of defense for Haitian Vodou from defamation by Christian missionaries and congregations. One of the first leading houngan to formally organize other houngan in solidarity was [[Wesner Morency]] (1959\u20132007), who established the Vodou Church of Haiti in 1998 (registered in 2001 by the Ministry of Justice) and the Commission Nationale pour la Structuration de Vodou (CONAVO). Another individual who has pursued the organization of houngan is the late [[Max Beauvoir]], who established and heads the [[National Confederation of Haitian Vodou]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Afro-American religion]]\n** [[Santer\u00eda]]\n** [[Candombl\u00e9]]\n** [[Umbanda]]\n* [[Haitian mythology]]\n* [[Haitian Vodou art]]\n* [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]]\n* [[Juju]]\n* [[Louisiana Voodoo]]\n* [[West African Vodun]]\n* [[Witch doctor]]\n* [[Simbi]]\n{{Portal|Traditional African religion}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Alvarado\n  | first1 = Denise\n  | year = 2011\n  | title = The Voodoo Hoodoo Spellbook\n  | publisher = Weiser Books\n  | location =\n  | isbn = 978-1-57863-513-9\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Blier\n  | first = Suzanne Preston\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | year = 1995\n  | pages = 61\u201387\n  | chapter = Vodun: West African Roots of Vodou\n  | isbn = 0-930741-47-1\n  | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Brown\n  | first1 = Karen McCarthy\n  | year = 1991\n  | title = Mama Lola: A Vodou Priestess in Brooklyn\n  | publisher = University of California Press\n  | location = Berkeley\n  | isbn = 0-520-22475-2\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Brown\n  | first = Karen McCarthy\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | year = 1995\n  | pages = 205\u2013223\n  | chapter = Serving the Spirits: The Ritual Economy of Haitian Vodou\n  | isbn = 0-930741-47-1\n  | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite web |ref=harv\n  |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html\n  |title = Haiti\n  |last1 = CIA World Factbook\n  |website =\n  |publisher = Central Intelligence Agency\n  |accessdate = 28 March 2012\n  }}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv\n  | last = Cosentino\n  | first = Donald J.\n  | title = More On Voodoo\n  | journal = African Arts \n  | volume = 21 \n  | issue = 3 (May) \n  | pages = 77 \n  | year = 1988 \n  | jstor = 3336454 \n  }}\n* {{cite book | last = Cosentino\n  | first = Donald J.\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | date = 1995b\n  | pages = 25\u201355\n  | chapter = Introduction: Imagine Heaven\n  | isbn = 0-930741-47-1\n  | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book | last = Cosentino\n  | first = Henrietta B.\n  | editor-first = Cosentino\n  | editor-last = Donald J.\n  | title = Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\n  | publisher = Los Angeles: UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History\n  | date = 1995a\n  | pages = xiii\u2013xiv\n  | chapter = The Sacred Arts of What?

The new Washington club, like the old one, was called the \"Senators\" (the second of three franchises to hold the name).\n\nThe Senators began their history as a consistently losing team, at times so inept that ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist Charley Dryden famously joked, \"Washington: First in war, first in peace, and last in the American League,\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Dryden|first=Charles|title=untitled|newspaper=Washington Post|date=June 27, 1904}}</ref> a play on the famous line in [[Henry Lee III]]'s eulogy for President [[George Washington]] as \"First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\". The [[1904 Washington Senators season|1904 Senators]] lost 113 games, and the next season the team's owners, trying for a fresh start, changed the team's name to the \"Nationals\" (and occasionally nicknamed the \"Nats\"). However, the \"Senators\" name remained widely used by fans and journalists \u2014 in fact, the two names were used interchangeably<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/senators-nationals-nats-whats-in-a-name/2012/10/05/75e95352-0ef9-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|first=John|last=Kelly|title=Picking the National's team name all by design|date=6 October 2012}}</ref> \u2014 although \"Nats\" remained the team's nickname.<ref name=\"ap19400616\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T41hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QU0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6992%2C4002266|title=Tigers Climb Into Second Place - Defeat Nats Twice, A's Upset Tribe|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=1940-06-16|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 6, 2012|pages=19}}</ref> The Senators name was officially restored in {{mlby|1956}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/al/wasdc/nats.html|title=Washington Senators (Nationals) (1901-1960)|website=www.sportsecyclopedia.com}}</ref>\n\n===A new era===\nThe club continued to lose, despite the addition of a talented 19-year-old pitcher named [[Walter Johnson]] in {{mlby|1907}}. Raised in rural [[Kansas]], Johnson was a tall, lanky man with long arms who, using a leisurely windup and unusual sidearm delivery, threw the ball faster than anyone had ever seen. Johnson's breakout year was {{mlby|1910}}, when he struck out 313 batters, posted an [[earned-run average]] of 1.36 and won 25 games for a losing ball club. Over his 21-year Hall of Fame career, Johnson, nicknamed the \"Big Train\", won 417 games and struck out 3,508 batters, a major-league record that stood for more than 50 years.\n\nIn {{mlby|1911}}, the Senators' wooden ballpark burned to the ground, and they replaced it with a modern concrete-and-steel structure on the same location. First called National Park, it later was renamed [[Griffith Stadium]], after the man who was named Washington manager in {{mlby|1912}} and whose name became almost synonymous with the ball club: [[Clark Griffith]]. A star pitcher with the National League's [[Chicago Colts]] in the 1890s, Griffith jumped to the AL in 1901 and became a successful manager with the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[New York Highlanders]]. Walter Johnson blossomed in [[1911 Washington Senators season|1911]] with 25 victories, although the Senators still finished the season in seventh place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/WSH/1911.shtml|title=1911 Washington Senators|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> In [[1912 Washington Senators season|1912]], the Senators improved dramatically, as their pitching staff led the league in team [[earned run average]] and in [[strikeout]]s.

Griffith, frustrated with the owners' penny-pinching, bought a controlling interest in the team in {{mlby|1920}} and stepped down as field manager a year later to focus on his duties as team president.\n\n===1924: World champions===\n[[File:1924worldseries.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Washington's [[Bucky Harris]] scores on his home run in the fourth inning of Game 7 of the 1924 World Series.]]\n\nIn [[1924 Washington Senators season|1924]], Griffith named 27-year-old second baseman [[Bucky Harris]] player-manager. Led by the hitting of [[Goose Goslin]] and [[Sam Rice]], and a solid pitching staff headlined by the 36-year-old Johnson, the Senators captured their first American League pennant, two games ahead of [[Babe Ruth]] and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Senators faced [[John McGraw]]'s heavily favored [[1924 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in the [[1924 World Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1924_WS.shtml|title=1924 World Series|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> Despite Johnson losing both of his starts, the Senators kept pace to tie the Series at three games apiece and force Game 7. The Senators trailed the Giants 3\u20131 in the eighth inning of Game 7, when Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman [[Freddie Lindstrom]]. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three.<ref name=\"1924 World Series Game 7 box score at Baseball Reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/WS1/WS1192410100.shtml|title=1924 World Series Game 7 box score|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> In the ninth inning with the game tied, 3\u20133, Harris brought in an aging Johnson to pitch on just one day of rest \u2013 he had been the losing pitcher in Game 5. Johnson held the Giants scoreless into extra innings.

After Johnson's retirement in {{mlby|1927}}, the Senators endured a few losing seasons until returning to contention in {{mlby|1930}}, this time with Johnson as manager. But after the Senators finished third in {{mlby|1931}} and {{mlby|1932}}, behind powerful Philadelphia and New York, Griffith fired Johnson, a victim of high expectations.<ref>Thomas, Henry W.: \"Walter Johnson: Baseball's Big Train\", page 319. Bison Books, 1998</ref>\n\nFor his new manager in {{mlby|1933}}, Griffith returned to the formula that worked for him in 1924, and 26-year-old shortstop [[Joe Cronin]] became player-manager. The change worked, as Washington posted a 99\u201353 record and swept to the pennant seven games ahead of the Yankees. But the Senators lost the [[1933 World Series|World Series]] to the Giants in five games, and after that, the city would not host another World Series until {{mlby|2019}}, when the [[Washington Nationals]], its current National League team, defeated the [[Houston Astros]].\n\n===Fading fortunes===\nThe Senators sank all the way to seventh in {{mlby|1934}}. Attendance plunged as well, and after the season Griffith traded Cronin to the Red Sox for journeyman shortstop [[Lyn Lary]] and $225,000 in cash (even though Cronin was married to Griffith's niece, Mildred). Despite the return of Harris as manager in 1935\u201342 and 1950\u201354, Washington remained mostly a losing ball club for the next 25 years, contending for the pennant only in the talent-thin war years of {{mlby|1943}} and {{mlby|1945}}.\n\nIn the fall of {{mlby|1953}}, the second major baseball franchise shift of the mid-20th century took place (after the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] moved to [[Milwaukee]] in 1952), with long suffering [[Baltimore]] civic and business interests purchasing the perennially cellar-dwelling [[St. Louis Browns]] from controversial but enterprising owner [[Bill Veeck]] and moving them {{convert|40|mi}} northeast of Washington to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] port city. In the spring of {{mlby|1954}}, the Browns moved to a newly renovated and modernized [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] on the site of their former northeastern city collegiate football bowl, and replacing the earlier [[minor league baseball|minor league]] level \"Triple A\" \"Orioles\" (also sometimes nicknamed the \"Birds\") of the [[International League]] where they had been consistent champions since the 1910s. The additional competition in the same League for [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] area baseball fans added to the complexion around the nation's capital for the rest of the 1950s as the new \"[[Baltimore Orioles]]\" swiftly built their team prospects with astute trades and farm system output during the rest of the decade, finally becoming pennant contenders by {{mlby|1960}}. They continued their winning ways as one of the most dominant teams in professional baseball for the next two decades overpowering even the hapless third Senators franchise in 1961\u20131971.\n\nThe Senators were also the butt of many nationwide jokes during the 1950s, with the debut and running of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical play in 1955 in [[New York City]] called ''\"[[Damn Yankees]]\"'' (based on an earlier best-selling novel and later movie in 1958), which followed a hapless elderly D.C. fan being given a \"Faustian\" or \"devil's bargain,\" selling his soul to transform the team by becoming a young powerful new Senators player (played in the movie version by heart-throb leading-man actor [[Tab Hunter]]) and lead the lowly team to a pennant versus the Yankees.\n\nIn 1954, Senators scout [[Ossie Bluege]], with help from longtime third base coach Alan Rupprecht, signed a 17-year-old [[Harmon Killebrew]]. Because of his $30,000 signing bonus, an enormous amount for that time, baseball rules required Killebrew to spend the rest of 1954 with the Senators as a \"bonus baby.\" Killebrew bounced between the Senators and the minor leagues for the next few years. He became the Senators' regular third baseman in {{mlby|1959}}, leading the League with 42 home runs and earning a starting spot on the American League [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|All-Star]] team.\n\n===Relocation===\nClark Griffith died in {{mlby|1955}}, and his nephew and adopted son [[Calvin Griffith|Calvin]] took over the team presidency. He sold Griffith Stadium to the city of Washington and leased it back, leading to speculation that the team was planning to move, as the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]], [[Baltimore Orioles|Browns]] and [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]] had done in the early 1950s, and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] would do later in the decade. After an early flirtation with San Francisco (with a \"Triple A\" [[Pacific Coast League]] team, the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]]), by {{mlby|1957}} Griffith was courting [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] in the [[Upper Midwest]] state of [[Minnesota]], a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting the Twin Cities' first offer<ref>{{cite news|title=Senators Reject Bids to Move to Minneapolis or St. Paul|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/10/22/archives/senators-reject-bids-to-move-to-minneapolis-or-st-paul-two-other.html?sq=giants+relocate+minneapolis&scp=2&st=p|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|agency=Associated Press|date=October 27, 1957|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> before agreeing to relocate. The American League opposed the move at first, but in {{mlby|1960}}, in the face of the [[Continental League]]'s proposed Minnesota franchise, a deal was reached. The Senators moved and were replaced with an expansion [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Senators]] team for {{mlby|1961}}. The old Washington Senators became the new [[Minnesota Twins]]; the expansion Senators would become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in {{mlby|1972}}, and baseball would not return to the city until {{mlby|2005}}, when the former Montreal Expos became the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\n==Photos==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Washington baseball LCCN2016894152 (cropped).jpg|Washington Senators around 1925\nFile:Baseball LCCN2016887984 (cropped).jpg|Washington Senators in the 1920s\nFile:Washington baseball LCCN2016890155 (cropped).jpg|Washington Senators Team Picture in the early 1930s\n</gallery>\n\n==The Washington Senators in popular culture==\nThe longtime competitive struggles of the team were fictionalized in the 1954 book ''[[The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant]]'', which became the 1955 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' and [[Damn Yankees (film)|the 1958 film]] starring then \"heart-throb\" leading-man actor [[Tab Hunter]]). The plot centers on Joe Boyd, a middle-aged real estate salesman and long-suffering fan of the Washington Senators baseball club. In this musical comedy-drama of the [[Faust|Faust legend]], Boyd sells his soul to the [[Devil]] and becomes slugger Joe Hardy, the \"long ball hitter the Senators need that he'd sell his soul for\" (as spoken by him in a throwaway line near the beginning of the drama). His hitting prowess enables the Senators to win the American League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] over the then-dominant Yankees. One of the songs from the musical, \"You Gotta Have Heart\", is frequently played at baseball games.\n\nThe (expansion) Washington Senators were mentioned several times in Tom Clancy's book ''Without Remorse''. As they performed even worse than the team they replaced, they were the subject of an updated joke: \"Washington: First in war, first in peace, and ''still'' last in the American League.\" When the current Nationals had their own struggles, the joke was updated once again, this time to \"Washington: First in war, first in peace, and last in the National League.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{1924 Washington Senators}}\n{{Minnesota Twins}}\n{{MLBHistory}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of the Washington Senators (1901-60)}}\n[[Category:Washington Senators (1901\u201360)]]\n[[Category:History of Major League Baseball by team|Washington Senators]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the current Washington Nationals|Washington Nationals}}\n{{for|the American Association Washington Senators|Washington Senators (1891\u20131899)}}\n<noinclude>{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=Washington Senators (1901\u20131960)|2=Talk:History of the Washington Senators (1901\u20131960)#Requested move 6 April 2020 }}\n</noinclude>\n{| class=\"infobox vcard\" style=\"width:27em; font-size:88%; text-align:left; line-height:1.5em\"\n! colspan=2 class=\"fn org\" style=\"font-size:125%; text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Washington Senators|border=2}}; margin-bottom:3px;\"|Washington Senators\n|-\n!

The new Washington club, like the old one, was called the \"Senators\" (the second of three franchises to hold the name).\n\nThe Senators began their history as a consistently losing team, at times so inept that ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist Charley Dryden famously joked, \"Washington: First in war, first in peace, and last in the American League,\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Dryden|first=Charles|title=untitled|newspaper=Washington Post|date=June 27, 1904}}</ref> a play on the famous line in [[Henry Lee III]]'s eulogy for President [[George Washington]] as \"First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\". The [[1904 Washington Senators season|1904 Senators]] lost 113 games, and the next season the team's owners, trying for a fresh start, changed the team's name to the \"Nationals\" (and occasionally nicknamed the \"Nats\"). However, the \"Senators\" name remained widely used by fans and journalists \u2014 in fact, the two names were used interchangeably<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/senators-nationals-nats-whats-in-a-name/2012/10/05/75e95352-0ef9-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|first=John|last=Kelly|title=Picking the National's team name all by design|date=6 October 2012}}</ref> \u2014 although \"Nats\" remained the team's nickname.<ref name=\"ap19400616\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T41hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QU0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6992%2C4002266|title=Tigers Climb Into Second Place - Defeat Nats Twice, A's Upset Tribe|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=1940-06-16|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 6, 2012|pages=19}}</ref> The Senators name was officially restored in {{mlby|1956}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/al/wasdc/nats.html|title=Washington Senators (Nationals) (1901-1960)|website=www.sportsecyclopedia.com}}</ref>\n\n===A new era===\nThe club continued to lose, despite the addition of a talented 19-year-old pitcher named [[Walter Johnson]] in {{mlby|1907}}. Raised in rural [[Kansas]], Johnson was a tall, lanky man with long arms who, using a leisurely windup and unusual sidearm delivery, threw the ball faster than anyone had ever seen. Johnson's breakout year was {{mlby|1910}}, when he struck out 313 batters, posted an [[earned-run average]] of 1.36 and won 25 games for a losing ball club. Over his 21-year Hall of Fame career, Johnson, nicknamed the \"Big Train\", won 417 games and struck out 3,508 batters, a major-league record that stood for more than 50 years.\n\nIn {{mlby|1911}}, the Senators' wooden ballpark burned to the ground, and they replaced it with a modern concrete-and-steel structure on the same location. First called National Park, it later was renamed [[Griffith Stadium]], after the man who was named Washington manager in {{mlby|1912}} and whose name became almost synonymous with the ball club: [[Clark Griffith]]. A star pitcher with the National League's [[Chicago Colts]] in the 1890s, Griffith jumped to the AL in 1901 and became a successful manager with the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[New York Highlanders]]. Walter Johnson blossomed in [[1911 Washington Senators season|1911]] with 25 victories, although the Senators still finished the season in seventh place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/WSH/1911.shtml|title=1911 Washington Senators|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> In [[1912 Washington Senators season|1912]], the Senators improved dramatically, as their pitching staff led the league in team [[earned run average]] and in [[strikeout]]s. Johnson won 33 games while teammate [[Bob Groom]] added another 24 wins to help the Senators finish the season in second place behind the [[Boston Red Sox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/WSH/1912.shtml|title=1912 Washington Senators|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> The Senators continued to perform respectably in [[1913 Washington Senators season|1913]] with Johnson posting a career-high 35 victories, as the team once again finished in second place, this time to the [[Philadelphia Athletics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1913.shtml|title=1913 American League Team Statistics and Standings|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> Starting in [[1916 Washington Senators season|1916]], the Senators settled back into mediocrity. Griffith, frustrated with the owners' penny-pinching, bought a controlling interest in the team in {{mlby|1920}} and stepped down as field manager a year later to focus on his duties as team president.\n\n===1924: World champions===\n[[File:1924worldseries.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Washington's [[Bucky Harris]] scores on his home run in the fourth inning of Game 7 of the 1924 World Series.]]\n\nIn [[1924 Washington Senators season|1924]], Griffith named 27-year-old second baseman [[Bucky Harris]] player-manager. Led by the hitting of [[Goose Goslin]] and [[Sam Rice]], and a solid pitching staff headlined by the 36-year-old Johnson, the Senators captured their first American League pennant, two games ahead of [[Babe Ruth]] and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Senators faced [[John McGraw]]'s heavily favored [[1924 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in the [[1924 World Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1924_WS.shtml|title=1924 World Series|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> Despite Johnson losing both of his starts, the Senators kept pace to tie the Series at three games apiece and force Game 7. The Senators trailed the Giants 3-1 in the eighth inning of Game 7, when Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman [[Freddie Lindstrom]]. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three.<ref name=\"1924 World Series Game 7 box score at Baseball Reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/WS1/WS1192410100.shtml|title=1924 World Series Game 7 box score|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> In the ninth inning with the game tied, 3\u20133, Harris brought in an aging Johnson to pitch on just one day of rest \u2013 he had been the losing pitcher in Game 5. Johnson held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. In the bottom of the 12th inning, [[Muddy Ruel]] hit a high [[foul ball]] near [[home plate]].<ref name=\"How Senators' Strategy Won for Johnson\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=muddy+ruel+baseball+digest&cd=1#v=onepage&q=muddy%20ruel%20baseball%20digest&f=false|title=How Senators' Strategy Won for Johnson|author=Ruel, Muddy|date=October 1964|magazine=Baseball Digest|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> The Giants' catcher, [[Hank Gowdy]], dropped his protective face mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat.<ref name=\"How Senators' Strategy Won for Johnson\" /> On the next [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]], Ruel hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]] and, then proceeded to score the winning [[Run (baseball)|run]] when [[Earl McNeely]] hit a [[ground ball]] that took another bad hop over Lindstrom's head.<ref name=\"1924 World Series Game 7 box score at Baseball Reference\" /><ref name=\"How Senators' Strategy Won for Johnson\" /> It was the only [[World Series]] triumph for the franchise during their 60-year tenure in Washington.\n\n===Building a winning tradition===\n[[File:Joe_Judge_flowers_(cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|On behalf of the [[Elks]] of Washington, [[Joe Judge (baseball)|Joe Judge]] (front left), captain of the Senators, was presented with a floral tribute for the team before the start of a game in 1929]]\nThe Senators repeated as American League champions in {{mlby|1925}} but lost the [[1925 World Series|World Series]] to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. After Johnson's retirement in {{mlby|1927}}, the Senators endured a few losing seasons until returning to contention in {{mlby|1930}}, this time with Johnson as manager. But after the Senators finished third in {{mlby|1931}} and {{mlby|1932}}, behind powerful Philadelphia and New York, Griffith fired Johnson, a victim of high expectations.<ref>Thomas, Henry W.: \"Walter Johnson: Baseball's Big Train\", page 319. Bison Books, 1998</ref>\n\nFor his new manager in {{mlby|1933}}, Griffith returned to the formula that worked for him in 1924, and 26-year-old shortstop [[Joe Cronin]] became player-manager. The change worked, as Washington posted a 99\u201353 record and swept to the pennant seven games ahead of the Yankees. But the Senators lost the [[1933 World Series|World Series]] to the Giants in five games, and after that, the city would not host another World Series until {{mlby|2019}}, when the [[Washington Nationals]], its current National League team, defeated the [[Houston Astros]].\n\n===Fading fortunes===\nThe Senators sank all the way to seventh in {{mlby|1934}}. Attendance plunged as well, and after the season Griffith traded Cronin to the Red Sox for journeyman shortstop [[Lyn Lary]] and $225,000 in cash (even though Cronin was married to Griffith's niece, Mildred). Despite the return of Harris as manager in 1935\u201342 and 1950\u201354, Washington remained mostly a losing ball club for the next 25 years, contending for the pennant only in the talent-thin war years of {{mlby|1943}} and {{mlby|1945}}.\n\nIn the fall of {{mlby|1953}}, the second major baseball franchise shift of the mid-20th century took place (after the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] moved to [[Milwaukee]] in 1952), with long suffering [[Baltimore]] civic and business interests purchasing the perennially cellar-dwelling [[St. Louis Browns]] from controversial but enterprising owner [[Bill Veeck]] and moving them {{convert|40|mi}} northeast of Washington to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] port city. In the spring of {{mlby|1954}}, the Browns moved to a newly renovated and modernized [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] on the site of their former northeastern city collegiate football bowl, and replacing the earlier [[minor league baseball|minor league]] level \"Triple A\" \"Orioles\" (also sometimes nicknamed the \"Birds\") of the [[International League]] where they had been consistent champions since the 1910s. The additional competition in the same League for [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] area baseball fans added to the complexion around the nation's capital for the rest of the 1950s as the new \"[[Baltimore Orioles]]\" swiftly built their team prospects with astute trades and farm system output during the rest of the decade, finally becoming pennant contenders by {{mlby|1960}}. They continued their winning ways as one of the most dominant teams in professional baseball for the next two decades overpowering even the hapless third Senators franchise in 1961\u20131971.\n\nThe Senators were also the butt of many nationwide jokes during the 1950s, with the debut and running of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical play in 1955 in [[New York City]] called ''\"[[Damn Yankees]]\"'' (based on an earlier best-selling novel and later movie in 1958), which followed a hapless elderly D.C. fan being given a \"Faustian\" or \"devil's bargain,\" selling his soul to transform the team by becoming a young powerful new Senators player (played in the movie version by heart-throb leading-man actor [[Tab Hunter]]) and lead the lowly team to a pennant versus the Yankees.\n\nIn 1954, Senators scout [[Ossie Bluege]], with help from longtime third base coach Alan Rupprecht, signed a 17-year-old [[Harmon Killebrew]]. Because of his $30,000 signing bonus, an enormous amount for that time, baseball rules required Killebrew to spend the rest of 1954 with the Senators as a \"bonus baby.\" Killebrew bounced between the Senators and the minor leagues for the next few years. He became the Senators' regular third baseman in {{mlby|1959}}, leading the League with 42 home runs and earning a starting spot on the American League [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|All-Star]] team.\n\n===Relocation===\nClark Griffith died in {{mlby|1955}}, and his nephew and adopted son [[Calvin Griffith|Calvin]] took over the team presidency. He sold Griffith Stadium to the city of Washington and leased it back, leading to speculation that the team was planning to move, as the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]], [[Baltimore Orioles|Browns]] and [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]] had done in the early 1950s, and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] would do later in the decade. After an early flirtation with San Francisco (with a \"Triple A\" [[Pacific Coast League]] team, the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]]), by {{mlby|1957}} Griffith was courting [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] in the [[Upper Midwest]] state of [[Minnesota]], a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting the Twin Cities' first offer<ref>{{cite news|title=Senators Reject Bids to Move to Minneapolis or St. Paul|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/10/22/archives/senators-reject-bids-to-move-to-minneapolis-or-st-paul-two-other.html?sq=giants+relocate+minneapolis&scp=2&st=p|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|agency=Associated Press|date=October 27, 1957|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> before agreeing to relocate. The American League opposed the move at first, but in {{mlby|1960}}, in the face of the [[Continental League]]'s proposed Minnesota franchise, a deal was reached. The Senators moved and were replaced with an expansion [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Senators]] team for {{mlby|1961}}. The old Washington Senators became the new [[Minnesota Twins]]; the expansion Senators would become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in {{mlby|1972}}, and baseball would not return to the city until {{mlby|2005}}, when the former Montreal Expos became the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\n==Photos==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Washington baseball LCCN2016894152 (cropped).jpg|Washington Senators around 1925\nFile:Baseball LCCN2016887984 (cropped).jpg|Washington Senators in the 1920s\nFile:Washington baseball LCCN2016890155 (cropped).jpg|Washington Senators Team Picture in the early 1930s\n</gallery>\n\n==The Washington Senators in popular culture==\nThe longtime competitive struggles of the team were fictionalized in the 1954 book ''[[The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant]]'', which became the 1955 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' and [[Damn Yankees (film)|the 1958 film]] starring then \"heart-throb\" leading-man actor [[Tab Hunter]]). The plot centers on Joe Boyd, a middle-aged real estate salesman and long-suffering fan of the Washington Senators baseball club. In this musical comedy-drama of the [[Faust|Faust legend]], Boyd sells his soul to the [[Devil]] and becomes slugger Joe Hardy, the \"long ball hitter the Senators need that he'd sell his soul for\" (as spoken by him in a throwaway line near the beginning of the drama). His hitting prowess enables the Senators to win the American League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] over the then-dominant Yankees. One of the songs from the musical, \"You Gotta Have Heart\", is frequently played at baseball games.\n\nThe (expansion) Washington Senators were mentioned several times in Tom Clancy's book ''Without Remorse''. As they performed even worse than the team they replaced, they were the subject of an updated joke: \"Washington: First in war, first in peace, and ''still'' last in the American League.\" When the current Nationals had their own struggles, the joke was updated once again, this time to \"Washington: First in war, first in peace, and last in the National League.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{1924 Washington Senators}}\n{{Minnesota Twins}}\n{{MLBHistory}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of the Washington Senators (1901-60)}}\n[[Category:Washington Senators (1901\u201360)]]\n[[Category:History of Major League Baseball by team|Washington Senators]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1924: World champions:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 3-1 \u2192 3\u20131", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Washington_Senators_(1901%E2%80%931960)"}

It was sponsored by [[Nabisco]] and originally aired December 6, 1995 on [[CBS]].\n\nThe special was based on a 1963 book of the same name, by Robert Barry. In 2005, ''Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree'' was adapted into a children's theater stage production by the [[Way Off Broadway Dinner Theatre]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe special begins with the song \u201cThe Perfect Tree,\u201d which features both Mr. Willowby ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) singing about his desire to find the perfect [[Christmas tree]] and, within Willowby\u2019s house, a father [[mouse]] singing that he will go out to get a tree for his family (his two children, Beverly and Ned, decide to come with him). After the song is finished, Willowby asks his [[butler]], Baxter ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) where his tree is.\n\nThe special then follows the family of mice out in the woods looking for a tree. Eventually, the father mouse spots \u201cthe perfect tree,\u201d but it is far too large to fit into their tiny living quarters, so the family climbs the tree so that he can chop off the very top. Right when they reach the top, however, Willowby\u2019s [[lumberjack]]s arrive at the scene and cut the entire tree down (as they sing the song \u201cWe\u2019re Lumberjacks\u201d). The family of mice hold on to the tree as it is brought to Willowby\u2019s house.\n\nThe tree is set up in the house, and Willowby notices it is slightly too tall. He has Baxter cut off the very top, and then tells him to bring up the top part of the tree (which the mouse family is in) to one of his staff, Swedish maid Miss Adelaide (Channing), whom Willowby describes as being a very lonely person who doesn\u2019t even come down for Christmas. However, this is part of Mr. Willowby's hidden agenda of getting Baxter and Adelaide to admit their secret love for each other.\n\nBaxter does so, and while he is meeting with Adelaide, she describes her family\u2019s traditions at Christmas time. While they are talking, a romantic interest between the two of them is insinuated. At one point, Baxter notices the father mouse on the floor, but Adelaide says it is Christmastime and thus would be wrong to kill the mouse at this time. She places the mouse up on a banister, and he returns to the top of the tree with his children.\n\nAfter Baxter leaves, Adelaide notices that the tree in her room is slightly too tall, so she cuts off the top and throws it out the window (with the mouse family in it). Before the father mouse can cut off the top, a [[bear]] picks up the tree and brings it home to her den and family to use as his own Christmas tree.\n\nThe bears engage in their Christmas festivities, and eventually notice that the tree is too tall. They cut off the top (which once again has the mice in it) and throw it outside. The family of mice laugh at all they\u2019ve been through that evening, only to then be picked up (along with the remnants of the tree) by an [[owl]].\n\nMeanwhile back at the manor, Mr. Willowby is piling gifts around the tree, but notices he doesn't hear Baxter anywhere. To his great satisfaction, he quickly finds the butler standing in the snow underneath Miss Adelaide's window, listening to her sing.\n\nThe owls set up the tree in their own den, and then engage in an angelic chorus (the mouse family speculates that they never knew owls could be so musical). Eventually, they too notice that the tree they have is too tall, and so they cut off the top and throw it (along with the mice) outside.\n\nThe father mouse then raises his axe to cut off a tree from the remnants that have been thrown outside, but then realizes that the tree as it is actually the perfect size for his own home. He and the other mice return to the manor. But Baxter catches Beverly by the tail, grousing over the possible mouse infestation. Fortunately at that moment, Willowby\u2019s Christmas Ball is about to begin, and as the guests arrive, he hears Miss Adelaide leaving her room. Knowing how she would feel, he releases Beverly and tells her to \"Hurry home for Christmas.\" The mice race into their den with the tree, cheering that their Christmas can begin.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Willowby's Christmas party is in full swing. Adelaide comes down this time, and begins to dance with Baxter. With Mr. Willowby joining their dance for a moment, he turns to gaze upon the tree, and launches into a final rendition of \"The Perfect Tree\".\n\nThe show ends with our narrarator Kermit The Frog leaving the darkened manor at party's end, wishing the audience Happy Holidays and good night. As the credits roll, Ned and Beverly begin relating their adventure to their mother while father dozes by the fireplace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Mr. Willowby\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Miss Adelaide\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Baxter the Butler\n\n===Muppet performers===\n* [[Bill Barretta]] as Bear\n* [[Julianne Buescher]] as Beverly Mouse\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] as Bear, [[Kermit the Frog]], Owl\n* [[Kevin Clash]] as Father Mouse, Owl\n* [[Bruce Lanoil]] as Owl, Bear\n* [[David Rudman]] as Ned Mouse\n\n==Accolades==\nScore- and songwriters Patty and Michael Silversher were nominated for an Emmy for the song \u201cThe Perfect Tree.\u201d The special also won a [[Casting Society of America]] award for \u201cBest Casting for TV Nighttime Special\u201d.<ref>http://imdb.com/title/tt0124013/awards</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{muppets}}\n* {{imdb title|0124013|Mr. Willowby\u2019s Christmas Tree}}\n\n{{The Jim Henson Company}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n\n[[Category:1995 television specials]]\n[[Category:1990s American television specials]]\n[[Category:American Christmas films]]\n[[Category:Christmas television specials]]\n[[Category:The Muppets television specials]]\n[[Category:1995 television films]]\n[[Category:CBS television specials]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree\n| image                = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| based_on             = ''Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree'' by Robert Barry\n| writer               = [[Mitchell Kriegman]]\n| story                = \n| director             = [[Jon Stone]]\n| narrated             = [[Kermit the Frog]]\n| starring             = [[Robert Downey Jr.]]<br>[[Stockard Channing]]<br>[[Leslie Nielsen]]\n| music                = [[Silversher & Silversher|Michael & Patty Silversher]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| executive_producer   = [[Michael K.

In 2005, ''Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree'' was adapted into a children's theater stage production by the [[Way Off Broadway Dinner Theatre]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe special begins with the song \u201cThe Perfect Tree,\u201d which features both Mr. Willowby ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) singing about his desire to find the perfect [[Christmas tree]] and, within Willowby\u2019s house, a father [[mouse]] singing that he will go out to get a tree for his family (his two children, Beverly and Ned, decide to come with him). After the song is finished, Willowby asks his [[butler]], Baxter ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) where his tree is.\n\nThe special then follows the family of mice out in the woods looking for a tree. Eventually, the father mouse spots \u201cthe perfect tree,\u201d but it is far too large to fit into their tiny living quarters, so the family climbs the tree so that he can chop off the very top. Right when they reach the top, however, Willowby\u2019s [[lumberjack]]s arrive at the scene and cut the entire tree down (as they sing the song \u201cWe\u2019re Lumberjacks\u201d). The family of mice hold on to the tree as it is brought to Willowby\u2019s house.\n\nThe tree is set up in the house, and Willowby notices it is slightly too tall. He has Baxter cut off the very top, and then tells him to bring up the top part of the tree (which the mouse family is in) to one of his staff, Swedish maid Miss Adelaide (Channing), whom Willowby describes as being a very lonely person who doesn\u2019t even come down for Christmas. However, this is part of Mr. Willowby's hidden agenda of getting Baxter and Adelaide to admit their secret love for each other.\n\nBaxter does so, and while he is meeting with Adelaide, she describes her family\u2019s traditions at Christmas time. While they are talking, a romantic interest between the two of them is insinuated. At one point, Baxter notices the father mouse on the floor, but Adelaide says it is Christmastime and thus would be wrong to kill the mouse at this time. She places the mouse up on a banister, and he returns to the top of the tree with his children.\n\nAfter Baxter leaves, Adelaide notices that the tree in her room is slightly too tall, so she cuts off the top and throws it out the window (with the mouse family in it). Before the father mouse can cut off the top, a [[bear]] picks up the tree and brings it home to her den and family to use as his own Christmas tree.\n\nThe bears engage in their Christmas festivities, and eventually notice that the tree is too tall. They cut off the top (which once again has the mice in it) and throw it outside. The family of mice laugh at all they\u2019ve been through that evening, only to then be picked up (along with the remnants of the tree) by an [[owl]].\n\nMeanwhile back at the manor, Mr. Willowby is piling gifts around the tree, but notices he doesn't hear Baxter anywhere. To his great satisfaction, he quickly finds the butler standing in the snow underneath Miss Adelaide's window, listening to her sing.\n\nThe owls set up the tree in their own den, and then engage in an angelic chorus (the mouse family speculates that they never knew owls could be so musical). Eventually, they too notice that the tree they have is too tall, and so they cut off the top and throw it (along with the mice) outside.\n\nThe father mouse then raises his axe to cut off a tree from the remnants that have been thrown outside, but then realizes that the tree as it is actually the perfect size for his own home. He and the other mice return to the manor. But Baxter catches Beverly by the tail, grousing over the possible mouse infestation. Fortunately at that moment, Willowby\u2019s Christmas Ball is about to begin, and as the guests arrive, he hears Miss Adelaide leaving her room. Knowing how she would feel, he releases Beverly and tells her to \"Hurry home for Christmas.\" The mice race into their den with the tree, cheering that their Christmas can begin.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Willowby's Christmas party is in full swing. Adelaide comes down this time, and begins to dance with Baxter. With Mr. Willowby joining their dance for a moment, he turns to gaze upon the tree, and launches into a final rendition of \"The Perfect Tree\".\n\nThe show ends with our narrarator Kermit The Frog leaving the darkened manor at party's end, wishing the audience Happy Holidays and good night. As the credits roll, Ned and Beverly begin relating their adventure to their mother while father dozes by the fireplace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Mr. Willowby\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Miss Adelaide\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Baxter the Butler\n\n===Muppet performers===\n* [[Bill Barretta]] as Bear\n* [[Julianne Buescher]] as Beverly Mouse\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] as Bear, [[Kermit the Frog]], Owl\n* [[Kevin Clash]] as Father Mouse, Owl\n* [[Bruce Lanoil]] as Owl, Bear\n* [[David Rudman]] as Ned Mouse\n\n==Accolades==\nScore- and songwriters Patty and Michael Silversher were nominated for an Emmy for the song \u201cThe Perfect Tree.\u201d The special also won a [[Casting Society of America]] award for \u201cBest Casting for TV Nighttime Special\u201d.<ref>http://imdb.com/title/tt0124013/awards</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{muppets}}\n* {{imdb title|0124013|Mr. Willowby\u2019s Christmas Tree}}\n\n{{The Jim Henson Company}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n\n[[Category:Christmas television specials]]\n[[Category:The Muppets television specials]]\n[[Category:1995 television films]]\n[[Category:1995 television specials]]\n[[Category:CBS television specials]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Willowby%27s_Christmas_Tree"}

The region that the Diocese comprises extends from its northern border on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] through the [[Finger Lakes]] region to its southern border at the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Pennsylvania]] border. \n\nThe Diocese of Rochester comprises 12 counties in New York, with approximately 350,000 Catholics and over 125 faith communities (parishes and chapels), 22 diocesan elementary schools and 7 independent parochial high schools. The bishop of the diocese is currently [[Salvatore Ronald Matano]]. The metropolitan for the diocese is the Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]], currently Cardinal [[Timothy Dolan]]. The [[cathedral]] [[parish]] for the diocese is [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Rochester)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral - Rochester, New York.jpg|thumb|right|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Rochester (1868-1937)]]\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester began on March 3, 1868, when [[Pope Pius IX]] entrusted eight counties (Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins) within the Diocese of Buffalo to [[Bernard J. McQuaid]], the first bishop of Rochester. The new diocese had about 54,500 Catholics in 35 parish churches and 29 mission churches.\n\nIn 1896, the counties of Schuyler, Tioga, Chemung, and Steuben were added to the Diocese of Rochester from the Diocese of Buffalo, forming the current boundaries.\n\nThe diocese grew as Catholic immigrants came to western New York, peaking in the 1960s. Since then, the Catholic population has stabilized while the numbers of ordained presbyters (priests) and women religious (sisters) has fallen.<ref>[http://www.dor.org/dorhomepage/history.htm Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester - Diocesan History]</ref>\n*In 1909, there were 121,000 Catholics in 93 parishes, 36 missions and 53 parish schools with 18,000 pupils. There were 164 priests and more than 500 sisters.\n*In 1938, there were 223,657 Catholics in 129 parishes, 36 missions and 72 parish schools serving 23,796 pupils. There were 289 active diocesan priests.\n*In 1966, there were 361,790 Catholics in 155 parishes, 36 mission churches and 99 elementary parish schools serving 45,540 pupils. There were 371 active diocesan priests and 1,549 sisters.\n*In 1978, there were 358,850 Catholics in 161 parishes, 29 mission churches and 75 schools serving 19,526 pupils. There were 311 active diocesan priests and 1,095 women religious.\n*In 1992, there were 361,384 Catholics in 162 parishes and 58 elementary schools serving 11,992 pupils. There were 208 active diocesan priests and 842 sisters.\n\nOn September 22nd 2017 the Diocese of Rochester inaugurated its sesquicentennial anniversary marked by a solemn mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral. This event marks a year long celebration celebrating one hundred and fifty years and the year of the Eucharist which was proclaimed by Bishop Salvatore Matano on the Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\n==Reports of sex abuse and bankruptcy==\n\nIn June 2018, it was revealed that the Diocese had secretly paid $1.6 million since 1950 in compensation to 20 sex abuse victims.<ref>https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/06/09/andreatta-diocese-rochester-has-paid-1-6-m-20-sex-abuse-victims/686390002/</ref> Most of the payments occurred after the eruption of the 2002 clergy sex abuse scandal, although some are decades old. On June 10, 2019, a man claiming that he had been molested between 1969 and 1971 by local priest Rev. Francis Vogt filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Rochester and several other local Catholic organizations affiliated the Diocese, claiming that they shielded Vogt from potential prosecution.<ref name=grownnot>https://13wham.com/news/local/victim-sues-diocese-of-rochester-over-claims-of-sexual-abuse-by-priest</ref> On September 12, 2019, the Diocese filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] in the wake of lawsuits against priests and other ministers who served in the Diocese.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/12/rochester-ny-catholic-diocese-bankruptcy-sex-abuse-lawsuits-child-victims-act-cva-chapter-11/2297878001/|title=Diocese bankruptcy: Matano says it was 'a very difficult and painful decision'|last=Orr|first=Steve|date=September 12, 2019|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref> <ref name=protectionnotgood /> The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester is the first Catholic diocese in the state of New York to file for bankruptcy and also the 20th Catholic diocese in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=protectionnotgood>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/12/catholic-sex-abuse-rochester-diocese-files-bankruptcy-protection/2308133001/</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishops of Rochester===\n# [[Bernard J.

The region that the Diocese comprises extends from its northern border on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] through the [[Finger Lakes]] region to its southern border at the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Pennsylvania]] border. \n\nThe Diocese of Rochester comprises 12 counties in New York, with approximately 350,000 Catholics and over 125 faith communities (parishes and chapels), 22 diocesan elementary schools and 7 independent parochial high schools. The bishop of the diocese is currently [[Salvatore Ronald Matano]]. The metropolitan for the diocese is the Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]], currently Cardinal [[Timothy Dolan]]. The [[cathedral]] [[parish]] for the diocese is [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Rochester)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral - Rochester, New York.jpg|thumb|left|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Rochester (1868-1937)]]\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester began on March 3, 1868, when [[Pope Pius IX]] entrusted eight counties (Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins) within the Diocese of Buffalo to [[Bernard J. McQuaid]], the first bishop of Rochester. The new diocese had about 54,500 Catholics in 35 parish churches and 29 mission churches.\n\nIn 1896, the counties of Schuyler, Tioga, Chemung, and Steuben were added to the Diocese of Rochester from the Diocese of Buffalo, forming the current boundaries.\n\nThe diocese grew as Catholic immigrants came to western New York, peaking in the 1960s. Since then, the Catholic population has stabilized while the numbers of ordained presbyters (priests) and women religious (sisters) has fallen.<ref>[http://www.dor.org/dorhomepage/history.htm Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester - Diocesan History]</ref>\n*In 1909, there were 121,000 Catholics in 93 parishes, 36 missions and 53 parish schools with 18,000 pupils. There were 164 priests and more than 500 sisters.\n*In 1938, there were 223,657 Catholics in 129 parishes, 36 missions and 72 parish schools serving 23,796 pupils. There were 289 active diocesan priests.\n*In 1966, there were 361,790 Catholics in 155 parishes, 36 mission churches and 99 elementary parish schools serving 45,540 pupils. There were 371 active diocesan priests and 1,549 sisters.\n*In 1978, there were 358,850 Catholics in 161 parishes, 29 mission churches and 75 schools serving 19,526 pupils. There were 311 active diocesan priests and 1,095 women religious.\n*In 1992, there were 361,384 Catholics in 162 parishes and 58 elementary schools serving 11,992 pupils. There were 208 active diocesan priests and 842 sisters.\n\nOn September 22nd 2017 the Diocese of Rochester inaugurated its sesquicentennial anniversary marked by a solemn mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral. This event marks a year long celebration celebrating one hundred and fifty years and the year of the Eucharist which was proclaimed by Bishop Salvatore Matano on the Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\n==Reports of sex abuse and bankruptcy==\n\nIn June 2018, it was revealed that the Diocese had secretly paid $1.6 million since 1950 in compensation to 20 sex abuse victims.<ref>https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/06/09/andreatta-diocese-rochester-has-paid-1-6-m-20-sex-abuse-victims/686390002/</ref> Most of the payments occurred after the eruption of the 2002 clergy sex abuse scandal, although some are decades old. On June 10, 2019, a man claiming that he had been molested between 1969 and 1971 by local priest Rev. Francis Vogt filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Rochester and several other local Catholic organizations affiliated the Diocese, claiming that they shielded Vogt from potential prosecution.<ref name=grownnot>https://13wham.com/news/local/victim-sues-diocese-of-rochester-over-claims-of-sexual-abuse-by-priest</ref> On September 12, 2019, the Diocese filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] in the wake of lawsuits against priests and other ministers who served in the Diocese.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/12/rochester-ny-catholic-diocese-bankruptcy-sex-abuse-lawsuits-child-victims-act-cva-chapter-11/2297878001/|title=Diocese bankruptcy: Matano says it was 'a very difficult and painful decision'|last=Orr|first=Steve|date=September 12, 2019|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref> <ref name=protectionnotgood /> The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester is the first Catholic diocese in the state of New York to file for bankruptcy and also the 20th Catholic diocese in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=protectionnotgood>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/12/catholic-sex-abuse-rochester-diocese-files-bankruptcy-protection/2308133001/</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishops of Rochester===\n# [[Bernard J.

Named after the [[Expo 67]] [[World's Fair]], the Expos' initial home was [[Jarry Park Stadium|Jarry Park]]. Managed by [[Gene Mauch]], the team lost 110 games in their first season, coincidentally matching the Padres inaugural win-loss record, and continued to struggle during their first decade with sub-.500 seasons.\n\nStarting in [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977]], the team's home venue was Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]], built for the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. Two years later, the team won a franchise-high 95 games, finishing second in the National League East. The Expos began the 1980s with a core group of young players, including catcher [[Gary Carter]], outfielders [[Tim Raines]] and [[Andre Dawson]], third baseman [[Tim Wallach]], and pitchers [[Steve Rogers (baseball)|Steve Rogers]] and [[Bill Gullickson]]. The team won its only division championship in the strike-shortened split season of [[1981 in baseball|1981]], ending its season with a three games to two loss to the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1981 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].\n\nThe team spent most of the 1980s in the middle of the NL East pack, finishing in third or fourth place in eight out of nine seasons from 1982 to 1990. [[Buck Rodgers]] was hired as manager before the [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985 season]] and guided the Expos to a .500 or better record five times in six years, with the highlight coming in [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]], when they won 91 games. They finished third, but were just four games behind the division-winning [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]].\n\nBronfman sold the team to a consortium of owners in 1991, with [[Claude Brochu]] as the managing general partner.<ref name=\"ExposGuide1996\">{{Cite book\n| author=Montreal Expos\n| authorlink=Montreal Expos\n| title=Expos Media Guide 1996\n| year=1996 }}</ref><ref name=\"1991June-Gazette\">{{Cite news\n  | last=Blair\n  | first=Jeff\n  | title=Brochu group goes to bat for baseball survival here; Expos sale official as Bronfman era ends\n  | newspaper=Montreal Gazette\n  | pages=C.1\n  | date=1991-06-15 }}</ref>\nRodgers, at that time second only to Gene Mauch in number of Expos games managed, was replaced partway through the [[1991 Major League Baseball season|1991 season]].

On November 15, a lawsuit by the former team owners against MLB and former majority owner Jeffrey Loria was struck down by arbitrators, bringing to an end all legal actions that would impede a move. The owners of the other MLB teams approved the move to Washington in a 28\u20131 vote on December 3 ([[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]] cast the sole dissenting vote).\n\n===Washington baseball history revived===\n{{Main|History of Washington, D.C. professional baseball}}\n\nNumerous professional baseball teams have called Washington, D.C. home. The [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]], a founding member of the [[American League]], played in the nation's capital from 1901 to 1960 before moving to Minnesota and becoming the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]. These Senators were owned by [[Clark Griffith]] and played in [[Griffith Stadium]]. With notable stars including [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Joe Cronin]], the Senators won the [[1924 World Series]] and pennants in [[1925 World Series|1925]] and [[1933 World Series|1933]], but were more often unsuccessful and moved to Minnesota for the [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961 season]] where the team was renamed the Minnesota Twins. A second [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]] team (1961\u20131971) had a winning record only once in their 11 years, though bright spots, such as slugger [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], earned the love of fans. The second Senators team moved to Arlington, Texas, for the [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972 season]] and changed their name to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and Washington spent the next 33 years without a baseball team.\n\nAlthough there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators, political considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival of the first American League franchise's \"official\" nickname used from [[1905 Major League Baseball season|1905]] to [[1956 Major League Baseball season|1956]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dcvote.org/media/media.cfm?mediaID=1098&year=2005 | work=DCVote.org | title=Media Center | accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref> Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected to the name Senators because the District of Columbia does not have [[District of Columbia voting rights|voting representation in Congress]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A1767-2004Oct1?language=printer | work=The Washington Post | title=The District's Senators Shouldn't Wear Cleats| date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> In addition, the Rangers still owned the rights to the Senators name,<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/expos/2004-11-19-nats-nickname_x.htm?loc=interstitialskip | work=USA Today | title=In Washington, it'll be \"Let's go Nats\"|date=November 22, 2004}}</ref> although the\nNationals were able to acquire the rights to the curly \"W\" from the Rangers.\n\nWashington, D.C., mayor [[Anthony A. Williams]] supported the name \"Washington Grays\", in honor of the Negro-league team the [[Homestead Grays]] (1929\u20131950), which had been based in [[Pittsburgh]], but played many of their home games in Washington. In the end, the team owners chose the name \"Washington Nationals\", which had been the official name of the American League's Washington Senators from 1905\u20131956.\n\n===Opposition from the Orioles===\nThe move was announced despite opposition from Peter Angelos, owner of the nearby Baltimore Orioles, who infamously announced \"There are no baseball fans in Washington, D.C. That's a fiction.\" Since 1972, the Orioles had been the only MLB franchise in the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington Metropolitan Area]], which he considered a single market. Angelos contended that the Orioles would suffer financially if another team were allowed to enter the market, although the Orioles and the Washington Senators had shared the market successfully from 1954 through 1971, and four other major metropolitan areas ([[New York metropolitan area|New York]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]], and [[San Francisco Bay Area]]) of roughly comparable size to Baltimore-Washington each have two MLB teams (in all cases, one each in the National and American Leagues). This reasoning disturbed many in Washington who recalled that it was the Griffith family, owners of the Washington Senators, who allowed the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] to move to Baltimore and become the Orioles in {{mlby|1954}} in the first place.\n\nOn March 31, 2005, Angelos and Major League Baseball struck a deal to protect the Orioles against any financial harm the Nationals might present.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, [[List of Washington Nationals broadcasters|television and radio broadcast rights]] to Nationals games are handled by the Orioles franchise, which formed a new network (the [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network]]) to produce and distribute the games for both franchises on both local affiliates and cable/satellite systems. MASN was not, however, immediately available on all cable providers, adding to the frustration of Nationals fans. In fact, most in the DC area missed almost the entirety of the Nationals' first two seasons. The deal with Angelos makes the Nationals the only major league baseball team that does not own its own broadcast rights.\n\n===The ballpark controversy===\n[[File:Nationals at bat.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Nationals at bat against the [[San Diego Padres]] in [[RFK Stadium]], 8 July 2006.]]\nThe team's relocation to Washington was contingent on a financing plan for the [[Nationals Park|Nationals' new stadium]]\u2014this plan quickly became the subject of much debate on the [[Council of the District of Columbia]].\n\nThree Council members who supported Mayor [[Anthony A. Williams|Anthony Williams's]] plan were ousted in September 2004's Democratic party primary. In addition, an opinion poll conducted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' during the peak of the controversy found that approximately two-thirds of District residents opposed the mayor's stadium plan.\n\nMuch of the controversy centered on the fact that the city would be helping finance a $581 million stadium without support from [[Maryland]] or [[Virginia]] or their counties, from which a large portion of the team's fan base would be drawn.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3930510 | work=The Economist | title=Letters | date=April 29, 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the move to Washington itself was called into doubt when the D.C. Council sought to change details of the stadium's financing. When the Council voted on December 14, 2004 to require 50 percent private financing for any new stadium, MLB ceased promotional activities for the Nationals and announced that they would consider looking for a new market.\n\nEventually, the council passed an amended plan on December 21, 2004 that proved slightly more financially favorable to the city, while remaining acceptable to MLB. Mayor Williams signed the stadium financing package on December 30.\n\nDuring the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005 season]], a private financing plan for construction of the stadium was negotiated between the city and a syndicate of bankers led by [[Deutsche Bank]]. The negotiations of the details ran into another problem in November 2005. The bankers requested a [[letter of credit]] or other financial guarantee of $24 million, $6 million for each of four years, insuring payment of lease revenues against various risks including poor attendance and terrorism. The city requested that Major League Baseball provide this guarantee, which they were unwilling to do.\n\nOn December 22, 2005, the ''Washington Post'' reported that Major League Baseball had specifically instructed prospective owners not to offer to pay cost overruns on the stadium if they were selected as the owners. Bidders were also told not to communicate with the press about these issues.\n\nIn February 2006, the DC City Council imposed a $611 million cap on the stadium.\n\nFinally, on March 5, Major League Baseball signed a lease for a new ballpark, agreeing to the city's $611 million cap. MLB also agreed to contribute $20 million toward the cost of the stadium, although it did not agree to cover stadium overruns. Further, MLB added the condition that excess ballpark tax revenue earmarked for debt service for the bonds be available for cost overruns. Two days later, on March 7 the DC City Council, by a vote of 9\u20134, approved a construction contract for a state-of-the-art stadium with a contemporary glass-and-stone facade, seats for 41,000 fans and a view of the U.S. Capitol, and affirmed its demand that public spending on the project be limited to $611 million. The votes were the final actions needed to satisfy the terms of the deal struck in September 2004, paving the way for the sale of the team.\n\nMajor League Baseball had agreed at the time that the franchise was moved to Washington to sell the team to an owner or ownership syndicate. Several dates for sale of the team were set and missed due to the legal wrangling regarding the building of the stadium. The delay was harshly criticized by city residents and leaders as reported in ''The Washington Post''.\n\nSelecting from a finalized group of three potential ownership syndicates, Major League Baseball announced in July 2006 that it had chosen the [[Lerner Enterprises]] group, led by billionaire [[real estate developer]] [[Theodore N. Lerner]]. The final sale price of the team was $450 million and the transfer of ownership was completed July 24, 2006. In late September 2006, [[Comcast]] finally agreed to broadcast the Nationals games.\n\n====New ownership and \"The Plan\"====\n[[File:Nationals Game - 2009 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Washington Nationals versus the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 2009 at [[Nationals Park]]]]\nWhen Ted Lerner took over the club in mid-{{MLBy|2006}}, he hired [[Stan Kasten]] as team president. Kasten was widely known as the architect of the [[Atlanta Braves]] before and during their run of 14 division titles (a streak only interrupted by the strike season of 1994, when the Braves ended the season behind the Montreal Expos \u2013 ironically, the Nationals' predecessor). Kasten was also the general manager or president of many other [[Atlanta]]-area sports teams, including the [[Atlanta Hawks]] and [[Atlanta Thrashers]]. \"The Plan\", as it became known, was a long-range rebuilding and restructuring of the team from the ground up. This plan included investing in the farm system and the draft, and having a suitable team to go along with their new stadium.\n\nIn the front office, the Nationals hired the well-respected former Arizona scouting director [[Mike Rizzo (baseball)|Mike Rizzo]] to be the vice president of baseball operations, second in charge under then-general manager Jim Bowden.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Nationals Counting on Draft-Day Payoff | author=Barry Svrluga | work=Washington Post | date=June 5, 2007 | page=E01 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/04/AR2007060401755.html}}</ref>\n\n=====2006-07=====\nAt the end of the [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006 season]], the Nationals did not re-sign free agent and star OF [[Alfonso Soriano]].

OF [[Jos\u00e9 Guill\u00e9n]] was also allowed to depart via free agency, and another high draft pick was obtained. Another high priced player, 2B/DH [[Jos\u00e9 Vidro]], was traded to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for prospects OF [[Chris Snelling]] and RHP [[Emiliano Fruto]]. In mid-2006, the Nationals received OF [[Austin Kearns]], 2B/SS [[Felipe L\u00f3pez (baseball)|Felipe L\u00f3pez]], and RHP [[Ryan Wagner]] from the [[Cincinnati Reds]], giving up LHP [[Gary Majewski]], LHP [[Bill Bray]], SS [[Royce Clayton]], 2B [[Brendan Harris]] and RHP [[Daryl Thompson]]. In August, they traded RHP [[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]] to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] for prospects LHP [[Matt Chico]] and RHP [[Garrett Mock]]. Other players traded or let go from the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005 season]] were OF [[Preston Wilson]], RHP [[H\u00e9ctor Carrasco]], IF [[Jamey Carroll]], and OF [[Terrmel Sledge]]. The team also acquired pitching prospects [[Luis Atilano]] from Atlanta, [[Shairon Martis]] from [[List of San Francisco Giants seasons|San Francisco]] and [[Jhonny N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers seasons|Dodgers]]. In [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], they had two first-round draft picks, OF [[Chris Marrero]], and RHP [[Colten Williams]], and signed them both to developmental contracts.

Rizzo began to shape the team in a way that was contrary to Bowden's previous methods. While Bowden was known for \"dumpster-diving\", that is attempting to find serviceable players among the less-than-desired, Mike Rizzo sought players who achieved results. Bowden took risks on players with poor reputations (such as outfielders [[Elijah Dukes]] and [[Lastings Milledge]]), while Rizzo made a point out of making certain his players possessed \"character\" and would contribute to a cohesive clubhouse.\n\nDespite the failures of Bowden's tenure, his last trade appeared to have been extremely beneficial to the Nationals, as he traded infielder [[Emilio Bonifacio]] and two minor-leaguers to the Marlins for starting pitcher Scott Olsen and outfielder [[Josh Willingham]].\n\nRizzo's first major trade during the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2009 season]] as General Manager of the Nationals was to trade Lastings Milledge along with control-challenged reliever [[Joel Hanrahan]] to the Pirates in exchange for speedy outfielder [[Nyjer Morgan]] and left-handed relief pitcher [[Sean Burnett]]. Morgan was thought to be a great clubhouse presence as well as a slick fielder on the outfield grass.\n\n[[File:MG 6582 Jason Marquis.jpg|150px |thumb|[[Jason Marquis]]]]\nMike Rizzo's new philosophy continued to show in the 2009\u20132010 offseason.

All three men had reputations as being great teammates. Collectively, they had extensive experience playing for successful teams. This was a contrast to the Nationals' roster at the time, which had some talented players who lacked experience playing for winning teams.\n\n===Seasons===\n{{prose|date=October 2014}}\n\n====2005====\n{{main|2005 Washington Nationals season}}\n\n[[Image:BushAsAPitcher.jpg|thumb|Then President [[George W.

[[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]] threw eight shutout innings, and [[Vinny Castilla]] was denied the chance to [[Hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] when Diamondback reliever [[Lance Cormier]] hit him with a pitch in the bottom of the eighth; Castilla needed only a single to complete the cycle. [[Chad Cordero]] recorded the save for Washington.\n*Between May 29 and June 15, 2005, the Nationals compiled a 15\u20132 record including a franchise record 10-game win streak (June 2\u201312).  Ten of those games were decided by 1 run.\n*On August 4, 2005, Brad Wilkerson became the first Washington Nationals player to ever hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], against then [[2005 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] relief pitcher [[Duaner S\u00e1nchez]]. The Nationals won the game 7\u20130 on a four-hit complete game shutout by [[John Patterson (pitcher)|John Patterson]].\n*During his August\u2013September callup, [[Ryan Zimmerman]] recorded 23 hits in 58 at-bats. He thus became the first member of the Washington Nationals to complete the season with a batting average of at least .300 in at least 50 at-bats.\n*The Nationals led all National League teams in interleague play in 2005, recording 12 wins.\n*At the halfway mark of the season, the Nationals were in first place in the National League East division, with a record of 50\u201331.

Although the Orioles won the first game of what would become known as the [[Beltway Series]] (which consisted of three games in Washington and three in Baltimore), the two teams split the season series, with the home team winning twice and the visitors once. These games marked the Orioles' first matchup with a Washington-based team in 35 years, as they played against [[Minnesota Twins|the original Senators]] from 1954 to 1960, and against [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|a new Senators team]] from 1961 to 1971.<ref group=note>Prior to 2006, the Nationals' natural rival was the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], dating back to their time in Montreal, and because the 2005 schedule was set with the Expos in mind, the two teams had to play another series that year.</ref>\n*On Father's Day, June 18, 2006, against the [[2006 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], the paid attendance was 45,157, the third-largest ever to see a single baseball game in the history of RFK Stadium. In that game, the Nationals beat the Yankees 3\u20132 on a two-run walk-off home run by rookie Ryan Zimmerman. (A [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]] doubleheader drew more spectators, as did the Nationals' first-ever home game with Arizona.)\n*On September 2, 2006, the Nationals rallied from three runs down in the first game and from five runs down in the second game to take a day\u2013night doubleheader sweep from the [[2006 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]], the first day-night doubleheader as part of the team's history in Washington.\n*On Labor Day, September 4, 2006, [[Ram\u00f3n Ortiz]] took a no-hitter into the ninth inning vs. the [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], but gave up a single to Aaron Miles on his second pitch in the 9th to break up the bid. Then he gave up a home run to [[Albert Pujols]], ending his chance to get his second career shutout. Ortiz himself also hit a home run in the 8th inning. The Nationals won 5\u20132.\n*On September 16, 2006, [[Alfonso Soriano]] became the fourth player to [[40\u201340 club|hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a season]] when he stole his 40th base in the first inning of a game against the [[2006 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]].

In 2005, the Expos moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and were renamed the Nationals. The franchise won the [[List of National League pennant winners|National League pennant]] in 2019, and has won its division five times. They won the [[World Series]] in 2019 against the [[Astros]] in game 7.\n\n==History==\n\n===Montreal Expos===\n{{Main|Montreal Expos}}\nThe Montreal Expos joined the [[National League]] in [[1969 Major League Baseball season|1969]], along with the [[San Diego Padres]], with a majority share held by [[Charles Bronfman]], a major shareholder in [[Seagram]]. Named after the [[Expo 67]] [[World's Fair]], the Expos' initial home was [[Jarry Park Stadium|Jarry Park]]. Managed by [[Gene Mauch]], the team lost 110 games in their first season, coincidentally matching the Padres inaugural win-loss record, and continued to struggle during their first decade with sub-.500 seasons.\n\nStarting in [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977]], the team's home venue was Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]], built for the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. Two years later, the team won a franchise-high 95 games, finishing second in the National League East. The Expos began the 1980s with a core group of young players, including catcher [[Gary Carter]], outfielders [[Tim Raines]] and [[Andre Dawson]], third baseman [[Tim Wallach]], and pitchers [[Steve Rogers (baseball)|Steve Rogers]] and [[Bill Gullickson]]. The team won its only division championship in the strike-shortened split season of [[1981 in baseball|1981]], ending its season with a three games to two loss to the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1981 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].\n\nThe team spent most of the 1980s in the middle of the NL East pack, finishing in third or fourth place in eight out of nine seasons from 1982 to 1990. [[Buck Rodgers]] was hired as manager before the [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985 season]] and guided the Expos to a .500 or better record five times in six years, with the highlight coming in [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]], when they won 91 games. They finished third, but were just four games behind the division-winning [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]].\n\nBronfman sold the team to a consortium of owners in 1991, with [[Claude Brochu]] as the managing general partner.<ref name=\"ExposGuide1996\">{{Cite book\n| author=Montreal Expos\n| authorlink=Montreal Expos\n| title=Expos Media Guide 1996\n| year=1996 }}</ref><ref name=\"1991June-Gazette\">{{Cite news\n  | last=Blair\n  | first=Jeff\n  | title=Brochu group goes to bat for baseball survival here; Expos sale official as Bronfman era ends\n  | newspaper=Montreal Gazette\n  | pages=C.1\n  | date=1991-06-15 }}</ref>\nRodgers, at that time second only to Gene Mauch in number of Expos games managed, was replaced partway through the [[1991 Major League Baseball season|1991 season]].

On November 15, a lawsuit by the former team owners against MLB and former majority owner Jeffrey Loria was struck down by arbitrators, bringing to an end all legal actions that would impede a move. The owners of the other MLB teams approved the move to Washington in a 28\u20131 vote on December 3 ([[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]] cast the sole dissenting vote).\n\n===Washington baseball history revived===\n{{Main|History of Washington, D.C. professional baseball}}\n\nNumerous professional baseball teams have called Washington, D.C. home. The [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]], a founding member of the [[American League]], played in the nation's capital from 1901 to 1960 before moving to Minnesota and becoming the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]. These Senators were owned by [[Clark Griffith]] and played in [[Griffith Stadium]]. With notable stars including [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Joe Cronin]], the Senators won the [[1924 World Series]] and pennants in [[1925 World Series|1925]] and [[1933 World Series|1933]], but were more often unsuccessful and moved to Minnesota for the [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961 season]] where the team was renamed the Minnesota Twins. A second [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]] team (1961\u20131971) had a winning record only once in their 11 years, though bright spots, such as slugger [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], earned the love of fans. The second Senators team moved to Arlington, Texas, for the [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972 season]] and changed their name to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and Washington spent the next 33 years without a baseball team.\n\nAlthough there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators, political considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival of the first American League franchise's \"official\" nickname used from [[1905 Major League Baseball season|1905]] to [[1956 Major League Baseball season|1956]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dcvote.org/media/media.cfm?mediaID=1098&year=2005 | work=DCVote.org | title=Media Center | accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref> Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected to the name Senators because the District of Columbia does not have [[District of Columbia voting rights|voting representation in Congress]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A1767-2004Oct1?language=printer | work=The Washington Post | title=The District's Senators Shouldn't Wear Cleats| date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> In addition, the Rangers still owned the rights to the Senators name,<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/expos/2004-11-19-nats-nickname_x.htm?loc=interstitialskip | work=USA Today | title=In Washington, it'll be \"Let's go Nats\"|date=November 22, 2004}}</ref> although the\nNationals were able to acquire the rights to the curly \"W\" from the Rangers.\n\nWashington, D.C., mayor [[Anthony A. Williams]] supported the name \"Washington Grays\", in honor of the Negro-league team the [[Homestead Grays]] (1929\u20131950), which had been based in [[Pittsburgh]], but played many of their home games in Washington. In the end, the team owners chose the name \"Washington Nationals\", which had been the official name of the American League's Washington Senators from 1905\u20131956.\n\n===Opposition from the Orioles===\nThe move was announced despite opposition from Peter Angelos, owner of the nearby Baltimore Orioles, who infamously announced \"There are no baseball fans in Washington, D.C. That's a fiction.\" Since 1972, the Orioles had been the only MLB franchise in the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington Metropolitan Area]], which he considered a single market. Angelos contended that the Orioles would suffer financially if another team were allowed to enter the market, although the Orioles and the Washington Senators had shared the market successfully from 1954 through 1971, and four other major metropolitan areas ([[New York metropolitan area|New York]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]], and [[San Francisco Bay Area]]) of roughly comparable size to Baltimore-Washington each have two MLB teams (in all cases, one each in the National and American Leagues). This reasoning disturbed many in Washington who recalled that it was the Griffith family, owners of the Washington Senators, who allowed the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] to move to Baltimore and become the Orioles in {{mlby|1954}} in the first place.\n\nOn March 31, 2005, Angelos and Major League Baseball struck a deal to protect the Orioles against any financial harm the Nationals might present.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, [[List of Washington Nationals broadcasters|television and radio broadcast rights]] to Nationals games are handled by the Orioles franchise, which formed a new network (the [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network]]) to produce and distribute the games for both franchises on both local affiliates and cable/satellite systems. MASN was not, however, immediately available on all cable providers, adding to the frustration of Nationals fans. In fact, most in the DC area missed almost the entirety of the Nationals' first two seasons. The deal with Angelos makes the Nationals the only major league baseball team that does not own its own broadcast rights.\n\n===The ballpark controversy===\n[[File:Nationals at bat.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Nationals at bat against the [[San Diego Padres]] in [[RFK Stadium]], 8 July 2006.]]\nThe team's relocation to Washington was contingent on a financing plan for the [[Nationals Park|Nationals' new stadium]]\u2014this plan quickly became the subject of much debate on the [[Council of the District of Columbia]].\n\nThree Council members who supported Mayor [[Anthony A. Williams|Anthony Williams's]] plan were ousted in September 2004's Democratic party primary. In addition, an opinion poll conducted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' during the peak of the controversy found that approximately two-thirds of District residents opposed the mayor's stadium plan.\n\nMuch of the controversy centered on the fact that the city would be helping finance a $581 million stadium without support from [[Maryland]] or [[Virginia]] or their counties, from which a large portion of the team's fan base would be drawn.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3930510 | work=The Economist | title=Letters | date=April 29, 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the move to Washington itself was called into doubt when the D.C. Council sought to change details of the stadium's financing. When the Council voted on December 14, 2004 to require 50 percent private financing for any new stadium, MLB ceased promotional activities for the Nationals and announced that they would consider looking for a new market.\n\nEventually, the council passed an amended plan on December 21, 2004 that proved slightly more financially favorable to the city, while remaining acceptable to MLB. Mayor Williams signed the stadium financing package on December 30.\n\nDuring the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005 season]], a private financing plan for construction of the stadium was negotiated between the city and a syndicate of bankers led by [[Deutsche Bank]]. The negotiations of the details ran into another problem in November 2005. The bankers requested a [[letter of credit]] or other financial guarantee of $24 million, $6 million for each of four years, insuring payment of lease revenues against various risks including poor attendance and terrorism. The city requested that Major League Baseball provide this guarantee, which they were unwilling to do.\n\nOn December 22, 2005, the ''Washington Post'' reported that Major League Baseball had specifically instructed prospective owners not to offer to pay cost overruns on the stadium if they were selected as the owners. Bidders were also told not to communicate with the press about these issues.\n\nIn February 2006, the DC City Council imposed a $611 million cap on the stadium.\n\nFinally, on March 5, Major League Baseball signed a lease for a new ballpark, agreeing to the city's $611 million cap. MLB also agreed to contribute $20 million toward the cost of the stadium, although it did not agree to cover stadium overruns. Further, MLB added the condition that excess ballpark tax revenue earmarked for debt service for the bonds be available for cost overruns. Two days later, on March 7 the DC City Council, by a vote of 9\u20134, approved a construction contract for a state-of-the-art stadium with a contemporary glass-and-stone facade, seats for 41,000 fans and a view of the U.S. Capitol, and affirmed its demand that public spending on the project be limited to $611 million. The votes were the final actions needed to satisfy the terms of the deal struck in September 2004, paving the way for the sale of the team.\n\nMajor League Baseball had agreed at the time that the franchise was moved to Washington to sell the team to an owner or ownership syndicate. Several dates for sale of the team were set and missed due to the legal wrangling regarding the building of the stadium. The delay was harshly criticized by city residents and leaders as reported in ''The Washington Post''.\n\nSelecting from a finalized group of three potential ownership syndicates, Major League Baseball announced in July 2006 that it had chosen the [[Lerner Enterprises]] group, led by billionaire [[real estate developer]] [[Theodore N. Lerner]]. The final sale price of the team was $450 million and the transfer of ownership was completed July 24, 2006. In late September 2006, [[Comcast]] finally agreed to broadcast the Nationals games.\n\n====New ownership and \"The Plan\"====\n[[File:Nationals Game - 2009 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Washington Nationals versus the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 2009 at [[Nationals Park]]]]\nWhen Ted Lerner took over the club in mid-{{MLBy|2006}}, he hired [[Stan Kasten]] as team president. Kasten was widely known as the architect of the [[Atlanta Braves]] before and during their run of 14 division titles (a streak only interrupted by the strike season of 1994, when the Braves ended the season behind the Montreal Expos \u2013 ironically, the Nationals' predecessor). Kasten was also the general manager or president of many other [[Atlanta]]-area sports teams, including the [[Atlanta Hawks]] and [[Atlanta Thrashers]]. \"The Plan\", as it became known, was a long-range rebuilding and restructuring of the team from the ground up. This plan included investing in the farm system and the draft, and having a suitable team to go along with their new stadium.\n\nIn the front office, the Nationals hired the well-respected former Arizona scouting director [[Mike Rizzo (baseball)|Mike Rizzo]] to be the vice president of baseball operations, second in charge under then-general manager Jim Bowden.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Nationals Counting on Draft-Day Payoff | author=Barry Svrluga | work=Washington Post | date=June 5, 2007 | page=E01 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/04/AR2007060401755.html}}</ref>\n\n=====2006-07=====\nAt the end of the [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006 season]], the Nationals did not re-sign free agent and star OF [[Alfonso Soriano]].

OF [[Jos\u00e9 Guill\u00e9n]] was also allowed to depart via free agency, and another high draft pick was obtained. Another high priced player, 2B/DH [[Jos\u00e9 Vidro]], was traded to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for prospects OF [[Chris Snelling]] and RHP [[Emiliano Fruto]]. In mid-2006, the Nationals received OF [[Austin Kearns]], 2B/SS [[Felipe L\u00f3pez (baseball)|Felipe L\u00f3pez]], and RHP [[Ryan Wagner]] from the [[Cincinnati Reds]], giving up LHP [[Gary Majewski]], LHP [[Bill Bray]], SS [[Royce Clayton]], 2B [[Brendan Harris]] and RHP [[Daryl Thompson]]. In August, they traded RHP [[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]] to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] for prospects LHP [[Matt Chico]] and RHP [[Garrett Mock]]. Other players traded or let go from the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005 season]] were OF [[Preston Wilson]], RHP [[H\u00e9ctor Carrasco]], IF [[Jamey Carroll]], and OF [[Terrmel Sledge]]. The team also acquired pitching prospects [[Luis Atilano]] from Atlanta, [[Shairon Martis]] from [[List of San Francisco Giants seasons|San Francisco]] and [[Jhonny N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers seasons|Dodgers]]. In [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], they had two first-round draft picks, OF [[Chris Marrero]], and RHP [[Colten Williams]], and signed them both to developmental contracts.

[[Jos\u00e9 Rijo]], a key adviser to Jim Bowden, was thought to be at the heart of this. As a result of this scandal, General Manager Jim Bowden resigned in Spring training of 2009, though he maintained he had done nothing wrong.<ref name=\"laTimes2March2009\">{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Washington Nationals general manager Jim Bowden resigns|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/02/sports/sp-newswire2|accessdate=June 23, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nMike Rizzo, the man serving as assistant G.M. for the previous two seasons, became the acting GM. Rizzo began to shape the team in a way that was contrary to Bowden's previous methods. While Bowden was known for \"dumpster-diving\", that is attempting to find serviceable players among the less-than-desired, Mike Rizzo sought players who achieved results. Bowden took risks on players with poor reputations (such as outfielders [[Elijah Dukes]] and [[Lastings Milledge]]), while Rizzo made a point out of making certain his players possessed \"character\" and would contribute to a cohesive clubhouse.\n\nDespite the failures of Bowden's tenure, his last trade appeared to have been extremely beneficial to the Nationals, as he traded infielder [[Emilio Bonifacio]] and two minor-leaguers to the Marlins for starting pitcher Scott Olsen and outfielder [[Josh Willingham]].\n\nRizzo's first major trade during the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2009 season]] as General Manager of the Nationals was to trade Lastings Milledge along with control-challenged reliever [[Joel Hanrahan]] to the Pirates in exchange for speedy outfielder [[Nyjer Morgan]] and left-handed relief pitcher [[Sean Burnett]]. Morgan was thought to be a great clubhouse presence as well as a slick fielder on the outfield grass.\n\n[[File:MG 6582 Jason Marquis.jpg|150px |thumb|[[Jason Marquis]]]]\nMike Rizzo's new philosophy continued to show in the 2009\u20132010 offseason. He was able to acquire second baseman [[Adam Kennedy]], All Star starting pitcher [[Jason Marquis]] (who began the [[2010 Major League Baseball season|2010 season]] very poorly, though it was later revealed that he had bone chips in his throwing elbow, his ERA was over 13 at one point), and catcher Ivan \"Pudge\" Rodriguez. All three men had reputations as being great teammates. Collectively, they had extensive experience playing for successful teams. This was a contrast to the Nationals' roster at the time, which had some talented players who lacked experience playing for winning teams.\n\n===Seasons===\n{{prose|date=October 2014}}\n\n====2005====\n{{main|2005 Washington Nationals season}}\n\n[[Image:BushAsAPitcher.jpg|thumb|Then President [[George W.

Outfielder [[Terrmel Sledge]] hit the Nationals' first home run in the April 4 contest.\n*On April 6, 2005, the Nationals recorded their first-ever regular season win by beating the [[2005 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]], 7\u20133. The win came in their second game of the season and was highlighted by Wilkerson [[hit for the cycle|hitting for the cycle]].\n*On April 14, 2005, the Washington Nationals won their first regular season home game at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C, by a score of 5\u20133 against the [[2005 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]]. President [[George W. Bush]] kept up a tradition of sitting U.S. Presidents by throwing out the [[ceremonial first pitch]] on opening day in Washington, exactly 95 years after [[William Howard Taft]] started the tradition at Griffith Stadium. There were 45,596 fans in attendance, including former Senators players and [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bud Selig]]. [[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]] threw eight shutout innings, and [[Vinny Castilla]] was denied the chance to [[Hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] when Diamondback reliever [[Lance Cormier]] hit him with a pitch in the bottom of the eighth; Castilla needed only a single to complete the cycle. [[Chad Cordero]] recorded the save for Washington.\n*Between May 29 and June 15, 2005, the Nationals compiled a 15-2 record including a franchise record 10-game win streak (June 2\u201312).  Ten of those games were decided by 1 run.\n*On August 4, 2005, Brad Wilkerson became the first Washington Nationals player to ever hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], against then [[2005 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] relief pitcher [[Duaner S\u00e1nchez]]. The Nationals won the game 7\u20130 on a four-hit complete game shutout by [[John Patterson (pitcher)|John Patterson]].\n*During his August\u2013September callup, [[Ryan Zimmerman]] recorded 23 hits in 58 at-bats. He thus became the first member of the Washington Nationals to complete the season with a batting average of at least .300 in at least 50 at-bats.\n*The Nationals led all National League teams in interleague play in 2005, recording 12 wins.\n*At the halfway mark of the season, the Nationals were in first place in the National League East division, with a record of 50\u201331.

Although the Orioles won the first game of what would become known as the [[Beltway Series]] (which consisted of three games in Washington and three in Baltimore), the two teams split the season series, with the home team winning twice and the visitors once. These games marked the Orioles' first matchup with a Washington-based team in 35 years, as they played against [[Minnesota Twins|the original Senators]] from 1954 to 1960, and against [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|a new Senators team]] from 1961 to 1971.<ref group=note>Prior to 2006, the Nationals' natural rival was the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], dating back to their time in Montreal, and because the 2005 schedule was set with the Expos in mind, the two teams had to play another series that year.</ref>\n*On Father's Day, June 18, 2006, against the [[2006 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], the paid attendance was 45,157, the third-largest ever to see a single baseball game in the history of RFK Stadium. In that game, the Nationals beat the Yankees 3-2 on a two-run walk-off home run by rookie Ryan Zimmerman. (A [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]] doubleheader drew more spectators, as did the Nationals' first-ever home game with Arizona.)\n*On September 2, 2006, the Nationals rallied from three runs down in the first game and from five runs down in the second game to take a day\u2013night doubleheader sweep from the [[2006 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]], the first day-night doubleheader as part of the team's history in Washington.\n*On Labor Day, September 4, 2006, [[Ram\u00f3n Ortiz]] took a no-hitter into the ninth inning vs. the [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], but gave up a single to Aaron Miles on his second pitch in the 9th to break up the bid. Then he gave up a home run to [[Albert Pujols]], ending his chance to get his second career shutout. Ortiz himself also hit a home run in the 8th inning. The Nationals won 5\u20132.\n*On September 16, 2006, [[Alfonso Soriano]] became the fourth player to [[40\u201340 club|hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a season]] when he stole his 40th base in the first inning of a game against the [[2006 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]].
