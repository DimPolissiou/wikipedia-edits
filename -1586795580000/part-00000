It is 18.6m high, 22.9m wide, and 38.1m long from the lower back wall to the front of the stage. Stage walls slope inward to help focus the sound. With the exception of its wooden floors, the Hall is built of brick, steel, and plaster, with modest decoration. Side balconies are very shallow to avoid trapping or muffling sound, and the coffered ceiling and statue-filled niches along three sides help provide excellent acoustics to essentially every seat.

These included tongue-in-groove, three-quarter inch, hard maple boards, a compressed wool underlayment and hardened steel cut nails, hammered in by hand. The vertical grain fir subfloor from 1899 was in excellent shape and was left in place.

The hall's leather seats are the original ones installed in 1900. The hall seats 2,625 people during Symphony season and 2,371 during the Pops season, including 800 seats at tables on the main floor.\n\n==Statues==\nSixteen casts of notable Greek and Roman statues line the upper level of the hall's walls. Ten are of mythical subjects, and six of historical figures. All were produced by P. P. Caproni and Brother. The casts, as one faces the stage are:\n\n'''on the right, starting near the stage:'''\n[[Faun]] carrying the boy [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] (Roman copy of an original from the Hellenistic Period. Naples); [[Apollo Citharoedus]] (Roman artist. Excavated from Cassius' Villa near Tivoli in 1774. Vatican); Young Woman of (Excavated from [[Herculaneum]] in 1711. Dresden); Dancing [[Faun]] (Rome); [[Demosthenes]] (Rome); Seated [[Anacreon]] (Copenhagen); Statue of a tragic poet with the head of [[Euripides]] (Vatican); [[Diana of Versailles]] (Paris);\n\n'''on the left, starting near the stage:'''\nResting [[Satyr]] ([[Praxiteles]], Rome); Wounded [[Amazons|Amazon]] ([[Polykleitos|Polycleitus]], Berlin); [[Hermes Logios (sculpture)|Hermes Logios]] (Paris); [[Lemnian Athena]] (Dresden, with head in Bologna); The Lateran [[Sophocles]] (Vatican); Standing [[Anacreon]] (Copenhagen); [[Aeschines]] (Naples); [[Apollo Belvedere]] (Rome).\n\n==Organ==\nThe Symphony Hall organ, a 4,800-pipe [[Aeolian-Skinner]] (Opus 1134) was designed by [[G. Donald Harrison]], installed in 1949, and autographed by [[Albert Schweitzer]]. It replaced the hall's first organ, built in 1900 by [[George S. Hutchings]] of Boston, which was electrically keyed, with 62 ranks of nearly 4,000 pipes set in a chamber 12 feet deep and 40 feet high. The Hutchings organ had fallen out of fashion by the 1940s when lighter, clearer tones became preferred. [[E. Power Biggs]], often a featured organist for the orchestra, lobbied hard for a thinner bass sound and accentuated treble.\n\nThe 1949 Aeolian-Skinner reused and modified more than 60% of the existing Hutchings pipes and added 600 new pipes in a Positiv division. The original diapason pipes, 32 feet in length, were reportedly sawed into manageable pieces for disposal in 1948.\n\nIn 2003, the organ was thoroughly overhauled by Foley-Baker Inc., reusing its chassis and many pipes, but enclosing the Bombarde and adding to it the long-desired Principal (diapason) pipes, adding a new Solo division, and reworking its chamber for better sound projection.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of concert halls]]\n* [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Boston, Massachusetts]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2014}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Boston Symphony Orchestra, ''Symphony Hall: The First 100 Years'', January 2000. {{ISBN|0-9671148-2-9}}\n* Boston Symphony Orchestra, ''Program Notes'', October 1, 2005, April 8, 2006\n* Leo Beranek, ''Concert Halls and Opera Houses: Music, Acoustics, and Architecture'' (2003), {{ISBN|978-0-387-95524-7}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Symphony Hall (Boston)}}\n* [https://www.bso.org/?brands=6426 Symphony Hall]\n\n{{BostonMA}}\n{{Boston Landmarks}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Boston]]\n[[Category:Concert halls in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Culture of Boston]]\n[[Category:Fenway\u2013Kenmore]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Fenway\u2013Kenmore]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Boston]]\n[[Category:Music venues completed in 1900]]\n[[Category:Music venues in Boston]]\n[[Category:1900 establishments in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Event venues on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boston]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox venue\n| name                   = Symphony Hall\n| nickname               =\n| fullname               =\n| former names           =\n| logo_image             =\n| logo_caption           =\n| image = Boston_Symphony_Hall_from_the_south.jpg\n| caption = Symphony Hall from the south.\n| image_size             = 250px\n| image_alt              =\n| pushpin_map            =\n| pushpin_mapsize        =\n| pushpin_map_caption    =\n| pushpin_label_position =\n| address                = 301 [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]]\n| location               = [[Boston, Massachusetts]]\n| coordinates            = {{coord|42|20|34.2|N|71|5|8.5|W|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| type                   = concert hall\n| broke_ground           = June, 12, 1899\n| built                  = 1900\n| opened                 = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD|df=y}} -->\n| renovated              =\n| expanded               =\n| closed                 =\n| demolished             =\n| owner                  = [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]\n| operator               =\n| cost                   =\n| architect              =\n| capacity               =\n| tenants                =\n| embedded               =\n {{Infobox NRHP| name =Symphony Hall\n| embed = yes\n| nrhp_type = nhl\n| location=\n| area =\n| built = \n| architect=  McKim, Mead and White\n| architecture= [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]\n|designated_nrhp_type=January 20, 1999<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=-191152283&ResourceType=Building |title=Symphony Hall |accessdate=2009-03-25|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n| added = January 20, 1999\n| governing_body = Private\n| refnum=99000633<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2007a}}</ref>\n}}\n| website                = {{URL|https://www.bso.org/?brands=6426|www.bso.org}}\n| publictransit          = [[Symphony (MBTA station)|Symphony]]\n}}\n[[File:Boston Symphony Hall.jpg|thumb|Inside Symphony Hall.]]\n\n'''Symphony Hall''' is a [[concert hall]] located at 301 [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

Though both sexes compete at amateur and youth levels, in collegiate and professional ranks, it is a rodeo event for women.  It combines the horse's athletic ability and the horsemanship skills of a rider in order to safely and successfully maneuver a horse in a pattern around three barrels (typically three water barrels) placed in a triangle in the center of an arena.\n\n== History==\nBarrel racing originally developed as an event for women. In early barrel racing, the pattern alternated between a figure-eight and a cloverleaf pattern. The figure-eight was eventually dropped in favor of the more difficult cloverleaf.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Barrel Racing | url = http://www.gailwoerner.com/way-out-west-blog/the-history-of-barrel-racing | publisher = Gail Woerner|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that competitive barrel racing was first held in Texas. The [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association]] (WPRA) was developed in 1948 by a group of women from [[Texas]] who were looking to make a home for themselves and women in general in the sport of rodeo.<ref>{{cite web |title=History (WPRA) |url=http://www.wpra.com/ |publisher=Women's Professional Rodeo Association|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref> When it initially began, the WPRA was called the Girls Rodeo Association, with the acronym GRA. It consisted of only 74 members, with as few as 60 approved tour events. The Girls Rodeo Association was the first body of rodeo developed specifically for women. The GRA eventually changed its name and officially became the WPRA in 1981, and the WPRA still allows women to compete in the various rodeo events as they like, but barrel racing remains the most popular event competition.\n\n==Modern event==\nToday barrel racing is a part of most [[rodeo]]s and is also included in [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]] or  O-Mok-See events, which are a mostly amateur competition open to riders of all ages and abilities. There are also open barrel racing jackpots (open to all contestants no matter their age or gender). Barrel racing at this level is usually an event in which age group riders compete against each other, others including the [[keyhole race]] and [[pole bending]].\n\nIn barrel racing the purpose is to run the pattern as fast as possible. The times are measured either by an [[electric eye]], a device using a laser system to record times, or by a judge who drops a flag to let the timer know when to hit the timer stop. Judges and timers are more commonly seen in local and non-professional events.  The timer begins when horse and rider cross the start line, and ends when the barrel pattern has been successfully executed and horse and rider cross the finish line. The rider's time depends on several factors, most commonly the horse's physical and mental condition, the rider's horsemanship abilities, and the type of ground or footing (the quality, depth, content, etc. of the sand or dirt in the arena).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rodeo.about.com/cs/barrelracing/a/barrelbasics.htm |title=Barrel Racing Basics - Timed Rodeo Event |publisher=Rodeo.about.com |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Barrel course.png|thumb|Diagram of a Barrel Racing Course. Riders enter at the red line, circle around the 1st barrel, proceed to the 2nd barrel, and then continue on to the 3rd where they will complete the pattern and finally exit the course crossing the red line a second time. This pattern is often referred to as a \"Cloverleaf\" The pattern may also begin with the left barrel first.]]  Beginning a barrel race, the horse and rider will enter the arena at top speed, through the center entrance (or alley if in a rodeo arena). Once in the arena, the electronic timer beam is crossed by the horse and rider. The timer keeps running until the beam is crossed again at the end of the run.\n\nModern barrel racing horses not only need to be fast, but also strong, agile, and intelligent. Strength and agility are needed to maneuver the course in as little distance as possible.  A horse that is able to \"hug the barrels\" as well as maneuver the course quickly and accurately follow commands, will be a horse with consistently low times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stock-horse-show-source.com/horse-games.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226112312/http://www.stock-horse-show-source.com/horse-games.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=December 26, 2008|title=stock-horse-show-source.com |publisher=stock-horse-show-source.com |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2015|df= }}</ref>\n\n==Rules and pattern==\n\nIn barrel racing, the fastest time wins. Running past a barrel and off the pattern will result in a \"no time\" score and disqualification. If a barrel racer or her horse hits a barrel and knocks it over there is a time penalty of five seconds (sometimes more), which usually will result in a time too slow to win.  There is a sixty-second time limit to complete the course after time begins.  Contestants cannot be required to start a run from an off-center alleyway, but contestants are not allowed to enter the arena and \"set\" the horse.  At professional rodeos, it is required that the arena be [[harrow (tool)|harrow]]ed after twelve contestants have run.  Barrels are required to be fifty-five gallons, metal, enclosed at both ends, and of at least two colors.  Competitors in the National Barrel Racing Association (NBRA) are required to wear a western long-sleeved shirt (tucked in), western cut pants or jeans, western hat, and boots. Competitors are required to abide by this dress code beginning one hour before the competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowgirls Barrel Racing|url=http://www.pbbanow.com/NBRA%20BARREL%20RACING%20RULES.pdf|website=NBRA|publisher=www.pbbanow.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715055413/http://www.pbbanow.com/NBRA%20BARREL%20RACING%20RULES.pdf|archivedate=July 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nStandard barrel racing patterns require measured distances between the start line and the first barrel, from the first to the second barrel, and  from the second to the third barrel. <ref>{{cite web|title=Barrel Racing Pattern|url=http://www.barrelracingclinic.com/BarrelPattern.htm|website=Clinic@BarrelRacingClinic.com|publisher=www.barrelracingclinic.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704123636/http://www.barrelracingclinic.com/BarrelPattern.htm|archivedate=July 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nUsually the established distances are as follows:\n\n* 90 feet between barrel 1 and 2.\n* 105 feet between barrel 1 and 3 and between 2 and 3.\n* 60 feet from barrels 1 and 2 to score line.\n\nIn a standard [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association|WPRA]] pattern, the score line begins at the plane of arena, meaning from fence to fence regardless of the position of the electric eye or timer.\n\nIn larger arenas, there is a maximum allowable distance of 105 feet between barrels 1 and 2, and a maximum distance of 120 feet between barrels 2 and 3, and 1 and 3. Barrels 1 and 2 must be at least 18 feet from the sides of the arena \u2014 in smaller arenas this distance may be less, but in no instance should the barrels be any closer than 15 feet from the sides of the arena.\n\nBarrel 3 should be no closer than 25 feet from the end of the arena, and should be set no more than 15 feet longer than the first and second barrel. If arena size permits, barrels must be set 60 feet or further apart. In small arenas it is recommended the pattern be reduced proportionately to a standard barrel pattern.\n\nThe above pattern is the set pattern for the [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association]] (WPRA), and The National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA).\n\nThe National Barrel Horse Association (NBHA) use the following layout for governing patterns:\n\n* A minimum of 15 feet between each of the first two barrels and the side fence.\n* A minimum of 30 feet between the third barrel and the back fence.\n* A minimum of 30 feet between the time line and the first barrel.\n\n===Competition technique===\nThe approach to the first barrel particularly critical. The rider can decide whether to go to the left or the right barrel first. Each turn in barrel racing is, ideally a relatively even half circle around the barrel, taking about three strides. In approaching the second barrel, the horse must do a [[flying change]] of lead and rider must identify the correct spot to approach the turn around the second barrel. The turn around the third and final barrel is in the same direction as the second barrel. Completing the third and final turn, horse and rider race for \"home\", the line that stops the timer and ends the run.\n\nAs the horse sets up to take the turn, the rider must be in position as well, sitting deeply in the saddle, using the inside hand to guide the horse through and around the barrel turn. The rider's leg to the inside of the turn is held securely along the girth to support the horse's rib cage and give them a focal point for the turn. The athleticism required for this maneuvering comes from optimum physical fitness of the rider and especially the horse. Improper preparation for such a sport can cause injury to both horse and rider. Injury can be avoided by using the proper protection for both horse and rider.\n\n== Associations and sanctioning bodies ==\n[[Image:JasmineBarrelInsane.jpg|thumb|right|Training the pattern]]\n\nSince its beginnings, the sport has developed over the years into a highly organized, exciting, but well-governed sport. The main sanctioning body of professional female rodeo athletes is the [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association]].  Today, the WPRA boasts a total of over 800 sanctioned tour events with an annual payout of more than three million dollars. The WPRA is divided into 12 divisional circuits. Average and overall winners from their circuit compete at the Ram National Circuit Finals Rodeo. In the United States, two national organizations promote events for barrel racing alone: the National Barrel Horse Association and [http://www.betterbarrelraces.com Better Barrel Races]. The WPRA is co-sanctioned with the PRCA (Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association) to allow women to compete in PRCA-endorsed rodeos. Without the co-sanction, barrel racing would be removed from PRCA rodeos and the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.\n\n==Horses==\nThe [[American Quarter Horse]] is the most commonly used horse breed.<ref name=Menarim/>\n\nPurchase price of a high caliber barrel racing horse can easily reach $25,000, depending on the ability and individuality of the horse. While breeding is one major influence in the sale price of a horse, athletic ability, intelligence and drive, as well as the overall state of the economy, all play a role.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ehringer |first1=Gavin |title=The Cost Of Being A Cowgirl |url=https://cowgirlmagazine.com/the-cost-of-being-a-cowgirl/ |website=COWGIRL Magazine |accessdate=16 December 2019 |date=2 February 2015}}</ref> Prices can vary a great deal depending on market conditions. The highest-selling barrel racing horse sold at a public auction in 2009 sold for $68.000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Market Watch 2009 |url=https://barrelhorsenews.com/barrel-racing-articles/statistics/market-watch-2009/ |website=Barrel Horse News |accessdate=17 December 2019 |date=10 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Tack and equipment ==\nThere are no specific bits required for barrel racing, although some bits are more common to barrel racers.  The type used is determined by an individual horse's needs.  Bits with longer shanks cause the horse to stop quicker than normal due to the additional leverage on the poll and jaw, while bits with shorter shanks  provide better control for turns. [[Curb chain]]s, [[noseband]]s, and [[Martingale (tack)|tiedowns]] are used as needed.<ref name=\"horse911.com\">{{cite web|title=Barrel Racing Tack & Equipment|url=http://www.horse411.com/barrel-racing-tack-equipment/|website=Horse411|publisher=www.horse411.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018|date=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nTypically, reins used in barrel racing competitions are a single looped rein.  This allows the rider the ability to quickly recover the reins if dropped, unlike split reins.  Leather reins are widely used.  These can be flat or braided, but both varieties have a tendency to become slippery when wet.  Reins made of synthetic materials are also available.<ref name=\"horse911.com\"/>\n\nA lightweight [[western saddle]] with a high pommel and cantle is ideal.  Forward hung stirrups also help to keep the rider's feet in proper position.  Typically, riders choose a saddle that is up to a full size smaller than he or she would normally use.  Most importantly, it must fit the rider's horse properly.

Though both sexes compete at amateur and youth levels, in collegiate and professional ranks, it is a rodeo event for women.  It combines the horse's athletic ability and the horsemanship skills of a rider in order to safely and successfully maneuver a horse in a pattern around three barrels (typically three water barrels) placed in a triangle in the center of an arena.\n\n== History==\nBarrel racing originally developed as an event for women. In early barrel racing, the pattern alternated between a figure-eight and a cloverleaf pattern. The figure-eight was eventually dropped in favor of the more difficult cloverleaf.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Barrel Racing | url = http://www.gailwoerner.com/way-out-west-blog/the-history-of-barrel-racing | publisher = Gail Woerner|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that competitive barrel racing was first held in Texas. The [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association]] (WPRA) was developed in 1948 by a group of women from [[Texas]] who were looking to make a home for themselves and women in general in the sport of rodeo.<ref>{{cite web |title=History (WPRA) |url=http://www.wpra.com/ |publisher=Women's Professional Rodeo Association|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref> When it initially began, the WPRA was called the Girls Rodeo Association, with the acronym GRA. It consisted of only 74 members, with as few as 60 approved tour events. The Girls Rodeo Association was the first body of rodeo developed specifically for women. The GRA eventually changed its name and officially became the WPRA in 1981, and the WPRA still allows women to compete in the various rodeo events as they like, but barrel racing remains the most popular event competition.\n\n==Modern event==\nToday barrel racing is a part of most [[rodeo]]s and is also included in [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]] or  O-Mok-See events, which are a mostly amateur competition open to riders of all ages and abilities. There are also open barrel racing jackpots (open to all contestants no matter their age or gender). Barrel racing at this level is usually an event in which age group riders compete against each other, others including the [[keyhole race]] and [[pole bending]].\n\nIn barrel racing the purpose is to run the pattern as fast as possible. The times are measured either by an [[electric eye]], a device using a laser system to record times, or by a judge who drops a flag to let the timer know when to hit the timer stop. Judges and timers are more commonly seen in local and non-professional events.  The timer begins when horse and rider cross the start line, and ends when the barrel pattern has been successfully executed and horse and rider cross the finish line. The rider's time depends on several factors, most commonly the horse's physical and mental condition, the rider's horsemanship abilities, and the type of ground or footing (the quality, depth, content, etc. of the sand or dirt in the arena).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rodeo.about.com/cs/barrelracing/a/barrelbasics.htm |title=Barrel Racing Basics - Timed Rodeo Event |publisher=Rodeo.about.com |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Barrel course.png|thumb|Diagram of a Barrel Racing Course. Riders enter at the red line, circle around the 1st barrel, proceed to the 2nd barrel, and then continue on to the 3rd where they will complete the pattern and finally exit the course crossing the red line a second time. This pattern is often referred to as a \"Cloverleaf\" The pattern may also begin with the left barrel first.]]  Beginning a barrel race, the horse and rider will enter the arena at top speed, through the center entrance (or alley if in a rodeo arena). Once in the arena, the electronic timer beam is crossed by the horse and rider. The timer keeps running until the beam is crossed again at the end of the run.\n\nModern barrel racing horses not only need to be fast, but also strong, agile, and intelligent. Strength and agility are needed to maneuver the course in as little distance as possible.  A horse that is able to \"hug the barrels\" as well as maneuver the course quickly and accurately follow commands, will be a horse with consistently low times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stock-horse-show-source.com/horse-games.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226112312/http://www.stock-horse-show-source.com/horse-games.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=December 26, 2008|title=stock-horse-show-source.com |publisher=stock-horse-show-source.com |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2015|df= }}</ref>\n\n==Rules and pattern==\n\nIn barrel racing, the fastest time wins. Running past a barrel and off the pattern will result in a \"no time\" score and disqualification. If a barrel racer or her horse hits a barrel and knocks it over there is a time penalty of five seconds (sometimes more), which usually will result in a time too slow to win.  There is a sixty-second time limit to complete the course after time begins.  Contestants cannot be required to start a run from an off-center alleyway, but contestants are not allowed to enter the arena and \"set\" the horse.  At professional rodeos, it is required that the arena be [[harrow (tool)|harrow]]ed after twelve contestants have run.  Barrels are required to be fifty-five gallons, metal, enclosed at both ends, and of at least two colors.  Competitors in the National Barrel Racing Association (NBRA) are required to wear a western long-sleeved shirt (tucked in), western cut pants or jeans, western hat, and boots. Competitors are required to abide by this dress code beginning one hour before the competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowgirls Barrel Racing|url=http://www.pbbanow.com/NBRA%20BARREL%20RACING%20RULES.pdf|website=NBRA|publisher=www.pbbanow.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715055413/http://www.pbbanow.com/NBRA%20BARREL%20RACING%20RULES.pdf|archivedate=July 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nStandard barrel racing patterns require measured distances between the start line and the first barrel, from the first to the second barrel, and  from the second to the third barrel. <ref>{{cite web|title=Barrel Racing Pattern|url=http://www.barrelracingclinic.com/BarrelPattern.htm|website=Clinic@BarrelRacingClinic.com|publisher=www.barrelracingclinic.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704123636/http://www.barrelracingclinic.com/BarrelPattern.htm|archivedate=July 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nUsually the established distances are as follows:\n\n* 90 feet between barrel 1 and 2.\n* 105 feet between barrel 1 and 3 and between 2 and 3.\n* 60 feet from barrels 1 and 2 to score line.\n\nIn a standard [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association|WPRA]] pattern, the score line begins at the plane of arena, meaning from fence to fence regardless of the position of the electric eye or timer.\n\nIn larger arenas, there is a maximum allowable distance of 105 feet between barrels 1 and 2, and a maximum distance of 120 feet between barrels 2 and 3, and 1 and 3. Barrels 1 and 2 must be at least 18 feet from the sides of the arena \u2014 in smaller arenas this distance may be less, but in no instance should the barrels be any closer than 15 feet from the sides of the arena.\n\nBarrel 3 should be no closer than 25 feet from the end of the arena, and should be set no more than 15 feet longer than the first and second barrel. If arena size permits, barrels must be set 60 feet or further apart. In small arenas it is recommended the pattern be reduced proportionately to a standard barrel pattern.\n\nThe above pattern is the set pattern for the [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association]] (WPRA), and The National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA).\n\nThe National Barrel Horse Association (NBHA) use the following layout for governing patterns:\n\n* A minimum of 15 feet between each of the first two barrels and the side fence.\n* A minimum of 30 feet between the third barrel and the back fence.\n* A minimum of 30 feet between the time line and the first barrel.\n\n===Competition technique===\nThe approach to the first barrel particularly critical. The rider can decide whether to go to the left or the right barrel first. Each turn in barrel racing is, ideally a relatively even half circle around the barrel, taking about three strides. In approaching the second barrel, the horse must do a [[flying change]] of lead and rider must identify the correct spot to approach the turn around the second barrel. The turn around the third and final barrel is in the same direction as the second barrel. Completing the third and final turn, horse and rider race for \"home\", the line that stops the timer and ends the run.\n\nAs the horse sets up to take the turn, the rider must be in position as well, sitting deeply in the saddle, using the inside hand to guide the horse through and around the barrel turn. The rider's leg to the inside of the turn is held securely along the girth to support the horse's rib cage and give them a focal point for the turn. The athleticism required for this maneuvering comes from optimum physical fitness of the rider and especially the horse. Improper preparation for such a sport can cause injury to both horse and rider. Injury can be avoided by using the proper protection for both horse and rider.\n\n== Associations and sanctioning bodies ==\n[[Image:JasmineBarrelInsane.jpg|thumb|right|Training the pattern]]\n\nSince its beginnings, the sport has developed over the years into a highly organized, exciting, but well-governed sport. The main sanctioning body of professional female rodeo athletes is the [[Women's Professional Rodeo Association]].  Today, the WPRA boasts a total of over 800 sanctioned tour events with an annual payout of more than three million dollars. The WPRA is divided into 12 divisional circuits. Average and overall winners from their circuit compete at the Ram National Circuit Finals Rodeo. In the United States, two national organizations promote events for barrel racing alone: the National Barrel Horse Association and [http://www.betterbarrelraces.com Better Barrel Races]. The WPRA is co-sanctioned with the PRCA (Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association) to allow women to compete in PRCA-endorsed rodeos. Without the co-sanction, barrel racing would be removed from PRCA rodeos and the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.\n\n==Horses==\nThe [[American Quarter Horse]] is the most commonly used horse breed.<ref name=Menarim/>\n\nPurchase price of a high caliber barrel racing horse can easily reach $25,000, depending on the ability and individuality of the horse. While breeding is one major influence in the sale price of a horse, athletic ability, intelligence and drive, as well as the overall state of the economy, all play a role.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ehringer |first1=Gavin |title=The Cost Of Being A Cowgirl |url=https://cowgirlmagazine.com/the-cost-of-being-a-cowgirl/ |website=COWGIRL Magazine |accessdate=16 December 2019 |date=2 February 2015}}</ref> Prices can vary a great deal depending on market conditions.

The type used is determined by an individual horse's needs.  Bits with longer shanks cause the horse to stop quicker than normal due to the additional leverage on the poll and jaw, while bits with shorter shanks  provide better control for turns. [[Curb chain]]s, [[noseband]]s, and [[martingale|tiedowns]] are used as needed.<ref name=\"horse911.com\">{{cite web|title=Barrel Racing Tack & Equipment|url=http://www.horse411.com/barrel-racing-tack-equipment/|website=Horse411|publisher=www.horse411.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018|date=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nTypically, reins used in barrel racing competitions are a single looped rein.  This allows the rider the ability to quickly recover the reins if dropped, unlike split reins.  Leather reins are widely used.  These can be flat or braided, but both varieties have a tendency to become slippery when wet.  Reins made of synthetic materials are also available.<ref name=\"horse911.com\"/>\n\nA lightweight [[western saddle]] with a high pommel and cantle is ideal.  Forward hung stirrups also help to keep the rider's feet in proper position.  Typically, riders choose a saddle that is up to a full size smaller than he or she would normally use.  Most importantly, it must fit the rider's horse properly.  [[Saddle pad]]s and cinches are chosen based on the horse's size.<ref name=\"horse911.com\"/>\n\n== Camas Prairie Stump Race ==\n[[Image:Camas Prairie Stump Race course.png|thumb|Camas Prairie Stump Race course]]\nThe Camas Prairie Stump Race is a barrel race which is also a [[match race]]: two horses race against each other on identical circuits opposite the start-finish line; the riders start beside each other facing in opposite directions, and the first horse and rider back across the line win the race.

The story is told with chapters of alternating perspectives. The plot revolves around Donovan Curtis, a troublemaker that gets wrapped up in a major prank gone wrong. Due to an accident caused by the superintendent, Donovan gets sent to the Academy of Scholastic Distinction (ASD); a school for gifted and talented students. The rest of the novel is spent on Donovan avoiding being caught while helping the students of ASD through his own special gifts.\n\n== Plot ==\nDonovan Curtis thinks he's ungifted. He's the ultimate prankster and trouble-maker. But one day, he goes too far in causing a commotion. He strikes a statue of Atlas with a stick, causing the globe Atlas was holding to roll into the gymnasium, where a basketball game is taking place. No one is injured, but the gym is completely demolished. \n\nThe district superintendent, Dr. Schultz, is watching the game. He catches Donovan red-handed. However, when he jots down Donovan's name, he accidentally writes it on the list of candidates for the Academy for Scholastic Distinction (ASD), a school for extremely gifted students. \n\nDonovan knows he will be busted and feels that he will cause more stress to his already stressed out household. His older sister, Katie, is currently staying with them and is seven months pregnant. Katie's husband, Brad, is deployed in Afghanistan with the Marines. Adding to the pressure, Katie's mother-in-law drops off Brad's dog, who seems to be ill and only takes a liking to Donovan. But after learning he is getting sent to ASD, it is filled with joy by the mistake. \n\nOn his first day, Donovan meets his classmates and while some seem to be annoyed by him, some take a liking to him, especially Chloe, a girl interested in normal things. While Donovan continues to hide out in the Academy, his teachers begin to question if he is gifted.\n\nDonovan also joins Robotics, a class taught by his homeroom teacher Mr. Osborne (Mr. Oz). Donovan helps give their robot a name: Tin Man Metallica Squarepants, gets his classmate Noah (an extremely intelligent and serious boy) hooked to YouTube and shows his classmates the talent he has of controlling the robot with a joystick.\n\nEventually, Donovan learns his classmates will have to go to summer school for failing to take Human Growth and Development. To help them, he convinces his sister to teach his classmates, which eventually gets approved as an actual credit.\n\n Characters \n* Chloe Garfinkle\n* Donovan Curtis\n* Mr. Osborn\n* Dr. Schultz\n* Abigail Lee\n* Noah Youkilis\n* The Daniels\n* Katie Patterson\n* Brad Patterson\n* Ms. Bevelaqua\n\n== Awards and Achievements ==\n* Winner of the 2014 Red Cedar Award (BC Young Readers' Choice)\n* Short-listed for the 2015 Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers' Choice\n* Short-listed for the 2013 Snow Willow Award (Saskatchewan Young Readers' Choice)\n* Short-listed for the 2013 Canadian Library Association Book of the Year For Children\n* Runner-up of the 2014 Manitoba Young Readers' Choice Award\n* Commended for the 2013 OLA Best Bets\n* Commended for the 2013 Best Books for Kids and Teens, Canadian Children's Book Centre<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scholastic.ca/books/view/ungifted |title=Scholastic: Ungifted |website=scholastic.ca |publisher=Scholastic Canada Ltd. |accessdate=28 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Ungifted'' has received reviews from [[School Library Journal]], [[Voice of Youth Advocates]] (VOYA), ALA [[Booklist]], the [[National Post]], [[Publishers Weekly]], [[New York Times Book Review]], the [[Horn Book Guide]], Children's Literature, [[Junior Library Guild]], and [[Kirkus Reviews]].

The story is told with chapters of alternating perspectives. The plot revolves around Donovan Curtis, a troublemaker that gets wrapped up in a major prank gone wrong. Due to an accident caused by the superintendent, Donovan gets sent to the Academy of Scholastic Distinction (ASD); a school for gifted and talented students. The rest of the novel is spent on Donovan avoiding being caught while helping the students of ASD through his own special gifts.\n\n== Plot ==\nDonovan Curtis thinks he's ungifted. He's the ultimate prankster and trouble-maker. But one day, he goes too far in causing a commotion. He strikes a statue of Atlas with a stick, causing the globe Atlas was holding to roll into the gymnasium, where a basketball game is taking place. No one is injured, but the gym is completely demolished. \n\nThe district superintendent, Dr. Schultz, is watching the game. He catches Donovan red-handed. However, when he jots down Donovan's name, he accidentally writes it on the list of candidates for the Academy for Scholastic Distinction (ASD), a school for extremely gifted students. \n\nDonovan knows he will be busted and feels that he will cause more stress to his already stressed out household. His older sister, Katie, is currently staying with them and is seven months pregnant. Katie's husband, Brad, is deployed in Afghanistan with the Marines. Adding to the pressure, Katie's mother-in-law drops off Brad's dog, who seems to be ill and only takes a liking to Donovan. But after learning he is getting sent to ASD, it is filled with joy by the mistake. \n\nOn his first day, Donovan meets his classmates and while some seem to be annoyed by him, some take a liking to him, especially Chloe, a girl interested in normal things. While Donovan continues to hide out in the Academy, his teachers begin to question if he is gifted.\n\nDonovan also joins Robotics, a class taught by his homeroom teacher Mr. Osborne (Mr. Oz). Donovan helps give their robot a name: Tin Man Metallica Squarepants, gets his classmate Noah (an extremely intelligent and serious boy) hooked to YouTube and shows his classmates the talent he has of controlling the robot with a joystick.\n\nEventually, Donovan learns his classmates will have to go to summer school for failing to take Human Growth and Development. To help them, he convinces his sister to teach his classmates, which eventually gets approved as an actual credit.\n\n Characters \n* Chloe Garfinkle\n* Donovan Curtis\n* Mr. Osborn\n* Dr. Schultz\n* Abigail Lee\n* Noah Youkilis\n* The Daniels\n* Katie Patterson\n* Brad Patterson\n\n== Awards and Achievements ==\n* Winner of the 2014 Red Cedar Award (BC Young Readers' Choice)\n* Short-listed for the 2015 Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers' Choice\n* Short-listed for the 2013 Snow Willow Award (Saskatchewan Young Readers' Choice)\n* Short-listed for the 2013 Canadian Library Association Book of the Year For Children\n* Runner-up of the 2014 Manitoba Young Readers' Choice Award\n* Commended for the 2013 OLA Best Bets\n* Commended for the 2013 Best Books for Kids and Teens, Canadian Children's Book Centre<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scholastic.ca/books/view/ungifted |title=Scholastic: Ungifted |website=scholastic.ca |publisher=Scholastic Canada Ltd. |accessdate=28 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Ungifted'' has received reviews from [[School Library Journal]], [[Voice of Youth Advocates]] (VOYA), ALA [[Booklist]], the [[National Post]], [[Publishers Weekly]], [[New York Times Book Review]], the [[Horn Book Guide]], Children's Literature, [[Junior Library Guild]], and [[Kirkus Reviews]].

informally delineated historical and [[Social class in the United States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms.

Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]].

Society, William Morrison Collection'')|279x279px]]\n\nThe '''Philadelphia Main Line''', known simply as the '''Main Line''', is an informally delineated historical and [[Social class in the United States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms. Its historical background, growth and community life |first=Tello J. |last=D'Ap\u00e9ry| publisher= Magee Press| location=Philadelphia| year=1936| page=4| url=http://www.phillyh2o.org/backpages/PDFs_Misc/OverbrookFarms_Apery_1936.pdf#page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built its main line during the early 19th century as part of the [[Main Line of Public Works]] that spanned Pennsylvania. Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]]. As such, communities west along the Main Line to Thorndale or even as far west as Parkesburg are considered to be a part of the Main Line.\n\n==Demographics==\nThere is no collective data for the Main Line, so all data is by [[ZIP code]]. In comparison, the median family income and home price for the state of Pennsylvania are $68,646 and $155,000, respectively.<ref>[http://www.brainyzip.com BrainyZip]</ref><ref>[http://www.zip-codes.com Zip-codes.com]</ref> The following ZIP codes are those within the previously mentioned municipalities that make up the Main Line.
