The series traces two long-prepared heists led by [[The Professor (Money Heist)|the Professor]] ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]), one on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]], and one on the [[Bank of Spain]]. The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe series was filmed in [[Madrid]], Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in Panama, Thailand and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an [[unreliable narrator]] for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman, [[Tokyo (Money Heist)|Tokyo]], ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received several awards including best drama series at the [[46th International Emmy Awards]], as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]],\" which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Premise ==\nSet in [[Madrid]], a mysterious man known as \"The Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose cities for code-names, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the [[Royal Mint (Spain)|Royal Mint of Spain]], and escaping with \u20ac2.4 billion. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events succeeding the initial heist, the group are forced out of hiding, and find themselves preparing for a second heist, this time on the [[Bank of Spain]], as they again deal with hostages and police forces.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a very small project in a simple way; we

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates on the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva.\" The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320) ===\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo, and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets. At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and the police catch Lisbon. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in a tent outside of the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to help them, and the Professor can establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manages to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda escapes, begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo can regain the trust of the group and rejoins them. Gand\u00eda shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and the holding of Lisbon to the public. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred to the Supreme Court. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang within the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda

The series traces two long-prepared heists led by [[The Professor (Money Heist)|the Professor]] ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]), one on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]], and one on the [[Bank of Spain]]. The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe series was filmed in [[Madrid]], Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in Panama, Thailand and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an [[unreliable narrator]] for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman, [[Tokyo (Money Heist)|Tokyo]], ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received several awards including best drama series at the [[46th International Emmy Awards]], as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]],\" which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Premise ==\nSet in [[Madrid]], a mysterious man known as \"The Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose cities for code-names, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the [[Royal Mint (Spain)|Royal Mint of Spain]], and escaping with \u20ac2.4 billion. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events succeeding the initial heist, the group are forced out of hiding, and find themselves preparing for a second heist, this time on the [[Bank of Spain]], as they again deal with hostages and police forces.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n\n{{further|#Themes and analysis}}\n\n{{Quote box |title= |quote=\"We wanted to make a very small project in a simple way; we

After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates on the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva.\" The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320) ===\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo, and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets. At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and the police catch Lisbon. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in a tent outside of the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, to help them, and the Professor can establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manages to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda escapes, begins communications with the police from within a [[panic room]] inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo can regain the trust of the group and rejoins them. Gand\u00eda shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes the unlawful torture of Rio and the holding of Lisbon to the public. Due to this revelation, Sierra is fired and begins a pursuit of the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred to the Supreme Court. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang within the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, holding him at gunpoint.\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the [[heist genre]]. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.<ref name=lavozdeasturias_190126>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Mar\u00eda

Drummer [[Spencer Dryden]] was ousted from the group, [[Marty Balin]] found his commitment to the band he had started becoming tenuous, [[Grace Slick]] was pregnant with her [[China Kantner|daughter]] for a good part of the year, [[Paul Kantner]] released his solo album ''[[Blows Against the Empire]]'', and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] and [[Jack Casady]] busied themselves with their side project, [[Hot Tuna]]. With no group project in sight, RCA Records assembled this album centered upon the group's hit singles, with input from the band. \"The Ballad of You & Me & Pooneil\", \"[[Crown of Creation]]\", and \"[[Volunteers (song)|Volunteers]]\" all made the lower reaches of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\" and \"[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]\" were the band's only [[Top 40]] hits, reaching #5 and #8 respectively. To ensure a full picture of the group's musical interests, and possibly to ensure solidarity in the publishing income, the band included instrumentals by Dryden and Kaukonen, a [[country blues]]/[[gospel music|gospel]] cover arranged by Kaukonen, and Balin's straightforward ballad \"Today\".\n\nThis would be the final album featuring what is considered the \"classic\" line-up of the band, after Slick and Dryden joined, and before Balin and Dryden left. Original copies of the LP contained an inner sleeve that was a reproduction of a 1918 vintage [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] sleeve and the record featured  late 1920s vintage Victor labels. The interior of the [[gatefold|gatefold cover]] featured a large color reproduction of the painting \"[[His Master's Voice]]\", the famous RCA Victor trademark.

Drummer [[Spencer Dryden]] was ousted from the group, [[Marty Balin]] found his commitment to the band he had started becoming tenuous, [[Grace Slick]] was pregnant with her [[China Kantner|daughter]] for a good part of the year, [[Paul Kantner]] released his solo album ''[[Blows Against the Empire]]'', and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] and [[Jack Casady]] busied themselves with their side project, [[Hot Tuna]]. With no group project in sight, RCA Records assembled this album centered upon the group's hit singles, with input from the band. \"The Ballad of You & Me & Pooneil\", \"[[Crown of Creation]]\", and \"[[Volunteers (song)|Volunteers]]\" all made the lower reaches of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\" and \"[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]\" were the band's only [[Top 40]] hits, reaching #5 and #8 respectively. To ensure a full picture of the group's musical interests, and possibly to ensure solidarity in the publishing income, the band included instrumentals by Dryden and Kaukonen, a [[country blues]]/[[gospel music|gospel]] cover arranged by Kaukonen, and Balin's straightforward ballad \"Today\".\n\nThis would be the final album featuring what is considered the \"classic\" line-up of the band, after Slick and Dryden joined, and before Balin and Dryden left. Original copies of the LP contained an inner sleeve that was a reproduction of a 1918 vintage [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] sleeve and the record featured  late 1920s vintage Victor labels. The interior of the [[gatefold|gatefold cover]] featured a large color reproduction of the painting \"[[His Master's Voice]]\", the famous RCA Victor trademark. Later reissues of the album were housed in a regular, non-gatefold cover and did not include the reproduction of painting and the 1918 inner sleeve, but the LP still bore the vintage Victor record labels.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Reissues==\nOn July 29, 1997, RCA reissued a [[remaster]]ed version of ''Worst'' on [[compact disc]].

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2006;103: 13271\u20135</ref> According to the Canadian Medical Association, it is crucial to both outlaw sex selection and fix the primary issue of son preference. Many laws already forbid fetal sex determination throughout countries in Asia, including China, but still continues to be a problem. Establishing responsibility to those performing illegal acts such as abortion is one step closer to ensuring a healthy, family oriented society. Holding doctors, clinics and establishments accountable by law is believed to make astounding differences in the sex preference.<ref>All-China Women's Federation Laws and regulations.

It is primarily important to spread public awareness though campaigns, media, and posters including advantages of females. The results of many campaigns such as the \"Care for Girls\" campaign on China, by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, encourages female births and requests participation from many neighboring countries. In one of the participating counties in Shanxi providence, the sex ratio birth was reduced from 135 in the year 2003 to 117 just three years later.<ref>Li SZ, Yan SH.

The Chinese government is essential in improving their gender and social rights. In 1992, the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women ensured women equal rights among politics, culture, education, work property rights and even marriage. Evidence shows that a country who supports higher status of women leads to a less traditional view of gender and lowers the level of son preference.

Many laws already forbid fetal sex determination throughout countries in Asia, including China, but still continues to be a problem. Establishing responsibility to those performing illegal acts such as abortion is one step closer to ensuring a healthy, family oriented society. Holding doctors, clinics and establishments accountable by law is believed to make astounding differences in the sex preference.<ref>All-China Women's Federation Laws and regulations.

It is primarily important to spread public awareness though campaigns, media, and posters including advantages of females. The results of many campaigns such as the \"Care for Girls\" campaign on China, by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, encourages female births and requests participation from many neighboring countries. In one of the participating counties in Shanxi providence, the sex ratio birth was reduced from 135 in the year 2003 to 117 just three years later.<ref>Li SZ, Yan SH.

The Chinese government is essential in improving their gender and social rights. In 1992, the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women ensured women equal rights among politics, culture, education, work property rights and even marriage. Evidence shows that a country who supports higher status of women leads to a less traditional view of gender and lowers the level of son preference. All these socioeconomic improvements have led to a steer away from traditional views of women to a more modern approach, working to end the gender gap in entirety.\n\n=== Change in attitudes ===\nAlthough China's sex ratio at birth is still one of the highest in the world, growing evidence has shown that son preference in China is declining.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  In recent interviews, many young Chinese adults expressed the view that they do not care about the gender of their future child, even though son preference was common in their parents' generation.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  A recent study showed that among the 66% claiming to be gender indifferent, 13% (10% urban 16% rural) prefer a boy, and 21% (22% urban and 18% rural) want a girl.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" /> Hesketh points out that with the consideration of advantages of raising girls, including that they are easier to care for, easier to find a spouse for, and take good care of aging parents, gender indifference and girl preference increase in comparison with previous son preference.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abortion in China]]\n* [[Female infanticide in China]]\n* [[Feminism in China]]\n* [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio]]\n* [[One-child policy]]\n* [[Prostitution in China]]\n* [[Rural society in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Sex trafficking in China]]\n* [[Urban society in the People's Republic of China]] \n* [[Women's healthcare in the People's Republic of China]]\n\n===General===\n* [[Sex-selective abortion]]\n* [[Women in China]]\n* [[Missing women of Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in China]]\n[[Category:Sex selection in China]]\n", "name_user": "Vli66", "label": "safe", "comment": "changed the order of citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_women_of_China"}

Rather than re-nominate Vice President [[Hannibal Hamlin]], the convention selected [[Andrew Johnson]] of Tennessee, a War Democrat, as Lincoln's running mate. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] ran as the nominee of the [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]], which criticized Lincoln for being too moderate on the issue of racial equality, but Fr\u00e9mont withdrew from the race in September. The Democrats were divided between the [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]], who favored immediate peace with the [[Confederated States of America |Confederacy]], and War Democrats, who wished to continue the war. The [[1864 Democratic National Convention]] nominated McClellan, a War Democrat, but adopted a platform advocating peace with the Confederacy, which McClellan rejected.\n\nDespite his early fears of defeat, Lincoln won strong majorities in the popular and electoral vote, partly as a result of the recent Union victory at the [[Battle of Atlanta]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=William C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2Vi9B5e2XYC&pg=PA211|title=Lincoln's Men: How President Lincoln became Father to an Army and a Nation|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1999|isbn=0-684-83337-9|location=|page=211|authorlink=William C.

But on the day before the organization of that body, Horatio Seymour announced positively that he would not be a candidate.\n\nSince the Democrats were divided by issues of war and peace, they sought a strong candidate who could unify the party. The compromise was to nominate pro-war General George B. McClellan for president and anti-war Representative [[George H. Pendleton]] for vice-president.

In addition, the war was continuing to take a very high toll in terms of casualties with campaigns such as [[Overland Campaign|Grant's Overland Campaign]] and the perceived lack of progress. The prospect of a long and bloody war started to make the idea of \"peace at all cost\" offered by the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] look more desirable. Because of this, McClellan was thought to be a heavy favorite to win the election. Unfortunately for Lincoln, Fr\u00e9mont's campaign got off to a good start.\n\nHowever, several political and military events eventually made Lincoln's re-election inevitable. In the first place, the Democrats had to confront the severe internal strains within their party at the [[1864 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. The political compromises made at the Democratic National Convention were contradictory and made McClellan's efforts to campaign seem inconsistent.\n\nSecondly, the Democratic National Convention influenced Fr\u00e9mont's campaign. Fr\u00e9mont was appalled at the Democratic platform, which he described as \"union with slavery\". After three weeks of discussions with Cochrane and his supporters, Fr\u00e9mont withdrew from the race in September 1864. In his statement, Fr\u00e9mont declared that winning the Civil War was too important to divide the Republican vote. Although he still felt that Lincoln was not going far enough, the defeat of McClellan was of the greatest necessity. General Cochrane, who was a War Democrat, agreed and withdrew with Fr\u00e9mont. On September 23, 1864 Fr\u00e9mont also brokered a political deal in which Lincoln removed U.S. Postmaster General [[Montgomery Blair]] from office, and on September 24 Abraham Lincoln relieved Blair of his duty as Postmaster General. McClellan's chances of victory faded after Fr\u00e9mont withdrew from the presidential race.\n\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1864Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|upright=2|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of red are for Lincoln (National Union) and shades of blue are for McClellan (Democratic).]]\nLastly, with the fall of [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta]] on September 2, there was no longer any question that a Union military victory was inevitable and close at hand.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Robert E.|title=Lincoln, the Fall of Atlanta, and the 1864 Presidential Election|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2016|volume=100|issue=3|page=260|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=119493972&site=eds-live&scope=site|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the end, the Union Party mobilized the full strength of both the Republicans and the War Democrats under the slogan \"Don't change horses in the middle of a stream\". It was energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

Both states had voted for Lincoln, so it would not have changed the result in any case. \n\nThree new states participated for the first time: Kansas, West Virginia, and Nevada. \n\nDespite Kentucky's state government never seceding from the Union, the Commonwealth had an election participation rate decrease of almost 40% compared to the election of 1860.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=1864&fips=21&f=0&off=0&elect=0&type=state|title=Presidential General Election Results Comparison - Kentucky|last=|first=|date=|website=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918213956/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=1864&fips=21&f=0&off=0&elect=0&type=state|archive-date=18 September 2006|accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nMcClellan won just three states: Kentucky, Delaware, and his home state of New Jersey. Lincoln won in every state he carried in 1860 except New Jersey, and also carried a state won four years earlier by [[Stephen Douglas]] (Missouri), one carried by [[John C. Breckinridge]] (Maryland) and all three newly admitted states (Kansas, Nevada and West Virginia). Altogether, 212 electoral votes were counted in Congress for Lincoln \u2013 more than enough to win the presidency even if all of the states in rebellion had participated and voted against him.\n\nLincoln was highly popular with soldiers and they in turn recommended him to their families back home.<ref>[[Phillip Shaw Paludan]], ''The Presidency of Abraham Lincoln'' (University Press of Kansas, 1994) pp. 274\u201393</ref><ref>Oscar O.

Out of the 40,247 army votes cast, Lincoln received 30,503 (75.8%) and McClellan 9,201 (22.9%), with the rest (543 votes) scattering (1.3%). Only soldiers from Kentucky gave McClellan a majority of their votes, and he carried the army vote in the state by a vote of 2,823 (70.3%) to 1,194 (29.7%).<ref>Presidential Ballots: 1836\u20131892, W. Dean Burnham, pp. 260\u201383</ref>\n\nOf the 1,129 counties making returns, Lincoln won in 728 (64.5%), while McClellan carried 400 (35.4%). One county (0.1%) in Iowa split evenly between Lincoln and McClellan.\n\nThis was the last election the Republicans won in Maryland until 1896.<ref>Counting the Votes; [http://www.countingthevotes.com/maryland Maryland]</ref>\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a)</sup>|ev_footnote=<sup>(a), (b), (c)</sup>}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Abraham Lincoln]] (Incumbent)|vp_name=[[Andrew Johnson]]|party=[[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]]|state=[[Illinois]]|vp_state=[[Tennessee]]|pv=2,218,388|pv_pct=55.03%|ev=212<sup>(b)</sup>}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[George B.

McClellan]], by a wide margin of 212\u201321 in the electoral college, with 55% of the popular vote. For the election, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and some Democrats created the National Union Party, especially to attract [[War Democrat]]s.\n\nDespite some intra-party opposition from [[Salmon Chase]] and the [[Radical Republicans]], Lincoln won his party's nomination at the [[1864 National Union National Convention]]. Rather than re-nominate Vice President [[Hannibal Hamlin]], the convention selected [[Andrew Johnson]] of Tennessee, a War Democrat, as Lincoln's running mate. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] ran as the nominee of the [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]], which criticized Lincoln for being too moderate on the issue of racial equality, but Fr\u00e9mont withdrew from the race in September. The Democrats were divided between the [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]], who favored immediate peace with the [[Confederated States of America |Confederacy]], and War Democrats, who wished to continue the war. The [[1864 Democratic National Convention]] nominated McClellan, a War Democrat, but adopted a platform advocating peace with the Confederacy, which McClellan rejected.\n\nDespite his early fears of defeat, Lincoln won strong majorities in the popular and electoral vote, partly as a result of the recent Union victory at the [[Battle of Atlanta]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=William C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2Vi9B5e2XYC&pg=PA211|title=Lincoln's Men: How President Lincoln became Father to an Army and a Nation|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1999|isbn=0-684-83337-9|location=|page=211|authorlink=William C.

Four additional Union states allowed \"proxy\" absentee voting. \"By margins of three to one or better, the soldiers lined up behind Lincoln.\" In every state, those returning home influenced their friends and family.

Initially, not all northern Republicans supported such measures.\n\nDemocratic leaders hoped that the radical Republicans would put forth their own ticket in the election. The ''[[New York World]]'', particularly interested in undermining the National Union Party, ran a series of articles predicting a delay for the National Union Convention until late in 1864 to allow Fr\u00e9mont time to collect delegates to win the nomination. Fr\u00e9mont supporters in New York City established a newspaper called the ''New Nation'', which declared in one of its initial issues that the National Union Convention would be a \"nonentity\".\n\n====National Union Party====\n[[File:Republican presidential ticket 1864b.jpg|thumb|250px|Lincoln and Johnson campaign poster]]\nBefore the election, some War Democrats joined the Republicans to form the National Union Party.<ref name=\"World Book\">[[World Book]]</ref> With the outcome of the Civil War still in doubt, some political leaders, including [[Salmon P.

Moderate Peace Democrats who supported the war against the Confederacy, such as [[Horatio Seymour]], were preaching the wisdom of a negotiated peace. After the Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863, moderate Peace Democrats proposed a negotiated peace that would secure Union victory. They believed this was the best course of action, because an armistice could finish the war without devastating the South.<ref>[[They Also Ran]]</ref> Radical Peace Democrats known as [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]], such as [[Thomas H.

McClellan]] vied for the presidential nomination. Additionally, friends of Horatio Seymour insisted on placing his name before the convention, which was held in [[Chicago]], Illinois, on August 29\u201331, 1864. But on the day before the organization of that body, Horatio Seymour announced positively that he would not be a candidate.\n\nSince the Democrats were divided by issues of war and peace, they sought a strong candidate who could unify the party. The compromise was to nominate pro-war General George B. McClellan for president and anti-war Representative [[George H. Pendleton]] for vice-president. McClellan, a War Democrat, was nominated over the Copperhead Thomas H. Seymour. Pendleton, a close associate of the Copperhead [[Clement Vallandigham]], balanced the ticket, since he was known for having strongly opposed the Union war effort.<ref>[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=299 George Pendleton].

Confederate forces had triumphed at the [[Battle of Mansfield]], the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], the [[Battle of Brice's Cross Roads]], the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]] and the [[Battle of the Crater]]. In addition, the war was continuing to take a very high toll in terms of casualties with campaigns such as [[Overland Campaign|Grant's Overland Campaign]] and the perceived lack of progress. The prospect of a long and bloody war started to make the idea of \"peace at all cost\" offered by the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] look more desirable. Because of this, McClellan was thought to be a heavy favorite to win the election. Unfortunately for Lincoln, Fr\u00e9mont's campaign got off to a good start.\n\nHowever, several political and military events eventually made Lincoln's re-election inevitable. In the first place, the Democrats had to confront the severe internal strains within their party at the [[1864 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. The political compromises made at the Democratic National Convention were contradictory and made McClellan's efforts to campaign seem inconsistent.\n\nSecondly, the Democratic National Convention influenced Fr\u00e9mont's campaign. Fr\u00e9mont was appalled at the Democratic platform, which he described as \"union with slavery\". After three weeks of discussions with Cochrane and his supporters, Fr\u00e9mont withdrew from the race in September 1864. In his statement, Fr\u00e9mont declared that winning the Civil War was too important to divide the Republican vote. Although he still felt that Lincoln was not going far enough, the defeat of McClellan was of the greatest necessity. General Cochrane, who was a War Democrat, agreed and withdrew with Fr\u00e9mont. On September 23, 1864 Fr\u00e9mont also brokered a political deal in which Lincoln removed U.S. Postmaster General [[Montgomery Blair]] from office, and on September 24 Abraham Lincoln relieved Blair of his duty as Postmaster General. McClellan's chances of victory faded after Fr\u00e9mont withdrew from the presidential race.\n\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1864Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|upright=2|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county.

It was energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

Lincoln won in every state he carried in 1860 except New Jersey, and also carried a state won four years earlier by [[Stephen Douglas]] (Missouri), one carried by [[John C. Breckinridge]] (Maryland) and all three newly admitted states (Kansas, Nevada and West Virginia). Altogether, 212 electoral votes were counted in Congress for Lincoln \u2013 more than enough to win the presidency even if all of the states in rebellion had participated and voted against him.\n\nLincoln was highly popular with soldiers and they in turn recommended him to their families back home.<ref>[[Phillip Shaw Paludan]], ''The Presidency of Abraham Lincoln'' (University Press of Kansas, 1994) pp. 274\u201393</ref><ref>Oscar O.

Out of the 40,247 army votes cast, Lincoln received 30,503 (75.8%) and McClellan 9,201 (22.9%), with the rest (543 votes) scattering (1.3%). Only soldiers from Kentucky gave McClellan a majority of their votes, and he carried the army vote in the state by a vote of 2,823 (70.3%) to 1,194 (29.7%).<ref>Presidential Ballots: 1836\u20131892, W.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile. The title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The next month, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.1/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Fiona Apple]]. It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile. The title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The next month, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.1/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

{"title_page": "Handshaking lemma", "text_new": "[[File:6n-graf.svg|thumb|250px|In this graph, an even number of vertices (the four vertices numbered 2, 4, 5, and 6) have odd degrees. The sum of the degrees of the vertices is 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;14, twice the number of edges.]]\nIn [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''handshaking lemma''' is the statement that every finite [[undirected graph]] has an even number of vertices with odd [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] (the number of edges touching the vertex). In more colloquial terms, in a party of people some of whom shake hands, an even number of people must have shaken an odd number of other people's hands.\n\nThe handshaking lemma is a consequence of the '''degree sum formula''' (also sometimes called the '''handshaking lemma'''),\n:<math>\\sum_{v\\in V} \\deg v = 2|E|</math>\nfor a graph with [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex set]] ''V'' and [[edge (graph theory)|edge set]] ''E''. Both results were proven by {{harvs|first=Leonhard|last=Euler|authorlink=Leonhard Euler|year=1736|txt}} in his famous paper on the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]] that began the study of graph theory.\n\nThe vertices of odd degree in a graph are sometimes called '''odd nodes''' or '''odd vertices'''; in this terminology, the handshaking lemma can be restated as the statement that every graph has an even number of odd nodes.\n\n==Proof==\nEuler's proof of\n degree sum formula uses the technique of [[Double counting (proof technique)|double counting]]: he counts the number of =incident pairs (''v'',''e'') where ''e'' is an edge and vertex ''v'' is one of its endpoints, in two different ways. Vertex ''v'' belongs to deg(''v'') pairs, where deg(''v'') (the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of ''v'') is the number of edges incident to it. Therefore, the number of incident pairs is the sum of the degrees. However, each edge in the graph belongs to exactly two incident pairs, one for each of its endpoints; therefore, the number of incident pairs is 2|''E''|. Since these two formulas count the same set of objects, they must have equal values.\n\nIn a sum of integers, the [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] of the sum is not affected by the even terms in the sum; the overall sum is even when there is an even number of odd terms, and odd when there is an odd number of odd terms. Since one side of the degree sum formula is the even number 2|''E''|, the sum on the other side must have an even number of odd terms; that is, there must be an even number of odd-degree vertices.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to use [[mathematical induction]] to prove that the number of odd-degree vertices is even, by removing one edge at a time from a given graph and using a [[Proof by cases|case analysis]] on the degrees of its endpoints to determine the effect of this removal on the parity of the number of odd-degree vertices.\n\n==Regular graphs==\nThe degree sum formula implies that every ''r''-[[regular graph]] with ''n'' vertices has ''nr''/2 edges.<ref>{{citation | title = Graphs and Applications: an Introductory Approach | series = Undergraduate Mathematics Series, The Open University | first1 = Joan M. | last1 = Aldous | first2 = Robin J. | last2 = Wilson | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1-85233-259-4 | page = [https://archive.org/details/graphsapplicatio0000aldo/page/44 44] | chapter = Theorem 2.2 | url = https://archive.org/details/graphsapplicatio0000aldo/page/44 }}</ref> In particular, if ''r'' is odd then the number of edges must be divisible by ''r''.\n\n==Infinite graphs==\n[[File:Infinite graph one direction.svg|thumb|150px|An infinite graph that does not obey the handshaking lemma]]\nThe handshaking lemma does not apply to infinite graphs, even when they have only a finite number of odd-degree vertices. For instance, an infinite [[path graph]] with one endpoint has only a single odd-degree vertex rather than having an even number of such vertices.\n\n==Exchange graphs==\nSeveral combinatorial structures listed by {{harvtxt|Cameron|Edmonds|1999}} may be shown to be even in number by relating them to the odd vertices in an appropriate \"exchange graph\".\n\nFor instance, as [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C. A. B. Smith]] proved, in any [[cubic graph]] ''G'' there must be an even number of [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s through any fixed edge ''uv''; {{harvtxt|Thomason|1978}} used a proof based on the handshaking lemma to extend this result to graphs ''G'' in which all vertices have odd degree. Thomason defines an exchange graph ''H'', the vertices of which are in one-to-one correspondence with the Hamiltonian paths beginning at ''u'' and continuing through ''v''. Two such paths ''p''<sub>1</sub> and ''p''<sub>2</sub> are connected by an edge in ''H'' if one may obtain ''p''<sub>2</sub> by adding a new edge to the end of ''p''<sub>1</sub> and removing another edge from the middle of ''p''<sub>1</sub>; this is a [[symmetric relation]], so ''H'' is an undirected graph. If path ''p'' ends at vertex ''w'', then the vertex corresponding to ''p'' in ''H'' has degree equal to the number of ways that ''p'' may be extended by an edge that does not connect back to ''u''; that is, the degree of this vertex in ''H'' is either deg(''w'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 (an even number) if ''p'' does not form part of a Hamiltonian cycle through ''uv'', or deg(''w'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2 (an odd number) if ''p'' is part of a Hamiltonian cycle through ''uv''. Since ''H'' has an even number of odd vertices, ''G'' must have an even number of Hamiltonian cycles through ''uv''.\n\n==Computational complexity==\nIn connection with the exchange graph method for proving the existence of combinatorial structures, it is of interest to ask how efficiently these structures may be found. For instance, suppose one is given as input a Hamiltonian cycle in a cubic graph; it follows from Smith's theorem that there exists a second cycle. How quickly can this second cycle be found?\n{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}} investigated the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of questions such as this, or more generally of finding a second odd-degree vertex when one is given a single odd vertex in a large [[implicitly-defined graph]]. He defined the [[complexity class]] [[PPA (complexity)|PPA]] to encapsulate problems such as this one; a closely related class defined on directed graphs, [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD]], has attracted significant attention in [[algorithmic game theory]] because computing a [[Nash equilibrium]] is computationally equivalent to the hardest problems in this class.<ref>{{citation|first1=Xi|last1=Chen|first2=Xiaotie|last2=Deng|contribution=Settling the complexity of two-player Nash equilibrium|title=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|Proc. 47th Symp.

How quickly can this second cycle be found?\n{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}} investigated the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of questions such as this, or more generally of finding a second odd-degree vertex when one is given a single odd vertex in a large [[implicitly-defined graph]]. He defined the [[complexity class]] [[PPA (complexity)|PPA]] to encapsulate problems such as this one; a closely related class defined on directed graphs, [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD]], has attracted significant attention in [[algorithmic game theory]] because computing a [[Nash equilibrium]] is computationally equivalent to the hardest problems in this class.<ref>{{citation|first1=Xi|last1=Chen|first2=Xiaotie|last2=Deng|contribution=Settling the complexity of two-player Nash equilibrium|title=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|Proc. 47th Symp.
