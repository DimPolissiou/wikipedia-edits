In New York, a federal agent named Irving Greenfield is conferring with the governor of Georgia about problems in the fictional county of Dunston, which has been taken over by a corrupt racketeer named Bama McCall. Knowing that Gator is an old friend of McCall's, Greenfield proposes coercing him into working with the agents to gather tax-evasion evidence against McCall. To persuade the governor, Greenfield reminds him that an election is coming up, and having \"cleaned up\" Dunston County would look good on his political resume. The governor is convinced and gives Greenfield \"whatever he needs.\"\n\nIn the [[Okefenokee]], Greenfield, accompanied by the local sheriff and other agents in boats and a helicopter, attempt to pick Gator up but wind up being led on a high speed chase through the swamp during which most of their vehicles are destroyed. Finally, Gator is cornered and, under threat of prison for himself and a foster home for his daughter, agrees to cooperate with the agents.\n\nGator and Greenfield travel to Dunston County, whereupon Gator meets up with McCall at a political rally and is immediately given a job as a bag man, or \"collector\" in McCall's protection racket. He also takes notice of an attractive TV newscaster named Aggie Maybank, who is trying to gain notoriety and has a sense that \"something is up\" in the county, and a semi-crazy \"cat lady\" named Emmeline Cavanaugh, who is protesting local politics. After treating Gator to a taste of the high life and a fancy dinner, McCall discreetly calls a police officer and asks him to check on Gator to find out what, if anything, he is up to.\n\nLater, Gator witnesses firsthand McCall's racket operation, which consists of business owners being forced to either pay monthly protection fees, or run the risk of being beaten, killed, or having their businesses destroyed. Local police and fire officials, also \"on the take,\" offer no help for the victims of his methods. Gator feels compassion for the businesspeople and doesn't agree with McCall's strong-arm tactics. He also discovers that McCall and his friends are using drugs to seduce underage girls in a local brothel. Eventually, McCall receives a phone call back from the cop who was checking up on Gator.\n\nGator then meets with McCall, tells him he doesn't like what he's seen and that he \"wants out.\" McCall, apparently hoping to get his old friend out of town without trouble, responds by giving Gator a drink laced with a sedative and telling him he will wake up in his car, which will be at the county line pointed toward home. Gator passes out and wakes up in his car, but instead of leaving, he determines to make sure McCall is brought to justice.\nGreenfield, meanwhile, is also trying to fit into the local community by hanging out in a local bar and trying to make conversation, but his New York ways make him obvious as an outsider. The corrupt police officer, having found out that Gator and Greenfield are working against McCall, passes the word along to McCall's henchmen, who attack and beat Greenfield as he leaves the bar, landing him in the hospital.\n\nStill determined to get a story, Aggie Maybank finds out that Greenfield is in the hospital and, attempting to visit him, runs into Gator in the hallway. She tries to interview him about what she's heard, but he refuses to talk to her even though he is clearly attracted to her.\n\nGator meets up with Aggie Maybank, who informs him that Emmeline Cavanaugh, the \"cat lady,\" had recently been fired from a job at the courthouse. They meet Emmeline, who readily agrees to help out because she \"detests dishonesty.\" She informs them that there are tax records, which would prove the corruption of not only McCall, but the mayor as well. Under cover of darkness, the three sneak into the courthouse (using Emmeline's stolen keys, and with her two cats in tow) and into a basement room where they start gathering evidence. A security guard hears the noises and triggers an alarm, which results in police descending upon the building. They manage to escape with the records, and get away in a patrol car which was inadvertently left with the keys inside. After picking up Greenfield at the hospital, they make their way to a beach house belonging to relatives of Aggie's.\n\nThe foursome spends most of the night going over the records. Eventually Gator and Aggie slip out for a romantic interlude on the beach. When they return, Greenfield sends them off to find a phone with which to call his boss and get more help into town. Within moments, Bama McCall, who has been informed by the police about the stolen records and has surmised where the group might be hiding, arrives at the beach house. He kills Greenfield with a sawed-off shotgun and sets the house (and all the tax records) on fire. McCall's henchman attempts to haul Emmeline out of the house, but she escapes and runs back inside to rescue one of her cats, and also dies in the fire.\n\nUpon returning and seeing the burning house, Gator and Aggie make their way to a motel on the outskirts of town, where Gator calls McCall on the phone and, after telling him that \"not all\" of the records were destroyed in the fire, demands $2000 and a plane ticket home in exchange for the records. He tells him where he is, and to bring the money and ticket to him and \"Don't bring that nasty ol' gun.\" McCall agrees to the deal. Gator, anticipating that McCall is not going to honor the deal, booby-traps the motel room, and waits outside in hiding. McCall arrives with one of his henchmen, and sends him to the motel room to kill Gator, but the henchman dies in the resulting explosion. Gator then confronts Bama, now defenseless. A wild chase around the motel parking lot ensues, eventually leading to a lengthy fistfight on the beach, during which Gator finally subdues Bama (apparently breaking his neck).\n\nLater, Aggie's story about the events has aired on the \"CBS Evening News\" and Gator arrives at Aggie's home to find her in a celebratory mood. She tells him that due to the recognition she received for her reporting about the Dunston County events, she's been offered an interview with a news organization in New York. Gator tells her he loves her, but they both realize that their vastly different lifestyles would make it impossible for them to be together for the long term; they reluctantly decide to go their separate ways.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Gator McKlusky\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Irving Greenfield\n* [[Lauren Hutton]] as Aggie Maybank\n* [[Jerry Reed]] as Bama McCall\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Emmeline Cavanaugh\n* [[Dub Taylor]] as Mayor Caffrey\n* [[Mike Douglas]] as The Governor\n* [[Burton Gilliam]] as Smiley\n* [[William Engesser]] as Bones\n* [[John Steadman (actor)|John Steadman]] as Ned McKlusky\n* Lori Futch as Suzie McKlusky\n* Stephanie Burchfield as Young Girl\n* Dudley Remus as Deputy Pogie, Dunston PD\n* [[Alex Hawkins]] as Police Chief\n* [[Don Ferguson (actor)|Don Ferguson]] as Bartender\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Sheriff J.C.

In December 1947 the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] under [[Josef Stalin]], decreed that ''May 9th (Victory Day)'' would become a working day, effectively making the celebrations cancelled and ceased completely. Stalin was also not eager to see the maimed Red Army soldiers who fought victoriously during the war, parade on [[Red Square]], as he had no need for heroes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Stalin had many of the veterans removed from the city limits, and the removal of the holiday helped build his image of being the great commander and hero of the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|war]], effectively broadening his [[Cult of Personality]] during his reign of power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nHowever, on April 26, 1965, nearly twenty years after the [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945|first parade]], under [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] reversed the actions made in 1947, thus making May 9 a non-working holiday, this would be the first time Victory Day was made as an actual holiday. On May 9, 1965 the [[1965 Moscow Victory Day Parade|second Victory Day parade]] took place in Moscow, this Victory Day celebration also saw veterans obtain the first [[Jubilee Medal \"Twenty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941\u20131945\"|jubilee medal]] for \"''Twenty Years of Victory''\" in honor of the 20th anniversary since the Allied victory in Europe against Nazi Germany.<ref>https://sputniknews.com/russia/201605091039305682-russia-vicrtory-celebration-parade/ Archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20180317185211/https://sputniknews.com/russia/201605091039305682-russia-vicrtory-celebration-parade/</ref> Further parades would be held in [[1985 Moscow Victory Day Parade|1985]] and [[1990 Moscow Victory Day Parade|1990]].\n\n===Russian Federation {{flagicon|RUS}}===\n{{Further|Moscow Victory Day Parade}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 311498 Military parade dedicated to the 63rd anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in the 1941-1945 Great Patriotic War.jpg|thumb|Victory Day Parade in Moscow 2008]]\nToday, [[Russia]], as the largest of the countries of the former Soviet Union, continues the practice of parades held in honor of the victory won in the [[Great Patriotic War]] - the Eastern Front of the Second World War as called by the Soviet Union. The first of these parades was held in 1995 (5 years after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]) under the auspices of President [[Boris Yeltsin]], who held the parade to commemorate the [[golden jubilee]] of the Soviet and allied victory in the war.<ref>http://tass.ru/obschestvo/1171423</ref> The parade was the only one to date that had to be divided into two parts (a full military parade on [[Poklonnaya Hill]] and a veterans ceremony on [[Red Square]]).\n\n===Ukraine {{flagicon|UKR}}===\n[[File:Victory day Kiev 2.jpg|thumb|Victory Day Parade in Kiev in 2010.]]\n[[Ukraine]], as the second-largest former [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet republic]] in terms of population, suffered massive casualties during the war. Ukrainians were the largest minority ethnic group of the USSR, and had seen the full force of the Nazi invasion that struck a huge blow to the Ukrainian population. An estimated 1,377,400 Ukrainian servicemen and women of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and personnel from paramilitary partisan formations lost their lives fighting against [[Wehrmacht]] troops during the war together with forces from fellow Axis nations and the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (which from late 1941 onwards had also fought against the Axis Powers' armed forces and paramilitaries) which they fought against bravely at a cost of millions of lives lost nationwide. Although Victory Day as a holiday has been altered completely and renamed as a completely different national holiday following the events of the 2013-14 [[Euromaidan]] (as [[Victory Day over Nazism in World War II]]), many Ukrainians still honor their forefathers in the traditional Victory Day style.{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} Only in the separatist-controlled regions of [[Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk]], since 2015, do the people completely celebrate the traditional Victory Day parades with military vehicles and soldiers marching past the main squares of the two cities, which are also televised events within their areas.\n\n'''Parades:'''\n*1995 Kiev Victory Day Parade\n*[[2010 Kiev Victory Day Parade]]\n*2011 Kiev Victory Day Parade\n*2013 Kiev Victory Day Parade<ref>http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1463653-1-87</ref>\n\n===Republic of Belarus {{flagicon|BLR}}===\nVictory parades in [[Belarus]] have dated back to Soviet parades in the former [[Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The traditions and customs of Victory Day are the same as in Russia, with marches of Immortal Regiments held in cities with large populations of Red Army veterans and their descendants, particularly in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Haifa]].\n\n== Expanded summary of the parades within the CIS ==\nAs Victory Day is the principal military holiday of Russia and of almost all member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (except the Baltics and the Ukraine), the celebrations in [[Moscow]] and other capital cities thus serve as national events to mark such an important holiday for millions of people, marking the anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual or semiannual parades mark the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the victorious Allies in Berlin, at midnight of May 9, 1945 (Russian time), officially concluding the Second World War in Europe and northern parts of Africa.\n\n=== Red Square, Moscow ===\n{{Main|Moscow Victory Day Parade}}\n[[File:2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade 45.jpg|thumb|The [[2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]\nThe most important parade of those being held on May 9 is the one held on Moscow's [[Red Square]], with the [[President of Russia]] as the guest of honor and keynote speaker in virtue of his constitutional mandate as Supreme Commander of the [[Russian Armed Forces]].  On the morning of the day, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the Massed Bands of around 1,100 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia]] (an appointment bestowed to either a colonel or a general rank officer), together with more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment. Each of the contingents, since 1996, carry historical military colors of the 1942 (Red Army, Soviet Air Force, People's Militia) and 1932/1944 (Navy) patterns at the head of their formations honoring the millions of men and women who served in the ranks of the military and law enforcement services of the former Soviet Union during the long period of the Eastern Front of the Second World War, and the millions among them who were either killed or were missing in action.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest-serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nOnce the ground column ends, the bands stop playing and, to give way to the mobile column by marching towards the facade of the GUM department store.

The traditions and customs of Victory Day are the same as in Russia, with marches of Immortal Regiments held in cities with large populations of Red Army veterans and their descendants, particularly in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Haifa]].\n\n== Expanded summary of the parades within the CIS ==\nAs Victory Day is the principal military holiday of Russia and of almost all member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (except the Baltics and the Ukraine), the celebrations in [[Moscow]] and other capital cities thus serve as national events to mark such an important holiday for millions of people, marking the anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual or semiannual parades mark the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the victorious Allies in Berlin, at midnight of May 9, 1945 (Russian time), officially concluding the Second World War in Europe and northern parts of Africa.\n\n=== Red Square, Moscow ===\n{{Main|Moscow Victory Day Parade}}\n[[File:2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade 45.jpg|thumb|The [[2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]\nThe most important parade of those being held on May 9 is the one held on Moscow's [[Red Square]], with the [[President of Russia]] as the guest of honor and keynote speaker in virtue of his constitutional mandate as Supreme Commander of the [[Russian Armed Forces]].  On the morning of the day, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the Massed Bands of around 1,100 bandsmen under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia]] (an appointment bestowed to either a colonel or a general rank officer), together with more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment. Each of the contingents, since 1996, carry historical military colors of the 1942 (Red Army, Soviet Air Force, People's Militia) and 1932/1944 (Navy) patterns at the head of their formations honoring the millions of men and women who served in the ranks of the military and law enforcement services of the former Soviet Union during the long period of the Eastern Front of the Second World War, and the millions among them who were either killed or were missing in action.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest-serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nOnce the ground column ends, the bands stop playing and, to give way to the mobile column by marching towards the facade of the GUM department store. The mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years and only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner non-special anniversary years. Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the ''Aviamarch'' and other air marches. The flypast marks the formal end the parade.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Russian parades held outside Moscow ===\n[[File:Orchestra of the St. Petersburg Garrison.jpg|thumb|The massed bands of the St. Petersburg Garrison during the parade in 2016]]\n[[File:Den' pobedi Syria 02.jpg|thumb|A parade at the Khmeimim Air Base in 2018.]]\nAs per tradition, 27 other Russian major cities ([[Sevastopol]] and [[Kerch]] in the disputed [[Crimea]] included) are expected to hold commemorative parades on that day (some of them including flypasts and fleet reviews during jubilee years), and joint civil-military parades are hosted by 50 other towns and cities nationwide.

The [[President of Belarus]] then arrives at the grandstand in front of the [[Minsk Hero City Obelisk]] to await the start of the parade before 10:00 in the morning.\n\nThe parade commander gives the order to begin the review of the Minsk Garrison by the Defence Minister of Belarus, the parade presenting arms at that juncture and the massed bands of the Minsk Garrison under the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus]] beginning to play inspection music under the baton of the Senior Director of Music. Then as the limousines stop in front of the grandstand and the massed bands stop playing the Deputy Defense Minister of Belarus reports to the Defense Minister on the status of the parade. \n\nThe Defense Minister, having now been duly notified, then reviews the parading troops along the avenue in his vehicle, stopping a few times to send holiday greetings to a 4,000 strong ground column formation from the armed forces and other uniformed organizations while the massed bands play. As the defense minister concludes the inspection of the troops, he reports to the president on the readiness of the parade. A minute of silence then takes place, followed by a performance of the National Anthem of Belarus ([[My Belarusy]]) by the massed bands. The president then delivers an address to the nation and congratulates the citizens on the holiday. As the president concludes the address, following a fanfare by the bands the parade commander then gives the order for the Minsk Garrison to get into their parade formations, and for the troops of the Honour Guard Company to take their post as linemen to mark the distance of the troops marching past the grandstand.

In order for Russian nationals to compete at the World Athletics Championship (from 2017 on), they must be approved as authorised neutral athletes by the IAAF. Prior to 1993, Russian athletes competed for the [[Soviet Union at the World Championships in Athletics|Soviet Union]]. Russia has the second-highest medal total among nations at the competition (153), after the [[United States at the World Championships in Athletics|United States]]. At 47 [[gold medals]], it holds the third-highest total after the United States and [[Kenya at the World Championships in Athletics|Kenya]]. It has had the most success in women's events and in field events. As a major nation in the [[sport of athletics]], it typically sent a delegation numbering over 100 athletes.\n\nIt topped the medal table at the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics|2001 tournament]]. Russia also finished top of the medal table at the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics|2013 Moscow Championships]], but lost this position due to doping disqualifications of its athletes. Russia's performance at the competition has been strongly affected by doping. The country was banned from competing in 2017 due to systemic doping issues and Russians had to gain special dispensation to compete as [[Authorised Neutral Athletes]].<ref>[https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/russians-neutral-athletes-2017 IAAF approves the application of seven Russians to compete internationally as neutral athletes].

Women's [[pole vault]]er [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] has also won three gold medals, in addition to a bronze. [[Yuliya Pechonkina]], a [[400 metres hurdles]] and relay athlete, has won the most medals for Russia, with her total of seven.

In order for Russian nationals to compete at the World Athletics Championship (from 2017 on), they must be approved as authorised neutral athletes by the IAAF. Prior to 1993, Russian athletes competed for the [[Soviet Union at the World Championships in Athletics|Soviet Union]]. Russia has the second-highest medal total among nations at the competition (153), after the [[United States at the World Championships in Athletics|United States]]. At 47 [[gold medals]], it holds the third-highest total after the United States and [[Kenya at the World Championships in Athletics|Kenya]]. It has had the most success in women's events and in field events. As a major nation in the [[sport of athletics]], it typically sent a delegation numbering over 100 athletes.\n\nIt topped the medal table at the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics|2001 tournament]]. Russia also finished top of the medal table at the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics|2013 Moscow Championships]], but lost this position due to doping disqualifications of its athletes. Russia's performance at the competition has been strongly affected by doping. The country was banned from competing in 2017 due to systemic doping issues and Russians had to gain special dispensation to compete as [[Authorised Neutral Athletes]].<ref>[https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/russians-neutral-athletes-2017 IAAF approves the application of seven Russians to compete internationally as neutral athletes]. IAAF (11 April 2017). Retrieved 2018-03-15.</ref> Various members of the Russian delegation have been banned for doping at every edition of the competition it has competed at, with the exceptions of 2003 and 2015 (though Russian medalists in both those years were subsequently banned).\n\nRussia's most successful athlete at the competition is horizontal jumps specialist [[Tatyana Lebedeva]], who between 2001 and 2009 won two [[triple jump]] gold medals, a [[long jump]] title, and two further silver medals. Women's [[pole vault]]er [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] has also won three gold medals, in addition to a bronze. [[Yuliya Pechonkina]], a [[400 metres hurdles]] and relay athlete, has won the most medals for Russia, with her total of seven. The most successful Russian man at the World Championships is [[high jump]]er [[Yaroslav Rybakov]], who won three high jump silvers before becoming champion in 2009.\n\n== Medal table ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Championships\n! colspan=\"3\" | Men\n! colspan=\"3\" | Women\n! colspan=\"6\" | Total\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: gold;\" | Gold\n! style=\"background-color: silver;\" | Silver\n! style=\"background-color: #cc9966;\" | Bronze\n! style=\"background-color: gold;\" | Gold\n! style=\"background-color: silver;\" | Silver\n! style=\"background-color: #cc9966;\" | Bronze\n! style=\"background-color: gold;\" | Gold\n! style=\"background-color: silver;\" | Silver\n! style=\"background-color: #cc9966;\" | Bronze\n!

But these experiments do not test what people would do in situations that are forced or rushed, most mistakes are made from rushing and or forgetting something due to lack of concentration. Situationism can be looked at in many different ways, this means that situationism needs to be tested and experimented in many different ways.\n\n#\n\n==Experimental evidence==\n===Evidence for===\nMany studies have found evidence supporting situationism. One notable situationist study is [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]]'s [[Stanford prison experiment]]. This study was considered one of the most unethical because the participants were deceived and were physically and psychologically abused. The goal of the study was that Zimbardo wanted to discover two things. If prison guards abused prisoners because of their nature, or because of the power they were given in the situation. They also wanted to figure out of prisoners acted violent because of their nature or because of being in a secluded and violent environment. To carry out this experiment, Zimbardo gathered 24 college men and paid them 15 dollars an hour to live two weeks in a mock prison. The participants were told that they were chosen to be guard or prisoner because of their personality traits, but they were randomly selected. The prisoners were booked and given prison clothes and no possessions. They were also assigned a number to be referred to with the intent of farther dehumanizing them. Within the first night, the prisoner and guard dynamics began to take place. The guards started waking up the prisoners in the middle of the night for count, and they would yell and ridicule them. The prisoners also started developing hostile traits against the guards and having prison related conversations. By the second day, the guards started abusing the prisoners by forcing them to do push ups, and the prisoners started rebelling by removing their caps and numbers, and hiding in their cells with their mattresses blocking the door. As the days passed the relationship between the guards and prisoners became extremely hostile- the prisoners fought for their independence, and the guards fought to strip them of it.\n\nThere were many cases where the prisoners began breaking down psychologically, and it all started with prisoner 8612. After one day after the experiment started, prisoner number 8612 has anxiety attacks and asked to leave. He was then told \"You can't leave. You can't quit.\u201d He then went back to the prison and \u201cbegan to act \u2018crazy,\u2019 to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control.\u201d <ref name=\"simplypsychology.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|title=Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> After this, he was sent home. The other prisoner that broke down was 819. 819 Had broken down and was told to rest in a room. When Dr.Zimbardo when to check on him he said \" what I found was a boy crying hysterically while in the background his fellow prisoners were yelling and chanting that he was a bad prisoner, that they were being punished because of him.\" Zimbardo then allowed him to leave but he said he couldn't because he was labeled as a bad prisoner, to which Zimbardo Responded \"Listen, you are not 819. My name is Dr. Zimbardo, I am a psychologist, and this is not a prison. This is just an experiment and those are students, just like you. Let's go. \" He stopped crying suddenly and looked up at me just like a small child awakened from a nightmare and said, \"OK, let's go.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=August 1971|title=THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT|url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/spec_coll/uarch/exhibits/Narration.pdf|journal=A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe guards also began to have extremely abusive relations with the prisoners. Zimbardo claimed there were three types of guards. The first were the guards that followed all the rules but got the job done, the second felt bad for the prisoners, and the third were extremely hostile and treated them like animals. This last type showed behaviors of actual guards and seemed to have forgotten they were college students, they got into their roles faster, and seemed to enjoy tormenting the prisoners. On Thursday night, 6 days into the experiment, Zimbardo described the guards as having \"sadistic\" behavior, and then decided to close down the study early.\n\nThis study showed how regular people can completely disassociate with who they are when their environment changes. Regular college boys turned into broken down prisoners and sadistic guards.\n\nStudies investigating [[Bystander effect|bystander]] effects also support situationism. For example, in 1973, [[John M. Darley|Darley]] and [[Daniel Batson|Batson]] conducted a study where they asked students at a seminary school to give a presentation in a separate building. They gave each individual participant a topic, and would then tell a participant that they were supposed to be there immediately, or in a few minutes, and sent them on their way to the building. On the way, each participant encountered a confederate who was on the ground, clearly in need of medical attention. Darley and Batson observed that more participants who had extra time stopped to help the confederate than those who were in a hurry. Helping was not predicted by religious personality measures, and the results therefore indicate that the situation influenced their behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Darley |first1=J.

D. |year=1973 |title='From Jerusalem to Jericho': A study of situational and dispositional variables in helping behavior |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=100\u2013108 |doi=10.1037/h0034449}}</ref>\n\nA third well-known study supporting situationism is an [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] study, the [[Milgram experiment]]. Stanley Milgram made his obedience study to explain the obedience phenomenon, specifically the holocaust. He wanted to explain how people follow orders, and how people are likely to do unmoral things when ordered to by people of authority. The way the experiment was devised was that Milgram picked 40 men from a newspaper add to take part in a study at Yale University.<ref name=\"simplypsychology.org\"/> The men were between 20 and 50 years old, and were paid $4.50 for showing up. In this study, a participant was assigned to be a \"teacher\" and a confederate was assigned to be a \"learner\". The teachers were told the learners had to memorize word pairs, and every time they got it wrong they were shocked with increasing voltages. The voltages ranged from 15 to 450, and in order for the participants to believe the shock was real, the experimenters administered to them a real 45v shock, The participant was unaware that the learner was a confederate. The participant would test the learner, and for each incorrect answer the learner gave, the participant would have to shock the learner with increasing voltages. The shocks were not actually administered, but the participant believed they were. When the shocks reached 300v, the learner began to protest and show discomfort. [[Stanley Milgram|Milgram]] expected participants to stop the procedure, but 65% of them continued to completion, administering shocks that could have been fatal, even if they were uncomfortable or upset. Even though most of the participants continued administering the shocks, they had distressed reactions when administering the shocks, such as laughing hysterically. Participants felt compelled to listen to the experimenter, who was the authority figure present in the room and continued to encourage the participant throughout the study. Out of 40 participants, 26 went all the way to the end.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|date=1963|title=Behavioral Study of Obedience|url=https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/pdf/MilgramOriginalWork.pdf|journal=Behavioral Study of Obedience|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Evidence against===\nPersonality traits have a very weak relationship to behavior in contrast, situational factors usually have a stronger impact on behavior; Which is the core evidence of situationism. In addition, people are also able to describe character traits of close to such as friends and family, which goes to show that there are opposing reasons showing why people can recall these traits.\n\nIn addition, there are other studies that show these same trends, for example, twin studies have shown that identical twins share more traits than fraternal twins.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=Eric |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving I. |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas J. |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=1 August 2010 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217\u2013220 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmid=20625474 |pmc=2899491 }}</ref> This also implies that there is a genetic basis for behavior, which directly contradicts situationist views that behavior is determined by the situation. When observing one instance of extroverted or honest behavior, it shows how in different situations a person would behave in a similarly honest or extroverted way. It shows that when many people are observed in a range of situations the trait-related reactions to behavior is about .20 or less. People think the correlation is around .80. This shows that the situation itself is more dependent of characteristics and the circumstances in contrast to what is taking place at that point in time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mullen |first1=Edward J. |last2=Streiner |first2=David L. |title=The Evidence For and Against Evidence-Based Practice |journal=Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention |date=2004 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=111\u2013121 |doi=10.1093/brief-treatment/mhh009 }}</ref>\n\n==Current views: interactionism==\nIn addition to the debate between trait influences and situational influences on behavior, a psychological model of \"[[interactionism]]\" exists, which is a view that both internal dispositions and external situational factors impact a person's behavior in a given situation.<ref name=\"Endler_Magnusson\">{{cite journal |last1=Endler |first1=N.

But these experiments do not test what people would do in situations that are forced or rushed, most mistakes are made from rushing and or forgetting something due to lack of concentration. Situationism can be looked at in many different ways, this means that situationism needs to be tested and experimented in many different ways.\n\n#\n\n==Experimental evidence==\n===Evidence for===\nMany studies have found evidence supporting situationism. One notable situationist study is [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]]'s [[Stanford prison experiment]]. This study was considered one of the most unethical because the participants were deceived and were physically and psychologically abused. The goal of the study was that Zimbardo wanted to discover two things. If prison guards abused prisoners because of their nature, or because of the power they were given in the situation. They also wanted to figure out of prisoners acted violent because of their nature or because of being in a secluded and violent environment. To carry out this experiment, Zimbardo gathered 24 college men and payed them 15 dollars an hour to live two weeks in a mock prison. The participants were told that they were chosen to be guard or prisoner because of their personality traits, but they were randomly selected. The prisoners were booked and given prison clothes and no possessions. They were also assigned a number to be referred to with the intent of farther dehumanizing them. Within the first night, the prisoner and guard dynamics began to take place. The guards started waking up the prisoners in the middle of the night for count, and they would yell and ridicule them. The prisoners also started developing hostile traits against the guards and having prison related conversations. By the second day, the guards started abusing the prisoners by forcing them to do push ups, and the prisoners started rebelling by removing their caps and numbers, and hiding in their cells with their mattresses blocking the door. As the days passed the relationship between the guards and prisoners became extremely hostile- the prisoners fought for their independence, and the guards fought to strip them of it.\n\nThere were many cases where the prisoners began breaking down psychologically, and it all started with prisoner 8612. After one day after the experiment started, prisoner number 8612 has anxiety attacks and asked to leave. He was then told \"You can't leave. You can't quit.\u201d He then went back to the prison and \u201cbegan to act \u2018crazy,\u2019 to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|title=Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>After this, he was sent home. The other prisoner that broke down was 819. 819 Had broken down and was told to rest in a room. When Dr.Zimbardo when to check on him he said \" what I found was a boy crying hysterically while in the background his fellow prisoners were yelling and chanting that he was a bad prisoner, that they were being punished because of him.\" Zimbardo then allowed him to leave but he said he couldn't because he was labeled as a bad prisoner, to which Zimbardo Responded \"Listen, you are not 819. My name is Dr. Zimbardo, I am a psychologist, and this is not a prison. This is just an experiment and those are students, just like you. Let's go. \" He stopped crying suddenly and looked up at me just like a small child awakened from a nightmare and said, \"OK, let's go.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|date=August 1971|title=THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT|url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/spec_coll/uarch/exhibits/Narration.pdf|journal=A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe guards also began to have extremely abusive relations with the prisoners. Zimbardo claimed there were three types of guards. The first were the guards that followed all the rules but got the job done, the second felt bad for the prisoners, and the third were extremely hostile and treated them like animals. This last type showed behaviors of actual guards and seemed to have forgotten they were college students, they got into their roles faster, and seemed to enjoy tormenting the prisoners. On Thursday night, 6 days into the experiment, Zimbardo described the guards as having \"sadistic\" behavior, and then decided to close down the study early.\n\nThis study showed how regular people can completely disassociate with who they are when their environment changes. Regular college boys turned into broken down prisoners and sadistic guards.\n\nStudies investigating [[Bystander effect|bystander]] effects also support situationism. For example, in 1973, [[John M. Darley|Darley]] and [[Daniel Batson|Batson]] conducted a study where they asked students at a seminary school to give a presentation in a separate building. They gave each individual participant a topic, and would then tell a participant that they were supposed to be there immediately, or in a few minutes, and sent them on their way to the building. On the way, each participant encountered a confederate who was on the ground, clearly in need of medical attention. Darley and Batson observed that more participants who had extra time stopped to help the confederate than those who were in a hurry. Helping was not predicted by religious personality measures, and the results therefore indicate that the situation influenced their behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Darley |first1=J.

Stanley Milgram made his obedience study to explain the obedience phenomenon, specifically the holocaust. He wanted to explain how people follow orders, and how people are likely to do unmoral things when ordered to by people of authority. The way the experiment was devised was that Milgram picked 40 men from a newspaper add to take part in a study at Yale University<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|title=Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>. The men were between 20 and 50 years old, and were paid $4.50 for showing up. In this study, a participant was assigned to be a \"teacher\" and a confederate was assigned to be a \"learner\". The teachers were told the learners had to memorize word pairs, and every time they got it wrong they were shocked with increasing voltages. The voltages ranged from 15 to 450, and in order for the participants to believe the shock was real, the experimenters administered to them a real 45v shock, The participant was unaware that the learner was a confederate. The participant would test the learner, and for each incorrect answer the learner gave, the participant would have to shock the learner with increasing voltages. The shocks were not actually administered, but the participant believed they were. When the shocks reached 300v, the learner began to protest and show discomfort. [[Stanley Milgram|Milgram]] expected participants to stop the procedure, but 65% of them continued to completion, administering shocks that could have been fatal, even if they were uncomfortable or upset. Even though most of the participants continued administering the shocks, they had distressed reactions when administering the shocks, such as laughing hysterically. Participants felt compelled to listen to the experimenter, who was the authority figure present in the room and continued to encourage the participant throughout the study. Out of 40 participants, 26 went all the way to the end.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|date=1963|title=Behavioral Study of Obedience|url=https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/pdf/MilgramOriginalWork.pdf|journal=Behavioral Study of Obedience|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Evidence against===\nPersonality traits have a very weak relationship to behavior in contrast, situational factors usually have a stronger impact on behavior; Which is the core evidence of situationism. In addition, people are also able to describe character traits of close to such as friends and family, which goes to show that there are opposing reasons showing why people can recall these traits.\n\nIn addition, there are other studies that show these same trends, for example, twin studies have shown that identical twins share more traits than fraternal twins.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=Eric |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving I. |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas J. |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=1 August 2010 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217\u2013220 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmid=20625474 |pmc=2899491 }}</ref> This also implies that there is a genetic basis for behavior, which directly contradicts situationist views that behavior is determined by the situation. When observing one instance of extroverted or honest behavior, it shows how in different situations a person would behave in a similarly honest or extroverted way. It shows that when many people are observed in a range of situations the trait-related reactions to behavior is about .20 or less. People think the correlation is around .80. This shows that the situation itself is more dependent of characteristics and the circumstances in contrast to what is taking place at that point in time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mullen |first1=Edward J. |last2=Streiner |first2=David L. |title=The Evidence For and Against Evidence-Based Practice |journal=Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention |date=2004 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=111\u2013121 |doi=10.1093/brief-treatment/mhh009 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Current views: interactionism==\nIn addition to the debate between trait influences and situational influences on behavior, a psychological model of \"[[interactionism]]\" exists, which is a view that both internal dispositions and external situational factors impact a person's behavior in a given situation.<ref name=\"Endler_Magnusson\">{{cite journal |last1=Endler |first1=N.

[[market town]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]]. It is in the [[Thames Valley]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], and on both the [[Great Western Main Line]] railway and the [[M4 motorway]]. Reading is {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Bristol]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[Basingstoke]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south-west of [[Maidenhead]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].\n\nThe first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre.\n\nToday,{{when|date=August 2019}} Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills.<ref name=\"Good Growth for Cities 2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|title=Government & public sector|work=PwC}}</ref> Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the [[University of Reading]].

The absence of a flood plain on the Kennet in this [[defile (geography)|defile]] enabled the development of [[Wharf|wharves]].\n\nAs Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to the west between the two rivers into the foothills of the [[Berkshire Downs]] as far as [[Calcot, Berkshire|Calcot]], [[Tilehurst]] and [[Purley on Thames|Purley]]; to the south and south-east on the south side of the Kennet as far as [[Whitley Wood]], [[Lower Earley]] and [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]]; and to the north of the Thames into the [[Chiltern Hills]] as far as [[Caversham Heights]], [[Emmer Green]] and [[Caversham Park Village]]. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the [[M4 motorway|M4]] curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet flood plain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area.<ref name=oslr159>{{cite map | title = Map of Reading, Wokingham & Pangbourne | publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]] | isbn = 9780319237304 | date = 12 May 2011 | scale = 1:25000}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Oracle riverside flooded 8 (871242314).jpg|thumb|left|River Kennet during the [[2007 United Kingdom floods|2007 floods]] at the riverside level of [[The Oracle, Reading|The Oracle]]]]\nThe floodplains adjoining Reading's two rivers are subject to occasional flooding. However, in the [[2007 United Kingdom floods|2007 floods]] that affected much of the UK, no properties were affected by flooding from the Thames and only four properties were affected by flooding from the Kennet.<ref>{{cite web|title=2007 Floods photos|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/EmergencyPlanning/Flooding/2007-floods/|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=5 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521211047/http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/EmergencyPlanning/Flooding/2007-floods/|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=July 2007 Flooding|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/Documents/adviceandemergencies/Emergency-Planning/July_2007_flooding_report_Cabinet.pdf|publisher=Reading Borough Council|accessdate=13 June 2011|date=29 October 2007}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nDepending on the definition adopted, neither the town nor the urban area are necessarily coterminous with the borough. Historically, the town of Reading was smaller than the borough. Definitions include the old [[ecclesiastical parish]]es of the churches of [[Reading Minster|St Mary]], [[St Laurence's Church, Reading|St Laurence]] and [[St Giles' Church, Reading|St Giles]], or the even smaller pre-19th century borough.{{sfn|Dils|1998}} Today, as well as the town centre Reading comprises a number of suburbs and other districts, both within the borough itself and within the surrounding urban area. The names and location of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to civil parishes, there are no formally defined boundaries. The Reading town area, sometimes referred to as ''Greater Reading'', incorporates the town's eastern and western suburbs outside the borough, in the civil parishes of Earley, Woodley, Purley, Tilehurst and Shinfield.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> This area had a population of 230,046 in 2018, with ONS recognising this definition (the USD) as the town of Reading.<ref name=\"ReadingTown\"/> The Reading urban area (officially Reading/Wokingham) additionally includes [[Winnersh]], [[Wokingham]] and [[Crowthorne]].\n\nLike the rest of the United Kingdom, Reading has a [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with limited seasonal temperature ranges and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest official [[Met Office]] weather station is located at the Reading University Atmospheric Observatory on the [[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights Campus]], which has recorded atmospheric measurements and meteorological observations since 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading University Atmospheric

[[market town]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]]. It is in the [[Thames Valley]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], and on both the [[Great Western Main Line]] railway and the [[M4 motorway]]. Reading is {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Bristol]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|14|mi|km}} north of [[Basingstoke]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} south-west of [[Maidenhead]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].\n\nThe first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre.\n\nToday,{{when|date=August 2019}} Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills.<ref name=\"Good Growth for Cities 2013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|title=Government & public sector|work=PwC}}</ref> Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the [[University of Reading]]. Every year it hosts the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], one of England's biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include [[Reading F.C.|Reading Football Club]], [[Reading City F.C.]] and [[London Irish]] rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the [[Reading Half Marathon]].\n\nIn 2018, Reading had a population of 230,046<ref name=\"ReadingTown\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/southeastengland/reading/E35001501__reading/|title=Reading (Reading, South East England, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> and the wider [[Reading/Wokingham Urban Area|urban area]] had 337,108 inhabitants,<ref name=\"ReadingUA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/englandua/?cityid=7246|title=United Kingdom: Urban Areas in England - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> while the smaller [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]] covered by the '''Borough of Reading''' had 163,203 residents.<ref name=\"ReadingUnitary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/admin/reading/E06000038__reading/|title=Reading (Unitary District, Reading, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref> The borough is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|two]] [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|members]], and has been continuously represented there since 1295.

Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain.

Later on he learns that Lali belongs to a nomadic community that is at present, inhabiting his region. Ashok meets Lali again and both confess that they are in love with each other. In the meantime Lali's father, who is the head of his community, sends a man named Phulwa to look for her. Phulwa discovers Lali with Prince Ashok. As he has always desired Lali as his better half, he gets jealous and enraged on seeing Lali close the prince. He attacks Ashok, but gets overpowered by him and runs away. Lali becomes upset and fears that Phulwa will take his revenge on them. Phulwa returns to Lali's father and lies to him that Lali has no guts to face her father anymore as she has lost her virginity to the prince, whom he has knocked down on the spot. Lali's father believes what Phulwa has said and orders his gang, along with Phulwa to rob the regal coffer to avenge this insult.\n\nIn the meantime, Ashok and Lali marry and go to meet Lali's father. Her father does not assent to this marriage, considering the fact that their class distinction will be an obstacle in the course of the relationship; besides, he is the one who has ordered the robbing of the coffer. He tells them that he has no objection to this marriage if the queens of the palace can accept Lali as their daughter-in-law, and the prince at first needs to go back to his palace to learn whether Lali will be accepted or not. After Ashok leaves, Lali's father instructs his tribe to pack up and resume their march, leaving Lali behind. Ashok resolves to leave his palace forever and spend the rest of his life with Lali and her community when he learns that she will not be accepted by the queens. He goes back to Lali who was waiting for him to return, and soon they join the march. During the trip, Phulwa replaces Ashok's water bottle with a bottle of poisoned water. Ashok gets thirsty, and Lali, unaware of the fact, gives him that bottle of poisoned water. Ashok falls sick and Lali cannot understand how it happened. The queens, along with cavalry, spot Kumar and Lali. They accuse Lali of having given him the poison. They take Kumar back with them leaving her behind. Kumar is saved ultimately. When he regains his consciousness, the queens misinterpret to him that Lali has given him the poison because all she wanted to have is his wealth, but not his love.\n\nAshok reluctantly gets married to Mangala, the beautiful princess of Thakur Amar Singh. Mangala comes to know that Ashok is already married to Lali. She feels as if she has been cheated and informs her father all about this. Her father comes to take her back with him and Ashok shoots an arrow in his back to counteract him. Hence Mangala is compelled to stay with Ashok.\n\nLali gives birth to a boy whose father is Ashok, actually. She names her son Ratan and tells him all about her past. One night Ratan meets his somnambulist father in the forest. He saves his father by killing a snake that was about to bite him. The King's men are there at once and they take Ratan to Queen Mangala. Mangala confesses her earnest gratitude towards him for saving her husband's life. She employs Ratan on his request. Ratan befriends Mangala's son. Eventually Mangala gets too fond of Ratan, and Ashok finds it irritating. Ratan meets with an accident while carrying the coffer upstairs. He falls down and has a severe injury to his head. Before his death, Ratan discloses that he is Ashok and Lali's son and his mother never gave the poison. Ashok is heartbroken again. He goes to Lali with the corpse of Ratan and they lament together on the death of their son. After the corpse of their son is cremated, Ashok returns to his palace with Lali on his side. At the door he meets an enraged Mangala with a sword in her hand. She argues that Ashok will have to leave Lali behind if he wants to stay in his palace, because Lali does not belong to the standard to stay there. Ashok counter-argues that as long as everything is his property he has the complete right to decide who will stay in his palace. Lali cannot stand this disquietude anymore. She leaves without uttering a single word and Ashok follows her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Suraiya]] as Laali\n*[[Sumitra Devi (actress)|Sumitra]] as Mangala\n*[[Suresh (Hindi films actor)|Suresh]] as Ashok\n*Sham Kumar\n*Ramesh\n*[[Madan Puri]] as Phulwa\n*Banerji\n*[[Amirbai Karnataki]]\t\t\n*[[Mumtaz Begum (actress)|Mumtazbai]]\n*Neelambai\n*Amir Bano\n*[[Daisy Irani|Roop Kumar]]\t\n*[[Ratan Kumar (actor)|Rattan Kumar]]\n*Amir Ali\n*Nawab\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Deewana\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Naushad]]\n| cover        = \n| released     = 1952\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = \n| label        = \n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = [[Baiju Bawra (1952 film)|Baiju Bawra]]\n| prev_year    = 1952\n| year         = 1952\n| next_title   = [[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]\n| next_year    = 1954\n}}\nThe music for the film was composed by renowned musician [[Naushad]] with lyrics penned by [[Shakeel Badayuni]].\n#\"Mora Nazuk Badan\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Dil Mein Aa Gaya Koi\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Jeene Diya Na Chain Se\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Lagi Hai Manmandir\"  \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Mere Chand Mere Lal\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Tasveer Banata Hoon Teri\" \u2013 [[Mohammed Rafi]]\n#\"Teer Khate Jayenge\" \u2013 [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Yeh Duniya Kaisi Hai\" \u2013 [[Hridaynath Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Humein Jo Koi Dekhle\" \u2013 [[Shamshad Begum]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0126264|Diwana}}\n*''[http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/movies/cast-crew/diwana/10466/ Diwana]'' on [http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/ BollywoodMDB]\n*''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbIh6Xlyq9A/ Diwana] on [https://www.youtube.com/ YouTube]\n\n{{A.

Later on he learns that Lali belongs to a nomadic community that is at present, inhabiting his region. Ashok meets Lali again and both confess that they are in love with each other. In the meantime Lali's father, who is the head of his community, sends a man named Phulwa to look for her. Phulwa discovers Lali with Prince Ashok. As he has always desired Lali as his better half, he gets jealous and enraged on seeing Lali close the prince. He attacks Ashok, but gets overpowered by him and runs away. Lali becomes upset and fears that Phulwa will take his revenge on them. Phulwa returns to Lali's father and lies to him that Lali has no guts to face her father anymore as she has lost her virginity to the prince, whom he has knocked down on the spot. Lali's father believes what Phulwa has said and orders his gang, along with Phulwa to rob the regal coffer to avenge this insult.\n\nIn the meantime, Ashok and Lali get married to each other and come to meet Lali's father. Her father does not assent to this marriage, considering the fact that their class distinction will be an obstacle in the course of the relationship; besides, he is the one who has ordered the robbing of the coffer. He tells them that he has no objection to this marriage if the queens of the palace can accept Lali as their daughter-in-law, and the prince at first needs to go back to his palace to learn whether Lali will be accepted or not. After Ashok leaves, Lali's father instructs his tribe to pack up and resume their march, leaving Lali behind. Ashok resolves to leave his palace forever and spend the rest of his life with Lali and her community when he learns that she will not be accepted by the queens. He goes back to Lali who was waiting for him to return, and soon they join the march. During the trip, Phulwa replaces Ashok's water bottle with a bottle of poisoned water. Ashok gets thirsty, and Lali, unaware of the fact, gives him that bottle of poisoned water. Ashok falls sick and Lali cannot understand how it happened. The queens, along with cavalry, spot Kumar and Lali. They accuse Lali of having given him the poison. They take Kumar back with them leaving her behind. Kumar is saved ultimately. When he regains his consciousness, the queens misinterpret to him that Lali has given him the poison because all she wanted to have is his wealth, but not his love.\n\nAshok reluctantly gets married to Mangala, the beautiful princess of Thakur Amar Singh. Mangala comes to know that Ashok is already married to Lali. She feels as if she has been cheated and informs her father all about this. Her father comes to take her back with him and Ashok shoots an arrow in his back to counteract him. Hence Mangala is compelled to stay with Ashok.\n\nLali gives birth to a boy whose father is Ashok, actually. She names her son Ratan and tells him all about her past. One night Ratan meets his somnambulist father in the forest. He saves his father by killing a snake that was about to bite him. The King's men are there at once and they take Ratan to Queen Mangala. Mangala confesses her earnest gratitude towards him for saving her husband's life. She employs Ratan on his request. Ratan befriends Mangala's son. Eventually Mangala gets too fond of Ratan, and Ashok finds it irritating. Ratan meets with an accident while carrying the coffer upstairs. He falls down and has a severe injury to his head. Before his death, Ratan discloses that he is Ashok and Lali's son and his mother never gave the poison. Ashok is heartbroken again. He goes to Lali with the corpse of Ratan and they lament together on the death of their son. After the corpse of their son is cremated, Ashok returns to his palace with Lali on his side. At the door he meets an enraged Mangala with a sword in her hand. She argues that Ashok will have to leave Lali behind if he wants to stay in his palace, because Lali does not belong to the standard to stay there. Ashok counter-argues that as long as everything is his property he has the complete right to decide who will stay in his palace. Lali cannot stand this disquietude anymore. She leaves without uttering a single word and Ashok follows her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Suraiya]] as Laali\n*[[Sumitra Devi (actress)|Sumitra]] as Mangala\n*[[Suresh (Hindi films actor)|Suresh]] as Ashok\n*Sham Kumar\n*Ramesh\n*[[Madan Puri]] as Phulwa\n*Banerji\n*[[Amirbai Karnataki]]\t\t\n*[[Mumtaz Begum (actress)|Mumtazbai]]\n*Neelambai\n*Amir Bano\n*[[Daisy Irani|Roop Kumar]]\t\n*[[Ratan Kumar (actor)|Rattan Kumar]]\n*Amir Ali\n*Nawab\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Deewana\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Naushad]]\n| cover        = \n| released     = 1952\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = \n| label        = \n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = [[Baiju Bawra (1952 film)|Baiju Bawra]]\n| prev_year    = 1952\n| year         = 1952\n| next_title   = [[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]\n| next_year    = 1954\n}}\nThe music for the film was composed by renowned musician [[Naushad]] with lyrics penned by [[Shakeel Badayuni]].\n#\"Mora Nazuk Badan\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Dil Mein Aa Gaya Koi\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Jeene Diya Na Chain Se\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Lagi Hai Manmandir\"  \u2013 [[Suraiya]]\n#\"Mere Chand Mere Lal\" \u2013 [[Suraiya]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Tasveer Banata Hoon Teri\" \u2013 [[Mohammed Rafi]]\n#\"Teer Khate Jayenge\" \u2013 [[Lata Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Yeh Duniya Kaisi Hai\" \u2013 [[Hridaynath Mangeshkar]]\n#\"Humein Jo Koi Dekhle\" \u2013 [[Shamshad Begum]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0126264|Diwana}}\n*''[http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/movies/cast-crew/diwana/10466/ Diwana]'' on [http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/ BollywoodMDB]\n*''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbIh6Xlyq9A/ Diwana] on [https://www.youtube.com/ YouTube]\n\n{{A.

Transfer of power is conducted through state-sanctioned assassinations: when a '''Sith Lord''' grows complacent, begins to show weakness, and is eventually killed, their property and authority are transferred to the apprentice who killed them. Robberies, betrayal, and sabotage are commonplace; murder is acceptable so long as the culprit is not caught. This kraterocratic system ensures that Sith society nurtures some of the most vicious and competitive individuals in the galaxy and is only governed by those strong enough to seize control.\n\nSith philosophy lionizes conflict as a [[catalyst]] for growth and as a tool for [[purge|purging]] the unworthy. Sith academies were structured with rules, lectures, and classes, with an underlying \"kill or be killed\" mentality amongst the apprentices. Sith emphasize \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" and view [[Self-control|restraint]] as a weakness. Members adhere to [[master morality]], are characterized by the desire to seize power by any means necessary, leveraging force (both physical and supernatural), social maneuvering, and political cunning to their advantage. The Sith cultivate a connection to the Dark Side of [[the Force]], which provides them with easy access to superhuman power and arcane knowledge; however, the trade-off is the severe cost of adopting a [[dark triad]] personality that corrodes their basic capacity for empathy, kindness, and love.\n\nThroughout ''Star Wars'' media and in popular culture, the Sith are infamous as the dualistic antagonists to the [[Jedi]], an affiliation of altruistic warriors who strive to use their own martial training and connection to the \"light side\" of the Force to promote peace and the common welfare throughout the galaxy. To counteract the Jedi's benevolent influence, Sith were responsible for secretly instigating many small regional conflicts as part of their larger plan to destabilize the Republic and eventually take control of the galaxy. Hiding from the shadows, their fingerprints are everywhere, in every conflict in the galaxy, and their subversive influence reaches far and wide. Over their long history, the Sith have established great empires, come close to realizing their ambitions of galactic conquest, and nearly eradicated the Jedi. Ultimately, however, they are self-defeating, their grand plans undone time and again by internal strife, rebellion inspired by their vicious tactics, and the psychologically noxious effects of their dark arts and philosophy.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''Sith'' was first used in the 1974 rough draft of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/the-star-wars-rough-draft/|title=Roughdraft|work=StarWarz.com}}</ref> with the first published use being the 1976 [[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|novelization of ''Star Wars'']] as a title for the key villain [[Darth Vader]], the \"Dark Lord of the Sith\". Sith characters had also been portrayed as such in some non-canonical [[Star Wars\u00a0expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Legends]] works prior to the release of ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', and in archived footage for the original ''Star Wars''.<ref>Dark Horse Comics, ''[[Dark Empire]]''</ref>  Prior to the formal introduction of the Sith, the term \"Dark Jedi\" was sometimes used for characters who would be later identified as Sith, or had goals and practices similar to the Sith. In his novel series ''[[The Thrawn Trilogy]]'', author [[Timothy Zahn]] labeled Sith Lord Darth Vader and Emperor [[Palpatine]] as \"Dark Jedi\", and the term \"Sith\" was never mentioned in the series until later reprints of the novels. \"Dark Jedi\" is also the name given in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] to [[antihero]] fictional characters attuned to [[the Force]] and adept in its Dark Side. However, the concept of \"Dark Jedi\" is not referenced anywhere in any of the theatrical ''Star Wars'' films, and they exist by that name only in non-canonical ''Star Wars'' Legends media, including video games such as ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (series)|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight (series)|Star Wars: Jedi Knight]]'' series. The Sith were not mentioned by name in canonical stories until the prequel trilogy used the word on film starting with 1999's ''[[The Phantom Menace]]''.\n\n===Influences===\n{{Main|Star Wars sources and analogues|Star Wars#Themes}}\n\n[[George Lucas]] acknowledged that the [[Jedi]], Sith, and other [[the Force|Force]] concepts have been inspired by many sources. These include: [[knighthood]], [[chivalry]], [[paladin]]ism, [[samurai]] [[bushido]], [[Shaolin Monastery]], [[Feudalism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Qigong]], [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]] and [[Roman mythology|mythology]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shint\u014d]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], and numerous cinematic precursors.  The works of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of ''Star Wars''.<ref name=\"swmyth\">{{cite web | url=http://www.films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm | title=The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers | publisher=Films Media Group | work=films.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |title=Star Wars @ NASM, Unit 1, Introduction Page |publisher=Nasm.si.edu |date=1999-01-31 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408195115/http://nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |archivedate= 8 April 2010 |df= }}</ref>  In particular, the contrasting narrative relationship between the Dark Side-using Sith and light side-using Jedi mirrors several modern and classical literary tropes.\n\nMost prominently, the conflict between the Sith and Jedi employs the classic trope of [[Black-and-white dualism|black and white moral dualism]]\u2014an elemental contrast between evil (the \"darkness\") and good (the \"light\") first postulated and elaborated in Zoroastrianism during the 5th century BCE from which the core mythos of Star Wars is much influenced.<ref>Featurette \"The Chosen One\", Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD</ref>  The ongoing struggle of the humanistic \"light side\"-affiliated Jedi to permanently defeat the egoistic \"Dark Side\"-affiliated Sith is framed not only as a contest of values, but as a deep metaphysical conflict: The Dark Side of the Force is viewed by the Jedi, and generally represented within ''Star Wars'' media, as not only a dangerous expedient but as a form of existential corruption which must be purged for the universe, or a person, to attain spiritual balance.<ref>{{web cite|url=https://andphilosophy.com/2017/03/13/the-paradox-of-the-force-the-quest-for-balance-in-star-wars/|title=The Paradox of The Force in Star Wars|website=AndPhilosophy.com}}</ref>  Jedi are often depicted as imperfect individuals, but their cause of selfless heroism is ultimately on the right side of an inexorable cosmic struggle against evil, embodied in the power-hungry Sith and the Dark Side of the Force.\n\nThe dualistic relationship between the Sith' and the Jedi' concepts of \"purity\" mirrors the philosophical and literary concept of \"[[Apollonian and Dionysian]]\": the Jedi are portrayed as embracing [[Purity in Buddhism|purity]], reason, temperance, altruism and other [[Humanism|humanistic virtues]]; the Sith, by contrast, embrace curiosity, emotion, conflict, power, instincts, unfettered self-interest and other [[Hedonism|hedonistic vices]].  However, whereas the classic Greek concept did not necessarily view the Apollonian and Dyonisian principles as opposed, ''Star Wars'' frames the Jedi and Sith as opponents in a dire moral struggle, with the Sith cast as corrupted villains apparently destined to defeat or self-destruction in the end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-who-is-the-chosen-one/|title=Star Wars: Who Is The Chosen One?|website=SlashFilm.com}}</ref>  Although a path to temporary power, the Sith way inevitably leads to ruin.\n\nWithin the ''Star Wars'' narrative, the Jedi and Sith naturally have different self-understandings. In Sith rhetoric, the relationship between the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith closely mirrors Nietzsche's concept of [[master\u2013slave morality]].  Sith value \"master\" virtues, such as pride and power, whereas the Jedi value altruistic virtues like kindness and empathy.  The goal of the Sith is tangible greatness: the ability to shape and destroy the world according to one's will alone.  The goal of the Jedi is moral goodness: freedom from inner, and outer, turmoil and suffering.  However, the Sith consider the Jedi's aspirations to be either hopeless or pathetic.  To the Sith, greater power is the only authentic goal.\n\n==Development==\nOriginally, George Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] in the same way that the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' had served [[Adolf Hitler]]. In developing the backstory for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|title=The Secret History of Star Wars|edition=3.0|year=2008|origyear=2007|publisher=Legacy Books Press|isbn=978-0-9784652-3-0|page=184}}</ref>\n\n===Fictional backstory===\nThe Sith are dedicated to the \"Sith Code\" and to mastering the Dark Side of the Force.<ref name=\"sw-en\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/groups/sith/|title=Sith, Star Wars Encyclopedia|work=StarWars.com|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> The Sith Code identifies conflict as the fundamental dynamic of reality, and holds that the search for lasting peace, within or without, is both quixotic and misguided.  Rather, Sith embrace strife and [[Passions (philosophy)|dark passion]] as salutary and emancipatory forces, as they believe that violent struggle purges the decadent and weak, and that emotions such as aggression and hate provide the strength and resolve to secure freedom through victory.  Although Sith seek dominion, Sith philosophy stresses that power belongs only to those with the strength, cunning, and ruthlessness to maintain it, and thus \"betrayal\" among the Sith is not a vice but an endorsed norm.  Accordingly, the Sith reject altruism, self-abnegation and kindness, as they regard such attitudes as founded on delusions that fetter one's perceptions and power.  In connection with their philosophy, the Sith draw on the Dark Side of the Force through severe negative emotions, a technique antipodal to that of their archenemies, the Jedi, who rely on the Force's \"light side,\" i.e., the Force as experienced through disciplined states of quietude and compassion.  Notably, both the Jedi and Sith shun romantic and familial love, as the Jedi fear such love will lead to attachment, and thus selfishness, and the Sith fear it will compromise their ruthlessness and connection to the Dark Side of the Force.  \nAlthough the Sith are intimately linked to the Dark Side, not every user of the Dark Side is a Sith, nor is every user of the light side a Jedi.\n  \n{{quote|text=Yes, a Jedi\u2019s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did [[Darth Vader|Obi-Wan\u2019s apprentice]].|title=''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''|character=[[Yoda]]}}\n\nThe Dark Side of the Force is stigmatized as seductive, corruptive, and addictive by the Jedi, who view it as evil,<ref>{{cite book|title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOzY95F6as0C|first1=Kevin S. |last1=Decker |first2=Jason T. |last2=Eberl|isbn=0-8126-9583-6|publisher=Open Court|date=2005}}</ref> whereas the Sith consider the Dark Side of the Force to be its most powerful manifestation, and regard the abstemious Jedi as blinded by false virtue.  As portrayed in all ''Star Wars''-related media, the Dark Side provides users with powers similar to those of the light side-using Jedi, but as it leverages passion and violence, its use is enhanced by negative raw and aggressive emotions and instinctual feelings such as anger, greed, hatred, and rage. By deciding to learn the ways of the Dark Side of the Force, the Sith may also acquire powers and abilities considered by some in the ''Star Wars'' universe to be unnatural.<ref>Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith</ref> A notable example is a form of directed dielectric breakdown called \"Force Lightning,\" infamously used by the Sith Lord [[Darth Sidious]] to torture Jedi-initiate and rebel Luke Skywalker. Darth Sidious claimed that his own master, Darth Plagueis, could even use the Force to avert the natural deaths of those whose lives he wished to save. Being uninhibited in their use of the Force, Sith could also repurpose abilities shared with the Jedi, such as telekinesis, to new and terrifying effect: [[Darth Vader]] was infamous for his use of telekinetic strangulation, or \"Force Choke,\" as a means of execution or intimidation.\n\n{{quote|text=Beneath anger is always fear. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you. Train yourself to let go everything you fear to lose.|title=''[[The Phantom Menace]]''|character=[[Yoda]]}}\n\nExtended indulgence in the Dark Side reshapes the user's psychology, resulting in a loss of humanity, morality, empathy, and the ability to love, leaving every Sith, to varying degrees, amoral, cruel, sadistic and violent. Considering this dark change in personality to be a transformation into a different person altogether, some who turn to the Dark Side take on a different name, as they regard their former persona as dead and destroyed. Sith Lords in particular adopt a new name upon their initiation into the Order, prefixing it with the title '''Darth''' (e.g., \"Darth Vader\").  Severe saturation in the Dark Side may even lead to physical degradation.  Although Sith are deeply affected by the Machiavellian methods and dark arts they practice, they are not portrayed as necessarily irredeemable: Some Sith, most famously [[Darth Vader]] in the final moments of his life, have renounced the Order and the Dark Side of the Force.\n\n{{quote|text=The dark side is generous... It is patient and it always wins \u2013 but in the heart of its strength lies its weakness: one lone candle is enough to hold it back.|title=''[[Revenge of the Sith]]'' novelization|character=[[Yoda]]}}\n\nMartial arts are a core part of the Sith tradition, and Sith featured in the ''Star Wars'' film series have all been highly trained warriors who further augment their abilities with the Force.  Like the Jedi, the Sith's signature armament is an extremely lethal focused energy melee weapon known as a [[lightsaber]], which (generally) only those trained in the ways of the Force can use effectively. Sith use lightsabers in combination with Force-derived powers, such as telekinesis, enhanced dexterity and precognition, to achieve superhuman combat prowess. A fully trained Sith is depicted as being at least a match for a well-trained Jedi Knight, and either can handily defeat multiple ordinary attackers armed with projectile weapons.  In matters of dress, Sith may adopt any attire consistent with their plans or guise; they commonly favor black robes, armor and gis when presenting themselves authentically.\n\n===Fictional backstory (''Legends'')===\n\nIn the ''Legends'' continuity, the Sith Order began around 6,900 BBY, during a period known as the Hundred Year Darkness. A series of conflict began between the rebellious dark Jedi, a faction of the Jedi Order, and the rest of the Order. The dark Jedi were defeated and cast out, exiled to the unknown regions. These Exiles came across the planet Korriban, and its native species, the Sith. The strongest among the Exiles, Ajunta Pall, became the first to hold the title Dark Lord of the Sith. His contemporaries, such as Karness Muur and XoXaan became Sith Lords. The human Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species, who also had an affinity for the Dark Side. They would become the original Sith Empire.\n\nOne of the earliest leaders of this Sith Empire was Tulak Hord. He expanded the Sith territories, and conquered the Dromund System, home to Dromuund Kaas, later the capital of the Sith Empire. He was eventually followed by Marka Ragnos, the last ruler of a period known as the Golden Age of the Sith. Upon the passing of Ragnos, two contenders for the throne of Dark Lord, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, dueled at his funeral. Eventually, after a series of conflicts, Sadow was victorious, and Kressh apparently killed.\n\nSadow began the Great Hyperspace War, invading the Republic and laying siege to its planets. Sadow's efforts were initially met with success, his forces amplified by illusions that Sadow projected from his meditation sphere. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord's concentration was broken when his apprentice turned on him. With his illusions dispersed, Sadow's forces were forced to retreat. Upon returning to Sith space, they found that Kressh had not been killed, and engaged him in a space battle. Sadow was victorious again, but they were soon attacked by republic forces. Sadow escaped by causing the Denarii Binary Star to go supernova.\n\nThe Sith Empire would eventually rise again, with the rise of Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma. The spirit of the deceased Dark Lord, Marka Ragnos, declared Kun Dark Lord of the Sith, and made Qel-Droma his apprentice. Allying themselves with warriors such as the Mandalorians, Kun and Qel-Droma declared war on the Galactic Republic. During a raid on the Jedi Library at Ossus, Qel-Droma dueled and killed his brother, but was captured. Qel-Droma was redeemed, and was instrumental in Kun's downfall, when the latter retreated to Yavin 4.\n\nAt some point following the Mandalorian Wars, the individuals known as Revan and Alek Squinquargesimus declared themselves sith lords, and became Darth Revan and Darth Malak respectively. Their brutal campaign against the Republic was hugely successful. Revan was eventually betrayed by Malak, allowing a Jedi strike team to capture him. Malak continued his conquest without Revan's tactical leadership, until a redeemed Revan defeated him, and the Star Forge, the source of the Sith Fleet was destroyed.\n\nRemnants of Revan's Sith Empire, lead by the Sith Triumvirate, consisting of Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, began a shadow war against the Jedi. This First Jedi Purge, brought the Jedi Order to the brink of extinction. Their downfall came about when Meetra Surik, a Jedi who was exiled after the Mandalorian Wars, returned to known space. She defeated the three Sith, and without the Sith leadership, and the destruction of their base of operations on Malachor V, the remaining Sith forces faded into obscurity.\n\nAround 300 years later, the original Sith empire, now under the leadership of Emperor Vitiate, emerged from the Unknown Regions and declared war on the republic. This war, dubbed the Great Galactic War, was halted when Vitiate, on the cusp of victory, was restrained by the telepathic prowess of Revan. After a period of non fighting, called the Galactic Cold War, tensions boiled over, and the Galactic War began. The Sith empire eventually fell to infighting, and mostly disappeared. Occasionally, a Dark Lord such as Darth Rivan or Darth Ruin, would rise and fall, but the Sith did not become a major threat again until around 2,500 years later.\n\nAt this point, the Brotherhood of Darkness, arose, lead by the Sith Lord Skere Kaan. They focused on controlling the infighting between the Sith. This policy allowed them to make great progress in their war against the Republic. Ironically, one of their own, a Sith Lord by the name of Bane turned on them, because he disapproved of their methods. He manipulated the Brotherhood into extinction, and they were defeated. Bane started the Rule of Two, which evolved into the Sith as they are seen in the films.\n\n===Fictional history===\n{{Main|Star Wars#Premise}}\nThe ''Star Wars'' saga began with the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', which was released in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759|accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> Since then, [[Star Wars films|films]], [[List of Star Wars books|books]], [[Star Wars games|computer games]] and [[Star Wars comics|comics]] have been released, all set in the [[Star Wars universe|fictional universe of ''Star Wars'']], which has expanded the history of the Sith within their stories.\n\nThe schemes of the Sith are key to the overarching plot of the ''Star Wars'' films and much other fictional material in the franchise.  Their background has varied among depictions, but the Sith have always been insidious archenemies of the [[Jedi]] leveraging dark arts in pursuit of power and revenge. The Sith were first mentioned in ''A New Hope'' in a scene ultimately cut from the film.  They were expanded upon heavily in the following years in books, comics, games and other multimedia. The Sith were formally introduced on-screen with the release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' in 1999 as a shadowy martial order manipulating the movie's political factions into a galaxy-spanning civil war.\n\n''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' first aired on [[Cartoon Network]] in 2008. This series took place between ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. During this time, [[Anakin Skywalker]] is a full-fledged Jedi Knight and the series shows how he progresses into his fall to the Dark Side of the Force.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars|url=http://www.tv-links.eu|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> [[Count Dooku]] is the active Sith Lord and leader of the Separatist Alliance. The series also explores Dooku's attempts at training secret apprentices like [[Asajj Ventress]] and [[Savage Opress]] in order to eventually defeat Darth Sidious and become the ruling Sith Lord.\n\n====Emergence of the Sith Order====\nThe origin, agenda, abilities and philosophy of the Sith are intertwined with their relationship to [[the Force]]. With proper training, the Force may be called upon by rare individuals capable of \"sensing\" or \"touching\" it to achieve extraordinary feats such as telekinesis, precognition and mental suggestion. Not all psychological states are conducive to employing the Force; discipline is required. However, both quietude and focused, intense passion alike can be effective. The Sith originated in a species of Force-sensitive warriors who discovered the efficacy of passion as a tool to draw on the Force at least 5,000 years prior to the events of the first ''Star Wars'' film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luceno|first=James|title=Star Wars: Tarkin|year=2014|publisher=Del Rey Books|isbn=978-0-345-51152-2}}</ref> Fully embracing this approach, they became defined and corrupted by it.\n\nThe warriors who would become the first Sith were apparently heterodox members of an older martial order of Force-sensitive sapient beings in the ''Star Wars'' universe: The Jedi. The Jedi served as a space-faring [[Military order (monastic society)|knightly order]] within the [[Galactic Republic]], a representative democracy encompassing most developed worlds.  The Jedi Order sought to use the powers of the Force to help defend the weak and advance the rule of law across the galaxy, in keeping with their ethics of self-sacrifice and service to the common welfare. The Jedi creed mirrored their method of utilizing the Force, and Jedi doctrine favored states of serenity, detachment, compassion, and humility as the proper means of accessing its power. When members of the Jedi Order began to experiment with passion as an alternative, controversy emerged. The Jedi establishment saw these innovations as a threat to the ethos of the Jedi, opening members to the seduction of aggrandizement and cruelty. Eventually, this controversy led to a sectarian conflict in which the heterodox Jedi were defeated and exiled.<ref>Marvel Comics, Star Wars 9 \u2013 \"Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part II\"</ref>\n\nIn exile, the dissident Jedi were free to explore the relationship between passion and the Force. They concluded that the martial and ethical disciplines of the Jedi establishment were foolish and misguided: Passion, not quietude, was the most potent means of accessing the Force, and conflict, not peace, was the natural and healthy state of the universe.  Rejecting the self-abnegation of their forebears, the exiles now embraced ruthless personal ambition, believing that power belonged to those with the cunning and strength to seize it.  In their training, the dissidents would seek to master the Force by cultivating dark passions such as anger and hate, a practice anathematized by the Jedi as taking recourse to the Force's \"Dark Side.\" Guided by their [[Might makes right|kratocratic]] and egoistic philosophy and armed with taboo Dark Side techniques, the former Jedi exiles would reemerge to menace the galaxy as the Sith Order, aiming to conquer the Galactic Republic and exact revenge against the Jedi.\n\nA succession of Sith-led regimes would arise to challenge the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.<ref>Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 \"Escape from Kadavo\"</ref> However, internal power struggles would prove decisive in thwarting the Sith's designs. The paradox of reconciling endless personal ambition with corporate action would become a great practical and philosophical concern for the Sith. Ultimately, this paradox would be \u201cresolved\u201d through a drastic reorganization effected by a leader named Darth Bane, who recast the Sith in an esoteric lineal master-apprentice tradition known as \u201cThe Rule of Two.\u201d<ref>Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 \"Sacrifice\"</ref> Thereafter (at least, as a matter of orthodoxy) there would be only two Sith at a time: One to embody power, and another to crave it. While concealing their identity as Sith, a succession of Sith masters and apprentices would work through the centuries to inveigle or force themselves into positions of power and undermine responsible government, preparing the Galactic Republic for eventual usurpation. The Banite tradition encouraged each apprentice to eventually challenge and slaughter his or her master, and take an apprentice in turn. In this way, Darth Bane guaranteed the conspiracy remained a secret for a thousand years; he believed that the kratocratic essence of Sith philosophy could be reconciled with a sustained project of galactic domination and revenge against the Jedi. The first six ''Star Wars'' films chronicle the consummation, and eventual undoing, of this ancient scheme.\n\n====Ascent to power of the Sith====\nDarth Bane's plan would come to fruition through [[Sheev Palpatine]], a [[Naboo]] Senator, later Supreme Chancellor, of the [[Galactic Republic]], and secretly a Dark Lord of the Sith (\u201cDarth Sidious\u201d). By manipulating disgruntled factions within the Galactic Republic, Palpatine orchestrated a civil war. This conflict, known within the ''Star Wars'' universe as the \"[[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]\", provided a justification for consolidating power in the Galactic Republic's chief executive and assembling a large army of hastily cloned soldiers\u2014surreptitiously conditioned to obey certain key commands issued by Palpatine. Although the Jedi eventually discovered Palpatine's identity as a Sith and attempted to arrest him, this action was anticipated by Palpatine, who framed their actions as an attempted coup, providing in turn a pretext for annihilating the Jedi by activating \u201cOrder 66,\u201d one of the clone soldiers\u2019 embedded protocols. In the course of effecting his designs, Palpatine also manipulated the Jedi's most powerful initiate, Anakin Skywalker, into his service, by promising to teach Skywalker Dark Side techniques that could save the life of [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], a Galactic Senator to whom Skywalker was secretly married in violation of Jedi rules, and whose death in childbirth Skywalker had preternaturally foreseen. In a tragic irony, Amidala's sheer horror at discovering Skywalker's collaboration with Sidious in destroying the Jedi would itself be the cause of her death during childbirth, though Sidious would trick Skywalker into believing that an episode of Skywalker's physical abuse of Amidala had been the actual cause of her death. Skywalker's subsequent emotional collapse would lead him to fully embrace the Dark Side of the Force and assume the persona of [[Darth Vader]], Lord of the Sith. With Darth Vader at his side, the Emperor would rule the newly styled Galactic Empire for approximately 20 years as its Emperor. Initially unknown to Vader and Sidious, two children were delivered by Padme before her death.\n\n====Sith temples====\nThe ''Rebels'' episode \"Twilight of the Apprentice\" features a forbidden planet called Malachor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor|title=Malachor|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> home of an ancient '''Sith temple'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor-sith-temple|title=Malachor Sith temple|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> The temple contains a superweapon, and can only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/sith-holocron|title=Sith holocron|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> in an [[obelisk]] at the summit of the pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants. Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and this ''Rebels'' episode, [[Darth Maul]] had become stranded on the planet. When [[Ahsoka Tano]], [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]] arrive, Ezra is separated from them. He is discovered by Maul, and together, they use the Force cooperatively to solve a series of tests, and retrieve a Sith Holocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors, all of whom are killed by Maul. Maul then betrays his allies, blinding Kanan, and proceeds to activate the superweapon.\n\nMaul is defeated by a sightless Kanan, and Darth Vader arrives with the intention of retrieving the holocron, but is challenged by Ahsoka, his former Padawan. While the superweapon is preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieve the holocron and escape, preventing the weapon of mass destruction from being used. Even though the temple is destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader keep fighting to the death within the rapidly crumbling building, until it eventually explodes, wounding Vader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/star-wars-rebels-twilight-of-the-apprentice-review|title=Star Wars Rebels: \"Twilight of the Apprentice\" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=30 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Star Wars Resistance]]'' episode \"The Relic Raiders\" depicts a Sith temple hidden underneath a later Jedi temple.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cao |first=Caroline |title=Star Wars Resistance Review: The Presence of The Force Grows in \"The Relic Raiders\" |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-resistance-season-2-episode-7-review-relic-raiders/ |website=/Film |accessdate=November 23, 2019 |date=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====End of the Sith====\nAnakin's children, [[Princess Leia|Leia]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] would become key members of the [[Rebel Alliance]] to restore the Galactic Republic. Luke would be secretly tutored in the ways of the Force by Vader's own former Jedi master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and a powerful elder Jedi, [[Yoda]], who also survived Palpatine's purge. Ironically, during a final confrontation between Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and the Emperor aboard a mobile battle station known as the [[Death Star]], the Sith lineage would end as Darth Bane prescribed that it proceed. Darth Sidious offered Skywalker an ultimatum to enter his service or die, and proceeded to use his Force-derived powers to torture and kill Skywalker when the latter refused to embrace the Dark Side of the Force. Experiencing a crisis of conscience at the imminent death of Skywalker, whom Vader now knew to be his son, Darth Vader chose to intervene and kill his former master, Sidious fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Vader would die of his own injuries shortly thereafter, thus apparently bringing an end to the Sith and their ancient vendetta.\n\nThe 2019 film ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'' depicts the climax of the conflict between the Sith and the Jedi,<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |title=Everything New Revealed in Vanity Fair's The Rise of Skywalker Cover Story |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/everything-new-revealed-in-vanity-fairs-the-rise-of-skywalker-cover-story |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=May 22, 2019 |date=May 22, 2019}}</ref> and features the group known as the [[Sith#Sith Eternal|Sith Eternal]], led by a resurrected Darth Sidious. When Sidious meets his final demise at the hands of his granddaughter [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the moment also marks the definitive end of the Sith.\n\n==Overview==\n===Members===\n<!-- Not every \"dark side user\" is a Sith; nor is every \"light side user\" is a Jedi. For example, Snoke and Kylo Ren, although powerful Dark Side users, were never considered Sith. The Knights of Ren, an organization of dark side Force-wielders led by Kylo Ren, were also a separate group from the Sith and the Dark Jedi. -->\n\n====Timeline====\n\n*Before the films - At an unknown point in time, numerous Jedi become disillusioned with the Order and exile themselves, forming the Sith Order. Thousands of years later, a centuries-long war between the Jedi and the Sith takes place, which culminates with the apparent defeat of all the Sith. However, there is a sole survivor, Darth Bane, who later goes on to create the Rule of Two and have an apprentice of his own, marking the beginning of a new era for the Sith. The Sith continue to exist in secret for a millennium after Bane's death. Darth Plagueis trains [[Palpatine|Sidious]], who ultimately kills Plagueis in his sleep and takes Maul as his first apprentice.\n* ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Sidious and Maul, who is later defeated in battle and presumed to be dead; the Jedi also become aware of the Sith's return.)\n* ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (Sidious and [[Count Dooku|Tyranus]]; Maul lives but is absent from the film due to still being thought dead.)\n* ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|film]] and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|series]] (Sidious and Tyranus, who also uses Asajj Ventress as a Shadow Hand.

He was a paranoid man, who believed that his followers were secretly plotting to overthrow him, which eventually came true, as they betrayed and attacked him, seeking to steal his power. Forced to flee from [[Korriban]], Andeddu created the world of Prakith, where he would rule as a deity for several centuries until meeting his demise and entombing himself to prevent his followers from stealing his secrets even in death. Prior to his death, he would also create a Sith holocron to store all his knowledge, including the ability to cheat death by transferring one's essence into another vessel, and his cult, called \"the Malevolence\", would create a temple in the reverence of the Dark Lord, believing that one day he would return. The legend of Andeddu and his incredible power remained at large long after his death, despite the Jedi Order's attempt to erase all knowledge and reference about the Sith.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Andeddu is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Andeddu thousands of years after his death and had the 5th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Atrius ====\nDarth Atrius was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who existed long before the Rule of Two was created. He owned two crossguard lightsabers, which were found and given away by the smuggler Sana Starros after the [[Battle of Yavin]]. The anger possessed by Atrius when wielding both these crossguard lightsabers at the same time, carried over to the weapons themselves, and can transfer over to their new owners. These lightsabers were eventually destroyed by Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, thus possibly erasing all knowledge about Atrius himself.<ref>https://movieweb.com/star-wars-canon-darth-atrius-lightsabers/</ref>\n\n==== Darth Caldoth ====\nDarth Caldoth was a male [[Duros (Star Wars)|Duros]] Dark Lord of the Sith, who lived at an unknown point in time and wrote a book titled ''The Bestiary of Darth Caldoth'', which mentioned various Sith warbeasts such as the Gundark. According to the legend, Caldoth eventually gained a Sith apprentice, the [[Twi'lek]] Ry Nymbis, and they were considered the two most powerful individuals in the galaxy at one point. Caldoth killed his own apprentice with a Sith ritual that turned the person's body into stone when he felt Nymbis was going to betray him. With the ritual, Nymbis was trapped in an eternal nightmare. Darth Caldoth is only alluded to in the novel ''Myths & Fables'' written by George Mann and published in August 2019.\n\n==== Darth Krall ====\nDarth Krall (Radaki) was a male Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at an unknown point in time and was seduced to the Dark Side after losing his faith in the Jedi Order, believing that the Jedi should retain their family ties and wealth. His notable actions include taking part in the Battle of Wasted Years, where the Sith emerged victorious, and taming the Nightmare Conjunction. His lightsaber would later be stored in the Bogan Collection at the Jedi Temple on [[Coruscant]]. Darth Krall is only alluded to in the audiobook ''Dooku: Jedi Lost''.\n\n==== Darth Skrye ====\nDarth Skrye was a female Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at an unknown point in time. Her voice would be heard by Count Dooku during his time as a Jedi Padawan, in a Force vision that he had after encountering the Presagers of Hakotei on Asusto, where she claimed that the Sith were reborn, before activating a superweapon called the Cauldron and destroying an entire planet. Skyre also owned an artifact called the Hand of Skrye, which would eventually be found by Jedi Lene Kostana and Sifo-Dyas on [[Rishi (Star Wars)|Rishi.]] Darth Skrye is only alluded to in the audiobook ''Dooku: Lost Jedi''.\n\n==== Darth Wrend ====\nDarth Wrend was a Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at an unknown point in time and was best known for coming back to life after being killed by the Jedi Order, in order to fight them once again. The legend of Darth Wrend would come to [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]'s mind during his time as a Padawan, who opened the holocron of prophecy, which contained numerous prophecies of which several dated ten thousand years prior. One of the prophecies said that evil would disappear yet appear again once the righteous had lost its light, which many believed that was referring to the return of the Sith. At that time, Qui-Gon believed that the prophecy talked about Darth Wrend's return from the dead and that it had already been fulfilled, although it would later be discovered that the prophecy referred to the return of the Sith in the form of Darth Sidious and his apprentice Darth Maul. Darth Wrend is only alluded in the novel and audiobook ''Master & Apprentice''.\n\n==== Darth Tanis ====\nDarth Tanis was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at least 4,000 years before the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', as Sith accounts from 3966 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) described kyber weaponry developed by him on the planet [[Malachor]]. Darth Tanis is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Tanis thousands of years after his death and had the 17th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Desolous ====\nDarth Desolous was a male [[Pau'an]] Dark Lord of the Sith who was expelled from the Jedi Order due to his violent nature and trained an army of fellow Pau'an warriors to fight them, but ended up falling into a trap set by the Jedi and perished in battle. His image would later be incorporated in the training simulations at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Desolous is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Desolous many years after his death and had the 44th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Phobos ====\nDarth Phobos was a Theelin Dark Lady of the Sith with mind manipulation abilities, who killed many of her fellow Sith in a bid of power and formed a cult to worship her, but was ultimately killed by the combined forces of the Jedi and Sith. Her image would later be incorporated in the training simulations at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Phobos is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though her backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Phobos many years after her death and had the 39th Legion of Sith Troopers named after her.\n\n==== Darth Revan ====\n[[Darth Revan]] was a Jedi hero who led the Republic to victory in the Mandalorian Wars, almost 4,000 years before the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. He and his comrade, Malak, later unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire, hidden in the Unknown Reaches of space. The Sith Emperor, using Sith sorcery, turned Revan and Malak to the Dark Side, but the two broke free from his control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Malak as his Sith Apprentice. As a Sith, Revan prepared to battle with the Jedi who boarded his flagship, and Darth Malak, in the hopes of destroying both Revan and [[Bastila Shan]], betrayed his master, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge. Revan was critically injured and taken by Bastila Shan to the Jedi Council Enclave. The Council chose to wipe Revan's memory, and imprint him with a false identity. Revan later awoke on a starship under attack and encountered Malak, who eventually revealed the truth of his identity. Following this, Revan defeated Malak in a final battle, claiming victory for the Republic. Revan later married Bastila Shan with the approval of the Jedi Council and eventually departed into the Unknown Regions to confront the Sith Emperor, but got imprisoned by gun for 300 years until his descendant Satele Shan rescued him. However, due to being imprisoned for centuries, his lighter half had persihed and became a Force spirit, leaving only his darker half, which sought to destroy the Sith Emperor once and for all. Since the Emperor's physical body had already been destroyed, leaving only his spirit, Revan planned to resurrect him so that he could then kill him for good. However, he was ultimately defeated by the combined forces of the Repulbic and his lighter half. The two halves of Revan then merged together in peace and died for the final time, although, unbeknownst to everyone, the Sith Emperor had been resurrected and escaped into the galaxy. Following his death, Revan would be remembered by the galaxy for thousand of years, both as a legendary Jedi hero and one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Revan is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Revan thousands of years after his death and had the 3rd Legion of Sith Troopers named after him. Darth Revan was also originally set to appear in the episode \"Ghosts of Mortis\" of ''The Clone Wars'' TV show alongside Darth Bane, but they were both ultimately cut.\n\n==== Darth Momin ====\nDarth Momin (Momin) was a male Dark Lord of Sith, as well as a sculptor, who was imprisoned at a young age for ideas and aspirations. He was eventually rescued by a woman named Shaa, who trained him in the Dark Side of the Force and whom he eventually killed after believing that he had become more powerful than his master. Momin then built a superweapon to destroy an entire city and perished when the Jedi intervened to stop him, losing control over the energy he wielded and causing his physical body to be destroyed, leaving only his mask with his consciousness inside. Years later, the mask would be retrieved from the Jedi Archive vault by Darth Sidious, who gave it to his apprentice Darth Vader as a gift for his journey to [[Mustafar]], which Vader sought to make his personal stronghold. After Momin's mask killed some of his personnel, Vader examined it and learned of Momin's past, before letting him possess the body of a Mustafarian and build his fortress for him. Shortly after Momin finished the build of the fortress, Vader was distracted by an invasion of Mustafarians, which Momin took advantage of to open the door to the Dark Side and resurrect himself. However, after challenging Vader to a duel, Momin would soon meet his demise by being crashed against the wall with a giant rock. Despite Momin's death, his dark essence would remain in the mask for years to come and at one point the mask was located aboard the Imperial yacht ''Imperialis'', where it possessed the bodies of two thieves who attempted to rob the ship, forcing the others to abandon them and destroy the ship. Darth Momin appeared in the novel series ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', as well as the 4th issue of ''Lando''.\n\n==== Darth Bane ====\n[[Darth Bane]] (Dessel) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith, who was the sole survivor of Sith Order in the aftermath of the ancient war between the Jedi and the Sith, and later established the Rule of Two, which was considered the beginning of the modern Sith within the ''Star Wars'' canon. This rule stated that there must be only two Sith Lords at a time: a master to embody power, and an apprentice to crave it and eventually overthrow his/her master and adopt an apprentice of his/her own.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Bane|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/groups/sith/|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> He is the main character of the non-canonical ''Darth Bane'' Trilogy by Drew Karpyshyn.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Bane's only appearance was in the episode \"Sacrifice\" of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' TV show, where his spirit was encountered by Yoda on the Sith homeworld of [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Moraband|Moraband]], whom he unsuccessfully attempted to seduce to the Dark Side, as part of the Jedi Grand Master's trial to learn the power of immortality. Bane was also originally set to appear in the episode \"Ghosts of Mortis\" alongside Darth Revan, but they were both ultimately cut.\n\n==== Darth Tenebrous ====\n[[Darth Tenebrous]] (Rugess Nome) was a male [[Bith (Star Wars)|Bith]] Dark Lord of the Sith with the power of foreseeing the future, including his own death, and was the master of both Darth Plagueis and Darth Venamis, the latter of whom he kept secret as it was a violation of the Rule of Two. His public persona was Rugess Tome, a legendary artisanal starship designer with a galaxy-spanning reputation, and he was known for being a scientific genius and master planner, as well as for his breathing apparatus. Tenebrous' secret plan was to possess the Chosen One once he would appear, but he was eventually killed by Plagueis during a mission on the planet Ban'demnic. However, Tenebrous wasn't too surprised at Plagueis's betrayal and instead congratulated him with his dying breath, because his conscience would soon be able to enter his apprentice's body. Despite managing to cheat death, Tenebrous' plan failed, because, during his time in Plagueis' body, he foresaw him being killed by his own apprentice before the appearance of the Chosen One, meaning that Tenebrous would never be able to possess him. Tenebrous then tried to escape from Plagueis' body, but only saw the mummified remains of his original body, as decades had passed since his death. Thus, Tenebrous was cursed to remain a vague spirit for the rest of eternity, unable to gain a physical body ever again.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon continuity, Darth Tenebrous is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Tenebrous many years after his death and had the 26th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Plagueis ====\n[[Darth Plagueis]] (Hego Damask) was a male [[Muun]] Dark Lord of the Sith and master of Darth Sidious, first referenced in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith]]'' by Palpatine to Anakin Skywalker. Plagueis later appeared as the protagonist of the now-non-canonical ''Legends'' novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis]]''. He was the master of Darth Sidious, who claimed that Plagueis' abilities in the Force grew to such an extent that he could create life by influencing microscopic force-sensitive entities called \"midi-chlorians,\" and even save people from dying. According to the Rule of Two, Plagueis would eventually be killed by Sidious in his sleep, who subsequently became the new Sith Master and would later take on an apprentice of his own. The non-canonical novel reveals that Plagueis maintained a public influence as a member of the Intergalactic Banking Clan as Hego Damask, a benevolent Muun, until he was eventually killed in his sleep by Sidious. In ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', it is revealed that the Banking Clan was one of the various groups to ally themselves with the Separatist Alliance.\n\n==== Sith Lords in the films ====\n\n==== Darth Sidious ====\n[[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] (Sheev Palpatine) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith who appeared in each trilogy of the ''[[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga|Skywalker Saga]]''. Originally the eldest son of an aristocratic family from the planet [[Naboo]], he rose to power within the Galactic Republic's government system starting from Senator of his homeworld, then to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and finally to self-proclaimed Emperor of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. This was done by cultivating a public image as a humble and competent politician while secretly mastering dark Sith arts studying under Plagueis, and planning the destruction of the Jedi Order and Republic. Eventually, by manipulating disaffected political groups and using double agents to sow discord, Palpatine fomented a civil war that provided an opportunity for him to seize absolute power. He had three known Sith apprentices: Darth Maul, Darth Tyranus, and Darth Vader. He was eventually betrayed and killed<!--Do NOT use \"seemingly killed\" or related phrases; the source states Palpatine was indeed killed, and this is further confirmed in the 2019 film The Rise of Skywalker--> by his last, Vader, at the end of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious |title=Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious |website=[[Star Wars Databank]] |accessdate=January 26, 2020}}</ref> He returned more than 30 years later in ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'', having managed to cheat death through powerful mastery of the Dark Side of the Force.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-easter-eggs-callbacks-references |title=A Guide to All the Old Star Wars References in The Rise of Skywalker |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=January 11, 2020 |first1=Joanna |last1=Robinson |first2=Anthony |last2=Breznican |authorlink2=Anthony Breznican}}</ref> He is finally killed by his granddaughter [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], who deflected his Force lightning using the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker]] lightsabers. Darth Sidious' death marked what appears to be the definitive end of the Sith.\n\nIn ''Legends'' continuity, Darth Sidious would return using clones and ancient Sith powers, returning in several clone bodies over the course of several novels and comics. During this time he would briefly turn [[Luke Skywalker]] to the Dark Side of the Force through sheer power as much as by guile, though Luke would later be redeemed by his sister Leia and restored to the light side of the Force and defeated Palpatine once and for all. Shortly before his first death, Palpatine had sent a psychic command through the Force to [[Mara Jade]], planting in her the need to kill Luke. She eventually fulfilled this command by slaying a clone of Luke called Luuke Skywalker, whom Palpatine had made in an attempt to use him against the original, though this plot ultimately would fail due to Mara's fatal attack on the clone.\n\nIn the ''Infinities'' storylines, which take alternate paths from the original three films\u2014 one from a specific point in each of the first three films\u2014 Palpatine's rule is depicted as eventually coming to an end in various ways. In the first such alternate continuity\u2014 based on ''A New Hope''\u2014 Yoda uses the Death Star to slay the Emperor, who had by this point managed to turn Leia to the Dark Side, crashing the massive station into the Emperor's castle. In the second, based on the ''Empire Strikes Back'', Palpatine continues to rule the Empire, and his ultimate fate is unrevealed, as the story focuses on Leia becoming a Jedi in place of Luke, who had perished on Hoth. In the final story, set in an alternate timeline of ''Return of the Jedi'', Palpatine is defeated by the combined forces of Luke, Leia, and Darth Vader as the second Death Star is destroyed by the rebel forces, but he remains alive. As a result, Palpatine remained as emperor and the rebels, now joined by a redeemed Anakin Skywalker in a white version of the Darth Vader suit, continued their battle against him.\n\n==== Darth Maul ====\n[[Darth Maul]] (Maul) was a male [[Dathomirian]] [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] informal Dark Lord of the Sith who served as the first apprentice of Darth Sidious. He first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace]]'', in which Sidious sent him to find the escaped [[Queen Amidala]] and bring her back to Naboo to sign a treaty that would legalize the Trade Federation's invasion there. After tracking the Queen's personal starship to Tatooine, he briefly attacked [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], the Jedi sent to escort Amidala to Coruscant, near its landing zone until the latter escaped by leaping aboard. Later, Maul was sent back to Naboo to aid the Federation in their struggle to fight Amidala's counterattack, where he again battled Jinn and his Padawan [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in the plasma refinery complex beneath Theed Palace. Although the vicious Zabrak was able to kill Jinn, he fell to Kenobi when the Padawan used his master's lightsaber to slice Maul in half. Twelve years later, during the Clone Wars, his fellow nightbrother [[Savage Opress]] discovered Maul on the junk planet Lotho Minor, where he had been dumped after surviving the apparently fatal battle with Kenobi. Maul would use his strength with the Dark Side of the Force and anger against Kenobi to heal and rise again with a new pair of robotic legs. Years later, he would give up on his Sith persona, becoming simply Maul, and would go on to found the crime empire Crimson Dawn. After the Crimson Dawn's downfall, Maul would remain in exile on [[Malachor]] for years, until meeting young Jedi Padwan [[Ezra Bridger]] in the second season of ''Star Wars: Rebels'', whom he attempted to drift to the Dark Side. Although he failed, Maul was able to escape aboard a stolen [[TIE fighter|TIE Fighter]], and later returned in the third season of the show, looking to locate the long-absent Obi-Wan Kenobi. After tracking him down to [[Tatooine]], Maul engaged Kenobi in a brief duel, which resulted in the former Sith Lord's death. In his final moments, Maul finally let go of his hatred for Kenobi and showed a great respect for him, realizing that Kenobi was looking after the [[Luke Skywalker|boy]] he believed to be the Chosen One and would destroy the Sith.\n\n==== Darth Tyranus ====\n[[Darth Tyranus]] (Count Dooku) was a male human Sith Lord and the second apprentice of Darth Sidious. Dooku was a former Jedi Knight, trained by Grand Master Yoda and who took Qui-Gon Jin as his apprentice, but later became disillusioned by the rampant corruption within the Galactic Senate, realizing that immediate change was needed in order to maintain peace. He first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones]]'', which revealed that he had a prominent role in engineering the Clone Wars,<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Tyranus/Count Dooku|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/dooku/|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> recruiting [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]] to become the template for an army of clones to be used by the Galactic Republic. Dooku led the Separatist Alliance as its public figurehead during the Clone Wars until he met his demise while dueling Anakin Skywalker aboard the ''Invisible Hand'' in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith]]''. Unlike his predecessor, Darth Maul, Sidious never truly cared about Dooku and merely used him as a [[Puppet ruler|puppet]] to help him with his plans, having always wanted Skywalker as his next, real apprentice.\n\n==== Darth Vader ====\n[[Darth Vader]] (Anakin Skywalker) was a male human-cyborg Sith Lord and the third and final apprentice of Darth Sidious, who first appeared in the [[Star Wars#original trilogy|''Star Wars'' original trilogy]], and later in [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|the prequel trilogy]]. As the Jedi hero Anakin Skywalker, he fought alongside his master Obi-Wan Kenobi during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars, but was slowly seduced to the Dark Side by Darth Sidious. After helping Sidious kill Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]], he swore allegiance to the Sith and was given the name Darth Vader before setting out to destroy all Jedi left on Coruscant. After being sent by Sidious to assassinate the Separatist council members on Mustafar, Vader was badly injured in a duel with Kenobi, resulting in the loss of his remaining organic arm, both legs, and severe burn injuries. He was saved by Sidious, and encased in a black suit of armor with extensive cybernetics which kept him alive. As the Galactic Empire was established and continued to grow, Vader became the Emperor's immensely feared second-in-command and was given the task of finding surviving Jedi and the [[Rebel Alliance]]'s base. After the destruction of the [[Death Star|first Death Star]], Vader was charged with tracking down the Rebel Alliance and destroying their headquarters. However, the actions of his son, [[Luke Skywalker]], eventually turned Vader against his master, resulting in both Sidious' and Vader's deaths, as well as the fulfillment of the Chosen One prophecy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Vader|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/darthvader/|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Shadow Hands of the Sith ===\nAlthough not official Sith, several other Dark Side users in the service of the Sith were present during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] and the initial years of the Galactic Empire, prior to the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', where it was mentioned that Darth Vader and Darth Sidious were the only known Force-wielders at that time.\n\n==== Asajj Ventress ====\n[[Asajj Ventress]] was a female Dathomirian Sith Shadow Hand trained under Darth Tyranus and an antagonist of the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. She first appeared in the 2003 series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', in which Darth Sidious assigned her to kill the then-Padawan Anakin Skywalker. After tracking the young war hero to the planet Muunilinst, Ventress engaged Anakin's Republic fighter forces fighting above the Separatist-occupied world and baited him in a chase to [[Yavin IV]], where a fierce battle from the forest to the Massassi temple took place. Though she initially gained the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel, Anakin called upon his immense connection to the Force to brutally overpower her, causing the Dathomirian to fall over the edge of a cliff. She luckily survived the landing and continued to serve her master throughout the Clone Wars on several occasions. Some of which included helping form an alliance between the [[Toydarians]] and the Separatists until Yoda thwarted it, spying on Kamino in a Separatist plot to destroy the clone production facilities while stealing Jango Fett's DNA template, and freeing Trade Federation viceroy Nute Gunray from the custody of Luminara Unduli and Ahsoka Tano while fighting the two Jedi before ultimately succeeding in her mission. After being replaced with Savage Opress for her failures, Ventress returned to the Nightsisters until General Grievous led a massacre against them, which only she and Mother Talzin survived. From there, she helped [[Boba Fett]]'s team of bounty hunters on a dangerous mission, which thus marked the start of her own bounty hunting career. Ventres later appeared in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Dark Disciple]]'', which was intended for a story arc in the TV series. In the novel, she teamed up with Jedi [[Quinlan Vos]] to assassinate Count Dooku, and, along the way, the two fell in love. However, their attempt to kill Dooku failed, and Dooku captured Vos, turning him to the Dark Side. Ventress managed to turn Vos back, but died saving him from an angered Dooku and was later buried on Dathomir, amongst her fallen sisters.\n\n==== Savage Opress ====\n[[Savage Opress]] was a male Dathomirian [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] Sith Shadow Hand first trained under Darth Tyrannus and later under his own brother, Darth Maul, as well as a major antagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. Originally a Nightbrother under Mother Talzin on Dathomir, he was handpicked by Asajj Ventress as part of her scheme to kill Darth Tyrannus for the attempt on her life. His mind was eventually altered by the Nightsisters, making him more of a [[berserker]] on Ventress' call to the point of killing his brother Feral without remorse. Opress managed to become Tyrannus' new Shadow Hand and learned only a little about the ways of the Sith before Ventress had him help her fight their master due to his actions under him getting unwanted attention from the Jedi. However, in the heat of the moment and provoked by both of them, Opress tried to kill both Tyrannus and Ventress before escaping back to Dathomir. There, he was instructed by Mother Talzin to find Maul so that he could complete his training to defend himself against the numerous enemies he had made. After finding his long-lost brother as a shell of his former self on a junk planet, Opress managed to stir up Maul's grudge with Obi-Wan Kenobi to aid him in his revenge against the Jedi. From there, the Zabrak duo were able to set up a Confederacy against the Republic separate from the Separatists, and soon took over [[Mandalore]]. However, they received an unexpected visit by Darth Sidious, who considered Maul's sudden rise to power a threat to his rule, and dueled both him and Opress. The latter was fatally injured in the fight and died in Maul's arms, who would soon be defeated as well and captured by Sidious.\n\n==== Inquisitorius ====\nThe Inquisitors were an organization of Force-sensitive warriors in the service of the Galactic Empire prior to the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', where it is implied that they all became defunct, as Darth Vader and Darth Sidious were the only known Force-wielders at that time. Most of them were former Jedi, who had lost their faith in the Jedi Order and succumbed to the Dark Side, during or shortly after the Clone Wars. They were all recruited into the Empire and trained by Darth Vader, who tasked them with hunting down other survivors of the Jedi Purge, as well as other Force-sensitive individuals, mostly children, to prevent them from becoming future Jedi. Among the known Inquisitors were: \n*'''The Grand Inquisitor''' - the individual who would become known as the Grand Inquisitor was a former [[Pau'an]] Jedi Temple Guard. He was one of the several guards who escorted the fallen Jedi [[Barriss Offee|Barris Offee]] for her trial after the bombing of the Jedi Temple in the episode \"The Wrong Jedi\" of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]''. Offee's speech about the Jedi Order having lost its way due to the Clone Wars, in addition to the fact that the Jedi Council had mistaken [[Ahsoka Tano]] for the real culprit, eventually made him lose faith in the Jedi as well and embrace the Dark Side. He later came into service of the Empire and was one of the first-ever Inquisitors recruited to its cause, with the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'' showcasing his first encounter with Darth Vader in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Over the years, the Inquisitor worked his way up the Empire's ranks and eventually became the highest-ranking Inquisitor, being tasked (along with his subordinates) with hunting down Force-sensitive children across the galaxy and preventing them from becoming Jedi. The Grand Inquisitor first appeared as the main antagonist of the first season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was assigned to hunt down [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]]. He was eventually defeated by Kanan in combat and chose to commit suicide rather than face the infamous wrath of Darth Vader for his failure. A vision of the Grand Inquisitor in his old Jedi Temple Guard attire later appeared to Kanan in the Jedi Temple on [[Lothal (Star Wars)|Lothal]] and dueled him as part of his final trial to become a Jedi Knight.\n*'''The Second Sister''' - Trilla Suduri was the Padawan of Jedi Knight Cere Junda and one of the few survivors of the Great Jedi Purge. After Cere was captured and interrogated by the Empire, she betrayed Trilla's location, leading to her being captured and tortured by the Empire as well, until giving into the Dark Side and becoming the Second Sister Inquisitor. She initially made a [[cameo appearance]] in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', and later served as the main antagonist of the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'', where she was tasked with hunting Jedi Padawan [[Cal Kestis]], as well as a holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children. Although she succeeded in securing the holocron, she was eventually defeated by Kestis and Cere at the Inquisitor headquarters on the planet [[List of Star Wars planets and moons|Nur]]. Cere then attempted to make amends with her former Padawan, but Darth Vader appeared and killed Trilla for failing her mission.\n*'''The Fourth Sister''' - the Fourth Sister was a mysterious female Inquisitor, who was only alluded in the novel ''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle''. In the novel, the Fourth Sister is never actually seen in person, but rather only her armor, which was stolen by Rebel commander Lina Graf in order to pose as her and infiltrate Darth Vader's Fortress on Mustafar to rescue Lieutenant Thom Hudd. The Fourth Sister's fate is left ambiguous, as she could have been either captured or killed by the Rebels in order to steal her armor.\n*'''The Fifth Brother''' - the [[Fifth Brother (Star Wars)|Fifth Brother]] was a former green-skinned humanoid male member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost his faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was introduced in the second season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was shown to be working closely with the Seventh Sister, as they were both tasked with hunting the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]'' crew after the Grand Inquisitor's death, during which they also competed against each other to become the next Grand Inquisitor. The Fifth Brother was eventually defeated after dueling Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, Ahsoka Tano and Maul on [[Malachor]], being disarmed by Ahsoka and subsequently killed by Maul.\n*'''The Sixth Brother''' - Bil Valen was a former humanoid Jedi Knight who eventually lost his faith in the Jedi Order and became the Sixth Brother Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was described as tall with unnatural-looking grey skin, piercing ice-blue eyes, broad shoulders, and distinctive scar/tattoo-like marking, and was also shown to have lost an arm to Darth Vader during one of his training sessions. The Sixth Brother only appeared in novels, most prominently in ''Ahsoka'', where he was tasked with hunting Ahsoka Tano, but was ultimately defeated by her after she caused his lightsaber to overload and explode, killing him. His lightsaber would later be rebuilt by Ahsoka into two white ones, which she would use for years to come.\n*'''The Seventh Sister''' - the [[Seventh Sister (Star Wars)|Seventh Sister]] was a former female [[Mirialan]] member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost her faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. She was introduced in the second season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where she was shown to be using small droids to help her track down her targets, and was also working closely with the Fifth Brother, as they were both tasked with hunting the ''Ghost'' crew after the Grand Inquisitor's death, during which they also competed against each other to become the next Grand Inquisitor. The Seventh Sister was eventually defeated by Maul on Malachor and subsequently killed by him, after Ezra Bridger refused to do so.\n*'''The Eighth Brother''' - the [[Eighth Brother]] was a former male [[Terrelian Jango Jumper]] member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost his faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was introduced in the second season finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was tasked with hunting the former Sith Darth Maul, eventually tracking him down to Malachor. He dueled Maul, Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, and Ahsoka Tano alongside his fellow Inquisitors, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, but they were both ultimately killed by Maul. Cornered, the Eighth Brother then attempted to escape, but his lightsaber had been damaged in battle and exploded in his hands when trying to use it to fly away, causing him to fall to his death.\n*'''The Ninth Sister''' - Masana Tide was a former female [[Dowutin]] Jedi Knight who eventually succumbed to the Dark Side and became the Ninth Sister Inquisitor after intense torture at the hands of the Empire. She first appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where she assisted Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother and the Tenth Brother in hunting the Jedi Ferren Barr on the planet [[Mon Cala]]. After Barr used the Force to turn the Imperial stormtroopers present against them, the Ninth Sister was betrayed by the Sixth Brother, who severed her right foot and left her behind to die so that he could escape, although she managed to survive the ordeal as well. She later appeared as an antagonist in the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'', where she joined the Second Sister in the hunt for Cal Kestis. The Ninth Sister was ultimately defeated by the young Padawan on [[Kashyyyk]], who severed her right hand as well. However, she survived the ordeal once again and her fate is left ambiguous.\n*'''The Tenth Brother''' - Prosset Dibs was a former blind human Jedi Master during the Clone Wars who eventually became disillusioned by the Jedi's role as protectors of the galaxy. He first appeared in the novel ''Jedi of the Republic - Mace Windu'', where he was shown to have tried to kill [[Mace Windu]] during a mission on the planet Hissrich. He was subsequently put on trial and expelled from the Jedi Order for his actions. Dibs later became the Tenth Brother Inquisitor in the service of the Empire and appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where he assisted Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother and the Ninth Sister in hunting the Jedi Ferren Barr on the planet Mon Cala. After Barr used the Force to turn the Imperial stormtroopers present against them, the Tenth Brother was killed in the ensuing fight.\n*'''Unnamed red-skinned Inquisitor''' - An unnamed red-skinned female Inquisitor appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where she assisted Darth Vader, the Fifth Brother and another black-skinned [[Twi'lek]] Inquisitor in hunting Jedi Master [[Eeth Koth]]. While Vader dueled and killed Koth, the female Inquisitor found his wife and baby daughter, but refused to kill them, instead taking the latter and bringing her to Vader, who then left her in the care of some nursemaids. Later, the Fifth Brother informed Vader of her actions and, believing it to be an act of treason, he tried to kill her in front of the other Inquisitors. She managed to escape with the help of her fellow Twi'lek Inquisitor, but they were both eventually caught following a long chase through Coruscant and chose to commit suicide rather than be killed by Vader.\n*'''Unnamed Twi'lek Inquisitor''' - A black-skinned male [[Twi'lek]] Inquisitor appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where he assisted Darth Vader, the Fifth Brother and another red-skinned female Inquisitor in hunting Jedi Master Eeth Koth. Later, when Vader tried to kill the female Inquisitor for treason, he helped her escape, but they were both eventually caught following a long chase through Coruscant and chose to commit suicide rather than be killed by Vader.\n\n=== New Republic-era Dark Side wielders ===\nAlthough not official Sith, several Dark Side users were present in the years following the fall of the Galactic Empire and during the conflict between the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]].\n\n==== Snoke ====\n{{main|Supreme Leader Snoke}}\n\n[[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]] was an artificial being created by Darth Sidious and his [[Sith Eternal]] cult on [[Exegol]] prior to Palpatine's rise as the Emperor of the Galactic Empire. After Palpatine's death and the fall of the Empire, Snoke emerged as an enigmatic figure who became the Supreme Leader of the First Order and seduced [[Kylo Ren]] to the Dark Side, training him to become his apprentice. Snoke first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), where he ordered Ren and the rest of the First Order to find a map that would lead them to [[Luke Skywalker]], the last remaining Jedi; Snoke was responsible for the destruction of Luke's Jedi Order, summoning a massive dark storm that destroyed Luke's Jedi Temple and all its inhabitants, but Luke himself survived and went into exile, leaving behind only a map as a way to be tracked down. Snoke later sensed an \"awakening\" in the Force, in the form of the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the secret granddaughter of Palpatine, who formed a unique Force dyad with Ren. After Ren was defeated by Rey in a lightsaber duel and the Resistance destroyed [[Starkiller Base]], Snoke ordered [[General Hux]] to bring Ren to him, to complete his training.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', Snoke reprimanded Hux for his failure as a military leader, following a failed attack on the Resistance's base on [[D'Qar]], and Ren for his failure to find and kill Luke Skywalker, doubting his destiny to succeed Darth Vader. Ren later brought Rey to Snoke, who tortured her for information on Luke's location. He also revealed to Ren and Rey that he had created the psychic bond between them as part of a plan to destroy Luke himself. Snoke then ordered Ren to kill Rey, but he instead sliced Snoke in half, killing him on the spot. Ren and Rey then worked together to overpower Snoke's Praetorian Guards before Rey escaped. Shortly after, Ren pinned Snoke's death on her and declared himself the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. In ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]'', Ren met the resurrected Emperor Palpatine on Exegol, who revealed to him that he had created Snoke as a [[Puppet ruler|puppet]] to lure Ren to the Dark Side and control the First Order. Ren also observed several clones of Snoke at Palpatine's lair, but Snoke had already served his purpose and therefore Palpatine had no further use for them.\n\n==== Kylo Ren ====\n{{main|Kylo Ren}}\n\n[[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]] was the son of Rebel Alliance heroes [[Leia Organa]] and [[Han Solo]]. As the grandson of Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, Solo was powerful with the Force from birth and was trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker alongside numerous other Jedi, in an attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order. However, Ben was slowly manipulated by Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the First Order and a powerful master of the Dark Side of the Force, who made him believe that it was his destiny to succeed Darth Vader and finish what he started: wipe out the Jedi Order. Thus, after Luke sensed the darkness inside him and attempted to kill him in his sleep, Ben turned to the Dark Side, adopting the '''Kylo Ren''' persona, and, following the destruction of Luke's Jedi Order (due to a mysterious dark storm destroying Luke's Jedi Temple and all its inhabitants), joined a mysterious organization of Force-wielding warriors called the Knights of Ren. He eventually killed their leader and replaced him, becoming the new leader of the Knights of Ren, and later a high-ranking commander within the First Order as well. However, unknown to Ren, Luke survived the destruction of his temple and, blaming himself for Ben's fall to the Dark Side, went into exile on [[Ahch-To]]. Ren eventually learned of his uncle's survival and sought to destroy him and the Jedi Order once and for all.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', Ren led an attack on a village on [[Jakku]] in the search of a map that would lead the First Order to Luke, and captured Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]], who secretly gave the map to his droid [[BB-8]], which was eventually found by the scavenger Rey. Although Ren learned of this after interrogating Poe with the Force, the latter was liberated by the rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], who eventually found BB-8 and Rey and they all escaped from Jakku aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', along the way joining up with Ren's father Han Solo and [[Chewbacca]], who agreed to take them to [[Takodana]], from where they could hand BB-8 over to the Resistance. However, Ren soon learned of this and led another attack on Takodana to retrieve BB-8. Although he failed and the First Order was chased away by the Resistance, Ren instead captured Rey, having sensed that she saw the map, and took her away for interrogation on Starkiller Base. However, Ren failed to extract the information from her and his interrogation instead unlocked her Force abilities. Ren later killed his father to prove his allegiance to the Dark Side and was defeated by Rey in a lightsaber duel, before being forced to evacuate due to the Resistance destroying Starkiller Base.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', Ren tried to prove himself to Snoke after being defeated by Rey by leading the attack on the Resistance fleet, although he hesitated to kill his mother. He also formed a special Force connection with Rey, through which he revealed to her how Luke had tried to kill him on the night that he turned to the Dark Side, leading Rey to come to confront Ren, believing that there is still good in him. Ren brought Rey before Snoke, who ordered him to kill her, but he instead killed Snoke and then worked with Rey to defeat his Praetorian Guards. Ren offered Rey to rule the galaxy alongside him and detach herself from the past, claiming that her parents were nobodies, but after she refused, they fought over possession of Luke's lightsaber, which Rey had been using, leading to it being destroyed and Rey escaping. Ren then pinned Snoke's death on Rey and declared himself as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, before leading an attack on the remains of the Resistance on Crait. After Luke showed up to confront Ren and give the Resistance enough time to escape, Ren fought him, only to discover him to be a Force projection. As Ren screamed in anger, Luke died peacefully on Ahch-To, having used all his remaining energy to project himself on Crait, and the remains of the Resistance escaped aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]'', Ren tracked down the resurrected Emperor Palpatine to Exegol with the intent of killing him, as he considered him a threat to his reign, but instead learned that Palpatine had been the mastermind behind Snoke all along and had manipulated him to join the Dark Side. Palpatine then revealed the Final Order \u2014 an armada of [[Star Destroyer]]s equipped with canons capable of decimating entire planets \u2014 and offered Ren control of the fleet, thus giving him the means necessary of claiming the galaxy for himself, in exchange for killing his granddaughter, revealed to be none other than Rey. Although Ren accepted, he secretly planned to have Rey join him, so that together they could kill Palpatine and then rule the galaxy together. Ren then managed to track down Rey and her friends to [[Pasaana]] through their Force connection and their confrontation led to Rey using Force lightning to destroy a First Order transporter, which she believed [[Chewbacca]] had been taken prisoner on. Later, Rey and her friends infiltrated Ren's Star Destroyer above [[Kijimi]] to rescue Chewbacca after learning that he was still alive, and Ren was once again able to locate Rey through their connection, leading to another confrontation, during which Ren informed her of being Palpatine's granddaughter. Eventually, Rey and Ren dueled on the ocean moon [[Kef Bir]], where the ruins of the [[second Death Star]] were located, during which Leia used her last remaining energy to reach out to his son, in an attempt to redeem him, before dying. Distracted, Ren was defeated and fatally injured by Rey, but having sensed Leia's death as well, she quickly used Force heal to treat his injury and then left. Initially confused and conflicted, Ren had a Force vision of his father, similar to the moment when he killed him, but this time Solo convinced his son to abandon the Dark Side and his Kylo Ren persona, redeeming himself and becoming Ben Solo once again. Ben then came to Exegol to help Rey fight Palpatine, killing the Knights of Ren in the process, but the Emperor sensed the unique Force dyad that the two of them formed and sucked the life energy from them to rejuvenate himself and become the most powerful being in the galaxy. However, Rey was able to summon the spirits of all the past Jedi and kill Palpatine, but died in the process. Ben then used all his remaining life energy to revive her and they shared a kiss, before Ben collapsed to the ground, dying peacefully and becoming one with the Force.\n\n==== Knights of Ren ====\nThe Knights of Ren were an organization of masked Force-wielding warriors, who were neither Sith or Jedi, but a new generation of Dark Side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the supposed demise of the last Sith Lords, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. They had a code, to which they were flexible in the following: living life the way they wanted, taking what the galaxy gave them, and consuming what the Dark Side sent them. Their name came from a lightsaber called \"Ren\", which was at the base of their code and could only be wieled by their leader. The Knights consisted of six individuals named '''Vicrul''', '''Ap'lek''', '''Cardo''', '''Kuruk''', '''Trudgen''', and '''Ushar''', and, prior to the destruction of Luke Skywalker's new Jedi Order, they were led by another individual known simply as \"'''Ren'''\". Some of the Knights were students of Luke, who, similarly to their future leader, Kylo Ren, had lost their faith in the Jedi and succumbed to the Dark Side. Eventually, after the destruction of Luke's New Jedi Order (although Luke himself survived and went into exile), Ben Solo fell to Dark Side, before contacting the Knights with the intent of joining them. Eventually, Ben killed Ren and replaced him as the new leader of the Knights of Ren, adopting the name \"Kylo Ren\". The Knights first appeared in a vision to Rey in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', but played a more important role in ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''. After Kylo Ren became the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, the Knights became his personal guards and began following him more closely. When Kylo formed an alliance with the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, who ordered him to kill his granddaughter Rey, the Knights of Ren joined him in his hunt for her and were present during their confrontation on [[Pasaana]], where they captured [[Chewbacca]]. Later, after Kylo redeemed himself and became Ben Solo once again, the Knights instead swore their loyalty to Palpatine and served as his guards during the final Battle of Exegol, where they were all slaughtered by Ben, marking the end of the Knights of Ren.\n\n=== ''Legends'' non-canonical members of the Sith ===\n{{Main|Star Wars canon|Star Wars expanded universe|}}\nFollowing the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], Lucasfilm rebranded most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels, comics, and other fictional media published since the [[Star Wars (film)|original 1977 film]] (previously identified as the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe) as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared them [[Star Wars canon|non-canonical to the franchise]] in April 2014.<ref name=\"SW Adult\">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Sith feature heavily in many stories of the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe (EU), appearing in a variety of media created prior to the advent of the 2015 feature film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.<ref>Ars Technica Op-ed: Disney takes a chainsaw to the Star Wars expanded universe, 1/10/2014</ref> Future authors and screenwriters are not required to honor all of the events depicted in this material, but the Expanded Universe has remained a source of creative inspiration. The EU thoroughly details the schism between the dissident \u201cDark Jedi\u201d and the Jedi establishment that led to the creation of the Sith Order, as well a series of conflicts between the Sith, Jedi and the Galactic Republic spanning the millennia prior to the events of the ''Star Wars'' motion picture series, and certain events thereafter.\n\nIn the EU, the Sith trace their origins to the followers of a dissident Jedi named Ajunta Pall, who endorsed the use of the Dark Side of the Force, contrary to Jedi orthodoxy.<ref>Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side</ref> After Pall and his \u201cDark Jedi\u201d followers were exiled for their practices, they eventually settled on a planet named Korriban, which was occupied by the \"Sith,\" a red-skinned humanoid race with a high prevalence of Force-sensitives. Over the course of centuries of intermingling between the ethnic Sith and Dark Jedi, the name \"Sith\" would come to apply to the martial philosophy and political affiliation created by the former Jedi exiles on Korriban, rather than a specific race. This Sith regime would strike out at the Galactic Republic and Jedi on numerous occasions. Notable conflicts between the Sith and the Galactic Republic include the \"Great Hyperspace War,\" in which the Sith would launch a massive invasion of the Republic but succumb to infighting, and the \u201cSith Holocaust,\u201d in which the Galactic Republic failed in its attempt to exterminate the Sith from known space, leading the Sith survivors to take a vow of eternal vengeance on the Galactic Republic. The EU also describes the exploits of Sith characters following the collapse of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire and the restoration of the Republic, such as the attempt by \u201cDarth Krayt\u201d to establish a New Sith Order on Korriban.\n\nThe first Expanded Universe novel was ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', written by [[Alan Dean Foster]] and published in 1978. The setting for the novel takes place between ''[[Star Wars (film)|Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]''. It provides a new adventure that includes [[Princess Leia]], [[R2-D2]], [[C-3PO]], [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Darth Vader]]. In the story, Darth Vader tries to get the Kyber Crystal to use it for his evil schemes.\n\nOther novels that depict Sith characters are ''[[Darth Maul: Saboteur]]'' and ''[[Cloak of Deception]]'' by [[James Luceno]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Luceno|first=James|title=Star Wars: Cloak of Deception|year=2002|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79570-0}}</ref> ''Cloak of Deception'' describes the political background surrounding the Republic in the time period before ''The Phantom Menace'', as well as Darth Sidious' plans to rule the galaxy, starting with the blockade of Naboo.\nIn ''Darth Maul: Saboteur'', the Sith Lord Darth Sidious sends Darth Maul to destroy InterGalactic Ore and Lommite Limited.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luceno|first=James|title=Darth Maul:Saboteur|year=2001|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-44735-7}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter]]'', by [[Michael Reaves]], Darth Sidious sends his apprentice, Darth Maul, to investigate the traitor who leaked the secret of his plan to take down the Republic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reaves|first=Michael|title=Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter|url=https://archive.org/details/darthmaulshadowh00reav|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Ballantine Publishing Group|isbn=0-345-43541-9}}</ref> ''Shadow Hunter'' provided insight into the Sith while detailing how Darth Sidious brought his plan of usurpation into action.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] purchased the copyrights to several Star Wars stories.<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Company/Timeline|work=www.darkhorse.com|publisher=Dark Horse|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> With their publication of ''Star Wars: Dark Empire #1'' in 1991, they initiated what has become a large line of ''Star Wars'' manga and comics.<ref name=\"Lavin 1998\">{{cite journal|last=Lavin|first=Michael R.|title=A Librarian's Guide to Dark Horse Comics|journal=Serials Review|year=1998|volume=24|issue=3/4}}</ref> The Sith appear as major antagonists throughout this story's plot.<ref name=\"Lavin 1998\" /> Many of the comics that were published helped expand the backstory of the characters and followed the rise and fall of the Dark Lords of the Sith.<ref name=\"Lavin 1998\" />\n\nStar Wars video games have also been adapted from the plots of the films, novels, and TV shows. The games follow the basic plot of the story, but they can also include alternative, non-canonical, endings depending on which character is being played. Some of the video games that have a heavy focus on Sith characters and lore are ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', released in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/pc-16512|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref> ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords]]'', released in 2004<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords/pc-608569|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'', released in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: The Force Unleashed|url=http://www.lucasarts.com/games/theforceunleashed/|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===== Darth Caedus =====\n[[Jacen Solo|Darth Caedus]] (Jacen Solo) was a Dark Lord of the Sith born as the oldest son of [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa Solo]]. A Jedi hero of the Yuuzhan Vong War, he eventually fell to the Dark Side years later and masterminded the Second Galactic Civil War. He was eventually killed by his twin sister Jaina for his actions.\n\n===== Marka Ragnos =====\n[[Marka Ragnos]] was an ancient Sith-human hybrid Sith Lord, who lived during the time of the first Sith Empire, and seized the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, serving as the ruler of the Empire. After his death, two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, fought to occupy his throne, only for Ragnos' spirit to appear before them and claim that only the most worthy should succeed him. Ragnos lived on as a Force spirit following his death, trapped within his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. A thousand years after the Dark Lord's death, Exar Kun summoned Ragnos from his grave through the use of talismans. Ragnos crowned Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord, with Ulic Qel-Droma as Kun's apprentice, as an attempt to resurrect the lost empire thousands of years prior. Several thousands of years after that, in the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'' (set during the New Republic era), a cult dedicated to Ragnos, led by the Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis, raised as a new threat to the galaxy, with the intent of resurrecting the Sith Lord using an old artifact called the Scepter of Ragnos. After absorbing Froce energy from numerous locations across the galaxy using the scepter, Tavion and her cult traveled to Korriban and almost succeeded in resurrecting Ragnos, but were stopped by Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. Inside Ragnos' tomb, the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr defeated Tavion, before Ragnos' spirit emerged and possessed her body, attempting to kill the Jedi. However, Jaden was able to defeat Ragnos, whose spirit left Tavion's body and returned to the depths of the Force, swearing revenge against the Jedi.\n\n===== Darth Venamis =====\nDarth Venamis was a Bith Dark Lord of the Sith who served as Darth Tenebrous' secret apprentice, as it was a violation of the Rule of Two. After Tenebrous was killed by his other apprentice, Darth Plagueis, he eventually found and defeated Venamis, before capturing him and using him as a test subject for his midi-chlorians experiments over the following years. After decades of torture and being killed and then brought back to life over and over again, Plaugeis finally allowed Venamis to die, having served his purpose. However, he later revived again in the presence of his new apprentice, Darth Sidious, until Venamis' organs finally ceased to function, and he died for the final time.\n\n==== ''Knights of the Old Republic'' series Sith Lords ====\n\n===== '''Darth Malak''' =====\n[[Darth Malak]] (Alek) is the main antagonist of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. Once a Jedi Knight and Revan's best friend, the two of them fought together in the Mandalorian Wars. At some point, Malak was injured in battle and had his entire lower jaw cut off, forcing him to don a prosthetic jaw instead. Later, Malak and Revan unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire in the Unknown Regions and were captured by the Sith Emperor, who, using Sith sorcery, turned them to the Dark Side, but the two broke free from hisr control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Malak as his Sith Apprentice. When Revan prepared to battle the Jedi who boarded his flagship, Malak betrayed him, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge, so that he could take over the Sith Empire for himself. However, Revan survived the ordeal and was taken to the Jedi Council Enclave, where he had his memory wiped, so that he would become a Jedi once again. Eventually, Revan faced off against Malak, who revealed the truth of his identity, but was ultimately killed in battle by his former friend and Sith Master, which also led to the downfall of his Empire.\n\n=====Darth Traya=====\n[[Darth Traya]] (Kreia) is a mentor to the \"Jedi Exile\" in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords]]''.<ref name=\"Meet Your Team\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/569/569765p1.html |title=KOTOR 2: Meet Your Team |author=Hilary Goldstein |date=30 November 2004 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"gsinterview2\">{{cite video |date=8 May 2004 |title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Developer Interview 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/video/920194/6096604/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-developer-interview-2 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> She is revealed to have been a Sith Master at the end of the game, and is ultimately killed in battle.\n\n===== Darth Sion =====\n[[Darth Sion]], also known as the Lord of Pain, is an antagonist in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords]]''. Alongside Darth Nihilus, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Sion managed to achieve immortality by calling on his pain, anger and hatred every time he was facing certain death, at the expense of all-consuming agony, which also led to his extremely disfigured appearance. The player's character eventually defeated Sion, and was then given the option to turn him back to the light side. Regardless, upon being shown the price he paid for immortality, Sion finally let go of his hate and allowed himself to die permanently.\n\n===== Darth Nihilus =====\n[[Darth Nihilus]], also known as the Lord of Hunger, is an antagonist in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords]]''. Alongside Darth Sion, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Nihilus imbued his dark soul into his mask and robes and had the power to drain the life force out of any living thing. Following the betrayal of his master, Nihilus used the might of the Sith Armada not to conquer planets, but to contain them so that he could \"feed\" off the Force energy of each planet's lifeforms, wiping planets of life. However, Nihilus was later drawn out and tricked into launching an attack on Telos, believing it to contain the last Jedi. The Exile confronted Nihilus on his ship, and Nihilus was killed either after his former slave Visas sacrificed herself due to their shared link in the Force, or after his attempt to feast on the Exile's connection to the Force backfired and weakened him. Despite his death, Nihilus' soul would continue to live in his mask and robes for millennia to come, as well as inside his own Sith holocron.\n\n=====Lord Vitiate=====\nKnown for much of his 1300-year life as \"the Sith Emperor\", Lord Vitiate was a sociopathic young lord in one of the earliest iterations of the Sith Empire. When that empire fell, he led an exodus of survivors to the other side of the galaxy to establish a continuation of it, with himself as Emperor. It was Vitiate who corrupted Revan and Malak, but Revan's redemption and Malak's defeat seemingly derailed his plans. Three hundred years after Revan's disappearance, the Emperor launched a surprise attack on the Republic, setting the stage for the video game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''.\n\n===== Vindican =====\nVindican was a male Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of the Sith species itself, who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. He was the master of Darth Malgus and, alongside him, joined the Sith Empire fleet on the attack of a Republic fleet over Korriban, with the intent of retaking the planet from the Jedi. Aboard the cruiser, Vindican and Malgus dueled a Zabrak Jedi Master named Kao Cen Darach and his apprentice, Satele Shan, but the latter managed to escape, and Vindican was severely injured by Darach. After killing him, Malgus looked down upon his fallen master and, in an act true to the Rule of Two, executed him with his own lightsaber, thus becoming the new Sith Master.\n\n===== Darth Malgus =====\n[[Darth Malgus]] (Veradun) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith and apprentice to Vindican, who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. Following the recapture of Korriban from the Jedi, Malgus killed his master and later led a surprise assault on Alderaan, only to be defeated by his nemesis and former opponent from Korriban, Satele Shan. Malgus was severely injured in the fight against Shan, forcing him to wear a respiratory apparatus for the rest of his life. Some time later, Malgus was tasked by his superior, Darth Angral, with leading an assault team on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, which Malgus and his forces destroyed, disgracing the Jedi Order in the eyes of the Republic. Although Malgus believed that the battle of Coruscant was the first step of destroying the Republic, it only served as leverage in the peace negotiations that took place on Alderaan. While the Alderaanian summit progressed, the Sith settled into an occupation of Coruscant. Malgus was placed in charge of orbital security, but the Sith Lord defied his orders and traveled back to Coruscant's surface to strike against the renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, who wanted to avenge her master Ven Zallow, whom Malgus killed during the attack on the Jedi Temple. Although Leneer ultimately failed, the conflict caused Malgus to become disillusioned with the Empire and to kill his lover Eleena Daru, seeing their relationship as a weakness that prevented him from preserving his own power, which he later used to cleanse the Empire of the politicians whom he blamed for allowing the Republic to survive. During the Cold War years that followed the successful peace negotiations, Malgus led Sith forces into the Unknown Regions, claiming previously-unknown territories for the Empire. Towards the end of the war, following the presumed death of the Sith Emperor and after serving on the Dark Council, Malgus declared his own Empire, free of the infighting of the Dark Council. However, the Republic and the Sith Empire forces soon teamed up to fight against Malgus' Empire and managed to track him down to his secret base he was tracked down to his secret base, where he was defeated. Despite his presumed death, Malgus later resurfaced during the Invasion of Ossus at the start of the Third Galactic War, once again serving as a commander within the Sith Empire. However, following the Battle of Corellia, Malgus went rogue, determined to expunge all physical and mental restraints used to keep him under control. Thousands of years after his death, Malgus was still remembered as one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived, with Darth Sidious even retrieving some surviving excerpts of Malgus's journals from an antiquities dealer and bounding them into his ''Book of Sith'', an anthology of Sith historical writings.\n\n===Sith Eternal===\nThe 2019 film ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' depicts thousands of Sith cultists and loyalists known as the '''Sith Eternal'''.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/12/21/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-exegol-sith-planet-wayfinder-explained |title=Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker's Hidden Planet Explained |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=21 December 2019 |accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref> They are located on the Sith planet [[Exegol]], which is described in the film as the \"hidden world of the Sith\".<ref name=\"Slate\"/> The film depicts the Sith loyalists as having built a secret armada of [[Star Destroyer]]s, known as the Final Order, at the behest of [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] (Darth Sidious).

Transfer of power is conducted through state-sanctioned assassinations: when a '''Sith Lord''' grows complacent, begins to show weakness, and is eventually killed, their property and authority are transferred to the apprentice who killed them. Robberies, betrayal, and sabotage are commonplace; murder is acceptable so long as the culprit is not caught. This kraterocratic system ensures that Sith society nurtures some of the most vicious and competitive individuals in the galaxy and is only governed by those strong enough to seize control.\n\nSith philosophy lionizes conflict as a [[catalyst]] for growth and as a tool for [[purge|purging]] the unworthy. Sith academies were structured with rules, lectures, and classes, with an underlying \"kill or be killed\" mentality amongst the apprentices. Sith emphasize \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" and view [[Self-control|restraint]] as a weakness. Members adhere to [[master morality]], are characterized by the desire to seize power by any means necessary, leveraging force (both physical and supernatural), social maneuvering, and political cunning to their advantage. The Sith cultivate a connection to the Dark Side of [[the Force]], which provides them with easy access to superhuman power and arcane knowledge; however, the trade-off is the severe cost of adopting a [[dark triad]] personality that corrodes their basic capacity for empathy, kindness, and love.\n\nThroughout ''Star Wars'' media and in popular culture, the Sith are infamous as the dualistic antagonists to the [[Jedi]], an affiliation of altruistic warriors who strive to use their own martial training and connection to the \"light side\" of the Force to promote peace and the common welfare throughout the galaxy. To counteract the Jedi's benevolent influence, Sith were responsible for secretly instigating many small regional conflicts as part of their larger plan to destabilize the Republic and eventually take control of the galaxy. Hiding from the shadows, their fingerprints are everywhere, in every conflict in the galaxy, and their subversive influence reaches far and wide. Over their long history, the Sith have established great empires, come close to realizing their ambitions of galactic conquest, and nearly eradicated the Jedi. Ultimately, however, they are self-defeating, their grand plans undone time and again by internal strife, rebellion inspired by their vicious tactics, and the psychologically noxious effects of their dark arts and philosophy.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''Sith'' was first used in the 1974 rough draft of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/the-star-wars-rough-draft/|title=Roughdraft|work=StarWarz.com}}</ref> with the first published use being the 1976 [[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|novelization of ''Star Wars'']] as a title for the key villain [[Darth Vader]], the \"Dark Lord of the Sith\". Sith characters had also been portrayed as such in some non-canonical [[Star Wars\u00a0expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Legends]] works prior to the release of ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', and in archived footage for the original ''Star Wars''.<ref>Dark Horse Comics, ''[[Dark Empire]]''</ref>  Prior to the formal introduction of the Sith, the term \"Dark Jedi\" was sometimes used for characters who would be later identified as Sith, or had goals and practices similar to the Sith. In his novel series ''[[The Thrawn Trilogy]]'', author [[Timothy Zahn]] labeled Sith Lord Darth Vader and Emperor [[Palpatine]] as \"Dark Jedi\", and the term \"Sith\" was never mentioned in the series until later reprints of the novels. \"Dark Jedi\" is also the name given in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] to [[antihero]] fictional characters attuned to [[the Force]] and adept in its Dark Side. However, the concept of \"Dark Jedi\" is not referenced anywhere in any of the theatrical ''Star Wars'' films, and they exist by that name only in non-canonical ''Star Wars'' Legends media, including video games such as ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (series)|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight (series)|Star Wars: Jedi Knight]]'' series. The Sith were not mentioned by name in canonical stories until the prequel trilogy used the word on film starting with 1999's ''[[The Phantom Menace]]''.\n\n===Influences===\n{{Main|Star Wars sources and analogues|Star Wars#Themes}}\n\n[[George Lucas]] acknowledged that the [[Jedi]], Sith, and other [[the Force|Force]] concepts have been inspired by many sources. These include: [[knighthood]], [[chivalry]], [[paladin]]ism, [[samurai]] [[bushido]], [[Shaolin Monastery]], [[Feudalism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Qigong]], [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]] and [[Roman mythology|mythology]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shint\u014d]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], and numerous cinematic precursors.  The works of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of ''Star Wars''.<ref name=\"swmyth\">{{cite web | url=http://www.films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm | title=The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers | publisher=Films Media Group | work=films.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |title=Star Wars @ NASM, Unit 1, Introduction Page |publisher=Nasm.si.edu |date=1999-01-31 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408195115/http://nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |archivedate= 8 April 2010 |df= }}</ref>  In particular, the contrasting narrative relationship between the Dark Side-using Sith and light side-using Jedi mirrors several modern and classical literary tropes.\n\nMost prominently, the conflict between the Sith and Jedi employs the classic trope of [[Black-and-white dualism|black and white moral dualism]]\u2014an elemental contrast between evil (the \"darkness\") and good (the \"light\") first postulated and elaborated in Zoroastrianism during the 5th century BCE from which the core mythos of Star Wars is much influenced.<ref>Featurette \"The Chosen One\", Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD</ref>  The ongoing struggle of the humanistic \"light side\"-affiliated Jedi to permanently defeat the egoistic \"Dark Side\"-affiliated Sith is framed not only as a contest of values, but as a deep metaphysical conflict: The Dark Side of the Force is viewed by the Jedi, and generally represented within ''Star Wars'' media, as not only a dangerous expedient but as a form of existential corruption which must be purged for the universe, or a person, to attain spiritual balance.<ref>{{web cite|url=https://andphilosophy.com/2017/03/13/the-paradox-of-the-force-the-quest-for-balance-in-star-wars/|title=The Paradox of The Force in Star Wars|website=AndPhilosophy.com}}</ref>  Jedi are often depicted as imperfect individuals, but their cause of selfless heroism is ultimately on the right side of an inexorable cosmic struggle against evil, embodied in the power-hungry Sith and the Dark Side of the Force.\n\nThe dualistic relationship between the Sith' and the Jedi' concepts of \"purity\" mirrors the philosophical and literary concept of \"[[Apollonian and Dionysian]]\": the Jedi are portrayed as embracing [[Purity in Buddhism|purity]], reason, temperance, altruism and other [[Humanism|humanistic virtues]]; the Sith, by contrast, embrace curiosity, emotion, conflict, power, instincts, unfettered self-interest and other [[Hedonism|hedonistic vices]].  However, whereas the classic Greek concept did not necessarily view the Apollonian and Dyonisian principles as opposed, ''Star Wars'' frames the Jedi and Sith as opponents in a dire moral struggle, with the Sith cast as corrupted villains apparently destined to defeat or self-destruction in the end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-who-is-the-chosen-one/|title=Star Wars: Who Is The Chosen One?|website=SlashFilm.com}}</ref>  Although a path to temporary power, the Sith way inevitably leads to ruin.\n\nWithin the ''Star Wars'' narrative, the Jedi and Sith naturally have different self-understandings. In Sith rhetoric, the relationship between the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith closely mirrors Nietzsche's concept of [[master\u2013slave morality]].  Sith value \"master\" virtues, such as pride and power, whereas the Jedi value altruistic virtues like kindness and empathy.  The goal of the Sith is tangible greatness: the ability to shape and destroy the world according to one's will alone.  The goal of the Jedi is moral goodness: freedom from inner, and outer, turmoil and suffering.  However, the Sith consider the Jedi's aspirations to be either hopeless or pathetic.  To the Sith, greater power is the only authentic goal.\n\n==Development==\nOriginally, George Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] in the same way that the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' had served [[Adolf Hitler]]. In developing the backstory for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|title=The Secret History of Star Wars|edition=3.0|year=2008|origyear=2007|publisher=Legacy Books Press|isbn=978-0-9784652-3-0|page=184}}</ref>\n\n===Fictional backstory===\nThe Sith are dedicated to the \"Sith Code\" and to mastering the Dark Side of the Force.<ref name=\"sw-en\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/groups/sith/|title=Sith, Star Wars Encyclopedia|work=StarWars.com|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> The Sith Code identifies conflict as the fundamental dynamic of reality, and holds that the search for lasting peace, within or without, is both quixotic and misguided.  Rather, Sith embrace strife and [[Passions (philosophy)|dark passion]] as salutary and emancipatory forces, as they believe that violent struggle purges the decadent and weak, and that emotions such as aggression and hate provide the strength and resolve to secure freedom through victory.  Although Sith seek dominion, Sith philosophy stresses that power belongs only to those with the strength, cunning, and ruthlessness to maintain it, and thus \"betrayal\" among the Sith is not a vice but an endorsed norm.  Accordingly, the Sith reject altruism, self-abnegation and kindness, as they regard such attitudes as founded on delusions that fetter one's perceptions and power.  In connection with their philosophy, the Sith draw on the Dark Side of the Force through severe negative emotions, a technique antipodal to that of their archenemies, the Jedi, who rely on the Force's \"light side,\" i.e., the Force as experienced through disciplined states of quietude and compassion.  Notably, both the Jedi and Sith shun romantic and familial love, as the Jedi fear such love will lead to attachment, and thus selfishness, and the Sith fear it will compromise their ruthlessness and connection to the Dark Side of the Force.  \nAlthough the Sith are intimately linked to the Dark Side, not every user of the Dark Side is a Sith, nor is every user of the light side a Jedi.\n  \n{{quote|text=Yes, a Jedi\u2019s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.

As portrayed in all ''Star Wars''-related media, the Dark Side provides users with powers similar to those of the light side-using Jedi, but as it leverages passion and violence, its use is enhanced by negative raw and aggressive emotions and instinctual feelings such as anger, greed, hatred, and rage. By deciding to learn the ways of the Dark Side of the Force, the Sith may also acquire powers and abilities considered by some in the ''Star Wars'' universe to be unnatural.<ref>Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith</ref> A notable example is a form of directed dielectric breakdown called \"Force Lightning,\" infamously used by the Sith Lord [[Darth Sidious]] to torture Jedi-initiate and rebel Luke Skywalker. Darth Sidious claimed that his own master, Darth Plagueis, could even use the Force to avert the natural deaths of those whose lives he wished to save. Being uninhibited in their use of the Force, Sith could also repurpose abilities shared with the Jedi, such as telekinesis, to new and terrifying effect: [[Darth Vader]] was infamous for his use of telekinetic strangulation, or \"Force Choke,\" as a means of execution or intimidation.\n\n{{quote|text=Beneath anger is always fear. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you. Train yourself to let go everything you fear to lose.|title=''[[The Phantom Menace]]''|character=[[Yoda]]}}\n\nExtended indulgence in the Dark Side reshapes the user's psychology, resulting in a loss of humanity, morality, empathy, and the ability to love, leaving every Sith, to varying degrees, amoral, cruel, sadistic and violent. Considering this dark change in personality to be a transformation into a different person altogether, some who turn to the Dark Side take on a different name, as they regard their former persona as dead and destroyed. Sith Lords in particular adopt a new name upon their initiation into the Order, prefixing it with the title '''Darth''' (e.g., \"Darth Vader\").  Severe saturation in the Dark Side may even lead to physical degradation.  Although Sith are deeply affected by the Machiavellian methods and dark arts they practice, they are not portrayed as necessarily irredeemable: Some Sith, most famously [[Darth Vader]] in the final moments of his life, have renounced the Order and the Dark Side of the Force.\n\n{{quote|text=The dark side is generous... It is patient and it always wins \u2013 but in the heart of its strength lies its weakness: one lone candle is enough to hold it back.|title=''[[Revenge of the Sith]]'' novelization|character=[[Yoda]]}}\n\nMartial arts are a core part of the Sith tradition, and Sith featured in the ''Star Wars'' film series have all been highly trained warriors who further augment their abilities with the Force.  Like the Jedi, the Sith's signature armament is an extremely lethal focused energy melee weapon known as a [[lightsaber]], which (generally) only those trained in the ways of the Force can use effectively. Sith use lightsabers in combination with Force-derived powers, such as telekinesis, enhanced dexterity and precognition, to achieve superhuman combat prowess. A fully trained Sith is depicted as being at least a match for a well-trained Jedi Knight, and either can handily defeat multiple ordinary attackers armed with projectile weapons.  In matters of dress, Sith may adopt any attire consistent with their plans or guise; they commonly favor black robes, armor and gis when presenting themselves authentically.\n\n===Fictional backstory (''Legends'')===\n\nIn the ''Legends'' continuity, the Sith Order began around 6,900 BBY, during a period known as the Hundred Year Darkness. A series of conflict began between the rebellious dark Jedi, a faction of the Jedi Order, and the rest of the Order. The dark Jedi were defeated and cast out, exiled to the unknown regions. These Exiles came across the planet Korriban, and its native species, the Sith. The strongest among the Exiles, Ajunta Pall, became the first to hold the title Dark Lord of the Sith. His contemporaries, such as Karness Muur and XoXaan became Sith Lords. The human Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species, who also had an affinity for the Dark Side. They would become the original Sith Empire.\n\nOne of the earliest leaders of this Sith Empire was Tulak Hord. He expanded the Sith territories, and conquered the Dromund System, home to Dromuund Kaas, later the capital of the Sith Empire. He was eventually followed by Marka Ragnos, the last ruler of a period known as the Golden Age of the Sith. Upon the passing of Ragnos, two contenders for the throne of Dark Lord, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, dueled at his funeral. Eventually, after a series of conflicts, Sadow was victorious, and Kressh apparently killed.\n\nSadow began the Great Hyperspace War, invading the Republic and laying siege to its planets. Sadow's efforts were initially met with success, his forces amplified by illusions that Sadow projected from his meditation sphere. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord's concentration was broken when his apprentice turned on him. With his illusions dispersed, Sadow's forces were forced to retreat. Upon returning to Sith space, they found that Kressh had not been killed, and engaged him in a space battle. Sadow was victorious again, but they were soon attacked by republic forces. Sadow escaped by causing the Denarii Binary Star to go supernova.\n\nThe Sith Empire would eventually rise again, with the rise of Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma. The spirit of the deceased Dark Lord, Marka Ragnos, declared Kun Dark Lord of the Sith, and made Qel-Droma his apprentice. Allying themselves with warriors such as the Mandalorians, Kun and Qel-Droma declared war on the Galactic Republic. During a raid on the Jedi Library at Ossus, Qel-Droma dueled and killed his brother, but was captured. Qel-Droma was redeemed, and was instrumental in Kun's downfall, when the latter retreated to Yavin 4.\n\nAt some point following the Mandalorian Wars, the individuals known as Revan and Alek Squinquargesimus declared themselves sith lords, and became Darth Revan and Darth Malak respectively. Their brutal campaign against the Republic was hugely successful. Revan was eventually betrayed by Malak, allowing a Jedi strike team to capture him. Malak continued his conquest without Revan's tactical leadership, until a redeemed Revan defeated him, and the Star Forge, the source of the Sith Fleet was destroyed.\n\nRemnants of Revan's Sith Empire, lead by the Sith Triumvirate, consisting of Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, began a shadow war against the Jedi. This First Jedi Purge, brought the Jedi Order to the brink of extinction. Their downfall came about when Meetra Surik, a Jedi who was exiled after the Mandalorian Wars, returned to known space. She defeated the three Sith, and without the Sith leadership, and the destruction of their base of operations on Malachor V, the remaining Sith forces faded into obscurity.\n\nAround 300 years later, the original Sith empire, now under the leadership of Emperor Vitiate, emerged from the Unknown Regions and declared war on the republic. This war, dubbed the Great Galactic War, was halted when Vitiate, on the cusp of victory, was restrained by the telepathic prowess of Revan. After a period of non fighting, called the Galactic Cold War, tensions boiled over, and the Galactic War began. The Sith empire eventually fell to infighting, and mostly disappeared. Occasionally, a Dark Lord such as Darth Rivan or Darth Ruin, would rise and fall, but the Sith did not become a major threat again until around 2,500 years later.\n\nAt this point, the Brotherhood of Darkness, arose, lead by the Sith Lord Skere Kaan. They focused on controlling the infighting between the Sith. This policy allowed them to make great progress in their war against the Republic. Ironically, one of their own, a Sith Lord by the name of Bane turned on them, because he disapproved of their methods. He manipulated the Brotherhood into extinction, and they were defeated. Bane started the Rule of Two, which evolved into the Sith as they are seen in the films.\n\n===Fictional history===\n{{Main|Star Wars#Premise}}\nThe ''Star Wars'' saga began with the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', which was released in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759|accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> Since then, [[Star Wars films|films]], [[List of Star Wars books|books]], [[Star Wars games|computer games]] and [[Star Wars comics|comics]] have been released, all set in the [[Star Wars universe|fictional universe of ''Star Wars'']], which has expanded the history of the Sith within their stories.\n\nThe schemes of the Sith are key to the overarching plot of the ''Star Wars'' films and much other fictional material in the franchise.  Their background has varied among depictions, but the Sith have always been insidious archenemies of the [[Jedi]] leveraging dark arts in pursuit of power and revenge. The Sith were first mentioned in ''A New Hope'' in a scene ultimately cut from the film.  They were expanded upon heavily in the following years in books, comics, games and other multimedia. The Sith were formally introduced on-screen with the release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' in 1999 as a shadowy martial order manipulating the movie's political factions into a galaxy-spanning civil war.\n\n''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' first aired on [[Cartoon Network]] in 2008. This series took place between ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. During this time, [[Anakin Skywalker]] is a full-fledged Jedi Knight and the series shows how he progresses into his fall to the Dark Side of the Force.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars|url=http://www.tv-links.eu|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> [[Count Dooku]] is the active Sith Lord and leader of the Separatist Alliance. The series also explores Dooku's attempts at training secret apprentices like [[Asajj Ventress]] and [[Savage Opress]] in order to eventually defeat Darth Sidious and become the ruling Sith Lord.\n\n====Emergence of the Sith Order====\nThe origin, agenda, abilities and philosophy of the Sith are intertwined with their relationship to [[the Force]]. With proper training, the Force may be called upon by rare individuals capable of \"sensing\" or \"touching\" it to achieve extraordinary feats such as telekinesis, precognition and mental suggestion. Not all psychological states are conducive to employing the Force; discipline is required. However, both quietude and focused, intense passion alike can be effective. The Sith originated in a species of Force-sensitive warriors who discovered the efficacy of passion as a tool to draw on the Force at least 5,000 years prior to the events of the first ''Star Wars'' film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luceno|first=James|title=Star Wars: Tarkin|year=2014|publisher=Del Rey Books|isbn=978-0-345-51152-2}}</ref> Fully embracing this approach, they became defined and corrupted by it.\n\nThe warriors who would become the first Sith were apparently heterodox members of an older martial order of Force-sensitive sapient beings in the ''Star Wars'' universe: The Jedi. The Jedi served as a space-faring [[Military order (monastic society)|knightly order]] within the [[Galactic Republic]], a representative democracy encompassing most developed worlds.  The Jedi Order sought to use the powers of the Force to help defend the weak and advance the rule of law across the galaxy, in keeping with their ethics of self-sacrifice and service to the common welfare. The Jedi creed mirrored their method of utilizing the Force, and Jedi doctrine favored states of serenity, detachment, compassion, and humility as the proper means of accessing its power. When members of the Jedi Order began to experiment with passion as an alternative, controversy emerged. The Jedi establishment saw these innovations as a threat to the ethos of the Jedi, opening members to the seduction of aggrandizement and cruelty. Eventually, this controversy led to a sectarian conflict in which the heterodox Jedi were defeated and exiled.<ref>Marvel Comics, Star Wars 9 \u2013 \"Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part II\"</ref>\n\nIn exile, the dissident Jedi were free to explore the relationship between passion and the Force. They concluded that the martial and ethical disciplines of the Jedi establishment were foolish and misguided: Passion, not quietude, was the most potent means of accessing the Force, and conflict, not peace, was the natural and healthy state of the universe.  Rejecting the self-abnegation of their forebears, the exiles now embraced ruthless personal ambition, believing that power belonged to those with the cunning and strength to seize it.  In their training, the dissidents would seek to master the Force by cultivating dark passions such as anger and hate, a practice anathematized by the Jedi as taking recourse to the Force's \"Dark Side.\" Guided by their [[Might makes right|kratocratic]] and egoistic philosophy and armed with taboo Dark Side techniques, the former Jedi exiles would reemerge to menace the galaxy as the Sith Order, aiming to conquer the Galactic Republic and exact revenge against the Jedi.\n\nA succession of Sith-led regimes would arise to challenge the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.<ref>Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 \"Escape from Kadavo\"</ref> However, internal power struggles would prove decisive in thwarting the Sith's designs. The paradox of reconciling endless personal ambition with corporate action would become a great practical and philosophical concern for the Sith. Ultimately, this paradox would be \u201cresolved\u201d through a drastic reorganization effected by a leader named Darth Bane, who recast the Sith in an esoteric lineal master-apprentice tradition known as \u201cThe Rule of Two.\u201d<ref>Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 \"Sacrifice\"</ref> Thereafter (at least, as a matter of orthodoxy) there would be only two Sith at a time: One to embody power, and another to crave it. While concealing their identity as Sith, a succession of Sith masters and apprentices would work through the centuries to inveigle or force themselves into positions of power and undermine responsible government, preparing the Galactic Republic for eventual usurpation. The Banite tradition encouraged each apprentice to eventually challenge and slaughter his or her master, and take an apprentice in turn. In this way, Darth Bane guaranteed the conspiracy remained a secret for a thousand years; he believed that the kratocratic essence of Sith philosophy could be reconciled with a sustained project of galactic domination and revenge against the Jedi. The first six ''Star Wars'' films chronicle the consummation, and eventual undoing, of this ancient scheme.\n\n====Ascent to power of the Sith====\nDarth Bane's plan would come to fruition through [[Sheev Palpatine]], a [[Naboo]] Senator, later Supreme Chancellor, of the [[Galactic Republic]], and secretly a Dark Lord of the Sith (\u201cDarth Sidious\u201d). By manipulating disgruntled factions within the Galactic Republic, Palpatine orchestrated a civil war. This conflict, known within the ''Star Wars'' universe as the \"[[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]\", provided a justification for consolidating power in the Galactic Republic's chief executive and assembling a large army of hastily cloned soldiers\u2014surreptitiously conditioned to obey certain key commands issued by Palpatine. Although the Jedi eventually discovered Palpatine's identity as a Sith and attempted to arrest him, this action was anticipated by Palpatine, who framed their actions as an attempted coup, providing in turn a pretext for annihilating the Jedi by activating \u201cOrder 66,\u201d one of the clone soldiers\u2019 embedded protocols. In the course of effecting his designs, Palpatine also manipulated the Jedi's most powerful initiate, Anakin Skywalker, into his service, by promising to teach Skywalker Dark Side techniques that could save the life of [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], a Galactic Senator to whom Skywalker was secretly married in violation of Jedi rules, and whose death in childbirth Skywalker had preternaturally foreseen. In a tragic irony, Amidala's sheer horror at discovering Skywalker's collaboration with Sidious in destroying the Jedi would itself be the cause of her death during childbirth, though Sidious would trick Skywalker into believing that an episode of Skywalker's physical abuse of Amidala had been the actual cause of her death. Skywalker's subsequent emotional collapse would lead him to fully embrace the Dark Side of the Force and assume the persona of [[Darth Vader]], Lord of the Sith. With Darth Vader at his side, the Emperor would rule the newly styled Galactic Empire for approximately 20 years as its Emperor. Initially unknown to Vader and Sidious, two children were delivered by Padme before her death.\n\n====Sith temples====\nThe ''Rebels'' episode \"Twilight of the Apprentice\" features a forbidden planet called Malachor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor|title=Malachor|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> home of an ancient '''Sith temple'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor-sith-temple|title=Malachor Sith temple|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> The temple contains a superweapon, and can only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/sith-holocron|title=Sith holocron|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> in an [[obelisk]] at the summit of the pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants. Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and this ''Rebels'' episode, [[Darth Maul]] had become stranded on the planet. When [[Ahsoka Tano]], [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]] arrive, Ezra is separated from them. He is discovered by Maul, and together, they use the Force cooperatively to solve a series of tests, and retrieve a Sith Holocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors, all of whom are killed by Maul. Maul then betrays his allies, blinding Kanan, and proceeds to activate the superweapon.\n\nMaul is defeated by a sightless Kanan, and Darth Vader arrives with the intention of retrieving the holocron, but is challenged by Ahsoka, his former Padawan. While the superweapon is preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieve the holocron and escape, preventing the weapon of mass destruction from being used. Even though the temple is destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader keep fighting to the death within the rapidly crumbling building, until it eventually explodes, wounding Vader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/star-wars-rebels-twilight-of-the-apprentice-review|title=Star Wars Rebels: \"Twilight of the Apprentice\" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=30 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Star Wars Resistance]]'' episode \"The Relic Raiders\" depicts a Sith temple hidden underneath a later Jedi temple.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cao |first=Caroline |title=Star Wars Resistance Review: The Presence of The Force Grows in \"The Relic Raiders\" |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-resistance-season-2-episode-7-review-relic-raiders/ |website=/Film |accessdate=November 23, 2019 |date=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====End of the Sith====\nAnakin's children, [[Princess Leia|Leia]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] would become key members of the [[Rebel Alliance]] to restore the Galactic Republic. Luke would be secretly tutored in the ways of the Force by Vader's own former Jedi master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and a powerful elder Jedi, [[Yoda]], who also survived Palpatine's purge. Ironically, during a final confrontation between Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and the Emperor aboard a mobile battle station known as the [[Death Star]], the Sith lineage would end as Darth Bane prescribed that it proceed. Darth Sidious offered Skywalker an ultimatum to enter his service or die, and proceeded to use his Force-derived powers to torture and kill Skywalker when the latter refused to embrace the Dark Side of the Force. Experiencing a crisis of conscience at the imminent death of Skywalker, whom Vader now knew to be his son, Darth Vader chose to intervene and kill his former master, Sidious fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Vader would die of his own injuries shortly thereafter, thus apparently bringing an end to the Sith and their ancient vendetta.\n\nThe 2019 film ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'' depicts the climax of the conflict between the Sith and the Jedi,<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |title=Everything New Revealed in Vanity Fair's The Rise of Skywalker Cover Story |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/everything-new-revealed-in-vanity-fairs-the-rise-of-skywalker-cover-story |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=May 22, 2019 |date=May 22, 2019}}</ref> and features the group known as the [[Sith#Sith Eternal|Sith Eternal]], led by a resurrected Darth Sidious.

For example, Snoke and Kylo Ren, although powerful Dark Side users, were never considered Sith. The Knights of Ren, an organization of dark side Force-wielders led by Kylo Ren, were also a separate group from the Sith and the Dark Jedi. -->\n\n====Timeline====\n\n*Before the films - At an unknown point in time, numerous Jedi become disillusioned with the Order and exile themselves, forming the Sith Order. Thousands of years later, a centuries-long war between the Jedi and the Sith takes place, which culminates with the apparent defeat of all the Sith. However, there is a sole survivor, Darth Bane, who later goes on to create the Rule of Two and have an apprentice of his own, marking the beginning of a new era for the Sith. The Sith continue to exist in secret for a millennium after Bane's death. Darth Plagueis trains [[Palpatine|Sidious]], who ultimately kills Plagueis in his sleep and takes Maul as his first apprentice.\n* ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Sidious and Maul, who is later defeated in battle and presumed to be dead; the Jedi also become aware of the Sith's return.)\n* ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (Sidious and [[Count Dooku|Tyranus]]; Maul lives but is absent from the film due to still being thought dead.)\n* ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|film]] and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|series]] (Sidious and Tyranus, who also uses Asajj Ventress as a Shadow Hand.

He was a paranoid man, who believed that his followers were secretly plotting to overthrow him, which eventually came true, as they betrayed and attacked him, seeking to steal his power. Forced to flee from [[Korriban]], Andeddu created the world of Prakith, where he would rule as a deity for several centuries until meeting his demise and entombing himself to prevent his followers from stealing his secrets even in death. Prior to his death, he would also create a Sith holocron to store all his knowledge, including the ability to cheat death by transferring one's essence into another vessel, and his cult, called \"the Malevolence\", would create a temple in the reverence of the Dark Lord, believing that one day he would return. The legend of Andeddu and his incredible power remained at large long after his death, despite the Jedi Order's attempt to erase all knowledge and reference about the Sith.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Andeddu is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Andeddu thousands of years after his death and had the 5th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Atrius ====\nDarth Atrius was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who existed long before the Rule of Two was created. He owned two crossguard lightsabers, which were found and given away by the smuggler Sana Starros after the [[Battle of Yavin]]. The anger possessed by Atrius when wielding both these crossguard lightsabers at the same time, carried over to the weapons themselves, and can transfer over to their new owners. These lightsabers were eventually destroyed by Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, thus possibly erasing all knowledge about Atrius himself.<ref>https://movieweb.com/star-wars-canon-darth-atrius-lightsabers/</ref>\n\n==== Darth Caldoth ====\nDarth Caldoth was a male [[Duros (Star Wars)|Duros]] Dark Lord of the Sith, who lived at an unknown point in time and wrote a book titled ''The Bestiary of Darth Caldoth'', which mentioned various Sith warbeasts such as the Gundark. According to the legend, Caldoth eventually gained a Sith apprentice, the [[Twi'lek]] Ry Nymbis, and they were considered the two most powerful individuals in the galaxy at one point. Caldoth killed his own apprentice with a Sith ritual that turned the person's body into stone when he felt Nymbis was going to betray him. With the ritual, Nymbis was trapped in an eternal nightmare. Darth Caldoth is only alluded to in the novel ''Myths & Fables'' written by George Mann and published in August 2019.\n\n==== Darth Krall ====\nDarth Krall (Radaki) was a male Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at an unknown point in time and was seduced to the Dark Side after losing his faith in the Jedi Order, believing that the Jedi should retain their family ties and wealth. His notable actions include taking part in the Battle of Wasted Years, where the Sith emerged victorious, and taming the Nightmare Conjunction. His lightsaber would later be stored in the Bogan Collection at the Jedi Temple on [[Coruscant]]. Darth Krall is only alluded to in the audiobook ''Dooku: Jedi Lost''.\n\n==== Darth Skrye ====\nDarth Skrye was a female Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at an unknown point in time. Her voice would be heard by Count Dooku during his time as a Jedi Padawan, in a Force vision that he had after encountering the Presagers of Hakotei on Asusto, where she claimed that the Sith were reborn, before activating a superweapon called the Cauldron and destroying an entire planet. Skyre also owned an artifact called the Hand of Skrye, which would eventually be found by Jedi Lene Kostana and Sifo-Dyas on [[Rishi (Star Wars)|Rishi.]] Darth Skrye is only alluded to in the audiobook ''Dooku: Lost Jedi''.\n\n==== Darth Wrend ====\nDarth Wrend was a Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at an unknown point in time and was best known for coming back to life after being killed by the Jedi Order, in order to fight them once again. The legend of Darth Wrend would come to [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]'s mind during his time as a Padawan, who opened the holocron of prophecy, which contained numerous prophecies of which several dated ten thousand years prior. One of the prophecies said that evil would disappear yet appear again once the righteous had lost its light, which many believed that was referring to the return of the Sith. At that time, Qui-Gon believed that the prophecy talked about Darth Wrend's return from the dead and that it had already been fulfilled, although it would later be discovered that the prophecy referred to the return of the Sith in the form of Darth Sidious and his apprentice Darth Maul. Darth Wrend is only alluded in the novel and audiobook ''Master & Apprentice''.\n\n==== Darth Tanis ====\nDarth Tanis was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at least 4,000 years before the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', as Sith accounts from 3966 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) described kyber weaponry developed by him on the planet [[Malachor]]. Darth Tanis is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Tanis thousands of years after his death and had the 17th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Desolous ====\nDarth Desolous was a male [[Pau'an]] Dark Lord of the Sith who was expelled from the Jedi Order due to his violent nature and trained an army of fellow Pau'an warriors to fight them, but ended up falling into a trap set by the Jedi and perished in battle. His image would later be incorporated in the training simulations at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Desolous is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Desolous many years after his death and had the 44th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Phobos ====\nDarth Phobos was a Theelin Dark Lady of the Sith with mind manipulation abilities, who killed many of her fellow Sith in a bid of power and formed a cult to worship her, but was ultimately killed by the combined forces of the Jedi and Sith. Her image would later be incorporated in the training simulations at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Phobos is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though her backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Phobos many years after her death and had the 39th Legion of Sith Troopers named after her.\n\n==== Darth Revan ====\n[[Darth Revan]] was a Jedi hero who led the Republic to victory in the Mandalorian Wars, almost 4,000 years before the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. He and his comrade, Malak, later unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire, hidden in the Unknown Reaches of space. The Sith Emperor, using Sith sorcery, turned Revan and Malak to the Dark Side, but the two broke free from his control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Malak as his Sith Apprentice. As a Sith, Revan prepared to battle with the Jedi who boarded his flagship, and Darth Malak, in the hopes of destroying both Revan and [[Bastila Shan]], betrayed his master, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge. Revan was critically injured and taken by Bastila Shan to the Jedi Council Enclave. The Council chose to wipe Revan's memory, and imprint him with a false identity. Revan later awoke on a starship under attack and encountered Malak, who eventually revealed the truth of his identity. Following this, Revan defeated Malak in a final battle, claiming victory for the Republic. Revan later married Bastila Shan with the approval of the Jedi Council and eventually departed into the Unknown Regions to confront the Sith Emperor, but got imprisoned by gun for 300 years until his descendant Satele Shan rescued him. However, due to being imprisoned for centuries, his lighter half had persihed and became a Force spirit, leaving only his darker half, which sought to destroy the Sith Emperor once and for all. Since the Emperor's physical body had already been destroyed, leaving only his spirit, Revan planned to resurrect him so that he could then kill him for good. However, he was ultimately defeated by the combined forces of the Repulbic and his lighter half. The two halves of Revan then merged together in peace and died for the final time, although, unbeknownst to everyone, the Sith Emperor had been ressurected and escaped into the galaxy. Following his death, Revan would be remembered by the galaxy for thousand of years, both as a legendary Jedi hero and one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Revan is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Revan thousands of years after his death and had the 3rd Legion of Sith Troopers named after him. Darth Revan was also originally set to appear in the episode \"Ghosts of Mortis\" of ''The Clone Wars'' TV show alongside Darth Bane, but they were both ultimately cut.\n\n==== Darth Momin ====\nDarth Momin (Momin) was a male Dark Lord of Sith, as well as a sculptor, who was imprisoned at a young age for ideas and aspirations. He was eventually rescued by a woman named Shaa, who trained him in the Dark Side of the Force and whom he eventually killed after believing that he had become more powerful than his master. Momin then built a superweapon to destroy an entire city and perished when the Jedi intervened to stop him, losing control over the energy he wielded and causing his physical body to be destroyed, leaving only his mask with his consciousness inside. Years later, the mask would be retrieved from the Jedi Archive vault by Darth Sidious, who gave it to his apprentice Darth Vader as a gift for his journey to [[Mustafar]], which Vader sought to make his personal stronghold. After Momin's mask killed some of his personnel, Vader examined it and learned of Momin's past, before letting him possess the body of a Mustafarian and build his fortress for him. Shortly after Momin finished the build of the fortress, Vader was distracted by an invasion of Mustafarians, which Momin took advantage of to open the door to the Dark Side and resurrect himself. However, after challenging Vader to a duel, Momin would soon meet his demise by being crashed against the wall with a giant rock. Despite Momin's death, his dark essence would remain in the mask for years to come and at one point the mask was located aboard the Imperial yacht ''Imperialis'', where it possessed the bodies of two thieves who attempted to rob the ship, forcing the others to abandon them and destroy the ship. Darth Momin appeared in the novel series ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', as well as the 4th issue of ''Lando''.\n\n==== Darth Bane ====\n[[Darth Bane]] (Dessel) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith, who was the sole survivor of Sith Order in the aftermath of the ancient war between the Jedi and the Sith, and later established the Rule of Two, which was considered the beginning of the modern Sith within the ''Star Wars'' canon. This rule stated that there must be only two Sith Lords at a time: a master to embody power, and an apprentice to crave it and eventually overthrow his/her master and adopt an apprentice of his/her own.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Bane|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/groups/sith/|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> He is the main character of the non-canonical ''Darth Bane'' Trilogy by Drew Karpyshyn.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Bane's only appearance was in the episode \"Sacrifice\" of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' TV show, where his spirit was encountered by Yoda on the Sith homeworld of [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Moraband|Moraband]], whom he unsuccessfully attempted to seduce to the Dark Side, as part of the Jedi Grand Master's trial to learn the power of immortality. Bane was also originally set to appear in the episode \"Ghosts of Mortis\" alongside Darth Revan, but they were both ultimately cut.\n\n==== Darth Tenebrous ====\n[[Darth Tenebrous]] (Rugess Nome) was a male [[Bith (Star Wars)|Bith]] Dark Lord of the Sith with the power of foreseeing the future, including his own death, and was the master of both Darth Plagueis and Darth Venamis, the latter of whom he kept secret as it was a violation of the Rule of Two. His public persona was Rugess Tome, a legendary artisanal starship designer with a galaxy-spanning reputation, and he was known for being a scientific genius and master planner, as well as for his breathing apparatus. Tenebrous' secret plan was to possess the Chosen One once he would appear, but he was eventually killed by Plagueis during a mission on the planet Ban'demnic. However, Tenebrous wasn't too surprised at Plagueis's betrayal and instead congratulated him with his dying breath, because his conscience would soon be able to enter his apprentice's body. Despite managing to cheat death, Tenebrous' plan failed, because, during his time in Plagueis' body, he foresaw him being killed by his own apprentice before the appearance of the Chosen One, meaning that Tenebrous would never be able to possess him. Tenebrous then tried to escape from Plagueis' body, but only saw the mummified remains of his original body, as decades had passed since his death. Thus, Tenebrous was cursed to remain a vague spirit for the rest of eternity, unable to gain a physical body ever again.\n\nIn the ''Star Wars'' canon continuity, Darth Tenebrous is only alluded in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Tenebrous many years after his death and had the 26th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.\n\n==== Darth Plagueis ====\n[[Darth Plagueis]] (Hego Damask) was a male [[Muun]] Dark Lord of the Sith and master of Darth Sidious, first referenced in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith]]'' by Palpatine to Anakin Skywalker. Plagueis later appeared as the protagonist of the now-non-canonical ''Legends'' novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis]]''. He was the master of Darth Sidious, who claimed that Plagueis' abilities in the Force grew to such an extent that he could create life by influencing microscopic force-sensitive entities called \"midi-chlorians,\" and even save people from dying. According to the Rule of Two, Plagueis would eventually be killed by Sidious in his sleep, who subsequently became the new Sith Master and would later take on an apprentice of his own. The non-canonical novel reveals that Plagueis maintained a public influence as a member of the Intergalactic Banking Clan as Hego Damask, a benevolent Muun, until he was eventually killed in his sleep by Sidious. In ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', it is revealed that the Banking Clan was one of the various groups to ally themselves with the Separatist Alliance.\n\n==== Sith Lords in the films ====\n\n==== Darth Sidious ====\n[[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] (Sheev Palpatine) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith who appeared in each trilogy of the ''[[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga|Skywalker Saga]]''. Originally the eldest son of an aristocratic family from the planet [[Naboo]], he rose to power within the Galactic Republic's government system starting from Senator of his homeworld, then to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and finally to self-proclaimed Emperor of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. This was done by cultivating a public image as a humble and competent politician while secretly mastering dark Sith arts studying under Plagueis, and planning the destruction of the Jedi Order and Republic. Eventually, by manipulating disaffected political groups and using double agents to sow discord, Palpatine fomented a civil war that provided an opportunity for him to seize absolute power. He had three known Sith apprentices: Darth Maul, Darth Tyranus, and Darth Vader. He was eventually betrayed and killed<!--Do NOT use \"seemingly killed\" or related phrases; the source states Palpatine was indeed killed, and this is further confirmed in the 2019 film The Rise of Skywalker--> by his last, Vader, at the end of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious |title=Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious |website=[[Star Wars Databank]] |accessdate=January 26, 2020}}</ref> He returned more than 30 years later in ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'', having managed to cheat death through powerful mastery of the Dark Side of the Force.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-easter-eggs-callbacks-references |title=A Guide to All the Old Star Wars References in The Rise of Skywalker |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=January 11, 2020 |first1=Joanna |last1=Robinson |first2=Anthony |last2=Breznican |authorlink2=Anthony Breznican}}</ref> He is finally killed by his granddaughter [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], who deflected his Force lightning using the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker]] lightsabers. Darth Sidious' death marked what appears to be the definitive end of the Sith.\n\nIn ''Legends'' continuity, Darth Sidious would return using clones and ancient Sith powers, returning in several clone bodies over the course of several novels and comics. During this time he would briefly turn [[Luke Skywalker]] to the Dark Side of the Force through sheer power as much as by guile, though Luke would later be redeemed by his sister Leia and restored to the light side of the Force and defeated Palpatine once and for all. Shortly before his first death, Palpatine had sent a psychic command through the Force to [[Mara Jade]], planting in her the need to kill Luke. She eventually fulfilled this command by slaying a clone of Luke called Luuke Skywalker, whom Palpatine had made in an attempt to use him against the original, though this plot ultimately would fail due to Mara's fatal attack on the clone.\n\nIn the ''Infinities'' storylines, which take alternate paths from the original three films\u2014 one from a specific point in each of the first three films\u2014 Palpatine's rule is depicted as eventually coming to an end in various ways. In the first such alternate continuity\u2014 based on ''A New Hope''\u2014 Yoda uses the Death Star to slay the Emperor, who had by this point managed to turn Leia to the Dark Side, crashing the massive station into the Emperor's castle. In the second, based on the ''Empire Strikes Back'', Palpatine continues to rule the Empire, and his ultimate fate is unrevealed, as the story focuses on Leia becoming a Jedi in place of Luke, who had perished on Hoth. In the final story, set in an alternate timeline of ''Return of the Jedi'', Palpatine is defeated by the combined forces of Luke, Leia, and Darth Vader as the second Death Star is destroyed by the rebel forces, but he remains alive. As a result, Palpatine remained as emperor and the rebels, now joined by a redeemed Anakin Skywalker in a white version of the Darth Vader suit, continued their battle against him.\n\n==== Darth Maul ====\n[[Darth Maul]] (Maul) was a male [[Dathomirian]] [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] informal Dark Lord of the Sith who served as the first apprentice of Darth Sidious. He first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace]]'', in which Sidious sent him to find the escaped [[Queen Amidala]] and bring her back to Naboo to sign a treaty that would legalize the Trade Federation's invasion there. After tracking the Queen's personal starship to Tatooine, he briefly attacked [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], the Jedi sent to escort Amidala to Coruscant, near its landing zone until the latter escaped by leaping aboard. Later, Maul was sent back to Naboo to aid the Federation in their struggle to fight Amidala's counterattack, where he again battled Jinn and his Padawan [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in the plasma refinery complex beneath Theed Palace. Although the vicious Zabrak was able to kill Jinn, he fell to Kenobi when the Padawan used his master's lightsaber to slice Maul in half. Twelve years later, during the Clone Wars, his fellow nightbrother [[Savage Opress]] discovered Maul on the junk planet Lotho Minor, where he had been dumped after surviving the apparently fatal battle with Kenobi. Maul would use his strength with the Dark Side of the Force and anger against Kenobi to heal and rise again with a new pair of robotic legs. Years later, he would give up on his Sith persona, becoming simply Maul, and would go on to found the crime empire Crimson Dawn. After the Crimson Dawn's downfall, Maul would remain in exile on [[Malachor]] for years, until meeting young Jedi Padwan [[Ezra Bridger]] in the second season of ''Star Wars: Rebels'', whom he attempted to drift to the Dark Side. Although he failed, Maul was able to escape aboard a stolen [[TIE fighter|TIE Fighter]], and later returned in the third season of the show, looking to locate the long-absent Obi-Wan Kenobi. After tracking him down to [[Tatooine]], Maul engaged Kenobi in a brief duel, which resulted in the former Sith Lord's death. In his final moments, Maul finally let go of his hatred for Kenobi and showed a great respect for him, realizing that Kenobi was looking after the [[Luke Skywalker|boy]] he believed to be the Chosen One and would destroy the Sith.\n\n==== Darth Tyranus ====\n[[Darth Tyranus]] (Count Dooku) was a male human Sith Lord and the second apprentice of Darth Sidious. Dooku was a former Jedi Knight, trained by Grand Master Yoda and who took Qui-Gon Jin as his apprentice, but later became disillusioned by the rampant corruption within the Galactic Senate, realizing that immediate change was needed in order to maintain peace. He first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones]]'', which revealed that he had a prominent role in engineering the Clone Wars,<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Tyranus/Count Dooku|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/dooku/|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> recruiting [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]] to become the template for an army of clones to be used by the Galactic Republic. Dooku led the Separatist Alliance as its public figurehead during the Clone Wars until he met his demise while dueling Anakin Skywalker aboard the ''Invisible Hand'' in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith]]''. Unlike his predecessor, Darth Maul, Sidious never truly cared about Dooku and merely used him as a [[Puppet ruler|puppet]] to help him with his plans, having always wanted Skywalker as his next, real apprentice.\n\n==== Darth Vader ====\n[[Darth Vader]] (Anakin Skywalker) was a male human-cyborg Sith Lord and the third and final apprentice of Darth Sidious, who first appeared in the [[Star Wars#original trilogy|''Star Wars'' original trilogy]], and later in [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|the prequel trilogy]]. As the Jedi hero Anakin Skywalker, he fought alongside his master Obi-Wan Kenobi during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars, but was slowly seduced to the Dark Side by Darth Sidious. After helping Sidious kill Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]], he swore allegiance to the Sith and was given the name Darth Vader before setting out to destroy all Jedi left on Coruscant. After being sent by Sidious to assassinate the Separatist council members on Mustafar, Vader was badly injured in a duel with Kenobi, resulting in the loss of his remaining organic arm, both legs, and severe burn injuries. He was saved by Sidious, and encased in a black suit of armor with extensive cybernetics which kept him alive. As the Galactic Empire was established and continued to grow, Vader became the Emperor's immensely feared second-in-command and was given the task of finding surviving Jedi and the [[Rebel Alliance]]'s base. After the destruction of the [[Death Star|first Death Star]], Vader was charged with tracking down the Rebel Alliance and destroying their headquarters. However, the actions of his son, [[Luke Skywalker]], eventually turned Vader against his master, resulting in both Sidious' and Vader's deaths, as well as the fulfillment of the Chosen One prophecy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Vader|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/darthvader/|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Shadow Hands of the Sith ===\nAlthough not official Sith, several other Dark Side users in the service of the Sith were present during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] and the initial years of the Galactic Empire, prior to the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', where it was mentioned that Darth Vader and Darth Sidious were the only known Force-wielders at that time.\n\n==== Asajj Ventress ====\n[[Asajj Ventress]] was a female Dathomirian Sith Shadow Hand trained under Darth Tyranus and an antagonist of the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. She first appeared in the 2003 series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', in which Darth Sidious assigned her to kill the then-Padawan Anakin Skywalker. After tracking the young war hero to the planet Muunilinst, Ventress engaged Anakin's Republic fighter forces fighting above the Separatist-occupied world and baited him in a chase to [[Yavin IV]], where a fierce battle from the forest to the Massassi temple took place. Though she initially gained the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel, Anakin called upon his immense connection to the Force to brutally overpower her, causing the Dathomirian to fall over the edge of a cliff. She luckily survived the landing and continued to serve her master throughout the Clone Wars on several occasions. Some of which included helping form an alliance between the [[Toydarians]] and the Separatists until Yoda thwarted it, spying on Kamino in a Separatist plot to destroy the clone production facilities while stealing Jango Fett's DNA template, and freeing Trade Federation viceroy Nute Gunray from the custody of Luminara Unduli and Ahsoka Tano while fighting the two Jedi before ultimately succeeding in her mission. After being replaced with Savage Opress for her failures, Ventress returned to the Nightsisters until General Grievous led a massacre against them, which only she and Mother Talzin survived. From there, she helped [[Boba Fett]]'s team of bounty hunters on a dangerous mission, which thus marked the start of her own bounty hunting career. Ventres later appeared in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Dark Disciple]]'', which was intended for a story arc in the TV series. In the novel, she teamed up with Jedi [[Quinlan Vos]] to assassinate Count Dooku, and, along the way, the two fell in love. However, their attempt to kill Dooku failed, and Dooku captured Vos, turning him to the Dark Side. Ventress managed to turn Vos back, but died saving him from an angered Dooku and was later buried on Dathomir, amongst her fallen sisters.\n\n==== Savage Opress ====\n[[Savage Opress]] was a male Dathomirian [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] Sith Shadow Hand first trained under Darth Tyrannus and later under his own brother, Darth Maul, as well as a major antagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. Originally a Nightbrother under Mother Talzin on Dathomir, he was handpicked by Asajj Ventress as part of her scheme to kill Darth Tyrannus for the attempt on her life. His mind was eventually altered by the Nightsisters, making him more of a [[berserker]] on Ventress' call to the point of killing his brother Feral without remorse. Opress managed to become Tyrannus' new Shadow Hand and learned only a little about the ways of the Sith before Ventress had him help her fight their master due to his actions under him getting unwanted attention from the Jedi. However, in the heat of the moment and provoked by both of them, Opress tried to kill both Tyrannus and Ventress before escaping back to Dathomir. There, he was instructed by Mother Talzin to find Maul so that he could complete his training to defend himself against the numerous enemies he had made. After finding his long-lost brother as a shell of his former self on a junk planet, Opress managed to stir up Maul's grudge with Obi-Wan Kenobi to aid him in his revenge against the Jedi. From there, the Zabrak duo were able to set up a Confederacy against the Republic separate from the Separatists, and soon took over [[Mandalore]]. However, they received an unexpected visit by Darth Sidious, who considered Maul's sudden rise to power a threat to his rule, and dueled both him and Opress. The latter was fatally injured in the fight and died in Maul's arms, who would soon be defeated as well and captured by Sidious.\n\n==== Inquisitorius ====\nThe Inquisitors were an organization of Force-sensitive warriors in the service of the Galactic Empire prior to the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', where it is implied that they all became defunct, as Darth Vader and Darth Sidious were the only known Force-wielders at that time. Most of them were former Jedi, who had lost their faith in the Jedi Order and succumbed to the Dark Side, during or shortly after the Clone Wars. They were all recruited into the Empire and trained by Darth Vader, who tasked them with hunting down other survivors of the Jedi Purge, as well as other Force-sensitive individuals, mostly children, to prevent them from becoming future Jedi. Among the known Inquisitors were: \n*'''The Grand Inquisitor''' - the individual who would become known as the Grand Inquisitor was a former [[Pau'an]] Jedi Temple Guard. He was one of the several guards who escorted the fallen Jedi [[Barriss Offee|Barris Offee]] for her trial after the bombing of the Jedi Temple in the episode \"The Wrong Jedi\" of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]''. Offee's speech about the Jedi Order having lost its way due to the Clone Wars, in addition to the fact that the Jedi Council had mistaken [[Ahsoka Tano]] for the real culprit, eventually made him lose faith in the Jedi as well and embrace the Dark Side. He later came into service of the Empire and was one of the first-ever Inquisitors recruited to its cause, with the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'' showcasing his first encounter with Darth Vader in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Over the years, the Inquisitor worked his way up the Empire's ranks and eventually became the highest-ranking Inquisitor, being tasked (along with his subordinates) with hunting down Force-sensitive children across the galaxy and preventing them from becoming Jedi. The Grand Inquisitor first appeared as the main antagonist of the first season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was assigned to hunt down [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]]. He was eventually defeated by Kanan in combat and chose to commit suicide rather than face the infamous wrath of Darth Vader for his failure. A vision of the Grand Inquisitor in his old Jedi Temple Guard attire later appeared to Kanan in the Jedi Temple on [[Lothal (Star Wars)|Lothal]] and dueled him as part of his final trial to become a Jedi Knight.\n*'''The Second Sister''' - Trilla Suduri was the Padawan of Jedi Knight Cere Junda and one of the few survivors of the Great Jedi Purge. After Cere was captured and interrogated by the Empire, she betrayed Trilla's location, leading to her being captured and tortured by the Empire as well, until giving into the Dark Side and becoming the Second Sister Inquisitor. She initially made a [[cameo appearance]] in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', and later served as the main antagonist of the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'', where she was tasked with hunting Jedi Padawan [[Cal Kestis]], as well as a holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children. Although she succeeded in securing the holocron, she was eventually defeated by Kestis and Cere at the Inquisitor headquarters on the planet [[List of Star Wars planets and moons|Nur]]. Cere then attempted to make amends with her former Padawan, but Darth Vader appeared and killed Trilla for failing her mission.\n*'''The Fourth Sister''' - the Fourth Sister was a mysterious female Inquisitor, who was only alluded in the novel ''Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle''. In the novel, the Fourth Sister is never actually seen in person, but rather only her armor, which was stolen by Rebel commander Lina Graf in order to pose as her and infiltrate Darth Vader's Fortress on Mustafar to rescue Lieutenant Thom Hudd. The Fourth Sister's fate is left ambiguous, as she could have been either captured or killed by the Rebels in order to steal her armor.\n*'''The Fifth Brother''' - the [[Fifth Brother (Star Wars)|Fifth Brother]] was a former green-skinned humanoid male member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost his faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was introduced in the second season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was shown to be working closely with the Seventh Sister, as they were both tasked with hunting the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]'' crew after the Grand Inquisitor's death, during which they also competed against each other to become the next Grand Inquisitor. The Fifth Brother was eventually defeated after dueling Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, Ahsoka Tano and Maul on [[Malachor]], being disarmed by Ahsoka and subsequently killed by Maul.\n*'''The Sixth Brother''' - Bil Valen was a former humanoid Jedi Knight who eventually lost his faith in the Jedi Order and became the Sixth Brother Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was described as tall with unnatural-looking grey skin, piercing ice-blue eyes, broad shoulders, and distinctive scar/tattoo-like marking, and was also shown to have lost an arm to Darth Vader during one of his training sessions. The Sixth Brother only appeared in novels, most prominently in ''Ahsoka'', where he was tasked with hunting Ahsoka Tano, but was ultimately defeated by her after she caused his lightsaber to overload and explode, killing him. His lightsaber would later be rebuilt by Ahsoka into two white ones, which she would use for years to come.\n*'''The Seventh Sister''' - the [[Seventh Sister (Star Wars)|Seventh Sister]] was a former female [[Mirialan]] member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost her faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. She was introduced in the second season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where she was shown to be using small droids to help her track down her targets, and was also working closely with the Fifth Brother, as they were both tasked with hunting the ''Ghost'' crew after the Grand Inquisitor's death, during which they also competed against each other to become the next Grand Inquisitor. The Seventh Sister was eventually defeated by Maul on Malachor and subsequently killed by him, after Ezra Bridger refused to do so.\n*'''The Eighth Brother''' - the [[Eighth Brother]] was a former male [[Terrelian Jango Jumper]] member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost his faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was introduced in the second season finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was tasked with hunting the former Sith Darth Maul, eventually tracking him down to Malachor. He dueled Maul, Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, and Ahsoka Tano alongside his fellow Inquisitors, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, but they were both ultimately killed by Maul. Cornered, the Eighth Brother then attempted to escape, but his lightsaber had been damaged in battle and exploded in his hands when trying to use it to fly away, causing him to fall to his death.\n*'''The Ninth Sister''' - Masana Tide was a former female [[Dowutin]] Jedi Knight who eventually succumbed to the Dark Side and became the Ninth Sister Inquisitor after intense torture at the hands of the Empire. She first appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where she assisted Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother and the Tenth Brother in hunting the Jedi Ferren Barr on the planet [[Mon Cala]]. After Barr used the Force to turn the Imperial stormtroopers present against them, the Ninth Sister was betrayed by the Sixth Brother, who severed her right foot and left her behind to die so that he could escape, although she managed to survive the ordeal as well. She later appeared as an antagonist in the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'', where she joined the Second Sister in the hunt for Cal Kestis. The Ninth Sister was ultimately defeated by the young Padawan on [[Kashyyyk]], who severed her right hand as well. However, she survived the ordeal once again and her fate is left ambiguous.\n*'''The Tenth Brother''' - Prosset Dibs was a former blind human Jedi Master during the Clone Wars who eventually became disillusioned by the Jedi's role as protectors of the galaxy. He first appeared in the novel ''Jedi of the Republic - Mace Windu'', where he was shown to have tried to kill [[Mace Windu]] during a mission on the planet Hissrich. He was subsequently put on trial and expelled from the Jedi Order for his actions. Dibs later became the Tenth Brother Inquisitor in the service of the Empire and appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where he assisted Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother and the Ninth Sister in hunting the Jedi Ferren Barr on the planet Mon Cala. After Barr used the Force to turn the Imperial stormtroopers present against them, the Tenth Brother was killed in the ensuing fight.\n*'''Unnamed red-skinned Inquisitor''' - An unnamed red-skinned female Inquisitor appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where she assisted Darth Vader, the Fifth Brother and another black-skinned [[Twi'lek]] Inquisitor in hunting Jedi Master [[Eeth Koth]]. While Vader dueled and killed Koth, the female Inquisitor found his wife and baby daughter, but refused to kill them, instead taking the latter and bringing her to Vader, who then left her in the care of some nursemaids. Later, the Fifth Brother informed Vader of her actions and, believing it to be an act of treason, he tried to kill her in front of the other Inquisitors. She managed to escape with the help of her fellow Twi'lek Inquisitor, but they were both eventually caught following a long chase through Coruscant and chose to commit suicide rather than be killed by Vader.\n*'''Unnamed Twi'lek Inquisitor''' - A black-skinned male [[Twi'lek]] Inquisitor appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where he assisted Darth Vader, the Fifth Brother and another red-skinned female Inquisitor in hunting Jedi Master Eeth Koth. Later, when Vader tried to kill the female Inquisitor for treason, he helped her escape, but they were both eventually caught following a long chase through Coruscant and chose to commit suicide rather than be killed by Vader.\n\n=== New Republic-era Dark Side wielders ===\nAlthough not official Sith, several Dark Side users were present in the years following the fall of the Galactic Empire and during the conflict between the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]].\n\n==== Snoke ====\n{{main|Supreme Leader Snoke}}\n\n[[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]] was an artificial being created by Darth Sidious and his [[Sith Eternal]] cult on [[Exegol]] prior to Palpatine's rise as the Emperor of the Galactic Empire. After Palpatine's death and the fall of the Empire, Snoke emerged as an enigmatic figure who became the Supreme Leader of the First Order and seduced [[Kylo Ren]] to the Dark Side, training him to become his apprentice. Snoke first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), where he ordered Ren and the rest of the First Order to find a map that would lead them to [[Luke Skywalker]], the last remaining Jedi; Snoke was responsible for the destruction of Luke's Jedi Order, summoning a massive dark storm that destroyed Luke's Jedi Temple and all its inhabitants, but Luke himself survived and went into exile, leaving behind only a map as a way to be tracked down. Snoke later sensed an \"awakening\" in the Force, in the form of the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the secret granddaughter of Palpatine, who formed a unique Force dyad with Ren. After Ren was defeated by Rey in a lightsaber duel and the Resistance destroyed [[Starkiller Base]], Snoke ordered [[General Hux]] to bring Ren to him, to complete his training.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', Snoke reprimanded Hux for his failure as a military leader, following a failed attack on the Resistance's base on [[D'Qar]], and Ren for his failure to find and kill Luke Skywalker, doubting his destiny to succeed Darth Vader. Ren later brought Rey to Snoke, who tortured her for information on Luke's location. He also revealed to Ren and Rey that he had created the psychic bond between them as part of a plan to destroy Luke himself. Snoke then ordered Ren to kill Rey, but he instead sliced Snoke in half, killing him on the spot. Ren and Rey then worked together to overpower Snoke's Praetorian Guards before Rey escaped. Shortly after, Ren pinned Snoke's death on her and declared himself the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. In ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]'', Ren met the resurrected Emperor Palpatine on Exegol, who revealed to him that he had created Snoke as a [[Puppet ruler|puppet]] to lure Ren to the Dark Side and control the First Order. Ren also observed several clones of Snoke at Palpatine's lair, but Snoke had already served his purpose and therefore Palpatine had no further use for them.\n\n==== Kylo Ren ====\n{{main|Kylo Ren}}\n\n[[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]] was the son of Rebel Alliance heroes [[Leia Organa]] and [[Han Solo]]. As the grandson of Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, Solo was powerful with the Force from birth and was trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker alongside numerous other Jedi, in an attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order. However, Ben was slowly manipulated by Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the First Order and a powerful master of the Dark Side of the Force, who made him believe that it was his destiny to succeed Darth Vader and finish what he started: wipe out the Jedi Order. Thus, after Luke sensed the darkness inside him and attempted to kill him in his sleep, Ben turned to the Dark Side, adopting the '''Kylo Ren''' persona, and, following the destruction of Luke's Jedi Order (due to a mysterious dark storm destroying Luke's Jedi Temple and all its inhabitants), joined a mysterious organization of Force-wielding warriors called the Knights of Ren. He eventually killed their leader and replaced him, becoming the new leader of the Knights of Ren, and later a high-ranking commander within the First Order as well. However, unknown to Ren, Luke survived the destruction of his temple and, blaming himself for Ben's fall to the Dark Side, went into exile on [[Ahch-To]]. Ren eventually learned of his uncle's survival and sought to destroy him and the Jedi Order once and for all.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', Ren led an attack on a village on [[Jakku]] in the search of a map that would lead the First Order to Luke, and captured Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]], who secretly gave the map to his droid [[BB-8]], which was eventually found by the scavenger Rey. Although Ren learned of this after interrogating Poe with the Force, the latter was liberated by the rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], who eventually found BB-8 and Rey and they all escaped from Jakku aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', along the way joining up with Ren's father Han Solo and [[Chewbacca]], who agreed to take them to [[Takodana]], from where they could hand BB-8 over to the Resistance. However, Ren soon learned of this and led another attack on Takodana to retrieve BB-8. Although he failed and the First Order was chased away by the Resistance, Ren instead captured Rey, having sensed that she saw the map, and took her away for interrogation on Starkiller Base. However, Ren failed to extract the information from her and his interrogation instead unlocked her Force abilities. Ren later killed his father to prove his allegiance to the Dark Side and was defeated by Rey in a lightsaber duel, before being forced to evacuate due to the Resistance destroying Starkiller Base.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', Ren tried to prove himself to Snoke after being defeated by Rey by leading the attack on the Resistance fleet, although he hesitated to kill his mother. He also formed a special Force connection with Rey, through which he revealed to her how Luke had tried to kill him on the night that he turned to the Dark Side, leading Rey to come to confront Ren, believing that there is still good in him. Ren brought Rey before Snoke, who ordered him to kill her, but he instead killed Snoke and then worked with Rey to defeat his Praetorian Guards. Ren offered Rey to rule the galaxy alongside him and detach herself from the past, claiming that her parents were nobodies, but after she refused, they fought over possession of Luke's lightsaber, which Rey had been using, leading to it being destroyed and Rey escaping. Ren then pinned Snoke's death on Rey and declared himself as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, before leading an attack on the remains of the Resistance on Crait. After Luke showed up to confront Ren and give the Resistance enough time to escape, Ren fought him, only to discover him to be a Force projection. As Ren screamed in anger, Luke died peacefully on Ahch-To, having used all his remaining energy to project himself on Crait, and the remains of the Resistance escaped aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]'', Ren tracked down the resurrected Emperor Palpatine to Exegol with the intent of killing him, as he considered him a threat to his reign, but instead learned that Palpatine had been the mastermind behind Snoke all along and had manipulated him to join the Dark Side. Palpatine then revealed the Final Order \u2014 an armada of [[Star Destroyer]]s equipped with canons capable of decimating entire planets \u2014 and offered Ren control of the fleet, thus giving him the means necessary of claiming the galaxy for himself, in exchange for killing his granddaughter, revealed to be none other than Rey. Although Ren accepted, he secretly planned to have Rey join him, so that together they could kill Palpatine and then rule the galaxy together. Ren then managed to track down Rey and her friends to [[Pasaana]] through their Force connection and their confrontation led to Rey using Force lightning to destroy a First Order transporter, which she believed [[Chewbacca]] had been taken prisoner on. Later, Rey and her friends infiltrated Ren's Star Destroyer above [[Kijimi]] to rescue Chewbacca after learning that he was still alive, and Ren was once again able to locate Rey through their connection, leading to another confrontation, during which Ren informed her of being Palpatine's granddaughter. Eventually, Rey and Ren dueled on the ocean moon [[Kef Bir]], where the ruins of the [[second Death Star]] were located, during which Leia used her last remaining energy to reach out to his son, in an attempt to redeem him, before dying. Distracted, Ren was defeated and fatally injured by Rey, but having sensed Leia's death as well, she quickly used Force heal to treat his injury and then left. Initially confused and conflicted, Ren had a Force vision of his father, similar to the moment when he killed him, but this time Solo convinced his son to abandon the Dark Side and his Kylo Ren persona, redeeming himself and becoming Ben Solo once again. Ben then came to Exegol to help Rey fight Palpatine, killing the Knights of Ren in the process, but the Emperor sensed the unique Force dyad that the two of them formed and sucked the life energy from them to rejuvenate himself and become the most powerful being in the galaxy. However, Rey was able to summon the spirits of all the past Jedi and kill Palpatine, but died in the process. Ben then used all his remaining life energy to revive her and they shared a kiss, before Ben collapsed to the ground, dying peacefully and becoming one with the Force.\n\n==== Knights of Ren ====\nThe Knights of Ren were an organization of masked Force-wielding warriors, who were neither Sith or Jedi, but a new generation of Dark Side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the supposed demise of the last Sith Lords, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. They had a code, to which they were flexible in the following: living life the way they wanted, taking what the galaxy gave them, and consuming what the Dark Side sent them. Their name came from a lightsaber called \"Ren\", which was at the base of their code and could only be wieled by their leader. The Knights consisted of six individuals named '''Vicrul''', '''Ap'lek''', '''Cardo''', '''Kuruk''', '''Trudgen''', and '''Ushar''', and, prior to the destruction of Luke Skywalker's new Jedi Order, they were led by another individual known simply as \"'''Ren'''\". Some of the Knights were students of Luke, who, similarly to their future leader, Kylo Ren, had lost their faith in the Jedi and succumbed to the Dark Side. Eventually, after the destruction of Luke's New Jedi Order (although Luke himself survived and went into exile), Ben Solo fell to Dark Side, before contacting the Knights with the intent of joining them. Eventually, Ben killed Ren and replaced him as the new leader of the Knights of Ren, adopting the name \"Kylo Ren\". The Knights first appeared in a vision to Rey in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', but played a more important role in ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''. After Kylo Ren became the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, the Knights became his personal guards and began following him more closely. When Kylo formed an alliance with the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, who ordered him to kill his granddaughter Rey, the Knights of Ren joined him in his hunt for her and were present during their confrontation on [[Pasaana]], where they captured [[Chewbacca]]. Later, after Kylo redeemed himself and became Ben Solo once again, the Knights instead swore their loyalty to Palpatine and served as his guards during the final Battle of Exegol, where they were all slaughtered by Ben, marking the end of the Knights of Ren.\n\n=== ''Legends'' non-canonical members of the Sith ===\n{{Main|Star Wars canon|Star Wars expanded universe|}}\nFollowing the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], Lucasfilm rebranded most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels, comics, and other fictional media published since the [[Star Wars (film)|original 1977 film]] (previously identified as the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe) as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared them [[Star Wars canon|non-canonical to the franchise]] in April 2014.<ref name=\"SW Adult\">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Sith feature heavily in many stories of the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe (EU), appearing in a variety of media created prior to the advent of the 2015 feature film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.<ref>Ars Technica Op-ed: Disney takes a chainsaw to the Star Wars expanded universe, 1/10/2014</ref> Future authors and screenwriters are not required to honor all of the events depicted in this material, but the Expanded Universe has remained a source of creative inspiration. The EU thoroughly details the schism between the dissident \u201cDark Jedi\u201d and the Jedi establishment that led to the creation of the Sith Order, as well a series of conflicts between the Sith, Jedi and the Galactic Republic spanning the millennia prior to the events of the ''Star Wars'' motion picture series, and certain events thereafter.\n\nIn the EU, the Sith trace their origins to the followers of a dissident Jedi named Ajunta Pall, who endorsed the use of the Dark Side of the Force, contrary to Jedi orthodoxy.<ref>Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side</ref> After Pall and his \u201cDark Jedi\u201d followers were exiled for their practices, they eventually settled on a planet named Korriban, which was occupied by the \"Sith,\" a red-skinned humanoid race with a high prevalence of Force-sensitives. Over the course of centuries of intermingling between the ethnic Sith and Dark Jedi, the name \"Sith\" would come to apply to the martial philosophy and political affiliation created by the former Jedi exiles on Korriban, rather than a specific race. This Sith regime would strike out at the Galactic Republic and Jedi on numerous occasions. Notable conflicts between the Sith and the Galactic Republic include the \"Great Hyperspace War,\" in which the Sith would launch a massive invasion of the Republic but succumb to infighting, and the \u201cSith Holocaust,\u201d in which the Galactic Republic failed in its attempt to exterminate the Sith from known space, leading the Sith survivors to take a vow of eternal vengeance on the Galactic Republic. The EU also describes the exploits of Sith characters following the collapse of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire and the restoration of the Republic, such as the attempt by \u201cDarth Krayt\u201d to establish a New Sith Order on Korriban.\n\nThe first Expanded Universe novel was ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', written by [[Alan Dean Foster]] and published in 1978. The setting for the novel takes place between ''[[Star Wars (film)|Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]''. It provides a new adventure that includes [[Princess Leia]], [[R2-D2]], [[C-3PO]], [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Darth Vader]]. In the story, Darth Vader tries to get the Kyber Crystal to use it for his evil schemes.\n\nOther novels that depict Sith characters are ''[[Darth Maul: Saboteur]]'' and ''[[Cloak of Deception]]'' by [[James Luceno]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Luceno|first=James|title=Star Wars: Cloak of Deception|year=2002|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79570-0}}</ref> ''Cloak of Deception'' describes the political background surrounding the Republic in the time period before ''The Phantom Menace'', as well as Darth Sidious' plans to rule the galaxy, starting with the blockade of Naboo.\nIn ''Darth Maul: Saboteur'', the Sith Lord Darth Sidious sends Darth Maul to destroy InterGalactic Ore and Lommite Limited.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luceno|first=James|title=Darth Maul:Saboteur|year=2001|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-44735-7}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter]]'', by [[Michael Reaves]], Darth Sidious sends his apprentice, Darth Maul, to investigate the traitor who leaked the secret of his plan to take down the Republic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reaves|first=Michael|title=Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter|url=https://archive.org/details/darthmaulshadowh00reav|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Ballantine Publishing Group|isbn=0-345-43541-9}}</ref> ''Shadow Hunter'' provided insight into the Sith while detailing how Darth Sidious brought his plan of usurpation into action.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] purchased the copyrights to several Star Wars stories.<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Company/Timeline|work=www.darkhorse.com|publisher=Dark Horse|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> With their publication of ''Star Wars: Dark Empire #1'' in 1991, they initiated what has become a large line of ''Star Wars'' manga and comics.<ref name=\"Lavin 1998\">{{cite journal|last=Lavin|first=Michael R.|title=A Librarian's Guide to Dark Horse Comics|journal=Serials Review|year=1998|volume=24|issue=3/4}}</ref> The Sith appear as major antagonists throughout this story's plot.<ref name=\"Lavin 1998\" /> Many of the comics that were published helped expand the backstory of the characters and followed the rise and fall of the Dark Lords of the Sith.<ref name=\"Lavin 1998\" />\n\nStar Wars video games have also been adapted from the plots of the films, novels, and TV shows. The games follow the basic plot of the story, but they can also include alternative, non-canonical, endings depending on which character is being played. Some of the video games that have a heavy focus on Sith characters and lore are ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', released in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/pc-16512|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref> ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords]]'', released in 2004<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords/pc-608569|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'', released in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: The Force Unleashed|url=http://www.lucasarts.com/games/theforceunleashed/|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===== Darth Caedus =====\n[[Jacen Solo|Darth Caedus]] (Jacen Solo) was a Dark Lord of the Sith born as the oldest son of [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa Solo]]. A Jedi hero of the Yuuzhan Vong War, he eventually fell to the Dark Side years later and masterminded the Second Galactic Civil War. He was eventually killed by his twin sister Jaina for his actions.\n\n===== Marka Ragnos =====\n[[Marka Ragnos]] was an ancient Sith-human hybrid Sith Lord, who lived during the time of the first Sith Empire, and seized the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, serving as the ruler of the Empire. After his death, two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, fought to occupy his throne, only for Ragnos' spirit to appear before them and claim that only the most worthy should succeed him. Ragnos lived on as a Force spirit following his death, trapped within his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. A thousand years after the Dark Lord's death, Exar Kun summoned Ragnos from his grave through the use of talismans. Ragnos crowned Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord, with Ulic Qel-Droma as Kun's apprentice, as an attempt to resurrect the lost empire thousands of years prior. Several thousands of years after that, in the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'' (set during the New Republic era), a cult dedicated to Ragnos, led by the Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis, raised as a new threat to the galaxy, with the intent of resurrecting the Sith Lord using an old artifact called the Scepter of Ragnos. After absorbing Froce energy from numerous locations across the galaxy using the scepter, Tavion and her cult traveled to Korriban and almost succeeded in resurrecting Ragnos, but were stopped by Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. Inside Ragnos' tomb, the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr defeated Tavion, before Ragnos' spirit emerged and possessed her body, attempting to kill the Jedi. However, Jaden was able to defeat Ragnos, whose spirit left Tavion's body and returned to the depths of the Force, swearing revenge against the Jedi.\n\n===== Darth Venamis =====\nDarth Venamis was a Bith Dark Lord of the Sith who served as Darth Tenebrous' secret apprentice, as it was a violation of the Rule of Two. After Tenebrous was killed by his other apprentice, Darth Plagueis, he eventually found and defeated Venamis, before capturing him and using him as a test subject for his midi-chlorians experiments over the following years. After decades of torture and being killed and then brought back to life over and over again, Plaugeis finally allowed Venamis to die, having served his purpose. However, he later revived again in the presence of his new apprentice, Darth Sidious, until Venamis' organs finally ceased to function, and he died for the final time.\n\n==== ''Knights of the Old Republic'' series Sith Lords ====\n\n===== '''Darth Malak''' =====\n[[Darth Malak]] (Alek) is the main antagonist of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. Once a Jedi Knight and Revan's best friend, the two of them fought together in the Mandalorian Wars. At some point, Malak was injured in battle and had his entire lower jaw cut off, forcing him to don a prosthetic jaw instead. Later, Malak and Revan unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire in the Unknown Regions and were captured by the Sith Emperor, who, using Sith sorcery, turned them to the Dark Side, but the two broke free from hisr control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Malak as his Sith Apprentice. When Revan prepared to battle the Jedi who boarded his flagship, Malak betrayed him, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge, so that he could take over the Sith Empire for himself. However, Revan survived the ordeal and was taken to the Jedi Council Enclave, where he had his memory wiped, so that he would become a Jedi once again. Eventually, Revan faced off against Malak, who revealed the truth of his identity, but was ultimately killed in battle by his former friend and Sith Master, which also led to the downfall of his Empire.\n\n=====Darth Traya=====\n[[Darth Traya]] (Kreia) is a mentor to the \"Jedi Exile\" in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords]]''.<ref name=\"Meet Your Team\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/569/569765p1.html |title=KOTOR 2: Meet Your Team |author=Hilary Goldstein |date=30 November 2004 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"gsinterview2\">{{cite video |date=8 May 2004 |title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Developer Interview 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/video/920194/6096604/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-developer-interview-2 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> She is revealed to have been a Sith Master at the end of the game, and is ultimately killed in battle.\n\n===== Darth Sion =====\n[[Darth Sion]], also known as the Lord of Pain, is an antagonist in [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords'']]. Alongside Darth Nihilus, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Sion managed to achieve immortality by calling on his pain, anger and hatred every time he was facing certain death, at the expense of all-consuming agony, which also led to his extremely disfigured appearance. The player's character eventually defeated Sion, and was then given the option to turn him back to the light side. Regardless, upon being shown the price he paid for immortality, Sion finally let go of his hate and allowed himself to die permanently.\n\n===== Darth Nihilus =====\n[[Darth Nihilus]], also known as the Lord of Hunger, is an antagonist in [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords|''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \u2013 The Sith Lords'']]. Alongside Darth Sion, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Nihilus imbued his dark soul into his mask and robes and had the power to drain the life force out of any living thing. Following the betrayal of his master, Nihilus used the might of the Sith Armada not to conquer planets, but to contain them so that he could \"feed\" off the Force energy of each planet's lifeforms, wiping planets of life. However, Nihilus was later drawn out and tricked into launching an attack on Telos, believing it to contain the last Jedi. The Exile confronted Nihilus on his ship, and Nihilus was killed either after his former slave Visas sacrificed herself due to their shared link in the Force, or after his attempt to feast on the Exile's connection to the Force backfired and weakened him. Despite his death, Nihilus' soul would continue to live in his mask and robes for millennia to come, as well as inside his own Sith holocron. \n\n=====Lord Vitiate=====\nKnown for much of his 1300-year life as \"the Sith Emperor\", Lord Vitiate was a sociopathic young lord in one of the earliest iterations of the Sith Empire. When that empire fell, he led an exodus of survivors to the other side of the galaxy to establish a continuation of it, with himself as Emperor. It was Vitiate who corrupted Revan and Malak, but Revan's redemption and Malak's defeat seemingly derailed his plans. Three hundred years after Revan's disappearance, the Emperor launched a surprise attack on the Republic, setting the stage for the video game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''.\n\n===== Vindican =====\nVindican was a male Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of the Sith species itself, who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. He was the master of Darth Malgus and, alongside him, joined the Sith Empire fleet on the attack of a Republic fleet over Korriban, with the intent of retaking the planet from the Jedi. Aboard the cruiser, Vindican and Malgus dueled a Zabrak Jedi Master named Kao Cen Darach and his apprentice, Satele Shan, but the latter managed to escape, and Vindican was severely injured by Darach. After killing him, Malgus looked down upon his fallen master and, in an act true to the Rule of Two, executed him with his own lightsaber, thus becoming the new Sith Master.\n\n===== Darth Malgus =====\n[[Darth Malgus]] (Veradun) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith and apprentice to Vindican, who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. Following the recapture of Korriban from the Jedi, Malgus killed his master and later led a surprise assault on Alderaan, only to be defeated by his nemesis and former opponent from Korriban, Satele Shan. Malgus was severely injured in the fight against Shan, forcing him to wear a respiratory apparatus for the rest of his life. Some time later, Malgus was tasked by his superior, Darth Angral, with leading an assault team on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, which Malgus and his forces destroyed, disgracing the Jedi Order in the eyes of the Republic. Although Malgus believed that the battle of Coruscant was the first step of destroying the Republic, it only served as leverage in the peace negotiations that took place on Alderaan. While the Alderaanian summit progressed, the Sith settled into an occupation of Coruscant. Malgus was placed in charge of orbital security, but the Sith Lord defied his orders and traveled back to Coruscant's surface to strike against the renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, who wanted to avenge her master Ven Zallow, whom Malgus killed during the attack on the Jedi Temple. Although Leneer ultimately failed, the conflict caused Malgus to become disillusioned with the Empire and to kill his lover Eleena Daru, seeing their relationship as a weakness that prevented him from preserving his own power, which he later used to cleanse the Empire of the politicians whom he blamed for allowing the Republic to survive. During the Cold War years that followed the successful peace negotiations, Malgus led Sith forces into the Unknown Regions, claiming previously-unknown territories for the Empire. Towards the end of the war, following the presumed death of the Sith Emperor and after serving on the Dark Council, Malgus declared his own Empire, free of the infighting of the Dark Council. However, the Republic and the Sith Empire forces soon teamed up to fight against Malgus' Empire and managed to track him down to his secret base he was tracked down to his secret base, where he was defeated. Despite his presumed death, Malgus later resurfaced during the Invasion of Ossus at the start of the Third Galactic War, once again serving as a commander within the Sith Empire. However, following the Battle of Corellia, Malgus went rogue, determined to expunge all physical and mental restraints used to keep him under control. Thousands of years after his death, Malgus was still remembered as one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived, with Darth Sidious even retrieving some surviving excerpts of Malgus's journals from an antiquities dealer and bounding them into his ''Book of Sith'', an anthology of Sith historical writings.\n\n===Sith Eternal===\nThe 2019 film ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' depicts thousands of Sith cultists and loyalists known as the '''Sith Eternal'''.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/12/21/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-exegol-sith-planet-wayfinder-explained |title=Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker's Hidden Planet Explained |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=21 December 2019 |accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref> They are located on the Sith planet [[Exegol]], which is described in the film as the \"hidden world of the Sith\".<ref name=\"Slate\"/> The film depicts the Sith loyalists as having built a secret armada of [[Star Destroyer]]s, known as the Final Order, at the behest of [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] (Darth Sidious).

He continued the expansion of the empire that his father had begun, and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions of Europe]] and [[Mongol conquests#East Asia|East Asia]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', p. 74.</ref> Like all of Genghis' primary sons, he participated extensively in conquests in [[China]], [[Iran]], and [[Central Asia]].\n\n==Background==\n\u00d6gedei was the third son of [[Genghis Khan]] and [[B\u00f6rte|B\u00f6rte Ujin]]. He participated in the turbulent events of his father's rise. When \u00d6gedei was 17 years old, Genghis Khan experienced the disastrous defeat of [[Khalakhaljid Sands]] against the army of [[Jamukha]]. \u00d6gedei was heavily wounded and lost on the battlefield.<ref>Secret history of the Mongols, $3, II</ref> His father's adopted brother and companion Borokhula rescued him. Although he was already married, in 1204 his father gave him [[T\u00f6regene]], the wife of a defeated [[Merkit]] chief. The addition of such a wife was not uncommon in [[steppe]] culture.\n\nAfter Genghis was proclaimed Emperor or [[Khagan]] in 1206, ''myangans'' (thousands) of the [[Jalayir]], Besud, [[Suldus]], and [[Khongqatan]] clans were given to him as his [[appanage]]. \u00d6gedei's territory occupied the [[Emil (river)|Emil]] and [[Hobok]] rivers. According to his father's wish, [[Ilugei]], the commander of the Jalayir, became \u00d6gedei's tutor.\n\n\u00d6gedei, along with his brothers, campaigned independently for the first time in November 1211 against the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]]. He was sent to ravage the land south through [[Hebei]] and then north through [[Shanxi]] in 1213. \u00d6gedei's force drove the Jin garrison out of the [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], and he rode to the juncture of the [[Xi Xia]], Jin, and Song domains.<ref>Marvin C Whiting ''Imperial Chinese Military History'', p. 355.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|Mongol conquest of Eastern Persia]], \u00d6gedei and [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]] massacred the residents of [[Otrar]] after a five-month siege in 1219\u201320 and joined [[Jochi]] who was outside the walls of [[Urganch]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', p. 57.</ref> Because Jochi and Chagatai were quarreling over the military strategy, \u00d6gedei was appointed by Genghis Khan to oversee the siege of Urganch.<ref>John Powell ''Magill's Guide to Military History: Jap-Pel'', p. 1148.</ref> They captured the city in 1221.

[[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], early 14th century.]]\n\nThe Empress Yisui insisted that [[Genghis Khan]] designate an heir before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] in 1219. After the terrible brawl between two elder sons Jochi and Chagatai, they agreed that \u00d6gedei was to be chosen as heir. Genghis confirmed their decision.\n\nGenghis Khan died in 1227, and Jochi had died a year or two earlier. \u00d6gedei's younger brother [[Tolui]] held the regency until 1229. \u00d6gedei was elected supreme khan in 1229, according to the [[kurultai]] held at Kodoe Aral on the [[Kherlen River]] after Genghis' death, although this was never really in doubt as it was Genghis' clear wish that he be succeeded by \u00d6gedei. After ritually declining three times, \u00d6gedei was proclaimed Khagan of the [[Mongols]] on 13 September 1229.<ref>[[Michael Prawdin]], Gerard (INT) Chaliand, ''The Mongol Empire'', p. 237.</ref> Chagatai continued to support his younger brother's claim.\n\nGenghis Khan saw \u00d6gedei as having a courteous and generous character.<ref>The Secret history of the Mongols</ref> His charisma is partially credited for his success in keeping the Empire on his father's path. Thanks mostly to the organization left behind by Genghis Khan, and to the personality of \u00d6gedei, the affairs of the Mongol Empire remained for the most part stable during his reign. \u00d6gedei was a pragmatic man, though he made some mistakes during his reign. \u00d6gedei had no delusions that he was his father's equal as a military commander or organizer and used the abilities of those he found most capable.\n\nNotwithstanding reports of his charisma, \u00d6gedei was criticized by Mongol and Persian chroniclers for a crime he committed in 1237, which according to Persian chroniclers consisted of ordering the rape of four thousand [[Oirats|Oirat]] girls above the age of seven. These girls were then confiscated for \u00d6gedei's harem or given to caravan hostels throughout the Mongol Empire for use as prostitutes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> This move brought the Oirat and their lands under \u00d6gedei's control following the death of \u00d6gedei's sister Checheyigen, who previously controlled Oirat lands.<ref>{{Citation|last=Weatherford, Jack, 1946-|title=The secret history of the Mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|date=2010|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=978-0307407153|oclc=951745549}}, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n== World conquests ==\n\n=== Expansion in the Middle East ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|l1=Mongol conquest of Persia}}\n{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}\n\nAfter destroying the Khwarazmian empire, Genghis Khan was free to move against [[Western Xia]]. In 1226, however, [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the last of the Khwarizm monarchs, returned to [[Persia]] to revive the empire lost by his father, [[Muhammad \u2018Ala al-Din II.]] The Mongol forces sent against him in 1227 were defeated at [[Dameghan]]. Another army that marched against Jalal al-Din scored a pyrrhic victory in the vicinity of [[Isfahan]] but was unable to follow up that success.\n\nWith \u00d6gedei's consent to launch a campaign, [[Chormaqan]] left [[Bukhara]] at the head of 30,000 to 50,000 Mongol soldiers.  He occupied Persia and [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], two long-standing bases of Khwarazmian support. Crossing the [[Amu Darya River]] in 1230 and entering Khorasan without encountering any opposition, Chormaqan passed through quickly. He left a sizable contingent behind under the command of Dayir Noyan, who had further instructions to invade western [[Afghanistan]]. Chormaqan and the majority of his army then entered the northern section of Persia known as Mazandaran in the autumn of 1230, thus avoiding the mountainous area south of the [[Caspian Sea]]. That region was controlled by the [[Ismailis]].\n\nUpon reaching the city of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], Chormaqan made his winter camp there and dispatched his armies to pacify the rest of northern Persia. In 1231, he led his army southward and quickly captured the cities of [[Qum]] and [[Hamadan]]. From there, he sent armies into the regions of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kirman]], whose rulers quickly submitted, preferring to pay tribute to Mongol overlords rather than having their states ravaged. Meanwhile, further east, Dayir steadily achieved his goals in capturing [[Kabul]], Ghazni, and Zawulistan. With the Mongols already in control of Persia, Jalal al-Din was isolated in Transcaucasia where he was banished. Thus all of Persia was added to the Mongol Empire.\n\n=== The fall of the Jin dynasty ===\n{{See also|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nAt the end of 1230, responding to the Jin's unexpected defeat of the Mongol general Doqulkhu, the Khagan went south to [[Shanxi]] province with [[Tolui]], clearing the area of the Jin forces and taking the city of [[Fengxiang]]. After passing the summer in the north, they again campaigned against the Jin in [[Henan]], cutting through territory of South China to assault the Jin's rear. By 1232 the Jin Emperor was [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|besieged in his capital]] of [[Kaifeng]]. \u00d6gedei soon departed, leaving the final conquest to his generals. After taking several cities, the Mongols, with the belated assistance of the [[Song dynasty]], destroyed the Jin with the [[Siege of Caizhou|fall of Caizhou]] in February 1234. However, a viceroy of the Song murdered a Mongol ambassador, and the Song armies recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, [[Luoyang]], and [[Chang'an]], which were now ruled by the Mongols.\n\nIn addition to the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|war with the Jin dynasty]], \u00d6gedei crushed the [[Eastern Xia]] founded by [[Puxian Wannu]] in 1233, pacifying southern [[Manchuria]]. \u00d6gedei subdued the [[Tungusic peoples|Water Tatars]] in the northern part of the region and suppressed their rebellion in 1237.\n\n=== Conquest of Georgia and Armenia ===\n[[File:Geor tamro aandersen.png|250px|thumb|\u00d6gedei conquered the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Georgia and Armenia}}\n\nThe Mongols under Chormaqan returned to the [[Caucasus]] in 1232. The walls of [[Ganjak]] were breached by [[catapult]] and [[battering ram]] in 1235. The Mongols eventually withdrew after the citizens of [[Irbil]] agreed to send a yearly tribute to the court of the khagan. Chormaqan waited until 1238, when the force of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] was also active in the north Caucasus.<ref>Timothy May-Mongol Empire: Chormaquan and the Mongol Conquest of the Middle East</ref> After subduing [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenia]], Chormaqan took [[Tiflis]]. In 1238, the Mongols captured [[Lorhe]] whose ruler, [[Shahanshah]], fled with his family before the Mongols arrived, leaving the rich city to its fate. After putting up a spirited defense at [[Hohanaberd]], the city's ruler, [[Hasan Jalal]], submitted to the Mongols. Another column then advanced against Gaian, ruled by Prince Avak. The Mongol commander Tokhta ruled out a direct assault and had his men construct a wall around the city, and Avak soon surrendered. By 1240, Chormaqan had completed the conquest of [[Transcaucasia]], forcing the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] nobles to surrender.\n\n=== Invasion of Korea ===\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Korea}}\nIn 1224, a Mongol envoy was killed in obscure circumstances and Korea stopped paying [[tribute]].<ref>Michel Ho\u00e0ng, Ingrid Cranfield ''Genghis Khan'', p. 159.</ref> \u00d6gedei dispatched [[Saritai]] to subdue Korea and avenge the dead envoy in 1231. Thus, Mongol armies began to [[Mongol invasions of Korea|invade Korea]] in order to subdue the kingdom. The [[Goryeo]] King temporarily submitted and agreed to accept [[darughachi|Mongol overseers]]. When they withdrew for the summer, however, [[Choe U]] moved the capital from [[Kaesong]] to [[Ganghwa Island|Ganghwa]] Island. Saritai was hit with a stray arrow and died as he campaigned against them.\n\n\u00d6gedei announced plans for the conquest of the [[Koreans]], the [[Southern Song]], the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]]s and their European allies, all of whom killed Mongol [[diplomat|envoy]]s, at the kurultai in Mongolia in 1234. \u00d6gedei appointed Danqu commander of the Mongol army and made Bog Wong, a defected Korean general, governor of 40 cities with their subjects. When the court of Goryeo sued for peace in 1238, \u00d6gedei demanded that the king of Goryeo appear before him in person. The Goryeo king finally sent his relative Yeong Nong-gun Sung with ten noble boys to [[Mongolia]] as [[hostage]]s, temporarily ending the war in 1241.<ref>J.Bor ''Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir, vol.II'', p. 197.</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Capture of the Mongol-Tatars Russian city.jpg|230px|thumb|The Mongol army captures a [[Rus' people|Rus']] city]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\n\nThe Mongol Empire expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]] to subdue the Russian steppe and drive into Europe. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal, and [[Principality of Minsk|Minsk]], which became part of [[Lithuania]]), Hungary, Poland, Serbia and Bulgaria. During the siege of [[Kolomna]], the Khagan's half brother Khulgen<ref>He was the son of Genghis Khan by Khulan khatun of the Merkid clan.</ref> was killed by an arrow.\n\nAfter the conquest of [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Alania]], and the Rus' principalities, \u00d6gedei's son [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] and Chagatai's grandson [[B\u00fcri]] ridiculed Batu, and the Mongol camp suffered dissension. The Khagan harshly criticized G\u00fcy\u00fck: \"You broke the spirit of every man in your army...Do you think that the Russians surrendered because of how mean you were to your own men?\". He then sent G\u00fcy\u00fck back to continue the conquest of Europe. G\u00fcy\u00fck and another of \u00d6gedei's sons, [[Kadan]], attacked [[Transylvania]] and Poland, respectively.\n\n\u00d6gedei Khan had granted permission to invade the remainder of Europe, all the way to the \"Great Sea\", the Atlantic Ocean; his death prevented the invasions from continuing west, as Batu withdrew to participate in the election of a successor.\n\n=== Conflict with Song China ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}\n\nIn a series of razzias from 1235 to 1245, the Mongols commanded by \u00d6gedei's sons penetrated deep into the Song Dynasty and reached [[Chengdu]], [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]] and [[Yangtze River]]. But they could not succeed in completing their conquest due to climate and the number of Song troops, and \u00d6gedei's son Khochu died in the process. In 1240, \u00d6gedei's other son [[Khuden]] dispatched a subsidiary expedition to [[Tibet]]. The situation between the two nations worsened when Song officers murdered \u00d6gedei's envoys headed by Selmus.<ref>Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States'', p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe Mongol expansion throughout the Asian continent under the leadership of \u00d6gedei helped bring political stability and re-establish the [[Silk Road]], the primary trading route between East and West.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of India}}\n\n\u00d6gedei appointed Dayir commander of Ghazni and Menggetu commander in [[Qonduz]]. In winter 1241 the Mongol force invaded the [[Indus valley]] and besieged [[Lahore]], which was controlled by the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. However, Dayir died storming the town, on 30 December 1241, and the Mongols butchered the town before withdrawing from the [[Delhi Sultanate]].<ref>Islamic Culture Board ''Islamic culture'', p. 256.</ref>\n\nSome time after 1235 another Mongol force invaded [[Kashmir]], stationing a [[darughachi]] there for several years. Soon Kashmir became a Mongolian dependency.<ref>[[Thomas T. Allsen]] ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p. 84.</ref> Around the same time, a Kashmiri [[Buddhist]] master, Otochi, and his brother Namo arrived at the court of \u00d6gedei.\n\n== Administration ==\n\u00d6gedei began the bureaucratization of Mongol administration. Three divisions constituted his administration: \n* the [[Christians|Christian]] eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], represented by Chinqai, the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[scribe]], and the [[Keraites]].\n* the Islamic cycle, represented by two [[Khorazm]]ians, Mahumud Yalavach, and Masud Beg.\n*the [[North Chinese]] [[Confucian]] circle, represented by [[Yelu Chucai]], a [[Khitan people|Khitan]], and Nianhe Zhong-shan, a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]].\n\nMahamud Yalavach promoted a system in which the government would delegate tax collection to [[tax farmer]]s who collect payments in silver. Yelu Chucai encouraged \u00d6gedei to institute a traditional Chinese system of government, with taxation in the hands of government agents and payment in a government issued currency. The Muslim merchants, working with capital supplied by the Mongol aristocrats, [[loan]]ed at higher [[interest rate|interest]] the silver needed for tax payments. At the same time the Mongols began circulating [[paper currency]] backed by silver reserves.\n\n[[File:Ogedei qaghan.svg|thumb|left|40px|''\u00d6gedei Khan'' in traditional [[Mongolian script]]]]\n\n\u00d6gedei abolished the branch departments of state affairs and divided the areas of Mongol-ruled China into ten routes according to the suggestion of Yel\u00fc Chucai. He also divided the empire into [[Beshbalik]] and [[Yanjing]] administration, while the headquarters in Karakorum directly dealt with Manchuria, Mongolia and Siberia. Late in his reign, [[Amu Darya]] administration was established. [[Turkestan]] was administered by Mahamud Yalavach, while Yelu Chucai administered North China from 1229 to 1240. \u00d6gedei appointed [[Shigi Khutugh]] chief judge in China. In [[Iran]], \u00d6gedei appointed first Chin-temur, a [[Kara-kitai]], and then [[Korguz]], an Uyghur who proved to be honest administrator. Later, some of Yelu Chucai's duties were transferred to Mahamud Yalavach and taxes were handed over to Abd-ur-Rahman, who promised to double the annual payments of silver.<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 102.</ref> The Ortoq or partner merchants lent \u00d6gedei's money at exorbitant rates of interest to the peasants, though \u00d6gedei banned considerably higher rates. Despite it proving profitable, many people fled their homes to avoid the tax collectors and their strong-arm gangs.\n\n\u00d6gedei had imperial princes tutored by the Christian scribe Qadaq and the [[Taoist]] priest Li Zhichang and built schools and an academy. \u00d6gedei Khan also decreed to issue paper currency backed by [[silk]] reserves and founded a Department responsible for destroying old notes. Yelu Chucai protested to \u00d6gedei that his large-scale distribution of [[appanage]]s in Iran, [[Western China|Western]] and North China, and Khorazm could lead to a disintegration of the Empire.<ref>Chunjiang Fu, Asiapac Editorial, Liping Yang ''Chinese History'', p. 148.</ref> \u00d6gedei thus decreed that the Mongol nobles could appoint overseers in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes.\n\nThe Khagan proclaimed the Great [[Yassa]] as an integral body of precedents, confirming the continuing validity of his father's commands and ordinances, while adding his own. \u00d6gedei codified rules of dress and conduct during the kurultais. Throughout the Empire, in 1234, he created postroad stations ([[Yam (route)|Yam]]) with a permanent staff who would supply post riders' needs.<ref>Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach ''Medieval Islamic Civilization'', p. 632.</ref> Relay stations were set up every 25 miles and the yam staff supplied remounts to the envoys and served specified rations. The attached households were exempt from other taxes, but they had to pay a qubchuri tax to supply the goods. \u00d6gedei ordered Chagatai and Batu to control their yams separately. The Khagan prohibited the nobility from issuing [[paiza]]s (tablets that gave the bearer authority to demand goods and services from civilian populations) and [[jarliq]]s. \u00d6gedei decreed that within decimal units one out of every 100 [[sheep]] of the well-off should be levied for the poor of the unit, and that one sheep and one mare from every herd should be forwarded to form a [[herd]] for the imperial table.<ref>Mongolia Society \u2013 Occasional Papers \u2013 p. 17.</ref>\n\n== Karakorum ==\n[[File:Karakorum - Tortue Sud.jpg|thumb|[[Bixi (tortoise)|Stone tortoise]] of Karakorum]]\n{{Main|Karakorum}}\n\nFrom 1235\u201338 \u00d6gedei constructed a series of palaces and [[pavilion]]s at stopping places in his annual [[nomad]]ic route through central Mongolia. The first palace Wanangong was constructed by North Chinese artisans. The Emperor urged his relatives build residences nearby and settled the deported craftsmen from China near the site. The construction of the city, [[Karakorum]] (\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c), was finished in 1235, assigning different quarters to Islamic and North Chinese craftsmen, who competed to win \u00d6gedei's favor. Earthen walls with 4 gates surrounded the city. Attached were private apartments, while in front of stood a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] bearing an engraved pillar, like those that were commonly used in East Asia. There was a castle with doors like the gates of the garden and a series of lakes where many water fowl gathered. \u00d6gedei erected several houses of worship for his Buddhist, Muslim, Taoist, and Christian followers. In the Chinese ward, there was a Confucian temple where Yelu Chucai used to create or regulate a calendar on the Chinese model.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:\u00d6gedei Khan Statue.JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of \u00d6gedei Khan in Mongolia]]\n\n\u00d6gedei was considered to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the force of his personality. He was a physically big, jovial, and charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set.{{Citation needed|reason=many Reliable Sources exist-the editor should have referenced!|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe sudden death of [[Tolui]] in 1232 seems to have affected \u00d6gedei deeply. According to some sources, Tolui sacrificed his own life, accepting a poisoned drink in shamanist ritual in order to save \u00d6gedei who was suffering from illness.<ref>Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Rudi Paul Lindner, Valentin Aleksandrovich ''The Uralic and Altaic Series'', p. 176.</ref> Other sources say \u00d6gedei orchestrated Tolui's death with the help of shamans who drugged the alcoholic Tolui.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=92|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\n\u00d6gedei was well known for his [[alcoholism]]. Chagatai entrusted an official to watch his habit, but \u00d6gedei managed to drink anyway.  It is commonly told that \u00d6gedei did so by vowing to reduce the number of cups he drank a day then having cups twice the size created for his personal use. When he died at dawn on 11 December 1241, after a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman, the people blamed the sister of Tolui's widow and Abd-ur-Rahman. The Mongol aristocrats recognized, however, that the Khagan's own lack of self-control had killed him.\n\n\u00d6gedei was also known to be a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a [[dictator]].<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 104.</ref> Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to establish a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was a pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.\n\nHowever, Mongol and Persian chroniclers criticize \u00d6gedei for a crime he committed in 1237 which violated the laws of his father, Genghis Khan, which forbade seizure, rape, kidnapping, bartering, or selling young girls, who were allowed to be married at a young age but could not engage in sexual activity until the age of sixteen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> Mongol chronicles were vague about the nature of the crime, but Persian chroniclers indicated that after the Oirat did not send girls for \u00d6gedei's harem, \u00d6gedei had four thousand Oirat girls above the age of seven stripped naked and raped by his soldiers repeatedly in full sight of the girls' relatives. Two of these girls died from the ordeal, and the remaining non-raped were divided up by soldiers, with some being sent to the royal harem, and others assigned to caravan hostels for sexual servitude, and others not deemed suitable for this were left present for anyone to carry them away or use them for any purposes deemed fit. \u00d6gedei seems not to have done this out of sexual depravity as such, but more to consolidate power over the Oirat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\nThe above account, including the assumption that Mongol sources criticized the crime (still questionable), was described in Jack Weatherford's 2011 book ''The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire''. Weatherford calls it \"the most horrendous crime of his twelve-year reign and one of the worst Mongol atrocities recorded\". A more recent book in feminist historiography \"Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire\" (2018) by Anne F. Broadbridge links the \"infamous alleged mass rape of Oirat girls\" to \u00d6gedei's requisitioning of girls from his uncle Tem\u00fcge Otchigin's territories without Tem\u00fcge's approval.

In Chapter 32 Juvayni starts by praising \u00d6gedei Khan then proceeds to give 50 highly detailed anecdotes to illustrate \u00d6gedei's \"clemency, forgiveness, justice and generosity\" followed by one anecdote to illustrate his \"violence, severity, fury and awesomeness\" which was the rape incident. This anecdote closes the chapter. The name of the tribe is unclear in two manuscripts of Juvayni but Manuscript D and Rashid-Al-Din give it as Oirat. Broadbridge and De Rachewiltz questioned the factual accuracy of this identification with the Oirats.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broadbridge |first1=Anne F. |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |page=187}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032\u20131035}}</ref> The anecdotes are written in the style of a Persian tale.

This anecdote contradicts the standard account of \u00d6gedei's death from a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman. A number of anecdotes evince a tone of ridicule for \u00d6gedei's lack of self-control. While the anecdotes may contain a kernel of truth some seem to be apocryphal legends originating from the community of Muslim merchants and should be approached with a degree of caution. Another Persian account was the mass sodomy against soldiers of the Jin Dynasty quoted in Rashid-Al-Din and noted by Weatherford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref> Homosexuality was taboo among the Mongols and punishable by death, so the factual accuracy of this \"act of the people of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]\" (Rashid-Al-Din) is still debatable. While Juvayni is a valuable source of information about the Mongol Empire his writings are commonly inflated, as when he estimates the strength of the Mongol army at 700,000, against other accounts that put the number between 105,000 and 130,000. Biased readings of Juvayni's account and projection of modern sensitivities backward in time has also led to the popular but unfounded theory that \u00d6gedei's wife T\u00f6regene and Fatima were in fact lesbian lovers. It is also notable that when Juvayni started writing the [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]] in Karakorum in the year 1252 the \u00d6gedeid faction had been purged by [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] so anti-\u00d6gedei bias could have been widespread.\n\n==Aftermath of \u00d6gedei's death==\n\n\u00d6gedei had nominated his grandson Shiremun as his heir, but G\u00fcy\u00fck eventually succeeded him after the five-year regency of his widow [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]]. However, Batu, the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] (also known as the Kipchak Khanate or the Ulus of Jochi) only nominally accepted G\u00fcy\u00fck, who died on the way to confront Batu. It was not until 1255, well into the reign of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], that Batu felt secure enough to again prepare to invade Europe. He died before his plans could be implemented.\n\nWhen [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271, he had \u00d6gedei Khan placed on the official record as Taizong ({{zh|\u592a\u5b97|T\u00e0iz\u014dng}}).\n\n== Spouses and children ==\nLike his father Genghis Khan, \u00d6gedei had many wives and concubines.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rash\u012bd al-D\u012bn \u1e6cab\u012bb, 1247-1318.|title=The successors of Genghis Khan.|date=1971|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-03351-6|location=New York|pages=620|oclc=160563}}</ref> \u00d6gedei married first [[Boraqchin (wife of \u00d6gedei)|Boraqchin]] and then [[T\u00f6regene Khatun|T\u00f6regene]].

Although he was already married, in 1204 his father gave him [[T\u00f6regene]], the wife of a defeated [[Merkit]] chief. The addition of such a wife was not uncommon in [[steppe]] culture.\n\nAfter Genghis was proclaimed Emperor or [[Khagan]] in 1206, ''myangans'' (thousands) of the [[Jalayir]], Besud, [[Suldus]], and [[Khongqatan]] clans were given to him as his [[appanage]]. \u00d6gedei's territory occupied the [[Emil (river)|Emil]] and [[Hobok]] rivers. According to his father's wish, [[Ilugei]], the commander of the Jalayir, became \u00d6gedei's tutor.\n\n\u00d6gedei, along with his brothers, campaigned independently for the first time in November 1211 against the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]]. He was sent to ravage the land south through [[Hebei]] and then north through [[Shanxi]] in 1213. \u00d6gedei's force drove the Jin garrison out of the [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], and he rode to the juncture of the [[Xi Xia]], Jin, and Song domains.<ref>Marvin C Whiting ''Imperial Chinese Military History'', p. 355.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|Mongol conquest of Eastern Persia]], \u00d6gedei and [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]] massacred the residents of [[Otrar]] after a five-month siege in 1219\u201320 and joined [[Jochi]] who was outside the walls of [[Urganch]].<ref>John Joseph Saunders ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', p. 57.</ref> Because Jochi and Chagatai were quarreling over the military strategy, \u00d6gedei was appointed by Genghis Khan to oversee the siege of Urganch.<ref>John Powell ''Magill's Guide to Military History: Jap-Pel'', p. 1148.</ref> They captured the city in 1221.

Thanks mostly to the organization left behind by Genghis Khan, and to the personality of \u00d6gedei, the affairs of the Mongol Empire remained for the most part stable during his reign. \u00d6gedei was a pragmatic man, though he made some mistakes during his reign. \u00d6gedei had no delusions that he was his father's equal as a military commander or organizer and used the abilities of those he found most capable.\n\nNotwithstanding reports of his charisma, \u00d6gedei was criticized by Mongol and Persian chroniclers for a crime he committed in 1237, which according to Persian chroniclers consisted of ordering the rape of four thousand [[Oirats|Oirat]] girls above the age of seven. These girls were then confiscated for \u00d6gedei's harem or given to caravan hostels throughout the Mongol Empire for use as prostitutes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> This move brought the Oirat and their lands under \u00d6gedei's control following the death of \u00d6gedei's sister Checheyigen, who previously controlled Oirat lands.<ref>{{Citation|last=Weatherford, Jack, 1946-|title=The secret history of the Mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|date=2010|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=978-0307407153|oclc=951745549}}, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n== World conquests ==\n\n=== Expansion in the Middle East ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|l1=Mongol conquest of Persia}}\n{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}\n\nAfter destroying the Khwarazmian empire, Genghis Khan was free to move against [[Western Xia]]. In 1226, however, [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the last of the Khwarizm monarchs, returned to [[Persia]] to revive the empire lost by his father, [[Muhammad \u2018Ala al-Din II.]] The Mongol forces sent against him in 1227 were defeated at [[Dameghan]]. Another army that marched against Jalal al-Din scored a pyrrhic victory in the vicinity of [[Isfahan]] but was unable to follow up that success.\n\nWith \u00d6gedei's consent to launch a campaign, [[Chormaqan]] left [[Bukhara]] at the head of 30,000 to 50,000 Mongol soldiers.  He occupied Persia and [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], two long-standing bases of Khwarazmian support. Crossing the [[Amu Darya River]] in 1230 and entering Khorasan without encountering any opposition, Chormaqan passed through quickly. He left a sizable contingent behind under the command of Dayir Noyan, who had further instructions to invade western [[Afghanistan]]. Chormaqan and the majority of his army then entered the northern section of Persia known as Mazandaran in the autumn of 1230, thus avoiding the mountainous area south of the [[Caspian Sea]]. That region was controlled by the [[Ismailis]].\n\nUpon reaching the city of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], Chormaqan made his winter camp there and dispatched his armies to pacify the rest of northern Persia. In 1231, he led his army southward and quickly captured the cities of [[Qum]] and [[Hamadan]]. From there, he sent armies into the regions of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kirman]], whose rulers quickly submitted, preferring to pay tribute to Mongol overlords rather than having their states ravaged. Meanwhile, further east, Dayir steadily achieved his goals in capturing [[Kabul]], Ghazni, and Zawulistan. With the Mongols already in control of Persia, Jalal al-Din was isolated in Transcaucasia where he was banished. Thus all of Persia was added to the Mongol Empire.\n\n=== The fall of the Jin dynasty ===\n{{See also|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nAt the end of 1230, responding to the Jin's unexpected defeat of the Mongol general Doqulkhu, the Khagan went south to [[Shanxi]] province with [[Tolui]], clearing the area of the Jin forces and taking the city of [[Fengxiang]]. After passing the summer in the north, they again campaigned against the Jin in [[Henan]], cutting through territory of South China to assault the Jin's rear. By 1232 the Jin Emperor was [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|besieged in his capital]] of [[Kaifeng]]. \u00d6gedei soon departed, leaving the final conquest to his generals. After taking several cities, the Mongols, with the belated assistance of the [[Song dynasty]], destroyed the Jin with the [[Siege of Caizhou|fall of Caizhou]] in February 1234. However, a viceroy of the Song murdered a Mongol ambassador, and the Song armies recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, [[Luoyang]], and [[Chang'an]], which were now ruled by the Mongols.\n\nIn addition to the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|war with the Jin dynasty]], \u00d6gedei crushed the [[Eastern Xia]] founded by [[Puxian Wannu]] in 1233, pacifying southern [[Manchuria]]. \u00d6gedei subdued the [[Tungusic peoples|Water Tatars]] in the northern part of the region and suppressed their rebellion in 1237.\n\n=== Conquest of Georgia and Armenia ===\n[[File:Geor tamro aandersen.png|250px|thumb|\u00d6gedei conquered the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Georgia and Armenia}}\n\nThe Mongols under Chormaqan returned to the [[Caucasus]] in 1232. The walls of [[Ganjak]] were breached by [[catapult]] and [[battering ram]] in 1235. The Mongols eventually withdrew after the citizens of [[Irbil]] agreed to send a yearly tribute to the court of the khagan. Chormaqan waited until 1238, when the force of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] was also active in the north Caucasus.<ref>Timothy May-Mongol Empire: Chormaquan and the Mongol Conquest of the Middle East</ref> After subduing [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenia]], Chormaqan took [[Tiflis]]. In 1238, the Mongols captured [[Lorhe]] whose ruler, [[Shahanshah]], fled with his family before the Mongols arrived, leaving the rich city to its fate. After putting up a spirited defense at [[Hohanaberd]], the city's ruler, [[Hasan Jalal]], submitted to the Mongols. Another column then advanced against Gaian, ruled by Prince Avak. The Mongol commander Tokhta ruled out a direct assault and had his men construct a wall around the city, and Avak soon surrendered. By 1240, Chormaqan had completed the conquest of [[Transcaucasia]], forcing the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] nobles to surrender.\n\n=== Invasion of Korea ===\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Korea}}\nIn 1224, a Mongol envoy was killed in obscure circumstances and Korea stopped paying [[tribute]].<ref>Michel Ho\u00e0ng, Ingrid Cranfield ''Genghis Khan'', p. 159.</ref> \u00d6gedei dispatched [[Saritai]] to subdue Korea and avenge the dead envoy in 1231. Thus, Mongol armies began to [[Mongol invasions of Korea|invade Korea]] in order to subdue the kingdom. The [[Goryeo]] King temporarily submitted and agreed to accept [[darughachi|Mongol overseers]]. When they withdrew for the summer, however, [[Choe U]] moved the capital from [[Kaesong]] to [[Ganghwa Island|Ganghwa]] Island. Saritai was hit with a stray arrow and died as he campaigned against them.\n\n\u00d6gedei announced plans for the conquest of the [[Koreans]], the [[Southern Song]], the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]]s and their European allies, all of whom killed Mongol [[diplomat|envoy]]s, at the kurultai in Mongolia in 1234. \u00d6gedei appointed Danqu commander of the Mongol army and made Bog Wong, a defected Korean general, governor of 40 cities with their subjects. When the court of Goryeo sued for peace in 1238, \u00d6gedei demanded that the king of Goryeo appear before him in person. The Goryeo king finally sent his relative Yeong Nong-gun Sung with ten noble boys to [[Mongolia]] as [[hostage]]s, temporarily ending the war in 1241.<ref>J.Bor ''Mongol hiigeed Eurasiin diplomat shashtir, vol.II'', p. 197.</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n[[File:Capture of the Mongol-Tatars Russian city.jpg|230px|thumb|The Mongol army captures a [[Rus' people|Rus']] city]]\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\n\nThe Mongol Empire expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]] to subdue the Russian steppe and drive into Europe. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal, and [[Principality of Minsk|Minsk]], which became part of [[Lithuania]]), Hungary, Poland, Serbia and Bulgaria. During the siege of [[Kolomna]], the Khagan's half brother Khulgen<ref>He was the son of Genghis Khan by Khulan khatun of the Merkid clan.</ref> was killed by an arrow.\n\nAfter the conquest of [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Alania]], and the Rus' principalities, \u00d6gedei's son [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] and Chagatai's grandson [[B\u00fcri]] ridiculed Batu, and the Mongol camp suffered dissension. The Khagan harshly criticized G\u00fcy\u00fck: \"You broke the spirit of every man in your army...Do you think that the Russians surrendered because of how mean you were to your own men?\". He then sent G\u00fcy\u00fck back to continue the conquest of Europe. G\u00fcy\u00fck and another of \u00d6gedei's sons, [[Kadan]], attacked [[Transylvania]] and Poland, respectively.\n\n\u00d6gedei Khan had granted permission to invade the remainder of Europe, all the way to the \"Great Sea\", the Atlantic Ocean; his death prevented the invasions from continuing west, as Batu withdrew to participate in the election of a successor.\n\n=== Conflict with Song China ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}\n\nIn a series of razzias from 1235 to 1245, the Mongols commanded by \u00d6gedei's sons penetrated deep into the Song Dynasty and reached [[Chengdu]], [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]] and [[Yangtze River]]. But they could not succeed in completing their conquest due to climate and the number of Song troops, and \u00d6gedei's son Khochu died in the process. In 1240, \u00d6gedei's other son [[Khuden]] dispatched a subsidiary expedition to [[Tibet]]. The situation between the two nations worsened when Song officers murdered \u00d6gedei's envoys headed by Selmus.<ref>Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States'', p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe Mongol expansion throughout the Asian continent under the leadership of \u00d6gedei helped bring political stability and re-establish the [[Silk Road]], the primary trading route between East and West.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of India}}\n\n\u00d6gedei appointed Dayir commander of Ghazni and Menggetu commander in [[Qonduz]]. In winter 1241 the Mongol force invaded the [[Indus valley]] and besieged [[Lahore]], which was controlled by the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. However, Dayir died storming the town, on 30 December 1241, and the Mongols butchered the town before withdrawing from the [[Delhi Sultanate]].<ref>Islamic Culture Board ''Islamic culture'', p. 256.</ref>\n\nSome time after 1235 another Mongol force invaded [[Kashmir]], stationing a [[darughachi]] there for several years. Soon Kashmir became a Mongolian dependency.<ref>[[Thomas T. Allsen]] ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p. 84.</ref> Around the same time, a Kashmiri [[Buddhist]] master, Otochi, and his brother Namo arrived at the court of \u00d6gedei.\n\n== Administration ==\n\u00d6gedei began the bureaucratization of Mongol administration. Three divisions constituted his administration: \n* the [[Christians|Christian]] eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], represented by Chinqai, the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[scribe]], and the [[Keraites]].\n* the Islamic cycle, represented by two [[Khorazm]]ians, Mahumud Yalavach, and Masud Beg.\n*the [[North Chinese]] [[Confucian]] circle, represented by [[Yelu Chucai]], a [[Khitan people|Khitan]], and Nianhe Zhong-shan, a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]].\n\nMahamud Yalavach promoted a system in which the government would delegate tax collection to [[tax farmer]]s who collect payments in silver. Yelu Chucai encouraged \u00d6gedei to institute a traditional Chinese system of government, with taxation in the hands of government agents and payment in a government issued currency. The Muslim merchants, working with capital supplied by the Mongol aristocrats, [[loan]]ed at higher [[interest rate|interest]] the silver needed for tax payments. At the same time the Mongols began circulating [[paper currency]] backed by silver reserves.\n\n[[File:Ogedei qaghan.svg|thumb|left|40px|''\u00d6gedei Khan'' in traditional [[Mongolian script]]]]\n\n\u00d6gedei abolished the branch departments of state affairs and divided the areas of Mongol-ruled China into ten routes according to the suggestion of Yel\u00fc Chucai. He also divided the empire into [[Beshbalik]] and [[Yanjing]] administration, while the headquarters in Karakorum directly dealt with Manchuria, Mongolia and Siberia. Late in his reign, [[Amu Darya]] administration was established. [[Turkestan]] was administered by Mahamud Yalavach, while Yelu Chucai administered North China from 1229 to 1240. \u00d6gedei appointed [[Shigi Khutugh]] chief judge in China. In [[Iran]], \u00d6gedei appointed first Chin-temur, a [[Kara-kitai]], and then [[Korguz]], an Uyghur who proved to be honest administrator. Later, some of Yelu Chucai's duties were transferred to Mahamud Yalavach and taxes were handed over to Abd-ur-Rahman, who promised to double the annual payments of silver.<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 102.</ref> The Ortoq or partner merchants lent \u00d6gedei's money at exorbitant rates of interest to the peasants, though \u00d6gedei banned considerably higher rates. Despite it proving profitable, many people fled their homes to avoid the tax collectors and their strong-arm gangs.\n\n\u00d6gedei had imperial princes tutored by the Christian scribe Qadaq and the [[Taoist]] priest Li Zhichang and built schools and an academy. \u00d6gedei Khan also decreed to issue paper currency backed by [[silk]] reserves and founded a Department responsible for destroying old notes. Yelu Chucai protested to \u00d6gedei that his large-scale distribution of [[appanage]]s in Iran, [[Western China|Western]] and North China, and Khorazm could lead to a disintegration of the Empire.<ref>Chunjiang Fu, Asiapac Editorial, Liping Yang ''Chinese History'', p. 148.</ref> \u00d6gedei thus decreed that the Mongol nobles could appoint overseers in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes.\n\nThe Khagan proclaimed the Great [[Yassa]] as an integral body of precedents, confirming the continuing validity of his father's commands and ordinances, while adding his own. \u00d6gedei codified rules of dress and conduct during the kurultais. Throughout the Empire, in 1234, he created postroad stations ([[Yam (route)|Yam]]) with a permanent staff who would supply post riders' needs.<ref>Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach ''Medieval Islamic Civilization'', p. 632.</ref> Relay stations were set up every 25 miles and the yam staff supplied remounts to the envoys and served specified rations. The attached households were exempt from other taxes, but they had to pay a qubchuri tax to supply the goods. \u00d6gedei ordered Chagatai and Batu to control their yams separately. The Khagan prohibited the nobility from issuing [[paiza]]s (tablets that gave the bearer authority to demand goods and services from civilian populations) and [[jarliq]]s. \u00d6gedei decreed that within decimal units one out of every 100 [[sheep]] of the well-off should be levied for the poor of the unit, and that one sheep and one mare from every herd should be forwarded to form a [[herd]] for the imperial table.<ref>Mongolia Society \u2013 Occasional Papers \u2013 p. 17.</ref>\n\n== Karakorum ==\n[[File:Karakorum - Tortue Sud.jpg|thumb|[[Bixi (tortoise)|Stone tortoise]] of Karakorum]]\n{{Main|Karakorum}}\n\nFrom 1235\u201338 \u00d6gedei constructed a series of palaces and [[pavilion]]s at stopping places in his annual [[nomad]]ic route through central Mongolia. The first palace Wanangong was constructed by North Chinese artisans. The Emperor urged his relatives build residences nearby and settled the deported craftsmen from China near the site. The construction of the city, [[Karakorum]] (\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c), was finished in 1235, assigning different quarters to Islamic and North Chinese craftsmen, who competed to win \u00d6gedei's favor. Earthen walls with 4 gates surrounded the city. Attached were private apartments, while in front of stood a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] bearing an engraved pillar, like those that were commonly used in East Asia. There was a castle with doors like the gates of the garden and a series of lakes where many water fowl gathered. \u00d6gedei erected several houses of worship for his Buddhist, Muslim, Taoist, and Christian followers. In the Chinese ward, there was a Confucian temple where Yelu Chucai used to create or regulate a calendar on the Chinese model.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:\u00d6gedei Khan Statue.JPG|thumb|180px|Statue of \u00d6gedei Khan in Mongolia]]\n\n\u00d6gedei was considered to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the force of his personality. He was a physically big, jovial, and charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set.{{Citation needed|reason=many Reliable Sources exist-the editor should have referenced!|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe sudden death of [[Tolui]] in 1232 seems to have affected \u00d6gedei deeply. According to some sources, Tolui sacrificed his own life, accepting a poisoned drink in shamanist ritual in order to save \u00d6gedei who was suffering from illness.<ref>Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Rudi Paul Lindner, Valentin Aleksandrovich ''The Uralic and Altaic Series'', p. 176.</ref> Other sources say \u00d6gedei orchestrated Tolui's death with the help of shamans who drugged the alcoholic Tolui.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=92|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\n\u00d6gedei was well known for his [[alcoholism]]. Chagatai entrusted an official to watch his habit, but \u00d6gedei managed to drink anyway.  It is commonly told that \u00d6gedei did so by vowing to reduce the number of cups he drank a day then having cups twice the size created for his personal use. When he died at dawn on 11 December 1241, after a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman, the people blamed the sister of Tolui's widow and Abd-ur-Rahman. The Mongol aristocrats recognized, however, that the Khagan's own lack of self-control had killed him.\n\n\u00d6gedei was also known to be a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a [[dictator]].<ref>David Morgan ''The Mongols'', p. 104.</ref> Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to establish a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was a pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.\n\nHowever, Mongol and Persian chroniclers criticize \u00d6gedei for a crime he committed in 1237 which violated the laws of his father, Genghis Khan, which forbade seizure, rape, kidnapping, bartering, or selling young girls, who were allowed to be married at a young age but could not engage in sexual activity until the age of sixteen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=89\u201390|oclc=915759962}}</ref> Mongol chronicles were vague about the nature of the crime, but Persian chroniclers indicated that after the Oirat did not send girls for \u00d6gedei's harem, \u00d6gedei had four thousand Oirat girls above the age of seven stripped naked and raped by his soldiers repeatedly in full sight of the girls' relatives. Two of these girls died from the ordeal, and the remaining non-raped were divided up by soldiers, with some being sent to the royal harem, and others assigned to caravan hostels for sexual servitude, and others not deemed suitable for this were left present for anyone to carry them away or use them for any purposes deemed fit. \u00d6gedei seems not to have done this out of sexual depravity as such, but more to consolidate power over the Oirat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref>\n\nThe above account, including the assumption that Mongol sources critized the crime (still questionable), was described in Jack Weatherford's 2011 book ''The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire''. Weatherford calls it \"the most horrendous crime of his twelve-year reign and one of the worst Mongol atrocities recorded\". A more recent book in feminist historiography \"Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire\" (2018) by Anne F. Broadbridge links the \"infamous alleged mass rape of Oirat girls\" to \u00d6gedei's requisitioning of girls from his uncle Tem\u00fcge Otchigin's territories without Tem\u00fcge's approval. Broadbridge notes however that \"with all the evidence suppressed, this can only be a surmise\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broadbridge |first1=Anne F. |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |page=187}}</ref> The History of the Yuan or ''Yuanshi'' (YS 2, 35) and Secret History of the Mongols (SHM 281) speak of a forceful requisitioning of women by \u00d6gedei from the \"left wing\" and \"uncle Otchigin's domain\" respectively but do not mention a rape (De Rachewiltz 2004).<ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032-1035}}</ref> In the Secret History \u00d6gedei expresses remorse for his act stating \"as to my second fault, to listen to the word of a woman without principle, and to have the girls of my uncle Otchigin's domain brought to me was surely a mistake\" but De Rachewiltz notes that the entire paragraph listing four good deeds and four mistakes may be a posthumous assessment (De Rachewiltz 2004).<ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032-1035}}</ref>\n\nThe only account alleging a rape is in Chapter 32 of the [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]] (History of the World Conqueror) written in 1252 by [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] (1226-1283).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Boyle |first1=John Andrew |title=The History of the World Conqueror by Ala-ad-din Ata-Malik JUVAINI, Translated from the text of Mirza Muhammad Qazvini |date=1958 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge Massachusetts |page=201}}</ref> This entire chapter was later copied verbatim by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]] into his early 14th century [[Jami' al-tawarikh|Jami' Al-Tawarikh]] (Compendium of Chronicles) albeit in a slightly abridged version. In Chapter 32 Juvayni starts by praising \u00d6gedei Khan then proceeds to give 50 highly detailed anecdotes to illustrate \u00d6gedei's \"clemency, forgiveness, justice and generosity\" followed by one anecdote to illustrate his \"violence, severity, fury and awesomeness\" which was the rape incident. This anecdote closes the chapter. The name of the tribe is unclear in two manuscripts of Juvayni but Manuscript D and Rashid-Al-Din give it as Oirat. Broadbridge and De Rachewiltz questioned the factual accuracy of this identification with the Oirats.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broadbridge |first1=Anne F. |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |page=187}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=De Rachewiltz |first1=Igor |title=The Secret History of the Mongols, A Mongolian Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, Translated with a Historical and Philological Commentary, Volume One |publisher=Brill's Inner Asian Library |location=Brill Leiden Boston |pages=1032-1035}}</ref> The anecdotes are written in the style of a Persian tale.

This anecdote contradicts the standard account of \u00d6gedei's death from a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman. A number of anecdotes evince a tone of ridicule for \u00d6gedei's lack of self-control. While the anecdotes may contain a kernel of truth some seem to be apocryphal legends originating from the community of Muslim merchants and should be approached with a degree of caution. Another Persian account was the mass sodomy against soldiers of the Jin Dynasty quoted in Rashid-Al-Din and noted by Weatherford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The secret history of the mongol queens : how the daughters of Genghis Khan rescued his empire|last=Weatherford, Jack.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9780307407160|location=|pages=90\u201391|oclc=915759962}}</ref>. Homosexuality was taboo among the Mongols and punishable by death, so the factual accuracy of this \"act of the people of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]\" (Rashid-Al-Din) is still debatable. While Juvayni is a valuable source of information about the Mongol Empire his writings are commonly inflated, as when he estimates the strength of the Mongol army at 700,000, against other accounts that put the number between 105,000 and 130,000. Biased readings of Juvayni's account and projection of modern sensitivities backward in time has also led to the popular but unfounded theory that \u00d6gedei's wife T\u00f6regene and Fatima were in fact lesbian lovers. It is also notable that when Juvayni started writing the [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]] in Karakorum in the year 1252 the \u00d6gedeid faction had been purged by [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] so anti-\u00d6gedei bias could have been widespread.\n\n==Aftermath of \u00d6gedei's death==\n\n\u00d6gedei had nominated his grandson Shiremun as his heir, but G\u00fcy\u00fck eventually succeeded him after the five-year regency of his widow [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]].

Probably the most important reason for this situation is that a number of studies that have involved silanization as part of the procedure have not been concerned with thoroughly characterizing the silane layer formed. The one result that unifies recent studies on the characterization of silane layers is centered on the extreme sensitivity of the reactions that lead to the formation of silane layers.<ref name=zhu /> Indeed, self-assembled layers of silanes on silicate surfaces have been reported to be dependent on various parameters such as humidity, temperature, impurities in the silane reagent and the type of silicate surface. In order to consistently and reproducibly make diverse functionalized surfaces with layers that are molecularly smooth, it is critical to understand the chemistry of the silicate surfaces and the ways in which various parameters affect the nature of the self-assembled layers.\n\n==Surface structure of silicon and mica==\n===Silicon===\nOxidized [[silicon]] has been extensively studied as a substrate for the deposition of biomolecules. Piranha solution can be used to increase the surface density of reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface of silicon. The \u2013OH groups can hydrolyze and subsequently form siloxane linkages (Si-O-Si) with organic silane molecules. Preparation of silicon surfaces for silanization involves the removal of surface contaminants. This can be achieved by using UV-ozone and [[piranha solution]]. Piranha solution in particular constitutes quite a harsh treatment that can potentially damage the integrity of the silicon surface. Finlayson-Pitts et al. investigated the effect of certain treatments on silicon and concluded that both the roughness (3-5 \u00c5) and the presence of scattered large particles were preserved after 1 cycle of plasma-treatment.<ref name=finlayson-pitts>{{cite journal | last1 = McIntire | first1 = T.

The adsorbed material is called the adsorbate, while the surface is called the adsorbent. It is common to distinguish between two types of adsorption, namely physical adsorption (which consists of intermolecular forces holding the adsorbed material to the surface) and chemical adsorption (which consists of covalent bonds tethering the adsorbed material to the surface). The nature of the layer of adsorbate formed depends on the interactions between the adsorbed material and the adsorbent.<ref name=parida>Parida, S. K.; Dash, S.; Patel, S.; Mishra, B. K. Adsorption of organic molecules on silica surface. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2006, 121, 77-110.</ref> More specifically, the mechanisms involved in adsorption include ion exchange (replacement of counter ions adsorbed from the solution by similarly charged ions), ion pairing (adsorption of ions from solution phase onto sites on the substrates that carry the opposite charge), hydrophobic bonding (non-polar attraction between groups on the substrate surface and molecules in solution), polarization of p-electrons polar interactions between partially charged sites on the substrate surface and molecules carrying opposite partial charges in solution, and covalent bonds.<ref name=zhu /><ref name=paria>Paria, S.; Khilar, K. C. A review on experimental studies of surfactant adsorption at the hydrophilic solid-water interface. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004, 110, 75-95.</ref> The variety of ways for adsorption to occur provides an indication of the complexities associated with controlling the type of layer that is adsorbed.\n \nThe type of silane used can further compound the problem, as in the case of APTES. APTES is the classical molecule used for the immobilization of biomolecules and has historically been the most widely studied molecule in the field by far. Since APTES contains three ethoxy groups per molecule, it can polymerize in the presence of water, leading to lateral polymerization between APTES molecules in horizontal and vertical directions and the formation of oligomers and polymers which can attach to the surface.\n\nSelf-assembly can be approached using '''solution-phase''' reactions or '''vapor-phase''' reactions. In solution-phase experiments, the silane is dissolved in an anhydrous solvent and placed in contact with the surface; in vapor-phase experiments, only the vapor of the silane reaches the substrate surface.<ref name=zhu />\n\n==Solution-phase reactions==\nSolution-phase reaction has historically been the method that has been most studied, and a general consensus that has evolved with regards to the conditions required for the formation of smooth aminosilane films includes the following: (1) an anhydrous solvent such as toluene is required, with a rigidly controlled trace amount of water to regulate the degree of polymerization of aminosilanes at the surface and in solution; (2) formation of oligomers and polymers is favored at higher silane concentrations (>10%); (3) moderate temperatures (60\u201390&nbsp;\u00b0C) can disrupt non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, leading to fewer silane molecules that are weakly tethered to the surface. Additionally, condition (3) favors desorption of water from the substrate into the toluene phase20; (4) Rinsing with solvents such as toluene, ethanol and water following the silanization reaction favors the removal of weakly bonded silane molecules and the hydrolysis of residual alkoxy linkages in the layer; (5) drying and curing at high temperature (110&nbsp;\u00b0C) favors the formation of siloxane linkages and also converts ammonium ions to the neutral amine, which is more reactive.<ref name=zhu />\n\n==Vapor-phase reactions==\nVapor-phase silanization has been approached as a way to circumvent the complexities of trace water in solution and silane purity.<ref name=zhu /> Since oligomers and polymers of silanes have negligible vapor pressure at the reaction temperatures commonly used, they do not reach the surface of the silicate during deposition. Since there is no solvent in the system, it is easier to control the amount of water in the reaction. Smooth monolayers have been reported for vapor-phase silanizations of several types of silanes, including aminosilanes, octadecyltrimethoxysilane and fluoalkyl silanes. However, the nature of the attachment of the silane molecules to the substrate is uncertain, although siloxane bond formation can be favored by soaking the substrate in water following deposition.\n\nIn a recent study by Chen et al., APTES monolayers were obtained consistently at different temperatures and deposition times. The thicknesses of the layers obtained were 5 \u00c5 and 6 \u00c5 at 70&nbsp;\u00b0C and 90&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively, which corresponds to the approximate length of an APTES molecule and indicates that monolayers formed on the substrates in each case.<ref name=zhu />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Silicon chemistry]]\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Process}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=August 2012}}\n{{lead too short|date=August 2012}}\n}}\n\n'''[[Silanization]] of [[silicon]] and [[mica]]''' is the coating of these materials with a thin layer of self assembling units.\n\n==Biological applications of silanization==\nNanoscale analysis of proteins using [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) requires surfaces with well-defined topologies and chemistries for many experimental techniques.

Giasson et al. reported that the silanol groups on freshly cleaved mica that was not subjected to any treatment were found to be more stable under high vacuum compared to the plasma-activated mica: after 64 hrs, surface coverage of the silanol groups for freshly cleaved mica plasma was roughly the same, while surface coverage for activated mica decreased 3-fold to 10%.<ref name=liberelle />\n\n==Adsorption of molecules onto silicate surfaces==\n[[Adsorption]] describes the process by which molecules or particles bind to surfaces and is distinguishable from [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], whereby the particles spread in the bulk of the absorbing material. The adsorbed material is called the adsorbate, while the surface is called the adsorbent. It is common to distinguish between two types of adsorption, namely physical adsorption (which consists of intermolecular forces holding the adsorbed material to the surface) and chemical adsorption (which consists of covalent bonds tethering the adsorbed material to the surface). The nature of the layer of adsorbate formed depends on the interactions between the adsorbed material and the adsorbent.<ref name=parida>Parida, S. K.; Dash, S.; Patel, S.; Mishra, B. K. Adsorption of organic molecules on silica surface. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2006, 121, 77-110.</ref> More specifically, the mechanisms involved in adsorption include ion exchange (replacement of counter ions adsorbed from the solution by similarly charged ions), ion pairing (adsorption of ions from solution phase onto sites on the substrates that carry the opposite charge), hydrophobic bonding (non-polar attraction between groups on the substrate surface and molecules in solution), polarization of p-electrons polar interactions between partially charged sites on the substrate surface and molecules carrying opposite partial charges in solution, and covalent bonds.<ref name=zhu /><ref name=paria>Paria, S.; Khilar, K. C. A review on experimental studies of surfactant adsorption at the hydrophilic solid-water interface. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004, 110, 75-95.</ref> The variety of ways for adsorption to occur provides an indication of the complexities associated with controlling the type of layer that is adsorbed.\n \nThe type of silane used can further compound the problem, as in the case of APTES. APTES is the classical molecule used for the immobilization of biomolecules and has historically been the most widely studied molecule in the field by far. Since APTES contains three ethoxy groups per molecule, it can polymerize in the presence of water, leading to lateral polymerization between APTES molecules in horizontal and vertical directions and the formation of oligomers and polymers which can attach to the surface.\n\nSelf-assembly can be approached using '''solution-phase''' reactions or '''vapor-phase''' reactions. In solution-phase experiments, the silane is dissolved in an anhydrous solvent and placed in contact with the surface; in vapor-phase experiments, only the vapor of the silane reaches the substrate surface.<ref name=zhu />\n\n==Solution-phase reactions==\nSolution-phase reaction has historically been the method that has been most studied, and a general consensus that has evolved with regards to the conditions required for the formation of smooth aminosilane films includes the following: (1) an anhydrous solvent such as toluene is required, with a rigidly controlled trace amount of water to regulate the degree of polymerization of aminosilanes at the surface and in solution; (2) formation of oligomers and polymers is favored at higher silane concentrations (>10%); (3) moderate temperatures (60\u201390&nbsp;\u00b0C) can disrupt non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, leading to fewer silane molecules that are weakly tethered to the surface. Additionally, condition (3) favors desorption of water from the substrate into the toluene phase20; (4) Rinsing with solvents such as toluene, ethanol and water following the silanization reaction favors the removal of weakly bonded silane molecules and the hydrolysis of residual alkoxy linkages in the layer; (5) drying and curing at high temperature (110&nbsp;\u00b0C) favors the formation of siloxane linkages and also converts ammonium ions to the neutral amine, which is more reactive.<ref name=zhu />\n\n==Vapor-phase reactions==\nVapor-phase silanization has been approached as a way to circumvent the complexities of trace water in solution and silane purity.<ref name=zhu /> Since oligomers and polymers of silanes have negligible vapor pressure at the reaction temperatures commonly used, they do not reach the surface of the silicate during deposition. Since there is no solvent in the system, it is easier to control the amount of water in the reaction. Smooth monolayers have been reported for vapor-phase silanizations of several types of silanes, including aminosilanes, octadecyltrimethoxysilane and fluoalkyl silanes. However, the nature of the attachment of the silane molecules to the substrate is uncertain, although siloxane bond formation can be favored by soaking the substrate in water following deposition.\n\nIn a recent study by Chen et al., APTES monolayers were obtained consistently at different temperatures and deposition times. The thicknesses of the layers obtained were 5 \u00c5 and 6 \u00c5 at 70&nbsp;\u00b0C and 90&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively, which corresponds to the approximate length of an APTES molecule and indicates that monolayers formed on the substrates in each case.<ref name=zhu />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Silicon chemistry]]\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 8 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silanization_of_silicon_and_mica"}

The tankers were simply too big to fit through the [[Panama Canal]] and would have to take a longer route that traversed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"jstor.org\" />\n\nThe final obstacle to the exportation of oil was a diplomatic one. Since about 60 percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports were going to the United States, Chinese officials were worried that by buying more oil that they would become involved in the disputes between Chavez\u2019s anti-US regime and the [[Presidency of George W.

The tankers were simply too big to fit through the [[Panama Canal]] and would have to take a longer route that traversed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"jstor.org\" />\n\nThe final obstacle to the exportation of oil was a diplomatic one. Since about 60 percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports were going to the United States, Chinese officials were worried that by buying more oil that they would become involved in the disputes between Chavez\u2019s anti-US regime and the [[Presidency of George W.

I remember during those days each and every actor was copying Dilip Saab whether it was Dharmendra, Jeetendra or Manoj Kumar. I was much in-demand as Dilip Saab's sister. Every hero wanted the same. Every actor wanted me to play his sister. Sometimes the sister was the film's heroine. The official heroine would just sing her songs, whereas I had all the dramatic scenes. I got my recognition and the awards. In a film called ''Paras'' I was Sanjeev Kumar's sister. But I had a lot more to do than Raakhee-di who played the heroine. I got my first award for it. Then I got my second award for ''Majboor'', a film written by Salimbhai and Javedbhai where Bachchan Saab played my brother. It was so heartening.

She, along with [[Rajesh Khanna]] was chosen as finalist and both were presented on stage as winners at the Filmfare Awards function. She got her first film offer for ''Taqdeer'' from [[Tarachand Barjatya]] who happened to be in the audience.<ref name=\"Farida Jalal \u2013 Interview 2000\">[http://cineplot.com/farida-jalal-interview-2000/ Farida Jalal \u2013 Interview (2000)], \"Cineplot.com\"</ref> In an interview in 2014, she said, when asked her about initial part of her career: \"I started my acting career when I was just out of my school St Joseph's Convent in Panchgani, in a film called ''Taqdeer''. I took part in a talent contest and even won. Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and I were the finalists. How was I to know that I'd soon be doing a film ''Aradhana'' with him?\".<ref name=\"2014 interview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebrities/features/type/view/id/7616|title=\"I virtually grew up and grew old in the industry\" \u2013 Farida Jalal|last=Ethiraj|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nShe usually played the sister or rejected fianc\u00e9e of the male lead, but almost never the female lead. One of her most critically acclaimed roles is in ''[[Bobby (1973 film)|Bobby]]'', where she played the part of the [[mental retardation|mentally challenged]] would-be fianc\u00e9e of [[Rishi Kapoor]]. During the 1980s, her roles progressed from sister and girlfriend to aunt, mother, or grandmother. She is also remembered for her part in ''Aradhana'', in which she plays [[Rajesh Khanna]]'s girlfriend, and sings the song \"Bagon me bahar hai, kaliyon pe nikhar hai\".\n\nWhen asked as to how she started getting typecast as a hero's sister, she quoted in an interview: \"It all started with ''Gopi'' where I was offered the greatest mr Dilip Kumar's sister's role. Forget about refusing, I jumped at the offer. Even if I had the chance to just go and observe him on the set I'd have done it. I love the man. I remember during those days each and every actor was copying Dilip Saab whether it was Dharmendra, Jeetendra or Manoj Kumar. I was much in-demand as Dilip Saab's sister. Every hero wanted the same. Every actor wanted me to play his sister. Sometimes the sister was the film's heroine. The official heroine would just sing her songs, whereas I had all the dramatic scenes. I got my recognition and the awards. In a film called ''Paras'' I was Sanjeev Kumar's sister. But I had a lot more to do than Raakhee-di who played the heroine. I got my first award for it. Then I got my second award for ''Majboor'', a film written by Salimbhai and Javedbhai where Bachchan Saab played my brother. It was so heartening. Why would I want to be heroine when I was getting the stronger parts as the sister?\"<ref name=\"2014 interview\" />\n\nShe acted for over 40 years, only taking a break during 1983 and 1990, when she settled in [[Bangalore]].\n\nDuring the 1990s, Jalal had a part in many major hits in India, among them ''[[Raja Hindustani]]'', ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'', ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'', ''[[Kaho Naa...

Earlier, she was also nominated multiple times for 'Best Supporting Actress Award', one for the Amitabh Bachchan-Parveen Babi-Pran starrer ''Majboor'' where she played Amitabh's handicapped sister.\n\nFarida Jalal though, could not get a major break as heroine against any big star except Rajesh Khanna in ''Aaradhana'', but she played the lead role in ''Jeevan Rekha'' in which her husband Tabrez was the hero. Pran and Ajit were also in the film. A song of the film; \"Yaar mere, meri baahon me aaja\" by [[Mohammed Rafi]] from this film had become popular, and is still popular.\n\nJalal starred in ''Shararat (Thoda Jadu, Thodi Nazaakat)'', in which she played a leading role. The comedy is currently airing on the [[Disney Channel]].\n\nIn 2005, she co-hosted the 50th [[Filmfare Awards]] alongside [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Sonali Bendre]], in Mumbai.

On 19 February, rumours did the rounds that she had died.<ref>[http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/farida-jalal-on-death-hoax-i-am-happy-to-realise-how-much-people-love-me/] Death rumour</ref> Annoyed, the lady asked her publicist to put the rumours to rest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/farida-jalal-is-not-dead-internet-stop-spreading-fake-news-please-1661303|title=Farida Jalal Is Not Dead, Internet.
