The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' relates many events which portray the might of Bhima. Bhima is responsible for slaying all hundred [[Kaurava]] brothers in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. He was considered to have the physical strength of 100 elephants approximately.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''Bhima'' in [[Sanskrit]] means 'big' or 'tall'.

Specifically, he became a master in using the [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. Bhima's strong point throughout the epic remains his towering strength. He was so wrathful and strong that it was impossible even for [[Indra]] to subdue him in a battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05022.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\nBhima was also renowned for his giant appetite&nbsp;\u2013 at times, half of the total food consumed by the Pandavas was eaten by him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=edited by Subodh|title=The Indian encyclopaedia : biographical, historical, religious, administrative, ethnological, commercial and scientific|year=2002|publisher=Cosmo Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788177552577|page=7535|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nBhima, being as powerful as his father.

He hatched a cunning plot where he poisoned Bhima's food and drowned him in River [[Ravi River|Ravi]]. Thankfully, the Naga king [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] saved Bhima and also apprised him of Duryodana's hatred for him.

Thanks to prior notice from [[Vidura]], the Pandavas managed to escape out from the palace with Bhima played a major role in carrying all five of them (Kunti and brothers) and escaping to safety. Bhima also barricaded the palace of Purochana and set fire to it, thereby ensuring Purochana became a victim of his own evil plot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02029.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bhima fighting with Bakasura color.jpg|thumb|Bhima fighting with Bakasura]]\nKunti and the Pandavas were living in ''agnyatavaasa'' (living incognito) after they escaped from the murder plot (Kunti suggests they be incognito to avoid further problems from the Kauravas). During their stay at Ekachakra or kaiwara (in West Bengal), they came to know of a demon, [[Bakasura]], who troubled people by eating members of their village and their provisions. The powerful Bhima brought his might to the fore and killed Bakasura, much to the delight of the villagers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01167.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bhimsen and Ghatotkach.jpg|thumb|left|Bhima (right) with his wife Hidimba and son Ghatotkacha.]]\nAt the time Bhima kills the demon [[Hidimba]] who was king of demons of forest [[Kamyaka]], he meets his sister [[Hidimbi]]; they eventually get married and have a son, [[Ghatotkacha]]. Hidimbi promises Kunti that she and Ghatotkacha will stay out of the Pandavas' lives and away from the luxuries of court. When Bhima killed the demon Hidimba, he became the King of Kamyaka for 5 years. In Mahabharata, the demon army from Kamyaka fought the war alongside Pandavas. After the death of Ghatotkacha Bhima again became king of Kamyaka.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThen the Pandavas attended the Swayamvara of [[Drupada]] princess, [[Draupadi]]. The Pandavas, led by Arjuna, were successful at the Swayamvara. With his brothers, he was married to Draupadi, who gave birth to a son, [[Upapandavas#Sutasoma|Sutasoma]]. At a later stage, Bhima also married Valandhara, the daughter of the king of [[Kasi Kingdom|Kasi]], and had a son named Savarga. Among Bhima's three sons, Sarvaga did not participate in the Kurukshetra war, Sutasoma was killed by [[Ashwatthama]] and Ghatotkacha was killed by [[Karna]].\n\n==Conquest for Rajasuya==\n[[File:Bhima Slays Jarasandha.jpg|thumb|300px|Bhima slays Jarasandha]]\nWhen [[Yudhishthira]] became emperor of [[Indraprastha]] he sent his four younger brothers out in different directions to subjugate kingdoms for the [[Rajasuya]] sacrifice. Bhima was sent out to the East, since [[Bhishma]] thought the easterners were skilled in fighting from the backs of elephants and in fighting with bare arms. He deemed Bhima to be the most ideal person to wage wars in that region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a100.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref> The Mahabharata mentions several kingdoms to the east of Indraprastha which were conquered by Bhima.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02029.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\nKey victories include his fights with:\n* [[Jarasandha]] of the [[Magadha]] empire. This was the most important win, as Jarasandha had several allies in the region, including [[Shishupala]] and [[Bhagadatta]]. Krishna tricked Jarasandha into having a wrestling bout with Bhima. This was an agonizing battle that stretched for 13 long days. At the end, Bhima broke Jarasandha's backbone with his knee and tore apart his body into two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02024.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n*[[Dasarna Kingdom|Dasarnas]], where the king called Sudharman with his bare arms fought a fierce battle with Bhima, who later appointed the mighty Sudharman as the first-in-command of his forces.\n*[[Karna]]. When Bhima came to Anga Kingdom, Karna didn\u2019t accept to make alliance due to which a terrific war took place between Bhima and [[Karna]]. Bhima and Karna both were very good archers. Each used some of their prominent weapons on each other. Bhima broke Karna\u2019s bow. Then both of them fought with the mace. At last Bhima defeated Karna but failed to kill because of Karna\u2019s Kavacha Kundal.<ref> https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02029.htm</ref>\n* [[Sishupala]] of [[Chedi Kingdom]], (who welcomed Bhima and hosted him for thirty days)\n* [[Matsya]], Maladas and the country called Madahara, Mahidara, and the Somadheyas, Vatsabhumi, and the king of the Bhargas, as also the ruler of the [[Nishada Kingdom|Nishadas]] and Manimat:\n* Southern [[Malla (India)|Mallas]] and the Bhagauanta mountain.\n* Sarmakas and the Varmakas\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:Exile of Pandavasa.jpg|thumb|left|Pandavas in Exile]]\nAfter Yudhishthira succumbed to [[Shakuni]]'s challenge in the game of dice, the Pandavas were forced into exile for 13 years, one of which was in anonymity. The exile period in the forests, saw the Pandavas come face to face with many [[rakshasa]]s and Bhima played a crucial role in the epic in rescuing his brothers every time.\n\n===Slaying Kirmira===\nRight at the start of the exile, in the woods of Kamyaka, the Pandavas encountered the demon [[Kirmira]], the brother of [[Bakasura]] and a friend of [[Hidimba]]. A fierce battle ensued between Bhima and the demon, where the two equally matched fighters hurled rocks and trees at each other. Eventually, Bhima emerged victorious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03010.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\n===Searching for Saugandhika flower===\n[[File:Draupadi showing the Sougandhika flowers to Bhima.jpg|thumb|150px|Draupadi showing the flowers to Bhima]]\n[[File:ASI , Bhima try to lift hanuman lift at gandhamadana mountain.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Bhima tries to lift [[Hanuman]]'s tail (by [[Archaeological Survey of India|Asi]] from [[Razmnama]])]]\n\nOnce in Badarikasrama forest, Draupadi scented the Saugandhika flower and was deeply attracted to it. The [[Lotus (genus)|lotus]] species was not to be located easily so Bhima went in search of the flower and ended up at [[Kubera]]'s palace. He was stopped in his tracks by the [[rakshasa]]s called '''Krodhavasas''', but he defeated them all and reached the lotus pond. He also slew the rakshasa '''Maniman''' a wicked demon, who had in the past, incurred a curse from Rishi [[Agastya]].\n\nBeing unused to the water of the pond, Bhima fell asleep on its shore. Later, the Pandavas arrived with Krishna and Draupadi in search of Bhima. They met Kubera who offered them baskets of Saugandhika lotuses and sent them on their way. Kubera was especially happy, as the slaughter of Maniman had relieved him of the curse too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03154.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\n==== Meeting Hanuman ====\nDuring his search for the Saugandhika flower, Bhima saw an old monkey, lying in the path, whose long tail was outstretching the region. Bhima in pride asked the monkey to move the tail blocking his path. But, the monkey replied saying he's too old and had no strength to do that and requested that Bhima do it instead. Outraged at being commanded by someone inferior to him, he grabbed the monkey's tail with his left hand with intention of swirling him via it and sending him in air and to his surprise he wasn't able to move it. So, he used both his hands and all his might but wasn't able to raise it. Defeated and surprised he asked the monkey for forgiveness with joined hands. The monkey revealed its true-self, [[Hanuman]] (his brother, as both were Vayu's children). Bhima received Hanuman's blessing in the form of increased strength which came from Hanuman's own body. He warned Bhima of the path ahead, blessed him of victory in all his endeavours and left.\n\n===Killing Jatasura===\nIn another minor incident in the epic, [[Jatasura]], a [[rakshasa]] disguised as a Brahmin abducted Yudhishthira, Draupadi and the twin brothers, Nakula, and Sahadeva during their stay at Badarikasrama. His objective was to seize the weapons of the Pandavas. Bhima, who was gone hunting during the abduction, was deeply upset when he came to know of Jatasura's evil act on his return. A fierce encounter followed between the two gigantic warriors, where Bhima emerged victorious by decapitating Jatasura and crushing his body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03156.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=Rashmi|title=Tibetans in exile : struggle for human rights|year=2010|publisher=Anamika Publishers & Distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788179752487|page=625}}</ref>\n\n===Cook at Virata's kingdom===\n[[File:Valala.jpg|thumb|left|Bhima as cook Vallabh]]\nAlong with his brothers, Bhima spent his last year of exile in the kingdom of [[Virata]].

Kichaka was crushed and slaughtered into a meatball by Bhima. \nLater Kichaka's allies plotted to murder Sairindri, but Bhima vanquished all of them.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Menon|first=[translated by] Ramesh|title=The Mahabharata : a modern rendering|year=2006|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9780595401871|page=645}}</ref>\n\n===Susarma's defeat===\nThe archenemy of Virata was King Susharma of the [[Trigarta Kingdom]], under the aegis of Duryodana, waged a battle against Virata by stealing the cows in his kingdom. Bhima lead the other Pandavas and Virata, and helped to rout the army of Susarma easily. Before he was about to strangle Susarma to death, Yudhishthira told him to spare him.\n\nBy this time, the 13-year exile period was completed and the rivalry between the siblings was renewed.\n\n==During the Kurukshetra War==\n[[File:Bhima fighting Duryodhana.jpg|thumb|Bhima fighting with [[Duryodhana]], [[Kalighat painting]]]]\nBefore the battle had begun, Bhima suggested that [[Satyaki]] would lead the Pandava forces, as their general, but [[Yudhishthira]] and [[Arjuna]] opted for Dhrishtadyumna.

But Bhima in his bloodlust, killed Durjaya by hitting Durjaya on head. Bhima, also defeated Alambusha on 14th day. 31 of [[Duryodhana]] brothers were also killed by Bhima in front of Karna and Duryodhana. Bhima slew [[Bahlika (Mahabharata)|Bahlika]], the King of the Bahlika kingdom on the night of the fourteenth day.\n\n===16th day===\n16th day of Kurukshetra war is completely dedicated to Bhima.

Bhima defeated [[Karna]] in archery. Soon Karna picked up sword and rushed on to Bhima. Soon they engaged in sword fight, when Bhima was about to stab Karna, Karna's son [[Banasena]] came in aid of his father. On seeing Banasena, Bhima got angered as his own son [[Ghatotkacha]] was slain by Karna. Banasena challenged Bhima and soon attacked Bhima with mace. Bhima brutally but fairly killed Banasena infront of [[Karna]]. Bhima killed Banasena by hitting him several times on head, chest and abdomen regions . Seeing his son's fate; Karna quickly picked up a mace and attacked Bhima. Still in anger, Bhima beat Karna several times and almost took Karna to death.

After given option to choose opponent & kind of duel, Duryodhana chose Bhima as his opponent & mace fight as duel. Bhima clashed with Duryodhana in a mace fight. Though Bhima had superior strength, Duryodhana started dominating. Lord [[Krishna]] knew that it is not possible to kill Duryodhana because Duryodhana's body turned as tough as a diamond with power in Gandhari's eyes. Krishna instrucuted Bhima to hit [[Duryodhana]]'s thighs through gestures. Bhima did as Krishna directed & successfully broke thighs of Duryodhana. Enraged at this sight, [[Balarama]] grabbing his plough paced to attack Bhima, but was stopped by [[Krishna]]. Krishna convinced his brother by narrating the injustice death of [[Abhimanyu]] and evils committed by [[Duryodhana]].\n\n==Later years and death==\n[[File:The blind Dhritarashtra attacks the statue of Bhima.jpg|thumb|The blind Dhritarashtra attacks the statue of Bhima]]\nAfter the war, [[Dhritarashtra]] was enraged by Bhima's slaying of all his sons.

When Bhima tires and falls down, he asks his elder brother why he, Bhima, is unable to complete the journey to heaven. Yudhishthira explains his brother's vice of [[gluttony]].

Specifically, he became a master in using the [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. Bhima's strong point throughout the epic remains his towering strength. He was so wrathful and strong that it was impossible even for [[Indra]] to subdue him in a battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05022.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\nBhima was also renowned for his giant appetite&nbsp;\u2013 at times, half of the total food consumed by the Pandavas was eaten by him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=edited by Subodh|title=The Indian encyclopaedia : biographical, historical, religious, administrative, ethnological, commercial and scientific|year=2002|publisher=Cosmo Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788177552577|page=7535|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nBhima, being as powerful as his father.

He hatched a cunning plot where he poisoned Bhima's food and drowned him in River [[Ravi River|Ravi]]. Thankfully, the Naga king [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] saved Bhima and also apprised him of Duryodana's hatred for him. It is also Vasuki who bestowed him the immense strength of ten thousand elephants.<ref>{{cite book|last=Menon|first=[translated by] Ramesh|title=The Mahabharata : a modern rendering|year=2006|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9780595401871|page=103}}</ref>\n[[File:Child bhima fight with Nagas.jpg|thumb|left|Bhima fighting with the Nagas]]\n\nDuryodana with his counsellor [[Purochana]] hatched a plan to burn the Pandavas alive at a lac palace [[Lakshagraha]] at Varnavrata that Duryodhana had built there (lacquer is highly inflammable). Thanks to prior notice from [[Vidura]], the Pandavas managed to escape out from the palace with Bhima played a major role in carrying all five of them (Kunti and brothers) and escaping to safety. Bhima also barricaded the palace of Purochana and set fire to it, thereby ensuring Purochana became a victim of his own evil plot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02029.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bhima fighting with Bakasura color.jpg|thumb|Bhima fighting with Bakasura]]\nKunti and the Pandavas were living in ''agnyatavaasa'' (living incognito) after they escaped from the murder plot (Kunti suggests they be incognito to avoid further problems from the Kauravas). During their stay at Ekachakra or kaiwara (in West Bengal), they came to know of a demon, [[Bakasura]], who troubled people by eating members of their village and their provisions. The powerful Bhima brought his might to the fore and killed Bakasura, much to the delight of the villagers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01167.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bhimsen and Ghatotkach.jpg|thumb|left|Bhima (right) with his wife Hidimba and son Ghatotkacha.]]\nAt the time Bhima kills the demon [[Hidimba]] who was king of demons of forest [[Kamyaka]], he meets his sister [[Hidimbi]]; they eventually get married and have a son, [[Ghatotkacha]]. Hidimbi promises Kunti that she and Ghatotkacha will stay out of the Pandavas' lives and away from the luxuries of court. When Bhima killed the demon Hidimba, he became the King of Kamyaka for 5 years. In Mahabharata, the demon army from Kamyaka fought the war alongside Pandavas. After the death of Ghatotkacha Bhima again became king of Kamyaka.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThen the Pandavas attended the Swayamvara of [[Drupada]] princess, [[Draupadi]]. The Pandavas, led by Arjuna, were successful at the Swayamvara. With his brothers, he was married to Draupadi, who gave birth to a son, [[Upapandavas#Sutasoma|Sutasoma]]. At a later stage, Bhima also married Valandhara, the daughter of the king of [[Kasi Kingdom|Kasi]], and had a son named Savarga. Among Bhima's three sons, Sarvaga did not participate in the Kurukshetra war, Sutasoma was killed by [[Ashwatthama]] and Ghatotkacha was killed by [[Karna]].\n\n==Conquest for Rajasuya==\n[[File:Bhima Slays Jarasandha.jpg|thumb|300px|Bhima slays Jarasandha]]\nWhen [[Yudhishthira]] became emperor of [[Indraprastha]] he sent his four younger brothers out in different directions to subjugate kingdoms for the [[Rajasuya]] sacrifice. Bhima was sent out to the East, since [[Bhishma]] thought the easterners were skilled in fighting from the backs of elephants and in fighting with bare arms. He deemed Bhima to be the most ideal person to wage wars in that region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a100.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref> The Mahabharata mentions several kingdoms to the east of Indraprastha which were conquered by Bhima.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02029.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\nKey victories include his fights with:\n* [[Jarasandha]] of the [[Magadha]] empire. This was the most important win, as Jarasandha had several allies in the region, including [[Shishupala]] and [[Bhagadatta]]. Krishna tricked Jarasandha into having a wrestling bout with Bhima. This was an agonizing battle that stretched for 13 long days. At the end, Bhima broke Jarasandha's backbone with his knee and tore apart his body into two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02024.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n*[[Dasarna Kingdom|Dasarnas]], where the king called Sudharman with his bare arms fought a fierce battle with Bhima, who later appointed the mighty Sudharman as the first-in-command of his forces.\n*[[Karna]]. When Bhima came to Anga Kingdom, Karna didn\u2019t accept to make alliance due to which a terrific war took place between Bhima and [[Karna]]. Bhima and Karna both were very good archers. Each used some of their prominent weapons on each other. Bhima broke Karna\u2019s bow. Then both of them fought with the mace. At last Bhima defeated Karna but failed to kill because of Karna\u2019s Kavacha Kundal.<ref> https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02029.htm</ref>\n* [[Sishupala]] of [[Chedi Kingdom]], (who welcomed Bhima and hosted him for thirty days)\n* [[Matsya]], Maladas and the country called Madahara, Mahidara, and the Somadheyas, Vatsabhumi, and the king of the Bhargas, as also the ruler of the [[Nishada Kingdom|Nishadas]] and Manimat:\n* Southern [[Malla (India)|Mallas]] and the Bhagauanta mountain.\n* Sarmakas and the Varmakas\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:Exile of Pandavasa.jpg|thumb|left|Pandavas in Exile]]\nAfter Yudhishthira succumbed to [[Shakuni]]'s challenge in the game of dice, the Pandavas were forced into exile for 13 years, one of which was in anonymity. The exile period in the forests, saw the Pandavas come face to face with many [[rakshasa]]s and Bhima played a crucial role in the epic in rescuing his brothers every time.\n\n===Slaying Kirmira===\nRight at the start of the exile, in the woods of Kamyaka, the Pandavas encountered the demon [[Kirmira]], the brother of [[Bakasura]] and a friend of [[Hidimba]]. A fierce battle ensued between Bhima and the demon, where the two equally matched fighters hurled rocks and trees at each other. Eventually, Bhima emerged victorious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03010.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\n===Searching for Saugandhika flower===\n[[File:Draupadi showing the Sougandhika flowers to Bhima.jpg|thumb|150px|Draupadi showing the flowers to Bhima]]\n[[File:ASI , Bhima try to lift hanuman lift at gandhamadana mountain.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Bhima tries to lift [[Hanuman]]'s tail (by [[Archaeological Survey of India|Asi]] from [[Razmnama]])]]\n\nOnce in Badarikasrama forest, Draupadi scented the Saugandhika flower and was deeply attracted to it. The [[Lotus (genus)|lotus]] species was not to be located easily so Bhima went in search of the flower and ended up at [[Kubera]]'s palace. He was stopped in his tracks by the [[rakshasa]]s called '''Krodhavasas''', but he defeated them all and reached the lotus pond. He also slew the rakshasa '''Maniman''' a wicked demon, who had in the past, incurred a curse from Rishi [[Agastya]].\n\nBeing unused to the water of the pond, Bhima fell asleep on its shore. Later, the Pandavas arrived with Krishna and Draupadi in search of Bhima. They met Kubera who offered them baskets of Saugandhika lotuses and sent them on their way. Kubera was especially happy, as the slaughter of Maniman had relieved him of the curse too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03154.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref>\n\n==== Meeting Hanuman ====\nDuring his search for the Saugandhika flower, Bhima saw an old monkey, lying in the path, whose long tail was outstretching the region. Bhima in pride asked the monkey to move the tail blocking his path. But, the monkey replied saying he's too old and had no strength to do that and requested that Bhima do it instead. Outraged at being commanded by someone inferior to him, he grabbed the monkey's tail with his left hand with intention of swirling him via it and sending him in air and to his surprise he wasn't able to move it. So, he used both his hands and all his might but wasn't able to raise it. Defeated and surprised he asked the monkey for forgiveness with joined hands. The monkey revealed its true-self, [[Hanuman]] (his brother, as both were Vayu's children). Bhima received Hanuman's blessing in the form of increased strength which came from Hanuman's own body. He warned Bhima of the path ahead, blessed him of victory in all his endeavours and left.\n\n===Killing Jatasura===\nIn another minor incident in the epic, [[Jatasura]], a [[rakshasa]] disguised as a Brahmin abducted Yudhishthira, Draupadi and the twin brothers, Nakula, and Sahadeva during their stay at Badarikasrama. His objective was to seize the weapons of the Pandavas. Bhima, who was gone hunting during the abduction, was deeply upset when he came to know of Jatasura's evil act on his return. A fierce encounter followed between the two gigantic warriors, where Bhima emerged victorious by decapitating Jatasura and crushing his body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03156.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=Rashmi|title=Tibetans in exile : struggle for human rights|year=2010|publisher=Anamika Publishers & Distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788179752487|page=625}}</ref>\n\n===Cook at Virata's kingdom===\n[[File:Valala.jpg|thumb|left|Bhima as cook Vallabh]]\nAlong with his brothers, Bhima spent his last year of exile in the kingdom of [[Virata]].

Bhima also defeated karna and then spared his life remembering [[Arjuna]]'s oath. Seeing Karna's failure, [[Duryodhana]] sends a legion of elephants to check Bhima's advance, and Bhima thoroughly destroys the army, leaving a bloody trail of elephant entrails.\n[[Durjaya]] ([[Dussasana]]'s son), on Duryodhana's order, attempted to stop Bhima. But Bhima in his bloodlust, killed Durjaya by hitting Durjaya on head. Bhima, also defeated Alambusha on 14th day. On the same day, Bhima defeated Karna 7 times but spared his life remembering Arjuna's oath of assassinating Karna. 31 of [[Duryodhana]] brothers were also killed by Bhima in front of Karna and Duryodhana. Bhima slew [[Bahlika (Mahabharata)|Bahlika]], the King of the Bahlika kingdom on the night of the fourteenth day.\n\n===16th day===\n16th day of Kurukshetra war is completely dedicated to Bhima.

Bhima defeated [[Karna]] in archery. Soon Karna picked up sword and rushed on to Bhima. Soon they engaged in sword fight, when Bhima was about to stab Karna, Karna's son [[Banasena]] came in aid of his father. On seeing Banasena, Bhima got angered as his own son [[Ghatotkacha]] was slain by Karna. Banasena challenged Bhima and soon attacked Bhima with mace. Bhima brutally but fairly killed Banasena infront of [[Karna]]. Bhima killed Banasena by hitting him several times on head, chest and abdomen regions . Seeing his son's fate; Karna quickly picked up a mace and attacked Bhima. Still in anger, Bhima beat Karna several times and almost took Karna to death.

After given option to choose opponent & kind of duel, Duryodhana chose Bhima as his opponent & mace fight as duel. Bhima clashed with Duryodhana in a mace fight. Though Bhima had superior strength, Duryodhana started dominating. Lord [[Krishna]] knew that it is not possible to kill Duryodhana because Duryodhana's body turned as tough as a diamond with power in Gandhari's eyes. Krishna instrucuted Bhima to hit [[Duryodhana]]'s thighs through gestures. Bhima did as Krishna directed & successfully broke thighs of Duryodhana. Enraged at this sight, [[Balarama]] grabbing his plough paced to attack Bhima, but was stopped by [[Krishna]]. Krishna convinced his brother by narrating the injustice death of [[Abhimanyu]] and evils committed by [[Duryodhana]].\n\n==Later years and death==\n[[File:The blind Dhritarashtra attacks the statue of Bhima.jpg|thumb|The blind Dhritarashtra attacks the statue of Bhima]]\nAfter the war, [[Dhritarashtra]] was enraged by Bhima's slaying of all his sons. When the Pandavas arrive at [[Hastinapur]] to claim the kingdom and pay their respects, Krishna, sensing his anger, placed an iron statue of Bhima in front of Dhritarashtra. When embracing Bhima, Dhritarashtra crushed the statue into pieces, but later realised his folly and apologised.\n\n[[Yudhishthira]] appointed Bhima as the commander-in-chief of Hastinapur and also King of [[Kamyaka]] forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a041.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}</ref> Upon the onset of the [[Kali yuga|Kaliyuga]], Bhima and the other Pandavas retired. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]].\n\nOn the journey, the group, one-by-one, begins to fall. When Bhima tires and falls down, he asks his elder brother why he, Bhima, is unable to complete the journey to heaven. Yudhishthira explains his brother's vice of [[gluttony]]. In some versions of the story, Yudhishthira points out Bhima's boastfulness, pride, and battle-lust as the reasons for his fall.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Bhima}}\n\n{{Mahabharata}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in the Mahabharata]]\n", "name_user": "Sunny 7809", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I have cut some incorrect facts or myth that not mentioned in Mahabharata written by Vedvyas.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima"}

He was born as the son of Magnus Anundson Sture and Karin Algotsdotter who belonged to the ancient [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] dynasty of justiciars.\nThe family byname [[Sture]], already of his father (this was an exceptional case of a hereditary byname, surname, being in real use in medieval Sweden), was not used of Algot. He was usually known as Algot of  R\u00e4fsn\u00e4s.\nThrough his marriage with Marta Bosdotter of Rigshult, Algot received new positions and moved from Westrogothia to the east-coast regions of Sweden: Ostrogothia and provinces around the Lake M\u00e4laren.<ref name=\"snl\"/>\n\nAlgot's wife was a first cousin of the High Justiciar [[Bo Jonsson (Grip) |Bo Jonsson]] of [[Gripsholm Castle|Gripsholm]] (ca 1330\u2013 1386), then the  head of the High Council of Sweden and real leader of the country. Bo Jonsson built his power base  by having trusted relatives in important positions including Algot. Bo Jonson obtained in c. 1383 the Westrogothian fortresses \u00d6resten and \u00d6ppensten. Algot was appointed as his governor there.\n\nIn 1388, Algot was the first Swedish aristocrat to start support [[Margaret I of Denmark]] against the then King [[Albert of Sweden]], a Mecklenburger.  By 1389, Albert was deposed of Sweden and incarcerated, while the Dowager Queen Margaret became the new ruler.\n\nIn 1392-1393 Algot was castellan of \u00d6rebro, and the winter 1393-1394 he held power in all Uplandia and led the siege of Stockholm, the \"capital\" town yet in hands of the deposed king Albert's representatives (led by the bailiff Herbrekt K\u00f6nigsmark). King Albert himself was kept imprisoned in the castle of Lindholm in Skaane.\n\nHe became a member of the National Council in 1395.\nAlgot played a key role in the lengthy peace negotiations in Lindholmen and Helsingborg, which ended with the release of Albert, in exchange for his vow to either give up Stockholm within three years, or pay a large sum in compensation to Margaret. After the three years, Albert chose to have Stockholm surrender.\n\nBy 1400, Algot became owner of the estate ''R\u00e4fsn\u00e4s'' in [[S\u00f6dermanland]] where he then mainly lived.\nIn 1403-1404, Algot had command of the expedition to [[Gotland]], to regain the island from the[[Teutonic Order]], but the campaign was unsuccessful.\nIn 1405, Algot was  grant a [[fief]] for life as castellan of Styresholm and governor over [[\u00c5ngermanland]]. In 1419 Algot received [[Gripsholm Castle]], which he exchanged in 1423 for [[Nyk\u00f6ping Castle]]. In his last years the councillor Algot of  R\u00e4fsn\u00e4s accompanied King Eric XIII on journeys to other lands. Algot died on 7 March 1425 or 1426, and was buried at [[Vadstena Abbey]].\n\n==Family==\nAbout 30 August 1381 Algot married M\u00e4rta Bosdotter of Ringshult, scion of an important Ostrogothian  family and widow of castellan Christopher Mikelsdorp. Her father was lord Bo Bosson of Ringshult, and grandmother had been Cecilia Knutsdotter of Aspanes, descendant of several dukes.\n\nThe couple had four historically known surviving children:\n\n* Anund Algotson Sture, lord of Revsnes, who married heiress of Gr\u00f6nskog\n* Gustav Algotson Sture, holder of \u00c4ngs\u00f6 who married firstly heiress of \u00c4ngs\u00f6, and secondly heiress of Lagmans\u00f6.\n* Karin (Katarina) Algotsdotter of Revsnes, who first married Karl Karlsson, Lord of Ulv\u00e5sa (grandson of St. Bridget of Sweden), and secondly knight H\u00e5kan Nilsson.\n* Marta (Margareta) Algotsdotter of Revsnes, married the immensely rich knight Erik Jonson Ummereise, lord of Bj\u00f6rn\u00f6 near Kalmar\n\nWhen Marta's son Johan Erikson Ummereise died in c 1440 as last of his line, the Ummereise inheritance became inherited by his surviving cousins. Algot Gustavson Sture from Lagmans\u00f6 became lord of Bj\u00f6rn\u00f6.\n\nKarin Algotsdotter had one known daughter from both of her marriages. When the elder, Birgitta Karlsdotter of Ulv\u00e5sa, died at the approximate age of nine, bringing to extinction her paternal grandfather's entire line, the surviving mother Karin Algotsdotter inherited Ulv\u00e5sa, St. Bridget's family seat. Karin's younger daughter (who inherited Ulv\u00e5sa from the mother) married and had children, one of whom married but her children did not survive, and Ulv\u00e5sa ended to Ellen Gisladotter of Geddeholm, a half-sibling of these last ones.\n\nWhereas lineages from both sons survive to the present day. One son's family produced, among others, the regent [[Sten Sture the Elder]] and his nephews, while the Lagmans\u00f6 branch on the other hand cognatically continued through short-lived branches of families of Oxenstierna, [[Tillbakaseende Ulv]], [[Thott]], [[F\u00e4rla]] and [[Gera]] to barons [[Oxenstierna]].\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Other sources==\n* Sture, 3.

On 14th April, 2020, in an awful incident during Corona lockdown, a pair of hindu saints were passing by at night. They were stopped by police due to lockdown. At the same time the hundreds of villagers gathered there and attacked them in presence of police. As the police was outnumbered, they couldn't save the saints and there driver from being killed by the villagers. Later on this became a national issue. 105 villagers were arrested by police.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India]], Gadchinchale has 248 households.
