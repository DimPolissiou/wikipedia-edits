The three categories of sex education in India are (1) the [[sex education]] courses targeted at adolescents in school, (2) family planning for adults, and (3) HIV/AIDS Prevention Education. This article outlines the current state of, efficacy of, and opposition to these types of sex education in India. For history regarding family planning in India, see [[Family planning in India|Family Planning in India]].\n\n==Current state of sexual health==\n\n=== Sex and pregnancy ===\nThe sex ratio in India is skewed towards males, with 943 girls born per 1000 males in 2011. This is propagated by several factors, including lower caloric intake by mothers, female infanticide, and cultural preference for boys. However, the most plausible explanation for fewer female than male births is prenatal sex determination, followed by induced abortion of female fetuses.<ref>Jha, Prabhat, Rajesh Kumar, Priya Vasa, Neeraj Dhingra, Deva Thiruchelvam, and Rahim Moineddin. \"Low male-to-female sex ratio of children born in India: national survey of 1\u00b7 1 million households.\" ''The Lancet'' 367, no. 9506 (2006): 211\u2013218.\n</ref> This suggests that potential mothers are socialised to believe that having a female child is detrimental to their family, either economically or socially.\n\nIn some areas of India, many young men and women are delaying their marriages to pursue their careers, a result of rising education levels. However, most Indian households are conservative and prohibit discussions about sex. In rural areas and urban slums, girls are often married early and they don't go into marriage equipped with any knowledge of sex. This manifests itself on a larger scale. According to [[UNICEF]], about 240 million women alive in India today were married before the age of 18<ref name=\"ThirdChild-HT\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/at-240-million-india-has-a-third-of-child-marriages-in-the-world/story-4VCQjqPRIfuxUBFSPs7xoJ.html|title=At 240 million, India has a third of child marriages in the world|date=12 August 2014|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> even though the average age of women at first marriage has increased to 20.6.<ref name=\"PushAge-DNA\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-indian-women-push-back-marriage-age-1350166|title=Indian women push back marriage age|date=20 February 2010|work=[[DNA India]]`|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref><ref>https://remakeindia.in/sex-education-in-india/</ref>\n\nAdolescent fertility usually occurs within marriage because girls are encouraged to reproduce as early as they can after they are married. Therefore, 36% of children (aged 13\u201316) and 64% of adolescents (aged 17\u201319) are pregnant or already mothers.<ref name=\"Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998\">Jejeebhoy, Shireen J. \"Adolescent sexual and reproductive behavior: a review of the evidence from India\". ''Social Science & Medicine'' 46, no. 10 (1998): 1275\u20131290.</ref> Conversely, pregnancy outside of wedlock carries severe social stigma in India. [[Medical termination of pregnancy]] is available to few and the attitude of the providers towards such women is not amicable. As a result, they may attempt [[unsafe abortion]]s or abandon the child. Such stigmatised women may also commit suicide.<ref name=\"Watsa2005\">{{cite journal|date=2005|title=Sexual Health Services for Young People|url=http://medind.nic.in/jah/t04/s1/jaht04s1p36g.pdf|journal=Journal of Family Welfare|publisher=[[Family Planning Association of India]]|volume=50|issue=I|page=36|last1=Watsa|first1=M. C.}}</ref>\n\nContraception is rarely used within or outside of marriage. Based on a National Family Health Survey conducted in 1992\u20131993, 7.1% of married women (aged 15\u201319) use contraception, compared to 21% among women (aged 20\u201324).<ref name=\"Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998\"/> Additionally, adolescents lack access to contraceptive methods like oral contraceptives and diaphragms. Lack of contraception use is coupled with lack of availability of safe abortions. While five million abortions occur annually in India, only 10% of those are performed within the structures of a high-quality hospital.<ref name=\"Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998\"/>\n\n=== HIV/AIDS and other STIs ===\nMore than four million people are estimated to be infected with HIV in India \u2013 the highest proportion of any country in the world. Slightly more than one half are men, and almost one half are women.<ref>Newmann, S., P. Sarin, N. Kumarasamy, E. Amalraj, M. Rogers, P. Madhivanan, T. Flanigan et al. \"Marriage, monogamy and HIV: a profile of HIV-infected women in south India.\" ''International journal of STD & AIDS'' 11, no. 4 (2000): 250\u2013253.</ref>\n\nPremarital sex has risen in India, and a large proportion of it is unprotected. Additionally, married men often engage in risky behavior by having unprotected sex with multiple partners, which can include commercial sex workers. Finally, the cultural patriarchal structure in India makes it unlikely that women will be able to ensure that their husbands are monogamous (South et al.).<ref>South, S. J., Trent, K., & Bose, S.

Disparities in gender at this age can often be explained by relatively poor access to reproductive health care and the fact that girls often have less access to food, which adversely affects their growth patterns. Additionally, adolescent girls often work long hours in the home with no opportunity for employment (Selvan et al.).<ref name=\"Selvan, M. S. 2001\">Selvan, M. S., M. W. Ross, A. S. Kapadia, R. Mathai, and S. Hira. \"Study of perceived norms, beliefs and intended sexual behaviour among higher secondary school students in India.\" ''AIDS care'' 13, no. 6 (2001): 779-788.</ref>\n\nAdolescents, both males and females, tend to not be informed about sexuality. This is often caused by lack of education in general (but sex education in particular) and conservative attitudes towards sex.<ref name=\"Selvan, M. S. 2001\"/>\n\n==== Efficacy ====\nParents are often hi\n to teach accurate and relevant information about sex to adolescents because of the stigma associated with the topic. More than taboo, mothers especially feel like talking about sex is embarrassing and dirty (Tripathi et al.).<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\">Tripathi, Niharika, and T. V. Sekher. \"Youth in India ready for sex education? Emerging evidence from national surveys.\" ''PloS'' one 8, no. 8 (2013): e71584.</ref>\n\nThis same attitude is held by teachers. First, when the National Council of Educational Research and Training initiated sex education, they structured it as a part of existing studies, rather than a separate subject. However, the teachers tried to avoid teaching the topic. Second, a school in [[Gujarat]] implemented a system where students could anonymously drop letters into a box for trained counselors to read. The nature of these questions tended to split by sex. Girls' questions-of-school adolescents (Tripathi et al.).<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\"/>\n\nIn a 2005 study in [[Chandigarh]], a reproductive health education package was prepared after consulting parents and teachers to address cultural sensitivities. The package had a guidebook for the instructor and a book for the students for self-study. The students (aged 15\u201320; mean age was 16.47) were grouped and subjected to two types of education methods. In the first method, education was directly provided to them in a classroom setting by an instructor. In the second method, some students were selected and educated by instructors. Following that, they were encouraged to engage in [[peer education]]. A third group was reserved as a [[control group|control]]. The first group showed the most improvement in their knowledge after the nine-month programme. The peer-education group showed knowledge levels similar to the first group after a three-month course. The increase in knowledge level was considered significant after comparison to the control group.<ref name=\"Parwej2005\" />\n\nSurveys have shown that adolescents learn a significant amount about sex from the media, including books and movies. However, exposure is not equivalent to accuracy. Though teens interacted with media that talked about sex, they did not glean accurate information regarding the reproductive process. Additionally, exposure to media didn't teach adolescents about healthy emotional growth or responsible adulthood.<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\"/>\n\nFinally, the level of awareness and knowledge regarding sex education among adolescents is higher among those living in urban areas than among those living in rural areas. This is caused by higher-quality education and more exposure to globalised points of view (Abraham).<ref name=\":2\">Abraham, Leena, and K. Anil Kumar. \"Sexual experiences and their correlates among college students in Mumbai City, India.\" ''International Family Planning Perspectives'' (1999): 139\u2013152.</ref>\n\n==== Opposition ====\nThere has been significant opposition to sex education, specifically for adolescents. In 2007, when sex education curriculum was promoted by India's Ministry of Human Resource Development, controversy developed. Many opponents believed that sex education would corrupt youth and be anathema to traditional Indian values. Additionally, they believed it would lead to promiscuity and irresponsible behavior. Finally, they argued that sex education was a western construct that was being forced upon India.

During [[The Emergency (India)|India's Emergency period]] in the 1970s, the government implemented a population-control policy which targeted lower-caste individuals.<ref name=\":0\">Connelly, Matthew. \"Population control in India: Prologue to the emergency period.\" ''Population and Development Review'' 32, no. 4 (2006): 629-667.</ref> Because the United States used food aid as leverage, India was incentivised to create a program that would influence lower-caste individuals to not have children. This program was eventually disbanded because of the lack of hygiene associated with the procedures and the nearly coercive techniques that were used (Connelly).<ref name=\":0\" /> (see [[Family planning in India]])\n\nIndia's family planning programmes are mainly run by the government in conjunction with NGOs. Because these programs are often quota-based, they take two forms: sterilisation programmes and contraceptive programmes (Gray et al.).<ref>Gray, Ronald H., Xianbin Li, Godfrey Kigozi, David Serwadda, Fred Nalugoda, Stephen Watya, Steven J. Reynolds, and Maria Wawer. \"The impact of male circumcision on HIV incidence and cost per infection prevented: a stochastic simulation model from Rakai, Uganda.\" ''Aids'' 21, no. 7 (2007): 845-850.</ref> Both use an incentive-based approach, where families are often given kitchen items or cash to undergo procedures (Bhatnagar et al.).<ref>Bhatnagar, R., K. Singh, T. Bir, U. Datta, S. Raj, and D. Nandan. \"An assessment of performance based incentive system for ASHA Sahyogini in Udaipur, Rajasthan.\" ''Indian journal of public health'' 53, no. 3 (2008): 166-170.</ref>\n\n==== Efficacy ====\nThe efficacy of India's family planning programs is dependent on the paradigm that is being used. Programs like Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) encourage women to register pregnancies and visit local health centres, and also encourage family planning through sterilisation. ASHA also  holds information meetings and raise awareness on such issues as women\u2019s health, disease, social determinants of health, nutrition and sanitation. Additionally, they serve as counsellors on adolescent and female sexual and reproductive health (Scott).<ref>Scott, K., & Shanker, S. (2010). Tying their hands?

Harvard</ref>\n\n==== Opposition ====\nFirst, the most significant criticisms of India's family planning program are those that advocate that it should be education-based rather than quota-based. They argue that India's program isn't sustainable because it does not stop women from marrying early or from spacing their pregnancies. Second, critics state that India's program does not consider the psyche of women who often undergo irreversible procedures like sterilisation because it doesn't provide the infrastructure for regular follow-ups. Finally, critics state that the programme is inherently gendered because most sterilisations are performed on women even though the procedure is less invasive for men (Vicziany).<ref>Vicziany, M.

This article outlines the current state of, efficacy of, and opposition to these types of sex education in India. For history regarding family planning in India, see [[Family planning in India|Family Planning in India]].\n\n==Current state of sexual health==\n\n=== Sex and pregnancy ===\nThe sex ratio in India is skewed towards males, with 943 girls born per 1000 males in 2011. This is propagated by several factors, including lower caloric intake by mothers, female infanticide, and cultural preference for boys. However, the most plausible explanation for fewer female than male births is prenatal sex determination, followed by induced abortion of female fetuses.<ref>Jha, Prabhat, Rajesh Kumar, Priya Vasa, Neeraj Dhingra, Deva Thiruchelvam, and Rahim Moineddin. \"Low male-to-female sex ratio of children born in India: national survey of 1\u00b7 1 million households.\" ''The Lancet'' 367, no. 9506 (2006): 211\u2013218.\n</ref> This suggests that potential mothers are socialised to believe that having a female child is detrimental to their family, either economically or socially.\n\nIn some areas of India, many young men and women are delaying their marriages to pursue their careers, a result of rising education levels. However, most Indian households are conservative and prohibit discussions about sex. In rural areas and urban slums, girls are often married early and they don't go into marriage equipped with any knowledge of sex. This manifests itself on a larger scale. According to [[UNICEF]], about 240 million women alive in India today were married before the age of 18<ref name=\"ThirdChild-HT\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/at-240-million-india-has-a-third-of-child-marriages-in-the-world/story-4VCQjqPRIfuxUBFSPs7xoJ.html|title=At 240 million, India has a third of child marriages in the world|date=12 August 2014|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> even though the average age of women at first marriage has increased to 20.6.<ref name=\"PushAge-DNA\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-indian-women-push-back-marriage-age-1350166|title=Indian women push back marriage age|date=20 February 2010|work=[[DNA India]]`|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref><ref>https://remakeindia.in/sex-education-in-india/</ref>\n\nAdolescent fertility usually occurs within marriage because girls are encouraged to reproduce as early as they can after they are married. Therefore, 36% of children (aged 13\u201316) and 64% of adolescents (aged 17\u201319) are pregnant or already mothers.<ref name=\"Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998\">Jejeebhoy, Shireen J. \"Adolescent sexual and reproductive behavior: a review of the evidence from India\".

Based on a National Family Health Survey conducted in 1992\u20131993, 7.1% of married women (aged 15\u201319) use contraception, compared to 21% among women (aged 20\u201324).<ref name=\"Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998\"/> Additionally, adolescents lack access to contraceptive methods like oral contraceptives and diaphragms. Lack of contraception use is coupled with lack of availability of safe abortions. While five million abortions occur annually in India, only 10% of those are performed within the structures of a high-quality hospital.<ref name=\"Jejeebhoy, Shireen J 1998\"/>\n\n=== HIV/AIDS and other STIs ===\nMore than four million people are estimated to be infected with HIV in India \u2013 the highest proportion of any country in the world. Slightly more than one half are men, and almost one half are women.<ref>Newmann, S., P. Sarin, N. Kumarasamy, E. Amalraj, M. Rogers, P. Madhivanan, T.

Disparities in gender at this age can often be explained by relatively poor access to reproductive health care and the fact that girls often have less access to food, which adversely affects their growth patterns. Additionally, adolescent girls often work long hours in the home with no opportunity for employment (Selvan et al.).<ref name=\"Selvan, M. S. 2001\">Selvan, M. S., M. W. Ross, A. S. Kapadia, R. Mathai, and S. Hira. \"Study of perceived norms, beliefs and intended sexual behaviour among higher secondary school students in India.\" ''AIDS care'' 13, no. 6 (2001): 779-788.</ref>\n\nAdolescents, both males and females, tend to not be informed about sexuality. This is often caused by lack of education in general (but sex education in particular) and conservative attitudes towards sex.<ref name=\"Selvan, M. S. 2001\"/>\n\n==== Efficacy ====\nParents are often reluctant to teach accurate and relevant information about sex to adolescents because of the stigma associated with the topic. More than taboo, mothers especially feel like talking about sex is embarrassing and dirty (Tripathi et al.).<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\">Tripathi, Niharika, and T. V. Sekher. \"Youth in India ready for sex education? Emerging evidence from national surveys.\" ''PloS'' one 8, no. 8 (2013): e71584.</ref>\n\nThis same attitude is held by teachers. First, when the National Council of Educational Research and Training initiated sex education, they structured it as a part of existing studies, rather than a separate subject. However, teachers tried to avoid teaching the topic. Second, a school in [[Gujarat]] implemented a system where students could anonymously drop letters into a box for trained counselors to read. The nature of these questions tended to split by sex. Girls' questions tended to focus on menstruation, physical appearance, and 'normal' sexual behavior while boys' questions tended to focus on nocturnal emission, masturbation and body size (Abraham et al.).<ref name=\":2\" /> Though these programmes exist, they are unable to reach girls who are not school, a significant section of the population. Other than the specific initiatives outlined above, there are very few services that cater specifically to adolescents. Though NGOs and local schools are trying to push for more, teachers rarely cover issues like sexuality and reproductive health. Additionally, NGO reach is limited even though they can reach out-of-school adolescents (Tripathi et al.).<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\"/>\n\nIn a 2005 study in [[Chandigarh]], a reproductive health education package was prepared after consulting parents and teachers to address cultural sensitivities. The package had a guidebook for the instructor and a book for the students for self-study. The students (aged 15\u201320; mean age was 16.47) were grouped and subjected to two types of education methods. In the first method, education was directly provided to them in a classroom setting by an instructor. In the second method, some students were selected and educated by instructors. Following that, they were encouraged to engage in [[peer education]]. A third group was reserved as a [[control group|control]]. The first group showed the most improvement in their knowledge after the nine-month programme. The peer-education group showed knowledge levels similar to the first group after a three-month course. The increase in knowledge level was considered significant after comparison to the control group.<ref name=\"Parwej2005\" />\n\nSurveys have shown that adolescents learn a significant amount about sex from the media, including books and movies. However, exposure is not equivalent to accuracy. Though teens interacted with media that talked about sex, they did not glean accurate information regarding the reproductive process. Additionally, exposure to media didn't teach adolescents about healthy emotional growth or responsible adulthood.<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\"/>\n\nFinally, the level of awareness and knowledge regarding sex education among adolescents is higher among those living in urban areas than among those living in rural areas. This is caused by higher-quality education and more exposure to globalised points of view (Abraham).<ref name=\":2\">Abraham, Leena, and K. Anil Kumar. \"Sexual experiences and their correlates among college students in Mumbai City, India.\" ''International Family Planning Perspectives'' (1999): 139\u2013152.</ref>\n\n==== Opposition ====\nThere has been significant opposition to sex education, specifically for adolescents. In 2007, when sex education curriculum was promoted by India's Ministry of Human Resource Development, controversy developed. Many opponents believed that sex education would corrupt youth and be anathema to traditional Indian values. Additionally, they believed it would lead to promiscuity and irresponsible behavior. Finally, they argued that sex education was a western construct that was being forced upon India. These arguments cause states like [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Goa]] to ban sex education programming.<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\"/>\n\nIn March 2007, the [[Maharashtra]] state government banned sex education in schools.<ref name=\"MHSexEdBan\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/maharashtra-resorts-to-another-ban/article1822059.ece|title=Maharashtra resorts to another ban|date=2 April 2007|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The ban came after the ruling and opposition [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] claimed that western countries had forced the Central government to implement the program.<ref name=\"MahaCorrupts\">{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/no-sex-education-please-it-corrupts-and-this-is-maharashtra/27130/0|title=No sex education please, it corrupts, and this is Maharashtra|date=31 March 2007|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> In April 2007 Basavaraj Horatti, the [[Karnataka]] Minister for Primary and Secondary Education, said that the program has been put on hold after complaints from teachers.

Anandhi, a scholar of gender issues, who wrote that sex-education was vital for combatting [[child sexual abuse]] and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]]. Later that year, Batra wrote a letter on behalf of the ''Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti'', which stated that teachers who followed the sex-education curriculum could be jailed for two years on the charge of \"outraging the modesty of a woman.\"<ref name=\"formerHRD\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-hrd-minister-feels-sex-education-corrupts-kids/article1-236673.aspx|title=Former HRD minister feels sex education corrupts kids|date=15 July 2007|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, [[Rajasthan]] Chief Minister [[Vasundhara Raje]] wrote a letter to [[Arjun Singh (politician, born 1930)|Arjun Singh]], the Union Minister of Human Resource Development. In the letter, she stated that children in Class IX and XI did not require sex education because they were in the early stages of puberty.

Rajendra Burma of [[All India Democratic Students' Organisation]] (AIDSO) claimed that it would cause innocent students to become too curious about sex.<ref name=\"Orissa-TOI\">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Orissa-govt-against-sex-education-in-schools/articleshow/2113029.cms|title=Orissa govt against sex education in schools|date=11 June 2007|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SexEd-TOI\">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Orissa-debates-sex-education-in-schools/articleshow/1976908.cms|title=Orissa debates sex education in schools|date=29 April 2007|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, a teachers' association protested the introduction of sex education in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. [[Om Prakash Sharma (Uttar Pradesh politician)|Om Prakash Sharma]], the chief of the association, said that it would result in embarrassing questions from students. He threatened to burn the books on a bonfire if they were not withdrawn.<ref name=\"UPTeacher\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/no-sex-education-say-uttar-pradesh-teachers/story-8zi1Ru3B23jyNRih00zQqN.html|title=No sex education, say Uttar Pradesh teachers|date=9 July 2007|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Ram Madhav]] of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) called sex education unfit for Indian society. He instead proposed that workshops be held for adults only to warn them against a promiscuous lifestyle. [[Prakash Javadekar]] of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) proposed that sex education should consist of abstinence-only education. Another BJP leader [[Murli Manohar Joshi]] stated that the course would disturb the mental development of children and claimed that multinational companies were behind this to boost the sales of condoms.<ref name=\"Trouble-BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6949714.stm|title=Sex education runs into trouble|date=22 August 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nOpponents of sex education for adolescents are swayed if sex education is deemed to be culturally sensitive and in line with Indian values. This can be achieved if the government and NGOs work in tandem to create curriculum that is acceptable to schools and the community. This trend may change as years progress because adolescents tend to have a more liberal view towards sex than adults.<ref name=\"Tripathi, Niharika 2013\" />\n\n=== Family planning for adults ===\n''See Also: [[Family planning in India|Family Planning in India]]''\n\nFamily planning in India has had a varied history. During [[The Emergency (India)|India's Emergency period]] in the 1970s, the government implemented a population-control policy which targeted lower-caste individuals.<ref name=\":0\">Connelly, Matthew. \"Population control in India: Prologue to the emergency period.\" ''Population and Development Review'' 32, no. 4 (2006): 629-667.</ref> Because the United States used food aid as leverage, India was incentivised to create a program that would influence lower-caste individuals to not have children. This program was eventually disbanded because of the lack of hygiene associated with the procedures and the nearly coercive techniques that were used (Connelly).<ref name=\":0\" /> (see [[Family planning in India]])\n\nIndia's family planning programmes are mainly run by the government in conjunction with NGOs. Because these programs are often quota-based, they take two forms: sterilisation programmes and contraceptive programmes (Gray et al.).<ref>Gray, Ronald H., Xianbin Li, Godfrey Kigozi, David Serwadda, Fred Nalugoda, Stephen Watya, Steven J. Reynolds, and Maria Wawer. \"The impact of male circumcision on HIV incidence and cost per infection prevented: a stochastic simulation model from Rakai, Uganda.\" ''Aids'' 21, no. 7 (2007): 845-850.</ref> Both use an incentive-based approach, where families are often given kitchen items or cash to undergo procedures (Bhatnagar et al.).<ref>Bhatnagar, R., K. Singh, T. Bir, U. Datta, S. Raj, and D. Nandan. \"An assessment of performance based incentive system for ASHA Sahyogini in Udaipur, Rajasthan.\" ''Indian journal of public health'' 53, no. 3 (2008): 166-170.</ref>\n\n==== Efficacy ====\nThe efficacy of India's family planning programs is dependent on the paradigm that is being used. Programs like Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) encourage women to register pregnancies and visit local health centres, and also encourage family planning through sterilisation. ASHA also  holds information meetings and raise awareness on such issues as women\u2019s health, disease, social determinants of health, nutrition and sanitation. Additionally, they serve as counsellors on adolescent and female sexual and reproductive health (Scott).<ref>Scott, K., & Shanker, S. (2010). Tying their hands? Institutional obstacles to the success of the ASHA community health worker programme in rural north India. ''AIDS Care'', ''22''(sup2), 1606-1612. doi:10.1080/09540121.2010.507751</ref> Past hospital care, ASHA also gives out free birth control pills and condoms which remove the stigma associated with couples buying contraceptives at drug stores (Scott).<ref>Scott, Kerry, and Shobhit Shanker. \"Tying their hands? Institutional obstacles to the success of the ASHA community health worker programme in rural north India.\" AIDS care 22, no. sup2 (2010): 1606-1612. Harvard</ref>\n\n==== Opposition ====\nFirst, the most significant criticisms of India's family planning program are those that advocate that it should be education-based rather than quota-based. They argue that India's program isn't sustainable because it does not stop women from marrying early or from spacing their pregnancies. Second, critics state that India's program does not consider the psyche of women who often undergo irreversible procedures like sterilisation because it doesn't provide the infrastructure for regular follow-ups. Finally, critics state that the programme is inherently gendered because most sterilisations are performed on women even though the procedure is less invasive for men (Vicziany).<ref>Vicziany, M.

The conclusion from this study was that mass media had been more effective at disseminating information about HIV/AIDS than the radio. However, this study also showed that mothers were not knowledgeable about Mother-to-Infant transmission because the information hadn't filtered down to them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally, a 2008 survey conducted among 11 and 12 class girls (aged 14 to 19; mean age was 16.38) in [[South Delhi]] found that 71% had no knowledge about the effects of [[genital herpes]]. 43% did not know the effects of [[syphilis]] and 28% did not know [[gonorrhoea]] was an STD. 46% thought the all STDs, except AIDS, could be cured. The major sources of information about STDs and safe sex among the girls were their friends (76%), media (72%), books and magazines (65%) or the internet (52%). 48% felt that they could not talk to their parents about sex.<ref name=\"McManus2008\">{{cite journal|date=2008|title=Study of knowledge, perception and attitude of adolescent girls towards STIs/HIV, safer sex and sex education: (A cross sectional survey of urban adolescent school girls in South Delhi, India)|journal=BMC Women's Health|volume=8|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1186/1472-6874-8-12|pmid=18647417|author1=Alexandra McManus|author2=Lipi Dhar|pmc=2490677}}</ref>\n\n==== Opposition ====\nOpposition to HIV/AIDS prevention education in India has been scarce because of the recognition of the importance of stopping this disease.

(Branwell used to be between Emily and Charlotte, but subsequently painted himself out.)]]\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb was born on 30 July 1818 to [[Maria Branwell]] and an Irish father, [[Patrick Bront\u00eb]].  The family was living on Market Street in the village of [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]] on the outskirts of [[Bradford]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Northern England]].  Emily's older siblings included, eldest to youngest, Maria, Elizabeth, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] and [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]], making Emily the Bront\u00ebs' fifth child.  In 1820, Emily's younger sister [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], the last Bront\u00eb child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to [[Haworth]], where Patrick was employed as [[perpetual curate]],<ref name=\"Fraser 16\" />  In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.<ref name=\"Fraser 16\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 16</ref>\n\nWhen Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821.<ref name=\"Fraser 28\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 28</ref> The younger children were to be cared for by [[Elizabeth Branwell]], their aunt and mother Maria's sister. \n\nEmily's three elder sisters, [[Maria Bront\u00eb|Maria]], Elizabeth, and Charlotte, were sent to the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School]] at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six, on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period.<ref name=\"Fraser 35\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 35</ref>  At school, however, the children suffered abuse and privations, and when a [[typhoid]] epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria, who may actually have had [[tuberculosis]], was sent home, where she died. Emily, Charlotte and Elizabeth were subsequently removed from the school in June 1825. Elizabeth died soon after their return home. \n\nThe four youngest Bront\u00eb children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest females in their immediate family.<ref name=\" Fraser 31\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 31</ref>\n\nCharlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.\n\nThe three remaining sisters and their brother [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]] were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt [[Elizabeth Branwell]]. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 20.</ref> Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''.<ref name=\"Fraser 44-45\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\n[[File:Gondal Poems.jpg|thumb|179 px|Emily's [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]] poems]]\n\nInspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift, <ref>Richard E.

With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and place-names, Emily and Anne's Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some \"diary papers,\" written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal.<ref>[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/diary_papers#diary \"Emily Bront\u00eb's Letters and Diary Papers\"], City University of New York</ref> The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander, a sort of British version of the \"noble savage\": romantic outlaws capable of more nobility, passion, and bravery than the denizens of \"civilization\".{{sfn|Austin|p=578}} Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Bront\u00eb's juvenilia, notably in Branwell's ''The Life of Alexander Percy'', which tells the story of an all-consuming, death-defying, and ultimately self-destructive love and is generally considered an inspiration for ''Wuthering Heights''.<ref name=\"Paddock p. 199\">Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 199.</ref>\n\nAt seventeen, Emily began to attend the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte was a teacher, but suffered from extreme [[homesickness]] and left after only a few months. Charlotte wrote later that \"Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it, she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring...

Unlike Charlotte, Emily was uncomfortable in Brussels, and refused to adopt Belgian fashions, saying \"I wish to be as God made me\", which rendered her  something of an outcast.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 21.</ref> Nine of Emily's French essays survive from this period. H\u00e9ger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emily's character, writing that:\n<blockquote><div>\nShe should have been a man \u2013 a great navigator. Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.<ref>[[Constantin H\u00e9ger]], 1842, referring to Emily Bront\u00eb, as quoted in ''The Oxford History of the Novel in English'' (2011), Volume 3, p. 208</ref>\n</div></blockquote>\nThe two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame H\u00e9ger proposed that they both stay another half-year, even, according to Charlotte, offering to dismiss the English master so that she could take his place.

[[Stevie Davies]] believes that there is what might be called Charlotte's smoke-screen and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point where she may even have doubted her sister's sanity.

The family was living on Market Street in the village of [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]] on the outskirts of [[Bradford]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Northern England]].  Emily's older siblings included, eldest to youngest, Maria, Elizabeth, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] and [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]], making Emily the Bront\u00ebs' fifth child.  In 1820, Emily's younger sister [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], the last Bront\u00eb child, was born.

Maria, who may actually have had [[tuberculosis]], was sent home, where she died. Emily, Charlotte and Elizabeth were subsequently removed from the school in June 1825. Elizabeth died soon after their return home. \n\nThe four youngest Bront\u00eb children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest females in their immediate family.<ref name=\" Fraser 31\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 31</ref>\n\nCharlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825.

Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life.

Their habitats consist of rocky outcroppings and gorges, with hard-packed soil and loose stones.\n\n== Behaviour ==\nUncommon, perenties generally avoid human contact and often retreat before they are seen. Being able diggers, they can excavate a burrow for shelter in only minutes. Their long claws enable them to easily climb trees. They often stand on their back legs and tails to gain a better view of the surrounding terrain. This behaviour, known as \"[[tripoding]]\", is quite common in monitor species. Perenties are fast sprinters, and can run using either all four legs or just their hind legs.\n\nTypical of most goannas, the perentie either freezes (lying flat on the ground, and remaining very still until the danger has passed) or runs if detected. If cornered, this powerful carnivore stands its ground and uses its arsenal of claws, teeth, and whip-like tail to defend itself. It can inflate its throat and hiss as a defensive or aggressive display, and can strike at opponents with its muscular tail. It may also lunge forward with an open mouth, either as a bluff or as an attack. The bite of a perentie can do much damage, not only from the teeth, but also because of the oral secretions.<!--only? caused by eating carrion-->.\n\n=== Feeding ===\n[[File:Perentie & Echidna.jpg|thumb|Mummified perentie that died trying to eat an echidna.]]\nPerenties are highly active carnivores that feed on mostly reptiles, small mammals, and less commonly birds such as [[diamond dove]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/scottnoidea/41885904531|title=Perentie and a diamond dove|last=Fisher|first=Scott|date=22 April 2018|website=Flickr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> They hunt live prey, but also scavenge carrion.

Although adults feed predominantly on vertebrate prey, young perenties eat mostly arthropods, especially grasshoppers.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9890041|title=The Activity Pattern, Temperature Regulation and Diet of Varanus-Giganteus on Barrow-Island, Western-Australia|first1=D.|last1=King|first2=B.|last2=Green|first3=H.|last3=Butler|date=March 15, 1989|journal=Wildlife Research|volume=16|issue=1|pages=41\u201347|via=www.publish.csiro.au|doi=10.1071/wr9890041}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPrey is typically swallowed whole, but if the food item is too large, pieces are ripped off to ease consumption.{{sfn|King|Green|1999|p=18}}\n\n=== Breeding ===\nThe perentie can lay its eggs in termite mounds or in the soil.{{sfn|King|Green|1999|p=33}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Perentie Lizard Perth Zoo SMC Spet 2005.jpg|A perentie in the [[Perth Zoo]], Western Australia\nImage:Perentie closeup.png|Closeup of a perentie in the wild\nImage:Perentie.jpg|In Australia's Red Centre\nImage:Perentie Lizard Pair.jpg |Pair of perenties in Perth Zoo\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{cite book | last=King| first= Dennis | last2= Green| first2= Brian| year= 1999 | title=Goannas: The Biology of Varanid Lizards | publisher= University of New South Wales Press | isbn=978-0-86840-456-1 |ref={{sfnRef|King|Green|1999}} }}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Cogger, H.

They formed the basis for a series of simpler boats which were widely built for export.\n\nAt the time of their introduction the Braves were the fastest naval vessels in the world.\n\n==Brave class==\nThe Brave class followed the {{sclass2-|Dark|fast patrol boat|4}} of convertible motor torpedo boats/gunboats. They were larger than the Dark class, and differed in being powered by gas turbine engines rather than the diesel engines of the Dark class. (Gas turbine propulsion had been tested in the {{sclass2-|Bold|fast patrol boat|4}} of two experimental fast patrol boats). Three [[Bristol Proteus]] engines propelled the Braves to a maximum of {{convert|52|kn|lk=in}}. Like the Dark class, the Braves had a [[mahogany]] skin over [[aluminium]] frame construction. They were built to be able to be used as either [[motor torpedo boat]]s or [[motor gun boat]]s. For the former role they had a [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm Bofors gun]], four {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]]es  and two [[depth charge]]s, in the latter two 40&nbsp;mm guns and two torpedoes. It was planned to arm the ships with a new {{convert|3.3|inch|mm|adj=on|0}} gun based on the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]] tank gun in a stabilised mounting, but this was abandoned.<ref name=\"conways47p539\">Gardiner and Chumbley 1995, p. 539.</ref><ref name=\"jfs60 p48-9\">Blackman 1960, pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F010729-0037, Marine aus Gro\u00dfbritannien in Oberwinter am Rhein.jpg|thumb|Visitors boarding HMS ''Brave Borderer'' at Oberwinter, Germany, 1961]]\nThe Royal Navy abandoned the idea of large scale coastal forces in 1957, so only two Braves were built for the Royal Navy. The two Braves, along with a single member of the Dark class, formed the Coastal Forces Trials and Special Service Squadron, based as Gosport. These were used to maintain proficiency in Coastal Forces operations, also being used as targets and for fishery protection.<ref name=\"conways47p539\"/><ref name=\"jfs62 p286\">Blackman 1962, p. 286.</ref> The two Braves were retired from use in 1970.<ref name=\"conways47p539\"/>\n\n==''Ferocity'' and derivatives==\nThe Braves were expensive boats, so as a private venture, [[Vosper & Company|Vospers]] produced a simpler derivative, ''Ferocity''. This was smaller than the Braves, with an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|90|ft|8|in|m}} and was powered by two Proteus engines instead of three, which were supplemented by two diesel engines for cruising. Construction was all wooden to minimise costs. Despite the reduced size and power, performance and armament were similar to the Braves. While ''Ferocity'' herself was not sold, it formed the basis for a number of boats for export.<ref name=\"jfs62 p286\"/><ref name=\"bmpt ferocity\">[http://www.bmpt.org.uk/other_boats_history/Ferocity/index.htm \"Ferocity\"].

They formed the basis for a series of simpler boats which were widely built for export.\n\nAt the time of their introduction the Braves were the fastest naval vessels in the world.\n\n==Brave class==\nThe Brave class followed the {{sclass2-|Dark|fast patrol boat|4}} of convertible motor torpedo boats/gunboats. They were larger than the Dark class, and differed in being powered by gas turbine engines rather than the diesel engines of the Dark class. (Gas turbine propulsion had been tested in the {{sclass2-|Bold|fast patrol boat|4}} of two experimental fast patrol boats). Three [[Bristol Proteus]] engines propelled the Braves to a maximum of {{convert|52|kn|lk=in}}. Like the Dark class, the Braves had a [[mahogany]] skin over [[aluminium]] frame construction. They were built to be able to be used as either [[motor torpedo boat]]s or [[motor gun boat]]s. For the former role they had a [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm Bofors gun]], four {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]]es  and two [[depth charge]]s, in the latter two 40&nbsp;mm guns and two torpedoes. It was planned to arm the ships with a new {{convert|3.3|inch|mm|adj=on|0}} gun based on the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder]] tank gun in a stabilised mounting, but this was abandoned.<ref name=\"conways47p539\">Gardiner and Chumbley 1995, p. 539.</ref><ref name=\"jfs60 p48-9\">Blackman 1960, pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F010729-0037, Marine aus Gro\u00dfbritannien in Oberwinter am Rhein.jpg|thumb|Visitors boarding HMS ''Brave Borderer'' at Oberwinter, Germany, 1961]]\nThe Royal Navy abandoned the idea of large scale coastal forces in 1957, so only two Braves were built for the Royal Navy. The two Braves, along with a single member of the Dark class, formed the Coastal Forces Trials and Special Service Squadron, based as Gosport. These were used to maintain proficiency in Coastal Forces operations, also being used as targets and for fishery protection.<ref name=\"conways47p539\"/><ref name=\"jfs62 p286\">Blackman 1962, p. 286.</ref> The two Braves were retired from use in 1970.<ref name=\"conways47p539\"/>\n\n==''Ferocity'' and derivatives==\nThe Braves were expensive boats, so as a private venture, [[Vosper & Company|Vospers]] produced a simpler derivative, ''Ferocity''. This was smaller than the Braves, with an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|90|ft|8|in|m}} and was powered by two Proteus engines instead of three, which were supplemented by two diesel engines for cruising. Construction was all wooden to minimise costs. Despite the reduced size and power, performance and armament were similar to the Braves.
