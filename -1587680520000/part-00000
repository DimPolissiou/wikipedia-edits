There have been some studies that test whether this association is due to the effects of variation in 5-HTTLPR on the reactivity of the human amygdala. In order to test this, researchers gathered a group of subjects and administered a harm avoidance (HA) subset of the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire as an initial mood and personality assessment.<ref name=\":1\" /> Subjects also had their DNA isolated and analyzed in order to be genotyped. Next, the amygdala was then engaged by having the subject match fearful facial expressions during an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] scan (by the 3-T GE Signa scanner).<ref name=\":1\" /> The results of the study showed that there was bilateral activity in the amygdala for every subject when processing the fearful images, as expected. However, the activity in the right amygdala was much higher for subjects with the s-allele, which shows that the 5-HTTLPR has an effect on amygdala activity. It is also important to note that there did not seem to be the same effect on the left amygdala.\n\n== Insomnia ==\nThere has been speculation that the 5-HTTLPR gene is associated with [[insomnia]] and sleep quality. Primary insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders and is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep, enough to cause distress in one's life. [[Serotonin]] (5-HT) has been associated with the regulation of sleep for a very long time now.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is the main regulator of serotonin and [[serotonergic]] energy and is therefore targeted by many [[antidepressant]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> There also have been several family and twin studies that suggest that insomnia is heavily genetically influenced. Many of these studies have found that there is a genetic and environment dual-factor that influences insomnia. It has been hypothesized that the short 5-HTTLPR genotype is related to poor sleep quality and, therefore, also primary insomnia. It is important to note that research studies have found that this variation does not cause insomnia, but rather may predispose an individual to experience worse quality of sleep when faced with a stressful life event.\n\n=== Brummett ===\n\nThe effect that the 5-HTTLPR gene had on sleep quality was tested by Brummett in a study conducted at Duke University Medical Center from 2001-2004. The sleep quality of 344 participants was measured using The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The study found that caregivers with the homozygous s-allele had poorer sleep quality, which shows that the stress of caregiving combined with the allele gave way to worse sleep quality. Although the study found that the 5-HTTLPR genotype did not directly affect sleep quality, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism's effect on sleep quality was magnified by one's environmental stress.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brummett|first=Beverly|title=Sleep Quality Varies as a Function of 5-HTTLPR Genotype and Stress|url=|journal=Psychosom Med|volume=69|issue=7|pages=621\u2013624|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e31814b8de6|pmid=17766685|pmc=2758820|year=2007}}</ref> It supports the notion that the 5-HTTLPR s-allele is what leads to hyperarousal when exposed to stress; hyperarousability is commonly associated with insomnia.\n\n=== Deuschle ===\n\nHowever, in a 2007 study conducted by a sleep laboratory in Germany, it was found that the 5-HTTLPR gene did have a strong association with both insomnia and depression both in participants with and without lifetime affective disorders. This study included 157 insomnia patients and a control group of 836 individuals that had no psychiatric disorders. The subjects were then genotyped through [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) techniques.<ref name=\":0\" /> The researchers found that the s-allele was greater represented in the vast majority of patients with insomnia compared to those who had no disorder.<ref name=\":0\" /> This shows that there is an association between the 5-HTTPLR genotype and primary insomnia. However, it is important to consider the fact that there was a very limited number of subjects with insomnia tested in this study.\n\n== Personality traits ==\n[[File:K.P.

There have been some studies that test whether this association is due to the effects of variation in 5-HTTLPR on the reactivity of the human amygdala. In order to test this, researchers gathered a group of subjects and administered a harm avoidance (HA) subset of the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire as an initial mood and personality assessment.<ref name=\":1\" /> Subjects also had their DNA isolated and analyzed in order to be genotyped. Next, the amygdala was then engaged by having the subject match fearful facial expressions during an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] scan (by the 3-T GE Signa scanner).<ref name=\":1\" /> The results of the study showed that there was bilateral activity in the amygdala for every subject when processing the fearful images, as expected. However, the activity in the right amygdala was much higher for subjects with the s-allele, which shows that the 5-HTTLPR has an effect on amygdala activity. It is also important to note that there did not seem to be the same effect on the left amygdala.\n\n== Insomnia ==\nThere has been speculation that the 5-HTTLPR gene is associated with [[insomnia]] and sleep quality. Primary insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders and is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep, enough to cause distress in one's life. [[Serotonin]] (5-HT) has been associated with the regulation of sleep for a very long time now.<ref name=\":0\" /> The 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is the main regulator of serotonin and [[serotonergic]] energy and is therefore targeted by many [[antidepressant]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> There also have been several family and twin studies that suggest that insomnia is heavily genetically influenced. Many of these studies have found that there is a genetic and environment dual-factor that influences insomnia. It has been hypothesized that the short 5-HTTLPR genotype is related to poor sleep quality and, therefore, also primary insomnia. It is important to note that research studies have found that this variation does not cause insomnia, but rather may predispose an individual to experience worse quality of sleep when faced with a stressful life event.\n\n=== Brummett ===\n\nThe effect that the 5-HTTLPR gene had on sleep quality was tested by Brummett in a study conducted at Duke University Medical Center from 2001-2004. The sleep quality of 344 participants was measured using The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The study found that caregivers with the homozygous s-allele had poorer sleep quality, which shows that the stress of caregiving combined with the allele gave way to worse sleep quality. Although the study found that the 5-HTTLPR genotype did not directly affect sleep quality, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism's effect on sleep quality was magnified by one's environmental stress.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brummett|first=Beverly|title=Sleep Quality Varies as a Function of 5-HTTLPR Genotype and Stress|url=|journal=Psychosom Med|volume=69|issue=7|pages=621\u2013624|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e31814b8de6|pmid=17766685|pmc=2758820|year=2007}}</ref> It supports the notion that the 5-HTTLPR s-allele is what leads to hyperarousal when exposed to stress; hyperarousability is commonly associated with insomnia.\n\n=== Deuschle ===\n\nHowever, in a 2007 study conducted by a sleep laboratory in Germany, it was found that the 5-HTTLPR gene did have a strong association with both insomnia and depression both in participants with and without lifetime affective disorders. This study included 157 insomnia patients and a control group of 836 individuals that had no psychiatric disorders. The subjects were then genotyped through [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) techniques.<ref name=\":0\" /> The researchers found that the s-allele was greater represented in the vast majority of patients with insomnia compared to those who had no disorder.<ref name=\":0\" /> This shows that there is an association between the 5-HTTPLR genotype and primary insomnia. However, it is important to consider the fact that there was a very limited number of subjects with insomnia tested in this study.\n\n== Personality traits ==\n[[File:K.P.

Clara suffered poor health throughout most of her childhood.\n\n==Education==\nHer musical education began when she entered school. She received musical training from the Grand Ducal conservatory in Karlsruhe until 1894. At age 7, she was the youngest student ever taught by concertmaster Carl Will. She continued her studies at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin until 1896. At the academy, she had many prestigious teachers. Clara Schumann\u2019s student [[Ernst Rudorff]] taught her piano. [[Woldemar Bargiel]] (Schumann\u2019s stepbrother) also taught her the theory of counterpoint and composition. Berlin composer [[Robert Kahn]] taught her piano and music theory. Her most well-known teacher was [[Max Bruch]] (1838 \u2013 1920) who taught composition. She remained in correspondence with Bruch for most of his life. She composed the score for \u201cFive Songs for a Voice with Pianoforte\u201d, for which Max Bruch wrote lyrics and direction.

Her compositions are described as having very expressive melodies, and rich harmony reminiscent of late romanticism. She mostly self-published her work.
