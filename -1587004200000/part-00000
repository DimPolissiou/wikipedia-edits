Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

It is the sequel to ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', and it was released worldwide on June 28, 2019. The gameplay is largely retained from that of its predecessor, in which players create their own custom courses using assets from various games across the ''[[Super Mario]]'' franchise and share them online. ''Super Mario Maker 2'' introduces new features and course assets, including a new course style and assets based on ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Super Mario#Common elements|Super Mario Maker#Gameplay|label 1=Common elements of the Super Mario series|label 2=Gameplay of Super Mario Maker}}\nLike its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which players create their own courses using assets from across the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series and publish them onto the internet for others to play. Players can choose from a selection of prior ''Super Mario'' games to base their course's visual style and gameplay on, including ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', and a newly introduced ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' theme. Gameplay mechanics and enemy behaviors can vary between the styles, with some elements being limited to specific styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/02/13/super-mario-maker-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch|title=Super Mario Maker 2 Announced for Nintendo Switch|last=Marks|first=Tom|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214180013/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/13/super-mario-maker-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch|archive-date=February 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nlife\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/super_mario_maker_2_confirmed_for_switch_launches_this_june|title=Super Mario Maker 2 Confirmed For Switch, Launches This June|last=Craddock|first=Ryan|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224105057/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/super_mario_maker_2_confirmed_for_switch_launches_this_june|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2019/02/13/mario-maker-2-is-heading-to-switch|title=Mario Maker 2 Is Heading To Switch|last=Hilliard|first=Kyle|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224105057/https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2019/02/13/mario-maker-2-is-heading-to-switch|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe sequel adds various assets and tools, including assets and a course theme based on ''Super Mario 3D World''.

Nintendo veteran Takashi Tezuka states that the theme for the sequel was to expand on what could be done compared to its predecessor and try new things, which took the form of new course elements and new side content in the form of a full-fledged single player campaign. Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.
