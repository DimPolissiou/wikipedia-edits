It services [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Latvia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]], Stena Line is a major unit of Stena AB, itself a part of the [[Stena Sphere]]. Stena Line also owns the Swedish vessels{{specify}} of the otherwise German- and Danish-owned [[Scandlines]].\n\n== History ==\nStena Line was founded in 1962 by [[Sten Allan Olsson|Sten A. Olsson]] in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], which still serves as the company's headquarters, when he acquired Skagenlinjen between Gothenburg and [[Fredrikshavn]], [[Denmark]].\n\nIn 1972, Stena Line was one of the first ferry operators in Europe to introduce a computer-based reservation system for the travel business area. In 1978, the freight business area also started operating a computer-based reservation system.\n\nThe first freight-focused route<ref>Chiefly a freight route. However passengers and cars are transported</ref> started between Gothenburg, Sweden, and [[Kiel]], [[Germany]]. The ship was the MS ''Stena Transporter''.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Stena acquired three other ferry companies. In 1981, Sessan Line, Stena's biggest competitor on Sweden\u2013Denmark routes, was acquired and incorporated into Stena Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/sessanlinjen.htm |publisher=Fakta om Fartyg |title=Sessan Linjen |language=Swedish |access-date=21 September 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801081056/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faktaomfartyg.nu%2Fsessanlinjen.htm |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> This included Sessan's two large newbuilds, ''Kronprinsessan Victoria'' and {{MS|Prinsessan Birgitta||2}}, which became the largest ships operated by Stena by that date. In 1983, Stena acquired Varberg-Gren\u00e5 Linjen, and two years later also the right to that company's former name, [[Lion Ferry]]. Lion Ferry continued as a separate marketing company until 1997, when it was incorporated into Stena Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/lion_ferry.htm |publisher=Fakta om Fartyg |title=Lion Ferry |language=Swedish |access-date=21 September 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729150759/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faktaomfartyg.nu%2Flion_ferry.htm |archive-date=29 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> In 1989, Stena acquired yet another ferry company, [[Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland|Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ)]] (which at the time traded under the name Crown Line). SMZ's [[Hoek van Holland]]\u2013[[Harwich International Port|Harwich]] route then became a part of Stena Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/stoomvaart_maatschappij_zeeland.htm |publisher=Fakta om Fartyg |title=Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland |language=Swedish |access-date=21 September 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731163420/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faktaomfartyg.nu%2Fstoomvaart_maatschappij_zeeland.htm |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nStena Line doubled in size in 1990 with the acquisition of [[Sealink|Sealink British Ferries]] from [[Sea Containers]]. This first became Sealink Stena Line, then Stena Sealink Line and finally Stena Line (UK), which now operates all of Stena's ferry services between [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].\n[[File:Stena Jutlandica in Gothenburg.jpg|thumb|left|''Stena Jutlandica'' in [[Gothenburg]]]]\nIn 1996, Stena Line introduced its 20,000 tonne HSS ([[High-speed Sea Service]]) vessels, which operated from [[Belfast]] to [[Stranraer]], [[Holyhead]] to [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] and [[Hoek van Holland]] to [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]. In addition to the three 1,500-passenger HSS vessels, Stena Line ordered two smaller 900-passenger HSS vessels to operate on the [[Gothenburg]]\u2013[[Frederikshavn]] route. Due to the bankruptcy of the shipyard, only the first of these vessels was ever completed.\n\nIn 1998, Stena's operations from [[Dover]] and [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] were merged with [[P&O Ferries|P&O European Ferries]] to form [[P&O Stena Line]], 40% of which was owned by Stena and 60% by P&O. In 2002, P&O acquired all of Stena's shares in the company, thus becoming the sole owner of P&O Stena Line, which soon changed its name to P&O Ferries.\n\nIn 2000, Stena Line purchased yet another Scandinavian ferry operator: [[Scandlines]] AB.\n\nIn November 2006, Stena ordered a pair of \"super ferries\" with a [[gross tonnage]] of 62,000 from [[Aker Yards]], [[Germany]] for delivery in 2010, with an option for two more ships of the same design.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.akeryards.com/?page=316&xml=A/134984/PR/200611/1087399| publisher=Aker Yards| title=Press release 9. 11. 2006| accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref> The new ferries will be amongst the largest in the world,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stenaline.com/stena_line/stena_line_koncernen/media/en_gb/pressreleaser_18083.html| publisher=Stena Line press release| title=Stena Line announces major investment in innovative ferries| accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref> to be operated on Stena's [[North Sea]] route from [[Hoek van Holland]] to [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]. The existing ships from the [[North Sea]] were to be moved to the Kiel\u2013Gothenborg route, whereas the ships from Kiel would transfer to the [[Gdynia]] to [[Karlskrona]] route. The new ferries were launched in 2010, with ''Stena Hollandica'' entering service on 16 May 2010, and ''Stena Britannica'' planned to enter service in the autumn of 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.Greek.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/essex/8685207.stm |title='Superferry' in maiden Harwich crossing |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe company also moved its [[Belfast]] Terminal from Albert Quay to the new VT4 during May 2008. This has reduced the length of the crossing to [[Stranraer]] by ten minutes.\n\nIn July 2009, Stena Line announced that it had repurchased its former ship, ''[[Stena Parisien]]'', from SeaFrance. The ship is now known as ''Stena Navigator''. She had  a  comprehensive refit. Following on from this, the ship was introduced on the [[Stranraer]] to Belfast route, alongside HSS ''Stena Voyager'' and ''Stena Caledonia''.\n\nA joint venture with [[Hyundai Glovis]] has been announced and approved by the [[European Commission]] in February 2019, for the implementation of a new cooperative short sea intra-European waters service in between the two carriers, for the sea transport of transhipment cargo originating from [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite news|title= EU gives green light to Stena Hyundai Glovis joint-venture |url= https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/270736/eu-gives-green-light-to-stena-hyundai-glovis-joint-venture/|accessdate=12 August 2019|newspaper=World maritime News |date=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 March 2020, due to the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Coronavirus outbreak]], the company suspended operations between [[Oslo]] and [[Frederikshavn]] temporarily until further notice due to travel restrictions in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the routes sole ship the ''[[MS Stena Saga]]'' was sent to [[Gothenburg]] where she arrived on 16 March 2020 where the company later confirmed it would be making 950 redundancies in Sweden as a result of Coronavirus. The company then later announced on 19 March 2020 that it was going to permanently suspend and close operations on the Oslo-Frederikshavn service due to the lack of profitability, where Stena announced that due to Coronavirus it was unlikely able to see it turn a profit during the whole year when the service is totally dependent on the summer season. The future of ''Stena Saga'' remains uncertain and remained laid up in Gothenburg.\n\n=== Irish Sea expansion ===\nIn December 2010, Stena Line announced it had acquired the Northern Irish operations of [[DFDS Seaways]]. The sale includes the Belfast to [[Heysham]] & [[Twelve Quays|Birkenhead]] routes, two vessels from the Heysham route (Scotia Seaways & Hibernia Seaways) and two chartered vessels from the Birkenhead route ({{MS|Mersey Seaways||2}} & {{MS|Lagan Seaways||2}}).<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=DFDS A/S|year=|accessdate=3 December 2010|title=DFDS sells Irish Sea ferry routes|url=http://www.dfds.com/news/latest/20101202-1/}}</ref> The [[Fleetwood]] to [[Larne]] route ended on 24 December 2010.\n\nOn 26 February 2014 it was announced that Stena Line would acquire the Celtic Link ferry service from [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]] to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], France.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stena Line buys Celtic Link ferry service|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2014/0226/506799-ferry-deal/|accessdate=27 February 2014|newspaper=RT\u00c9 News|date=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Change on the Irish Sea==\nOn 21 November 2011, Stena Line introduced the Stena Superfast VII and Stena Superfast VIII to replace the Stena Navigator and Stena Caledonia. It was announced that the Stena Voyager would be removed from service on 20 November 2011. It was later sold to Stena Recycling and sent for scrapping in May 2013.\n\n== Routes ==\n[[File:Stena line route map.svg|thumb|500px|Stena Line route map (D\u00fan Laoghaire \u2013 Holyhead route has been discontinued)]]\n\n===Irish Sea===\n* [[Fishguard]] \u2013 [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]]: {{MS|Stena Europe||2}}\n* [[Holyhead]] \u2013 [[Dublin Port]]: [[MS Stena Adventurer (2003)|''Stena Adventurer'']], [[MS Stena Estrid (2020)|''Stena Estrid'']]\n* [[Belfast]] \u2013 [[Cairnryan]]: [[MS Superfast VII|''Stena Superfast VII'']], [[MS Superfast VIII|''Stena Superfast VIII'']]\n* [[Belfast]] \u2013 [[Heysham]]: ''Stena Hibernia'', ''Stena Precision''\n* [[Belfast]] \u2013 [[Twelve Quays|Birkenhead]]: [[E-Flexer-class ferry|''Stena Edda'']], [[MS Mersey Seaways|''Stena Mersey'']], [[MS Stena Forerunner|''Stena Forerunner'']]\n* [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] \u2013 [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]]: [[MS Stena Horizon|''Stena Horizon'']]\n\n=== North Sea ===\n* [[Hook of Holland]] \u2013 [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]: ''Stena Britannica'', ''Stena Hollandica''\n* [[Hook of Holland]] \u2013 [[North Killingholme Haven]]: ''Stena Transit'', ''Stena Transporter''\n* [[Rotterdam]] \u2013 [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]: ''mv.

It services [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Latvia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]], Stena Line is a major unit of Stena AB, itself a part of the [[Stena Sphere]]. Stena Line also owns the Swedish vessels{{specify}} of the otherwise German- and Danish-owned [[Scandlines]].\n\n== History ==\nStena Line was founded in 1962 by [[Sten Allan Olsson|Sten A. Olsson]] in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], which still serves as the company's headquarters, when he acquired Skagenlinjen between Gothenburg and [[Fredrikshavn]], [[Denmark]].\n\nIn 1972, Stena Line was one of the first ferry operators in Europe to introduce a computer-based reservation system for the travel business area. In 1978, the freight business area also started operating a computer-based reservation system.\n\nThe first freight-focused route<ref>Chiefly a freight route. However passengers and cars are transported</ref> started between Gothenburg, Sweden, and [[Kiel]], [[Germany]]. The ship was the MS ''Stena Transporter''.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Stena acquired three other ferry companies. In 1981, Sessan Line, Stena's biggest competitor on Sweden\u2013Denmark routes, was acquired and incorporated into Stena Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/sessanlinjen.htm |publisher=Fakta om Fartyg |title=Sessan Linjen |language=Swedish |access-date=21 September 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801081056/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faktaomfartyg.nu%2Fsessanlinjen.htm |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> This included Sessan's two large newbuilds, ''Kronprinsessan Victoria'' and {{MS|Prinsessan Birgitta||2}}, which became the largest ships operated by Stena by that date. In 1983, Stena acquired Varberg-Gren\u00e5 Linjen, and two years later also the right to that company's former name, [[Lion Ferry]]. Lion Ferry continued as a separate marketing company until 1997, when it was incorporated into Stena Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/lion_ferry.htm |publisher=Fakta om Fartyg |title=Lion Ferry |language=Swedish |access-date=21 September 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729150759/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faktaomfartyg.nu%2Flion_ferry.htm |archive-date=29 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> In 1989, Stena acquired yet another ferry company, [[Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland|Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ)]] (which at the time traded under the name Crown Line). SMZ's [[Hoek van Holland]]\u2013[[Harwich International Port|Harwich]] route then became a part of Stena Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/stoomvaart_maatschappij_zeeland.htm |publisher=Fakta om Fartyg |title=Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland |language=Swedish |access-date=21 September 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731163420/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faktaomfartyg.nu%2Fstoomvaart_maatschappij_zeeland.htm |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nStena Line doubled in size in 1990 with the acquisition of [[Sealink|Sealink British Ferries]] from [[Sea Containers]]. This first became Sealink Stena Line, then Stena Sealink Line and finally Stena Line (UK), which now operates all of Stena's ferry services between [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].\n[[File:Stena Jutlandica in Gothenburg.jpg|thumb|left|''Stena Jutlandica'' in [[Gothenburg]]]]\nIn 1996, Stena Line introduced its 20,000 tonne HSS ([[High-speed Sea Service]]) vessels, which operated from [[Belfast]] to [[Stranraer]], [[Holyhead]] to [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] and [[Hoek van Holland]] to [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]. In addition to the three 1,500-passenger HSS vessels, Stena Line ordered two smaller 900-passenger HSS vessels to operate on the [[Gothenburg]]\u2013[[Frederikshavn]] route. Due to the bankruptcy of the shipyard, only the first of these vessels was ever completed.\n\nIn 1998, Stena's operations from [[Dover]] and [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] were merged with [[P&O Ferries|P&O European Ferries]] to form [[P&O Stena Line]], 40% of which was owned by Stena and 60% by P&O. In 2002, P&O acquired all of Stena's shares in the company, thus becoming the sole owner of P&O Stena Line, which soon changed its name to P&O Ferries.\n\nIn 2000, Stena Line purchased yet another Scandinavian ferry operator: [[Scandlines]] AB.\n\nIn November 2006, Stena ordered a pair of \"super ferries\" with a [[gross tonnage]] of 62,000 from [[Aker Yards]], [[Germany]] for delivery in 2010, with an option for two more ships of the same design.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.akeryards.com/?page=316&xml=A/134984/PR/200611/1087399| publisher=Aker Yards| title=Press release 9. 11. 2006| accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref> The new ferries will be amongst the largest in the world,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.stenaline.com/stena_line/stena_line_koncernen/media/en_gb/pressreleaser_18083.html| publisher=Stena Line press release| title=Stena Line announces major investment in innovative ferries| accessdate=21 September 2007}}</ref> to be operated on Stena's [[North Sea]] route from [[Hoek van Holland]] to [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]. The existing ships from the [[North Sea]] were to be moved to the Kiel\u2013Gothenborg route, whereas the ships from Kiel would transfer to the [[Gdynia]] to [[Karlskrona]] route. The new ferries were launched in 2010, with ''Stena Hollandica'' entering service on 16 May 2010, and ''Stena Britannica'' planned to enter service in the autumn of 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.Greek.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/essex/8685207.stm |title='Superferry' in maiden Harwich crossing |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe company also moved its [[Belfast]] Terminal from Albert Quay to the new VT4 during May 2008. This has reduced the length of the crossing to [[Stranraer]] by ten minutes.\n\nIn July 2009, Stena Line announced that it had repurchased its former ship, ''[[Stena Parisien]]'', from SeaFrance. The ship is now known as ''Stena Navigator''. She had  a  comprehensive refit. Following on from this, the ship was introduced on the [[Stranraer]] to Belfast route, alongside HSS ''Stena Voyager'' and ''Stena Caledonia''.\n\nA joint venture with [[Hyundai Glovis]] has been announced and approved by the [[European Commission]] in February 2019, for the implementation of a new cooperative short sea intra-European waters service in between the two carriers, for the sea transport of transhipment cargo originating from [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite news|title= EU gives green light to Stena Hyundai Glovis joint-venture |url= https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/270736/eu-gives-green-light-to-stena-hyundai-glovis-joint-venture/|accessdate=12 August 2019|newspaper=World maritime News |date=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 March 2020, due to the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Coronavirus outbreak]], the company suspended operations between [[Oslo]] and [[Frederikshavn]] temporarily until further notice due to travel restrictions in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the routes sole ship the ''[[MS Stena Saga]]'' was sent to [[Gothenburg]] where she arrived on 16 March 2020 where the company later confirmed it would be making 950 redundancies in Sweden as a result of Coronavirus. The company then later announced on 19 March 2020 that it was going to permanently suspend and close operations on the Oslo-Frederikshavn service due to the lack of profitability, where Stena announced that due to Coronavirus it was unlikely able to see it turn a profit during the whole year when the service is totally dependent on the summer season. The future of ''Stena Saga'' remains uncertain and remained laid up in Gothenburg.\n\n\n=== Irish Sea expansion ===\nIn December 2010, Stena Line announced it had acquired the Northern Irish operations of [[DFDS Seaways]]. The sale includes the Belfast to [[Heysham]] & [[Twelve Quays|Birkenhead]] routes, two vessels from the Heysham route (Scotia Seaways & Hibernia Seaways) and two chartered vessels from the Birkenhead route ({{MS|Mersey Seaways||2}} & {{MS|Lagan Seaways||2}}).<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=DFDS A/S|year=|accessdate=3 December 2010|title=DFDS sells Irish Sea ferry routes|url=http://www.dfds.com/news/latest/20101202-1/}}</ref> The [[Fleetwood]] to [[Larne]] route ended on 24 December 2010.\n\nOn 26 February 2014 it was announced that Stena Line would acquire the Celtic Link ferry service from [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]] to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], France.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stena Line buys Celtic Link ferry service|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2014/0226/506799-ferry-deal/|accessdate=27 February 2014|newspaper=RT\u00c9 News|date=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n\n==Change on the Irish Sea==\nOn 21 November 2011, Stena Line introduced the Stena Superfast VII and Stena Superfast VIII to replace the Stena Navigator and Stena Caledonia. It was announced that the Stena Voyager would be removed from service on 20 November 2011. It was later sold to Stena Recycling and sent for scrapping in May 2013.\n\n== Routes ==\n[[File:Stena line route map.svg|thumb|500px|Stena Line route map (D\u00fan Laoghaire \u2013 Holyhead route has been discontinued)]]\n\n===Irish Sea===\n* [[Fishguard]] \u2013 [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]]: {{MS|Stena Europe||2}}\n* [[Holyhead]] \u2013 [[Dublin Port]]: [[MS Stena Adventurer (2003)|''Stena Adventurer'']], [[MS Stena Estrid (2020)|''Stena Estrid'']]\n* [[Belfast]] \u2013 [[Cairnryan]]: [[MS Superfast VII|''Stena Superfast VII'']], [[MS Superfast VIII|''Stena Superfast VIII'']]\n* [[Belfast]] \u2013 [[Heysham]]: ''Stena Hibernia'', ''Stena Precision''\n* [[Belfast]] \u2013 [[Twelve Quays|Birkenhead]]: [[E-Flexer-class ferry|''Stena Edda'']], [[MS Mersey Seaways|''Stena Mersey'']], [[MS Stena Forerunner|''Stena Forerunner'']]\n* [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] \u2013 [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]]: [[MS Stena Horizon|''Stena Horizon'']]\n\n=== North Sea ===\n* [[Hook of Holland]] \u2013 [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]: ''Stena Britannica'', ''Stena Hollandica''\n* [[Hook of Holland]] \u2013 [[North Killingholme Haven]]: ''Stena Transit'', ''Stena Transporter''\n* [[Rotterdam]] \u2013 [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]]: ''mv.

In ''Polonosuchus'', the rostromedial foramen is on the medial surface of the [[maxilla]], and the foramina for replacement [[Tooth|teeth]] are not connected by a dental groove but are set together in a straight line, unlike in ''Teratosaurus.'' It also had a larger first [[dental alveolus]] than ''Teratosaurus'', no different in size from alveoli 2-4, shorter overall maxillae (165&nbsp;mm as opposed to 245&nbsp;mm), and a large ridge between the palatal process and the dental alveoli which is not present in ''Teratosaurus'' at all.<ref name=\"Brusatte\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Polonosuchus silesiacus (2).jpg|thumb|Restoration]] \nThe [[holotype]], and only known specimen, is fragmentary. From the skull are preserved both maxillae, [[premaxilla]]e, [[Nasal bone|nasals]], [[Prefrontal bone|prefrontals]], [[Palatine bone|palatines]] and [[Quadrate bone|quadrates]], the left [[Jugal bone|jugal]], the right [[Pterygoid bone|pterygoid]], [[Quadratojugal bone|quadratojugal]], [[surangular]], [[Articular bone|articular]], [[Squamosal bone|squamosal]] and [[Lacrimal bone|lacrimal]], and fragments of the [[Mandible|dentary]]. There are also the first three [[cervical vertebrae]], nine [[caudal vertebrae]], some [[Osteoderm|caudal scutes]] and fragments of [[cervical rib]]s.<ref name=\"Sulej\" />\n\n=== Skull ===\nThe maxillae are tall and laterally compressed, forming most of the borders of the [[antorbital fenestra]] (visible on the photo above). The [[Palatine process of maxilla|palatal process]] extends anteroventrally and is very short. A ridge extending to form a suture with the palatine is present above the sixth, seventh and eighth dental alveoli. Small [[Infraorbital foramen|infraorbital foramina]] are located around the edge of the antorbital fenestra, near the teeth. At least eleven dental alveoli were present, although the total is not certain as both maxillae are broken off at the posterior ends. Small replacement teeth are visible above some of the alveoli, indicating it was probably a [[polyphyodont]].\n\nThe premaxillae are very similar to those of ''Postosuchus'', but slightly smaller; the posterodorsal process is broken off, but sutures present on the nasal bones show it would have extended all the way up to the anterior border of the [[naris]]. The palatal processes of the premaxillae are incompletely preserved, but would almost certainly have articulated with those of the maxillae. There are certainly four alveoli present, with a small cavity which may be a fifth.\n\nThe nasals have a long dorsoventrally compressed process which would have extended down between the maxilla and premaxilla. They also have a long anterior process with a triangular cross-section. The surface for articulation with the lacrimal is clearly visible on the right nasal.\n\n[[File:Reconstruction of Polonosuchus by Szymon G\u00f3rnicki.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of Polonosuchus by Szymon G\u00f3rnicki]]\nThe lacrimal has a thick [[Rugae|rugose]] ridge extending back from that on the nasal. Its lamellar part forms the posterodorsal border of the antorbital fenestra, and is articulated with the maxillae which form much of the rest of the borders. There is also a descending process of the lacrimal which forms most of the posterior border of the antorbital fenestra, with a noticeably [[wikt:striation|striated]] ridge. This descending process would probably have contacted the jugal at its ventral end.\n\nThe prefrontals are large triangular plates which overhang the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]], with rugose lateral surfaces. All the surfaces which articulate with the other bones of the skull roof are narrow and oblique.\n\nThe squamosal has five projections. Two of these bordered the superior temporal fenestra and met with the parietal and postorbital, which are not known. A hook-like ventral projection would have met the quadrate head, and a lateral projection would have overhung the quadratojugal. The fifth projection is broken off and missing.\n\nMuch of the jugal is preserved, although not the anterior or ascending processes. The posterior process has straight margins. The ascending process had a triangular cross-section at the base, where it articulates with the pterygoid. The quadratojugal is only partial, with a broken dorsal edge. Its process for articulating with the quadrate is clearly visible, and that for the jugal is long and indented.\n\n[[File:Polonosuchus size.png|thumb|left|Size of ''Polonosuchus'' compared to a human]]\nThe palatines have a robust anterior and fragile posterior. Relative to their overall length, the region between the [[Posterior nasal apertures|choanae]] and the suborbital fossae is very long. An oblique vertical wall rises from the dorsal surface, separating part of the nasal fossa. There are two ridges which cross on the ventral surface.\n\nThe pterygoid has a missing anterior ramus. Its posteroventral ramus has missing parts, but the centre is preserved and exhibits a cleft for the [[ectopterygoid]]. The quadrate ramus extends back with a narrow shelf on the ventral side. A small facet at its base forms part of the articulation with the [[Sphenoid bone|basisphenoid]], which is common for Triassic [[archosaur]]s.\n\nThe quadrate has a rounded dorsal head which contacts the squamosal, and a high and narrow pterygoid ramus. There is a strong posterior ridge along the quadrate's main axis. Above the two parts of the [[Condyloid process|mandibular condyle]], there is a well-defined facet for articulation with the quadratojugal.\n\nThe anterior parts of the dentary are preserved, up to the first eight teeth. The lateral faces bear a series of [[Haversian canal|vascular foramina]].\n\nThe articular and surangular are fragmentary, and one of the few features preserved is a foramen for a branch of the [[facial nerve]].<ref name=\"Sulej\" />\n\n=== Vertebrae ===\n[[File:MEPAN silezaur rauizuch.jpg|thumb|''[[Silesaurus opolensis]]'' and ''Polonosuchus silesiacus'' models in Poland]]\nThe [[Vertebral centrum|centrum]] of the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas vertebra]] is the only part preserved, and has a crescent shape and rounded anterior surface. The other two vertebrae have centra longer than they are tall. The [[Axis (anatomy)|axis]] has a triangular [[neural spine]] and relatively small [[Articular processes|prezygapophyses]], at least compared to the stout [[Articular processes|postzygapophyses]]. The third cervical vertebra has an incomplete neural spine and equally sized post- and prezygapophyses. The caudal vertebrae have pronounced facets for the [[haemal arch]]es, and tall plate-like neural spines. The centra have smooth convex ventral surfaces, and as the vertebrae are fairly large, they probably come from the anterior part of the tail.<ref name=\"Sulej\" />\n\n=== Dermal armour ===\nFive dermal scutes were found in close proximity to the caudal vertebrae, indicating that they are probably from the tail.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nKilsob is bounded on the north by [[Erraran]] and [[Bawnboy]] townlands, on the west by [[Newtown, Templeport|Newtown]], [[Lakefield, Templeport|Lakefield]] and [[Mullaghmore, Templeport]] townlands, on the south by [[Kildoagh]] townland and on the east by [[Muinaghan]] and [[Corrasmongan]] townlands. The town of Bawnboy is partly situate in the north part of the townland and was sometimes referred to as Kilsob, rather than Bawnboy, in the past. Its chief geographical features are Bellaboy Lough (Irish = Loch B\u00e9al \u00c1tha Bu\u00ed = The Lake of the Entrance to the Yellow Ford), the Bawnboy River, a stone quarry and dug wells. Kilsob is traversed by the national secondary [[N87 road (Ireland)]], the L1037 road, minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 348 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nA subdivision of the townland is named Rossilk or Ruserk.\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilsobb''.<ref>National Archives Dublin [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 26 June 1615, King [[James VI and I]] granted, inter alia, ''four polls in Killsobb to Sir George Graeme and Sir Richard Graeme to form part of the Manor of Greame''. An Inquisition held at Cavan Town on 31 October 1627 found that ''Sir Richard Greames of Corrasmongan died on 7 November 1625 seized of, inter alia, four polls in Kilsob. His son and heir Thomas Greames was aged 40 (born 1585) and married.'' After the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] the Graham family were still in possession of Kilsob.\n\nIn the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663<ref>''The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan'', edited by Rev. Francis J. McKiernan, in Breifne Journal. Vol. I, No. 3 (1960), pp. 247-263</ref> there was one person paying the Hearth Tax in- ''Kilsobb- Mr. John Brench.''\n\nBy a deed dated 7 January 1746 between- ''Veaitch Betty of '''Kilsob''' in the County of Cavan, Gentleman of the one part and Bryan Reilly & Patrick McKiernan of Middle '''Kilsob''' of the other part, the said Veaitch Betty leased land for 21 years to said Bryan Reilly & Patrick McKiernan in Middle '''Killsob'''. Witnesses: Terence Kiernan of the City of Dublin & John Beatty of Swadlingbar & George Booth near Drumersnaw, Co.

Probate granted July 1796) stated-  ''To be buried in the vault I made at Temple Piert. To my dear wife Mary Betty the houses and demesne of Lakefield with the mill race and ten acres whereon the mill is built provided she keeps unmarried, and after her demise to my eldest son Rowland Betty. To my daughters, Susanna Betty and Ann Betty, \u00a3300 each to be paid out of the lands of '''Kilsob'''. To my second son William Betty the farm of land known as Middle '''Kilsob''' or Gortenane, and his heirs. To my eldest son Rowland Betty the lands of Newtown known by the name of Tony McCallan, the farm of Lower '''Kilsob''' and the farm of Mullaghmore, the above lands not to be taken over until my debts and the children's fortunes are paid. Should either son die without male heirs then to the elder surviving daughter of either. To my said son William Beatty the lease of Gortnacarrig, County Cavan, made to me by the Right Honourable Lord Farnham and the lease of Lavaghmore, Co. Leitrim, made to me by Samuel Campbell, Esq. To my granddaughter Isabella Simpson twenty pounds to be paid by her uncle William Betty when she marries or comes of age. Ten shillings each to the poorest widows or orphans of Templepiert and Drumreilly. A debt of nearly \u00a3100 is owed to me by Rev. Mr. Swanne.\n \n''Executors to be my wife Mary Betty and my sons Rowland and William. Witnesses: Thomas Farrelly, Hugh Bannan and John Logan.''\n \n''Codicil dated 27 September 1784.

The town of Bawnboy is partly situate in the north part of the townland and was sometimes referred to as Kilsob, rather than Bawnboy, in the past. Its chief geographical features are Bellaboy Lough (Irish = Loch B\u00e9al \u00c1tha Bu\u00ed = The Lake of the Entrance to the Yellow Ford), the Bawnboy River, a stone quarry and dug wells. Kilsob is traversed by the national secondary [[N87 road (Ireland)]], the L1037 road, minor roads and rural lanes.

They are all connected by a ring which passes through a hole at the end of each plate, and are covered with letters beautifully engraved. I have seen and felt also the Urim and Thummim.

Joseph requested the privilege of looking into the stone, which he did by putting his face into the hat where the stone was. It proved to be not the right stone for him; but he could see some things, and, among them, he saw the stone, and where it was, in which he could see whatever he wished to see. Smith claims and believes that there is a stone of this quality, somewhere, for every one. The place where he saw the stone was not far from their house; and, under pretence of digging a well, they found water and the stone at a depth of twenty or twenty-two feet. After this, Joseph spent about two years looking into this stone, telling fortunes, where to find lost things, and where to dig for money and other hidden treasure. ...During that year, Joseph went to the town of Harmony, in the State of Pennsylvania, at the request of some one who wanted the assistance of his divining rod and stone in finding hidden treasure, supposed to have been deposited there by the Indians or others. ...Under the first plate, or lid, he found a pair of spectacles, about one and a half inches longer than those used at the present day, the eyes not of glass, but of diamond. ...Returning home, he one day tried the spectacles, and found that, by looking through them, he could see everything -- past, present, and future -- and could also read and understand the characters written on the plates. ...Joseph, with spectacles on, translated the characters on the gold plates, and Harris recorded the result. ...Joseph and Harris returned to Harmony, and found the plates missing -- the Lord had taken them also. Then Joseph put on the spectacles, and saw where the Lord had hid them, among the rocks, in the mountains. Though not allowed to get them, he could, by the help of the spectacles, read them where they were, as well as if they were before him. ...[relating a story from the Book of Mormon] They also found something of which they did not know the use, but when they went into the tabernacle, a voice said, 'What have you got in your hand, there?' They replied that they did not know, but had come to inquire; when the voice said, 'Put it on your face, and put your face in a skin, and you will see what it is.' They did so, and could see everything of the past, present, and future; and it was the same spectacles that Joseph found with the gold plates.\"<ref>Fayette Lapham, \"The Mormons.\" Historical Magazine 7 (May 1870): 307\u20138. found online at: http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1870s/Laph1870.htm</ref>\n|-\n| [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] || ''Des Moines Iowa State Register'' || 1870 August 28 || || \"By means of the urim and thummim 'a pair of large spectacles;' as Mr. Harris termed them, the translation was made, and Mr. Harris claims to have written, of the translations as they were given by Smith, '116 solid pages of [[Foolscap folio |[fools]cap]]: The remainder was written by others.'\"<ref>Harris, Martin.

He did so, and was permitted to look in the glass, which was placed in a hat to exclude the light. He was greatly surprised to see but one thing, which was a small stone, a great way off. It soon became luminous, and dazzeled his eyes, and after a short time it became as intense as the mid-day sun. He said that the stone was under the roots of a tree or shrub as large as his arm, situated about a mile up a small stream that puts in on the South side of Lake Erie, not far from the New York and Pennsylvania line. He often had an opportunity to look in the glass, and with the same result. The luminous stone alone attracted his attention. This singular circumstance occupied his mind for some years, when he left his father's house, and with his youthful zeal traveled west in search of this luminous stone. He took a few shillings in money and some provisions with him. He stopped on the road with a farmer, and worked three days, and replenished his means of support. After traveling some one hundred and fifty miles he found himself at the mouth of the creek. He did not have the glass with him, but he knew its exact location. He borrowed an old ax and a hoe, and repaired to the tree With some labor and exertion he found the stone, carried it to the creek, washed and wiped it dry, sat down on the bank, placed it in his hat, and discovered that time, place and distance were annihilated; that all intervening obstacles were removed, and that he possessed one of the attributes of Deity, an All-Seeing-Eye. He arose with a thankful heart, carried his tools to their owner, turned his feet towards the rising sun, and sought with wearing limbs his long desired home. On the request of the Court, he exhibited the stone. It was about the size of a small hen's egg, in the shape of a high-instepped shape. It was composed of layers of different colors passing diagonally through it. It was very hard and smooth, perhaps by being carried in the pocket.\"<ref>Purple, William D. \u201cJoseph Smith, The Originator of Mormonism.\u201d Chenango Union 30, no. 33 (2 May 1877): 1.

Joseph requested the privilege of looking into the stone, which he did by putting his face into the hat where the stone was. It proved to be not the right stone for him; but he could see some things, and, among them, he saw the stone, and where it was, in which he could see whatever he wished to see. Smith claims and believes that there is a stone of this quality, somewhere, for every one. The place where he saw the stone was not far from their house; and, under pretence of digging a well, they found water and the stone at a depth of twenty or twenty-two feet. After this, Joseph spent about two years looking into this stone, telling fortunes, where to find lost things, and where to dig for money and other hidden treasure. ...During that year, Joseph went to the town of Harmony, in the State of Pennsylvania, at the request of some one who wanted the assistance of his divining rod and stone in finding hidden treasure, supposed to have been deposited there by the Indians or others. ...Under the first plate, or lid, he found a pair of spectacles, about one and a half inches longer than those used at the present day, the eyes not of glass, but of diamond. ...Returning home, he one day tried the spectacles, and found that, by looking through them, he could see everything -- past, present, and future -- and could also read and understand the characters written on the plates. ...Joseph, with spectacles on, translated the characters on the gold plates, and Harris recorded the result. ...Joseph and Harris returned to Harmony, and found the plates missing -- the Lord had taken them also. Then Joseph put on the spectacles, and saw where the Lord had hid them, among the rocks, in the mountains. Though not allowed to get them, he could, by the help of the spectacles, read them where they were, as well as if they were before him. ...[relating a story from the Book of Mormon] They also found something of which they did not know the use, but when they went into the tabernacle, a voice said, 'What have you got in your hand, there?' They replied that they did not know, but had come to inquire; when the voice said, 'Put it on your face, and put your face in a skin, and you will see what it is.'

This singular circumstance occupied his mind for some years, when he left his father's house, and with his youthful zeal traveled west in search of this luminous stone. He took a few shillings in money and some provisions with him. He stopped on the road with a farmer, and worked three days, and replenished his means of support. After traveling some one hundred and fifty miles he found himself at the mouth of the creek. He did not have the glass with him, but he knew its exact location. He borrowed an old ax and a hoe, and repaired to the tree With some labor and exertion he found the stone, carried it to the creek, washed and wiped it dry, sat down on the bank, placed it in his hat, and discovered that time, place and distance were annihilated; that all intervening obstacles were removed, and that he possessed one of the attributes of Deity, an All-Seeing-Eye. He arose with a thankful heart, carried his tools to their owner, turned his feet towards the rising sun, and sought with wearing limbs his long desired home. On the request of the Court, he exhibited the stone. It was about the size of a small hen's egg, in the shape of a high-instepped shape. It was composed of layers of different colors passing diagonally through it. It was very hard and smooth, perhaps by being carried in the pocket.\"<ref>Purple, William D. \u201cJoseph Smith, The Originator of Mormonism.\u201d Chenango Union 30, no. 33 (2 May 1877): 1.

With an air of mystery he would look at the stone shaded in his hat and see visions and any amount of lost property. Each day he had new revelations for his open mouthed followers. In a few weeks people were paying money for his oracles. Many a man was sent over the hills in search of lost cattle, on a fool's errand, of course, but Joe made money and the public apparently fancied humbugging, and that made him a great success.\"<ref>\"Mormon Leaders at Their Mecca.\" New York Herald, 25 June 1893, 12.

She has lived in [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], [[San Francisco]], [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] and [[Pennsylvania]], as well as attending the [[University of Michigan]], where she earned her B.A. in 1981<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blueflowerarts.com/artist/mary-gaitskill/|title=Mary Gaitskill|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> and won a [[Hopwood Award]]. She sold flowers in San Francisco as a teenage runaway. In a conversation with novelist and short story writer [[Matthew Sharpe]] for ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Gaitskill said she chose to become a writer at age 18 because she was \"indignant about things\u2014it was the typical teenage sense of 'things are wrong in the world and I must say something.'\"<ref>Sharpe, Matthew.

The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. ''Secretary'' is the only story in the book written in the first person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, [[sex work]], [[sadomasochism]], drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. ''A Romantic Weekend'' and ''Secretary'' both explore themes of [[BDSM]] and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story ''Connection'' is about a female friendship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=Bad Behavior|date=1988|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-4887-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/badbehaviorstori0000gait}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \"taboo\" subjects such as [[prostitution]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[sado-masochism]].  Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl.  She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \"On Not Being a Victim,\" for ''[[Harper's]]''.\n\nGaitskill's 1994 essay in ''Harper's'' also addresses feminist debates about [[date rape]], victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\" <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=On Not Being a Victim|journal=Harper's Magazine|date=March 1994|volume=288|issue=1726|page=35}}</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in ''Bad Behavior'', although the two have little in common.  She characterized the film as \"the ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\" but observed that the \"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Gaitskill Interview|url=http://failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.php?sxnSrc=ltst|publisher=Failbetter|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe novel ''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat).  Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \"Definitism\" and its founder \"Anna Granite\" (thinly veiled satires of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and [[Ayn Rand]]).  When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an expos\u00e9 of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women.  In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses:\n\n{{ quote|It's a kind of inward aggression. It seems like self-contempt, but it's really an inverted contempt for everything. That's what I was trying to describe in her. I would say it had to do with her childhood, not because she was sexually abused, but because the world that she was presented with was so inadequate in terms of giving her a full-spirited sense of herself. That inadequacy can make you implode with a lot of disgust. It can become the gestalt of who you are. So the masochism is like \"I'm going to make myself into a debased object because that is what I think of you. This is what I think of your love. I don't want your love. Your love is shit. Your love is nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence (originally at Altx.com) |url=http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |date=1994 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921215639/http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |archivedate=2016-09-21 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe novel ''The Mare'', published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through [[The Fresh Air Fund]]. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=The Mare|date=2015|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-37974-0}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for ''Because They Wanted To'' in 1998. ''Veronica'' (2005) was a [[National Book Award]] nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year.  The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts [[AIDS]].  Gaitskill mentioned working on the novel in a 1994 interview, but that same year she put it aside until 2001.  Writing of ''Veronica'' and Gaitskill's career in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in March 2006, [[Wyatt Mason]] said:\n\n{{ quote|Through four books over eighteen years, Mary Gaitskill has been formulating her fiction around the immutable question of how we manage to live in a seemingly inscrutable world. In the past, she has described, with clarity and vision, the places in life where we sometimes get painfully caught.

Despite her well-known S/M themes, Gaitskill does not appear to consider the [[Marquis de Sade]] himself an influence, or at least not a literary one:  \"I don't think much of Sade as a writer, although I enjoyed beating off to him as a child.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence/Portable Infinite (originally at Altx.com)|url=http://portable-infinite.blogspot.com/2006/11/mary-gaitskill-interview.html|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Bad Behavior'' (1988) (stories) {{ISBN|0-671-65871-9}}\n*''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' (1991) (novel) {{ISBN|0-671-68540-6}}\n*''Because They Wanted To'' (1997) (stories) {{ISBN|0-684-80856-0}}\n*''Veronica'' (2005) (novel, [[National Book Award]] Finalist) {{ISBN|0-375-42145-9}}\n*''Don't Cry'' (2009) (stories) {{ISBN|0-375-42419-9}}\n*''The Mare'' (November 2015) (novel) {{ISBN|978-0307379740}}\n*''Somebody with a Little Hammer'' (2017) (essays) {{ISBN|0-307-37822-5}}\n\n==Awards==\n\n* Arts and Letters Award in Literature, [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandletters.org/pressrelease/2018-literature-award-winners/|title=2018 LITERATURE AWARD WINNERS|website=artsandletters.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n* Cullman Research Fellowship at the [[New York Public Library]] (2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for fiction (2002)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* [[Hopwood Award]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Author interview] (2010) by Suzanne Warren at [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Narrative.com].\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |work=College Crier |first=Carri Anne |last=Yager |title=Mary Gaitskill: Critics line up to praise her work- and don't have a clue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009042111/http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060421140536/http://www.failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.htm Author interview] (2005?) at [http://www.failbetter.com failbetter.com].\n* [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Author interview] (2005) for Barnes & Noble's \"Meet the Writers\" website.

Her work has appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''The Best American Short Stories'' (1993, 2006, 2012), and ''The O. Henry Prize Stories'' (1998, 2008).\n\n==Life==\nGaitskill was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. She has lived in [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], [[San Francisco]], [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] and [[Pennsylvania]], as well as attending the [[University of Michigan]], where she earned her B.A. in 1981<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blueflowerarts.com/artist/mary-gaitskill/|title=Mary Gaitskill|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> and won a [[Hopwood Award]]. She sold flowers in San Francisco as a teenage runaway. In a conversation with novelist and short story writer [[Matthew Sharpe]] for ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Gaitskill said she chose to become a writer at age 18 because she was \"indignant about things\u2014it was the typical teenage sense of 'things are wrong in the world and I must say something.'\"<ref>Sharpe, Matthew. [http://bombsite.com/issues/107/articles/3265 \"Mary Gaitskill\"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Spring 2009. Retrieved July 27, 2011.</ref> Gaitskill has also recounted (in her essay \"Revelation\") becoming a born-again Christian at age 21 but lapsing after six months.\n\nShe married the writer [[Peter Trachtenberg]] in 2001. They divorced in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrodale|first=Amie|title=I'm Psychic... with Mary Gaitskill|url=https://www.vice.com/read/im-psychic-mary-gaitskill|work=Interview with Vice Magazine|magazine=Vice Magazine|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill has taught at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], the [[University of Houston]], [[New York University]], [[The New School]], [[Brown University]], in the MFA program at [[Temple University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|title=Department of English: Mary Gaitskill|publisher=Temple University College of Liberal Arts|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162351/http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|archive-date=February 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Syracuse University]]. She was the Writer-In-Residence at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]]. As of 2020, Gaitskill is a [[Visiting Professor|visiting professor]] of literature at [[Claremont McKenna College]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/news/prof-mary-gaitskill-recognized-by-american-academy-of-arts-and-letters|title=Prof. Mary Gaitskill recognized by American Academy of Arts and Letters|last=Affairs|first=Office of Public|last2=Claremont|first2=Communications 400 N.

The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. ''Secretary'' is the only story in the book written in the first person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, [[sex work]], [[sadomasochism]], drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. ''A Romantic Weekend'' and ''Secretary'' both explore themes of [[BDSM]] and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story ''Connection'' is about a female friendship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=Bad Behavior|date=1988|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-4887-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/badbehaviorstori0000gait}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \"taboo\" subjects such as [[prostitution]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[sado-masochism]].  Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl.  She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \"On Not Being a Victim,\" for ''[[Harper's]]''.\n\nGaitskill's 1994 essay in ''Harper's'' also addresses feminist debates about [[date rape]], victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\" <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=On Not Being a Victim|journal=Harper's Magazine|date=March 1994|volume=288|issue=1726|page=35}}</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in ''Bad Behavior'', although the two have little in common.  She characterized the film as \"the ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\" but observed that the \"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Gaitskill Interview|url=http://failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.php?sxnSrc=ltst|publisher=Failbetter|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe novel ''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat).  Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \"Definitism\" and its founder \"Anna Granite\" (thinly veiled satires of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and [[Ayn Rand]]).  When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an expos\u00e9 of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women.  In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses:\n\n{{ quote|It's a kind of inward aggression. It seems like self-contempt, but it's really an inverted contempt for everything. That's what I was trying to describe in her. I would say it had to do with her childhood, not because she was sexually abused, but because the world that she was presented with was so inadequate in terms of giving her a full-spirited sense of herself. That inadequacy can make you implode with a lot of disgust. It can become the gestalt of who you are. So the masochism is like \"I'm going to make myself into a debased object because that is what I think of you. This is what I think of your love. I don't want your love. Your love is shit. Your love is nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence (originally at Altx.com) |url=http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |date=1994 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921215639/http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |archivedate=2016-09-21 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe novel ''The Mare'', published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through [[The Fresh Air Fund]]. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=The Mare|date=2015|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-37974-0}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for ''Because They Wanted To'' in 1998. ''Veronica'' (2005) was a [[National Book Award]] nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year.  The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts [[AIDS]].  Gaitskill mentioned working on the novel in a 1994 interview, but that same year she put it aside until 2001.  Writing of ''Veronica'' and Gaitskill's career in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in March 2006, [[Wyatt Mason]] said:\n\n{{ quote|Through four books over eighteen years, Mary Gaitskill has been formulating her fiction around the immutable question of how we manage to live in a seemingly inscrutable world. In the past, she has described, with clarity and vision, the places in life where we sometimes get painfully caught.

She has won the [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress]] 5 times in the span of 11 years from 1990 to 2001, and holds the record for most wins in that category. She also holds the record for most wins for the [[Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actress]] in Taiwan, having won 4 times. In the West, she has been awarded the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1992 and [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] at [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2004. In 2004, she became the first Asian actress to be nominated for the French [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress]].\n\nHer most acclaimed performances include ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'', ''[[Center Stage (1991 film)|Center Stage]]'', ''[[Comrades: Almost a Love Story]]'', ''[[The Soong Sisters (film)|The Soong Sisters]]'', ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'', and ''[[Clean (film)|Clean]]''. Her cheongsam-wearing character in 2000's ''In The Mood for Love'', opposite male lead [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] and under the direction of [[Wong Kar-wai]], is a classic in both the film and fashion worlds.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMaggie Cheung was born in Hong Kong in 20 September 1964 to [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] parents. She attended St. Paul's Primary Catholic School in Happy Valley, where she began at the primary one level. Her family emigrated from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom when she was eight. She spent part of her childhood and adolescence in [[Bromley]], London, England. She returned to Hong Kong at the age of 18 in 1982 for a vacation but ended up staying for modeling assignments and other commitments. She also shortly obtained a sales job at [[Lane Crawford]] department store.<ref name=vamp />\n\nIn 1983, Cheung entered the [[Miss Hong Kong pageant]] and won the first runner-up and the Miss Photogenic award as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miss Hong Kong 1983|url=http://www.misshkbeauties.com/mhk/1983/index.htm|work=misshkbeauties.com|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> She was a semi-finalist in the [[Miss World]] pageant the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missworld.tv/history/previousTitleHolders.sps?iType=6919&icustompageid=13079|title=Miss World Previous Title Holders - 1983|work=missworld.tv}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> After two years as a TV presenter, it led to a contract with TVB (the television arm of the Shaw Bros.

In ''[[Center Stage (1991 film)|Center Stage]]'', Cheung performed in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], and [[Shanghainese]] fluently, switching languages with ease. In ''[[Clean (film)|Clean]]'', she performed in fluent English, French, and Cantonese.\n\n==Career==\nSoon after her debut, Cheung broke into the film industry, starring in comedies. She caught the attention of [[Jackie Chan]], who cast her in [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'']] (1985) as May, his long-suffering girlfriend. The film was a huge hit and made Cheung a star overnight.<ref name=star>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/film/86232.htm|title=Hong Kong Actress Maggie Cheung|work=China.org.cn}}</ref><ref name=women>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/people/celebrities/8/2800-1.htm|title=Maggie Cheung: A Multi Award-Winning Actress from Hong Kong|work=Women of China}}</ref> TVB had also cast [[Barbara Yung]] and [[Kent Tong]] in a period drama, Kings of Ideas (\u6a4b\u738b\u4e4b\u738b) but due to the death of [[Barbara Yung]], the role was assigned to Cheung. \n\nDespite her success, Cheung found herself typecast in the roles of comics or weak, clumsy women. Realizing this, Cheung wanted to break away by seeking more dramatic roles. She got this opportunity when [[Wong Kar-wai]] cast her in ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'' (1988), her first of many collaborations with Wong.<ref name=star /><ref name=women /> Cheung often cites the film as the piece that truly began her serious acting career, and she won critical praise for it. In 1989, she won Best Actress awards at the [[Golden Horse Award]] and [[Hong Kong Film Award]] for her work in ''Full Moon in New York'' and ''[[A Fishy Story]]'' respectively.<ref name=women /> In 1991, she became the first Chinese performer to win a Best Actress Award at the prestigious [[Berlin Film Festival]] for her work in ''[[Center Stage (1991 film)|Center Stage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/movies/grand-canyon-wins-the-first-prize-at-berlin-festival.html|title='Grand Canyon' Wins The First Prize At Berlin Festival|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nCheung subsequently proved her versatility with roles in action films. Her performance in the sci-fi martial arts smash hit ''[[The Heroic Trio]]'' (1992) and its sequel, ''[[Executioners (film)|Executioners]]'' (1993), impressed both critics and audiences with her martial arts skills.<ref name=star /> Also in a departure from her usual roles, Cheung played a beautiful and vicious femme fatale in ''[[New Dragon Gate Inn]]'' (1992).<ref name=women />\n\nAfter taking a break in 1994, Cheung returned to film [[Olivier Assayas]]' ''[[Irma Vep]]'' (1996), which helped her break into the international scene.<ref name=star /> That same year, she won further acclaim for her work in the romantic film ''[[Comrades: Almost a Love Story]]'', in which she played one of a pair of lovers kept apart for ten years by fate and circumstance. The following year, she made her first English-language film in [[Wayne Wang]]'s  ''[[Chinese Box]]'' (1997). Cast as a mysterious young woman named Jean, Cheung held her own alongside the more internationally well-established stars, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Gong Li]].<ref name=women />\n\nAfter her 1998 marriage with Olivier Assayas, Cheung stayed mainly in France. She returned to Hong Kong to film ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), which won critical acclaim and a second Taiwanese Golden Horse award for Cheung.<ref name=vamp /><ref name=star /> Thereafter, she starred in [[Zhang Yimou]]'s ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002) and Wong's ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2004).<ref name=star /> She won the Best Actress award at the  [[Cannes Film Festival]] for her role as a mother who tries to kick her drug habit and reconcile with her long-lost son in ''[[Clean (film)|Clean]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.sina.com/special_report/040524cannes.shtml|title=Maggie Cheung Snatches Best Actress Award at Cannes|work=Sina}}</ref>\n\nCheung was a jury member at the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival|1997 Berlin Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Archives - Juries|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/04_jury_1997/04_Jury_1997.html|work=berlinale.de|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> the 1999 [[Venice Film Festival]], the 2004 [[Hawaii International Film Festival]], the 2007 [[Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Juries 2007|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/2007/juryLongFilm.html|work=festival-cannes.fr|accessdate=18 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203062231/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/2007/juryLongFilm.html|archive-date=3 December 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the 2010 [[Marrakech International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jury 2010|url=http://en.festivalmarrakech.info/Membres-of-jury_a330.html|work=festivalmarrakech.info|accessdate=4 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203225/http://en.festivalmarrakech.info/Membres-of-jury_a330.html|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> And for the first time in its history, the 59th Cannes Film Festival (2006) used a photographic image of a real actress on its poster &mdash; that of Cheung.\n\nOn 7 February 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' rated Cheung as one of the 22 Great Performers in 2006 for her [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Cannes]] winning role as Emily in ''Clean''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hirschberg|first=Lynn|title=Great Performers|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D10FF385B0C728DDDAB0894DF404482&fta=y&archive:article_related|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 September 2010|date=11 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103225504/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D10FF385B0C728DDDAB0894DF404482&fta=y&archive:article_related|archive-date=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After 25 years of making movies, she decided to retire from acting to pursue a career as a film composer.

Raised in Hong Kong and England, she started her career after placing second in 1983's [[Miss Hong Kong Pageant]]. She achieved critical success in the late 80s and into the early 2000s, before taking a break from acting since her last starring role in 2004. In recent years, she rarely makes public appearances except for fashion events and award ceremonies.\n\nCheung has won numerous accolades at home and abroad for her acting. She has won the [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress]] 5 times in the span of 11 years from 1990 to 2001, and holds the record for most wins in that category. She also holds the record for most wins for the [[Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actress]] in Taiwan, having won 4 times. In the West, she has been awarded the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1992 and [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] at [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2004. In 2004, she became the first Asian actress to be nominated for the French [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress]].\n\nHer most acclaimed performances include ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'', ''[[Center Stage (1991 film)|Center Stage]]'', ''[[Comrades: Almost a Love Story]]'', ''[[The Soong Sisters (film)|The Soong Sisters]]'', ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'', and ''[[Clean (film)|Clean]]''. Her cheongsam-wearing character in 2000's ''In The Mood for Love'', opposite male lead [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] and under the direction of [[Wong Kar-wai]], is a classic in both the film and fashion worlds.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMaggie Cheung was born in Hong Kong in 20 September 1964 to [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] parents. She attended St. Paul's Primary Catholic School in Happy Valley, where she began at the primary one level. Her family emigrated from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom when she was eight. She spent part of her childhood and adolescence in [[Bromley]], London, England. She returned to Hong Kong at the age of 18 in 1982 for a vacation but ended up staying for modeling assignments and other commitments. She also shortly obtained a sales job at [[Lane Crawford]] department store.<ref name=vamp />\n\nIn 1983, Cheung entered the [[Miss Hong Kong pageant]] and won the first runner-up and the Miss Photogenic award as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miss Hong Kong 1983|url=http://www.misshkbeauties.com/mhk/1983/index.htm|work=misshkbeauties.com|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> She was a semi-finalist in the [[Miss World]] pageant the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missworld.tv/history/previousTitleHolders.sps?iType=6919&icustompageid=13079|title=Miss World Previous Title Holders - 1983|work=missworld.tv}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> After two years as a TV presenter, it led to a contract with TVB (the television arm of the Shaw Bros.

In ''[[Center Stage (1991 film)|Center Stage]]'', Cheung performed in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], and [[Shanghainese]] fluently, switching languages with ease. In ''[[Clean (film)|Clean]]'', she performed in fluent English, French, and Cantonese.\n\n==Career==\nSoon after her debut, Cheung broke into the film industry, starring in comedies. She caught the attention of [[Jackie Chan]], who cast her in [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'']] (1985) as May, his long-suffering girlfriend. The film was a huge hit and made Cheung a star overnight.<ref name=star>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/film/86232.htm|title=Hong Kong Actress Maggie Cheung|work=China.org.cn}}</ref><ref name=women>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/people/celebrities/8/2800-1.htm|title=Maggie Cheung: A Multi Award-Winning Actress from Hong Kong|work=Women of China}}</ref> TVB had also cast [[Barbara Yung]] and [[Kent Tong]] in a period drama, Kings of Ideas (\u6a4b\u738b\u4e4b\u738b) but due to the death of [[Barbara Yung]], the role was assigned to Cheung. \n\nDespite her success, Cheung found herself typecast in the roles of comics or weak, clumsy women. Realizing this, Cheung wanted to break away by seeking more dramatic roles. She got this opportunity when [[Wong Kar-wai]] cast her in ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'' (1988), her first of many collaborations with Wong.<ref name=star /><ref name=women /> Cheung often cites the film as the piece that truly began her serious acting career, and she won critical praise for it. In 1989, she won Best Actress awards at the [[Golden Horse Award]] and [[Hong Kong Film Award]] for her work in ''Full Moon in New York'' and ''[[A Fishy Story]]'' respectively.<ref name=women /> In 1991, she became the first Chinese performer to win a Best Actress Award at the prestigious [[Berlin Film Festival]] for her work in ''[[Center Stage (1991 film)|Center Stage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/movies/grand-canyon-wins-the-first-prize-at-berlin-festival.html|title='Grand Canyon' Wins The First Prize At Berlin Festival|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nCheung subsequently proved her versatility with roles in action films. Her performance in the sci-fi martial arts smash hit ''[[The Heroic Trio]]'' (1992) and its sequel, ''[[Executioners (film)|Executioners]]'' (1993), impressed both critics and audiences with her martial arts skills.<ref name=star /> Also in a departure from her usual roles, Cheung played a beautiful and vicious femme fatale in ''[[New Dragon Gate Inn]]'' (1992).<ref name=women />\n\nAfter taking a break in 1994, Cheung returned to film [[Olivier Assayas]]' ''[[Irma Vep]]'' (1996), which helped her break into the international scene.<ref name=star /> That same year, she won further acclaim for her work in the romantic film ''[[Comrades: Almost a Love Story]]'', in which she played one of a pair of lovers kept apart for ten years by fate and circumstance. The following year, she made her first English-language film in [[Wayne Wang]]'s  ''[[Chinese Box]]'' (1997). Cast as a mysterious young woman named Jean, Cheung held her own alongside the more internationally well-established stars, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Gong Li]].<ref name=women />\n\nAfter her 1998 marriage with Olivier Assayas, Cheung stayed mainly in France. She returned to Hong Kong to film ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), which won critical acclaim and a second Taiwanese Golden Horse award for Cheung.<ref name=vamp /><ref name=star /> Thereafter, she starred in [[Zhang Yimou]]'s ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002) and Wong's ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2004).<ref name=star /> She won the Best Actress award at the  [[Cannes Film Festival]] for her role as a mother who tries to kick her drug habit and reconcile with her long-lost son in ''[[Clean (film)|Clean]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.sina.com/special_report/040524cannes.shtml|title=Maggie Cheung Snatches Best Actress Award at Cannes|work=Sina}}</ref>\n\nCheung was a jury member at the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival|1997 Berlin Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Archives - Juries|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/04_jury_1997/04_Jury_1997.html|work=berlinale.de|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> the 1999 [[Venice Film Festival]], the 2004 [[Hawaii International Film Festival]], the 2007 [[Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Juries 2007|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/2007/juryLongFilm.html|work=festival-cannes.fr|accessdate=18 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203062231/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/2007/juryLongFilm.html|archive-date=3 December 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the 2010 [[Marrakech International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jury 2010|url=http://en.festivalmarrakech.info/Membres-of-jury_a330.html|work=festivalmarrakech.info|accessdate=4 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203225/http://en.festivalmarrakech.info/Membres-of-jury_a330.html|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> And for the first time in its history, the 59th Cannes Film Festival (2006) used a photographic image of a real actress on its poster &mdash; that of Cheung.\n\nOn 7 February 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' rated Cheung as one of the 22 Great Performers in 2006 for her [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Cannes]] winning role as Emily in ''Clean''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hirschberg|first=Lynn|title=Great Performers|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D10FF385B0C728DDDAB0894DF404482&fta=y&archive:article_related|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 September 2010|date=11 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103225504/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D10FF385B0C728DDDAB0894DF404482&fta=y&archive:article_related|archive-date=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After 25 years of making movies, she decided to retire from acting to pursue a career as a film composer.

Most settlements were nearly independent of trade with Britain as most grew or made nearly everything they needed\u2014the average cost of imports per most households was only about 5-15 English pounds per year. Most settlements were created by complete family groups with several generations often present in each settlement. Probably close to 80% of the families owned the land they lived and farmed on. They nearly all used English Common Law as their basic code of law and, except for the French, Dutch and Germans, spoke some dialect of English. They established their own popularly elected governments and courts and were, within a few years, mostly self-governing, self-supporting and self-replicating.\n\nNearly all colonies and, later, states in the United States were settled by migration from another colony or state, as foreign immigration usually only played a minor role after the first initial settlements were \n====New England====\nThe New England colonists included more educated men as well as many skilled farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen. They were mostly farmers and settled in small villages for common religious activity. Shipbuilding, commerce, and fisheries were important in coastal towns. New England's healthy climate (the cold winters killed the mosquitoes and other disease-bearing insects), and abundant food supply resulted in the lowest death rate and highest birth rate of any place in the world (marriage was expected and birth control was not, and a much higher than average number of children and mothers survived).<ref>Daniel Scott Smith,  \"The demographic history of colonial New England.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 32#1 (1972): 165-183.</ref>\n\nThe eastern and northern frontier around the initial New England settlements was mainly settled by the [[Yankee]] descendants of the original New Englanders. Emigration to the New England colonies after 1640 and the start of the [[English Civil War]] decreased to less than 1% (about equal to the death rate) in nearly all years prior to 1845. The rapid growth of the New England colonies (total population \u2248700,000 by 1790) was almost entirely due to the high birth rate (>3%) and low death rate (<1%) per year.<ref>Howard Russell, '' A Long, Deep Furrow: Three Centuries of Farming in New England'' (1976)</ref>\n\n====Middle Colonies====\nThe middle colonies' settlements were scattered west of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] (est. 1626 by Dutch, taken over by the English in 1664) and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] (est. 1682). The Dutch-started colony of New York had the most eclectic collection of residents from many different nations and prospered as a major trading and commercial center after about 1700. The Pennsylvania colonial center was dominated by the Quakers for decades after they emigrated there, mainly from the North Midlands of England, from about 1680 to 1725. The main commercial center of Philadelphia was run mostly by prosperous Quakers, supplemented by many small farming and trading communities with strong German contingents located in the Delaware River valley.\n\nMany more settlers arrived in the middle colonies starting in about 1680, when Pennsylvania was founded and many Protestant sects were encouraged to settle there for freedom of religion and good, cheap land. These settlers were of about 60% German and 33% English extraction. By 1780 in New York about 27% of the population were descendants of Dutch settlers 55,000  of 204,000. New Jersey had the rest of the Dutch where they were 14% of the population of 140,000. The rest were mostly English with a wide mixture of other Europeans and about 6% Blacks. New Jersey and Delaware had a majority of British with 20% German-descended colonists, about a 6% black population, and a small contingent of Swedish descendants of [[New Sweden]]. Nearly all were at least third-generation natives.\n\n====South====\nThe main drive of the economy in Virginia, Maryland and South Carolina was large plantations growing staples for export, especially tobacco and rice. Outside the plantations, land was farmed by independent farmers who rented from the proprietors, or (most often) owned it outright. They emphasized subsistence farming to grow food for their large families. Many of the Irish and Irish immigrants specialized in rye-whiskey making, which they sold to obtain cash.  In Maryland, by 1700 there were about 25,000 people and by 1750 that had grown more than 5 times to 130,000. By 1755, about 40% of Maryland's population was black.<ref>Lois Green Carr, and Philip D. Morgan, eds. ''Colonial Chesapeake Society'' (1991)</ref>\n\n====Frontier====\nFrom 1717 to 1775 the western frontier was settled primarily by Presbyterian settlers who migrated in large part from Scotland and Ireland. Frontier settlers initially landed in Philadelphia or Baltimore before migrating to the western frontier for the cheaper land.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Ibpus.com|title=US Citizenship, Naturalization Regulation and Procedures Handbook: Practical Information and Contacts|date=2013|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=1577515544|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Natural growth===\nAll the colonies, after they were started, grew mostly by natural growth, with foreign born populations rarely exceeding 10% in isolated instances. The last significant colonies to be settled mainly by immigrants were Pennsylvania in the early 18th century and Georgia and the Borderlands in the late 18th century, as migration (not immigration) continued to provide nearly all the settlers for each new colony or state. This pattern would continue throughout U.S. history. The extent of colonial settlements by 1800 is shown by this map from the University of Texas map collection.<ref>http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/exploration_1675.jpg</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size:95%; text-align: right;\"\n|-\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"10\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"| Estimated Population of American Colonies 1620 to 1780 <br />\nSeries Z-19 U.S. Census<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/CT1970p2-13.pdf</ref><br />\nNote that the U.

The Irish in the 1790 census were mostly [[Ulster-Scots|Scots Irish]]. The French were mostly [[Huguenot]]s. The total U.S. Catholic population in 1790 is estimated at 40,000 or 1.6%, perhaps a low count due to prejudice.

Nearly all states that lost their 1790 (and 1800) census records have tried to reconstitute their original census from tax records etc. with various degrees of success. The summaries of the 1790 and 1800 census from all states survived.\n# The Total is the total immigration over the approximately 130-year span of colonial existence of the U.S. colonies as found in the 1790 census. Many of the colonists, especially from the New England colonies, are already into their fifth  generation of being in America. At the time of the [[American Revolution]] the foreign born population is estimated to be from 300,000 to 400,000.\n\nDuring the 17th century, approximately 350-400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America. However only half stayed permanently. They were 90% of whites in 1700. From 1700 to 1775 between 400-500,000 Europeans immigrated, 90% being Scots, Scots-Irish, Irish, Germans and Huguenots.

The figure of 45,000 has been questioned as a \"mystery\". These numbers do not include the 50,000-120,000 convicts transported, 33,000 of whom were English.<ref name=Butler /> Even the very high birth rate may not account for all of the nine-fold increase from 230,000 to 2.1 million. Another estimate with very similar results to the ICPS study (except for the French and Swedish totals) gives the number of Americans of English ancestry as 1.9 million in 1790 or 47.9% of the total of 3.930 million (3.5% Welsh, 8.5% Scotch Irish, 4.3% Scots, Irish (South) 4.7%, German 7.3%, Dutch 2.7%, French 1.7%, Swedish 0.2% and Black, 19.3%.<ref>Colin Bonwick, The American Revolution, 1991, p. 253, {{ISBN|0-8139-1346-2}})</ref> The southern Irish were overwhelmingly Protestant.\n\nThe 1790 population already reflected the approximate 50,000 \"Loyalists\" who had emigrated to Canada during and at the end of the American Revolution, 7-10,000 who went to the UK and 6,000 to the Caribbean. 30,000 Americans emigrated to Ontario Canada in the 1790s, often referred to as \"Late Loyalists.\" They were for the most part not political refugees but went for generous land grants and tax 3/4 less than in the United States.\n\nAlready by 1790 the ancestry question was starting to become irrelevant to many, as intermarriage from different ethnic groups was becoming common, causing people to form a common American identity. The total white population in 1790 was about 80% of British ancestry, and would go on to roughly double by natural increase every 25 years. From about 1675 onward, the native-born population of what would become the United States would never again drop below 85% of the total.\n\n===Immigration 1791 to 1849===\nIn the early years of the U.S., immigration was only about 6,000 people a year on average, including French [[refugees]] from the slave revolt in [[Haiti]]. The [[French Revolution]], starting in 1789, and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1792 to 1814 severely limited immigration from Europe. The [[War of 1812]] (1812\u20131814) with Britain again prevented any significant immigration. By 1808 Congress had banned the importation of slaves, slowing that human traffic to a trickle.\n\nAfter 1820 immigration gradually increased. For the first time federal records, including ship passenger lists, were kept for immigration. Total immigration for the year 1820 was 8,385, gradually building to 23,322 by 1830, with 143,000 total immigrating during the decade. From 1831 to 1840 immigration increased greatly, to 599,000 total, as 207,000 Irish, even before the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|famine of 1845-49]], started to emigrate in large numbers as Britain eased travel restrictions. 152,000 Germans, 76,000 British, and 46,000 French formed the next largest immigrant groups in that decade.\n\nFrom 1841 to 1850 immigration exploded to 1,713,000 total immigrants and at least 781,000 Irish, with the famine of 1845-1849 driving them, fled their homeland to escape poverty and death. In attempting to divert some of this traffic to help settle Canada, the British offered bargain fares of 15 shillings for transit to Canada, instead of the normal 5 pounds (100 shillings). Thousands of poor Irish took advantage of this offer and headed to Canada on what came to be called the \"coffin ships\" because of their high death rates. Once in Canada, many Irish walked across the border or caught an intercoastal freighter to the nearest major city in the United States - usually Boston or New York. Bad potato crops and failed revolutions struck the heart of Europe in 1848, contributing to the decade's total of 435,000 Germans, 267,000 British and 77,000 French immigrants to America. Bad times in Europe drove people out; land, relatives, freedom, opportunity, and jobs in America lured them in.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"| Population and Foreign Born 1790 to 1849<br /> Census Population, Immigrants per Decade\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Census||Population || Immigrants-1 ||Foreign Born|| %\n|-\n| colspan=5|<hr />\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1790 || 3,918,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1800  || 5,236,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1810 ||7,036,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1820 ||10,086,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1830 ||12,785,000 || 143,000 ||200,000 -2||1.6%\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1840 ||17,018,000 || 599,000  ||800,000 -2 ||4.7%\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1850 ||23,054,000 || 1,713,000 ||2,244,000 ||9.7%\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe number of immigrants from 1830 on are from immigration records. The census of 1850 was the first census in which place of birth was asked. It is probably a reasonable estimate that the foreign born population in the U.S. reached its minimum in about 1815 at something like 100,000, or 1.4% of the population. By 1815 most of the immigrants that arrived before the [[American Revolution]] had passed on, and there had been almost no new immigration.\n\n# ''The total number immigrating in each decade from 1790 to 1820 are estimates.''\n# ''The number foreign born in 1830 and 1840 decades are extrapolations.''\n\nNearly all population growth up to 1830 was by internal increase; about 98.5% of the population was native-born. By 1850, this had shifted to about 90% native-born. The first significant Catholic immigration started in the mid-1840s.\n\n===Immigration 1850 to 1965===\n\n===Immigration 1965 to Present===\nIn 1965, U.S. immigration law changes reduced the emphasis on national origin. Prior policy favored European immigrants. The 1965 law directed that those with relatives in the U.S. or employer sponsorship now had priority.  By the 1970s, most immigrants to the U.S. came from Latin America or Asia instead of Europe. Since 2000, over three quarters of all immigrants to the U.S. have come from Asia and Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/us-migration-trends/|title=Trends in Migration to the U.S. \u2013 Population Reference Bureau|author=|date=|website=www.prb.org}}</ref>\n<!--\n===Restriction===\n==Ethnic and racial structure==\n===European Americans (White)===\n===African Americans (Black)===\n===Native Americans and Pacific Islanders===\n===Asian Americans===\n===Hispanics/Latinos===\n==Population policies==\n===Natalism===\n===Abortion===\n===Birth control===\n===Child health===\n-->\n\n==Migration within the United States==\n\n===The American West===\nIn 1848, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], concluding the Mexican War, extended U.S. citizenship to approximately 60,000 Mexican residents of the [[New Mexico]] Territory and 10,000 living in [[California]].  However, much like Texas, the Mexican government had encouraged immigration and settlement of these regions from groups in the United States and Europe.  Approximately half of this population is estimated to have been of American origin.  In 1849, the [[California Gold Rush]] spurred significant immigration from Mexico, South America, China, Australia, Europe and caused a mass migration within the US, resulting in California gaining statehood in 1850, with a population of about 90,000.\n\n===Rural flight===\n[[File:Census Bureau population change in the United States 1960-2000.jpg|thumb|550px| Population change 1960 to 2000 by state]]\n''Rural flight'' is the departure of excess populations (usually young men and women) from farm areas. In some cases whole families left, as in the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s. Much of rural America  has seen steady population decline since 1920.\n\n===Black migration out of the South===\n{{main|Great Migration (African American)}}\n\nThe '''Great Migration''' was the movement of millions of [[African American]]s out of the rural [[Southern United States]] from 1914 to 1960. Most moved to large industrial cities, as well as to many smaller industrial cities.African-Americans moved as individuals or small groups. There was no government assistance.

During WWII birthrates had been low, as millions of men had been away fighting in WWII and this had deterred women from starting families: women also had to take the place of men in the workplace, while simultaneously fulfilling their household duties. The millions of men coming back to the US after WWII, and the couples eager to start families, led to a sharp rise in the US birth rate, and a surge in new housing construction in the suburbs and outlying areas of the cities. Since the men who came back got jobs in the workplace again, married women stayed home to take care of the house and children and let their husbands be the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the household.<ref>D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at war with America: Private lives in a patriotic era'' (12984)</ref>\n\nDuring the baby boom years, between 1946 and 1964, the birth rate doubled for third children and tripled for fourth children.<ref name=\"WHC\">{{cite book |author=Chafe, William Henry |year=2003 |title=The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War I |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-515048-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/unfinishedjourne0000chaf/page/118 118] |url=https://archive.org/details/unfinishedjourne0000chaf/page/118 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of children aged 0\u20134 increased to 16,410,000 in 1950 from 11,000,000 in 1940, it continued into the 1960s where it peaked at 20,000,000 children under the age of 5.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe number of children under 19 rose to 69 million in 1960 from 51 million in 1950, a 35.3% increase, while the proportion of the population rose to 38.8% up from 33.8% in 1950.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe total fertility rate of the United States jumped from 2.49 in 1945 to 2.94 in 1946, a rise of 0.45 children therefore beginning the baby boom.

Marriage rates increased and remained at high levels in the late 1930 to the mid-1940s. The number of marriages shot up to reach over 2 million in 1946, with a marriage rate of 16.4 per 1,000 people as WWII had ended. The average age at first marriage for both men and women began to fall after WWII, dropping 22.8 for men and 20.3 for women in 1950 and dropping even more to 22.5 and 20.1 years in 1956. In 1959, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 47% of all brides marrying for their first time were teenagers aged 19 and under. In 1955, 51.2% of women were married by their 20th birthday and 88% by their 25th birthday; 40.3% of men and 28.5% of women aged 20\u201324 in 1955 had never married, down from 77.8% for men and 57.4% for women in 1940.<ref>Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg,  ''Domestic revolutions: A social history of American family life'' (1989).</ref>\n\nAs of 2002, 4.3% of men and 18.1% of women aged 20 are married, increasing to 37% of men and 52% of women by age 25, and then 61% of men and 76% of women by age 30.\n\n===Population growth projections===\nThe U.S. population in 1900 was 76 million.

Easterlin has attempted to explain the cause of the Baby Boom and Baby Bust through the \"relative income\" theory. The \"relative income\" theory suggests that couples choose to have children based on a couple's ratio of potential earning power and the desire to obtain material objects.  This ratio depends on the economic stability of the country in which they live and how people are raised to value material objects.  The \"relative income\" theory explains the Baby Boom by suggesting that the late 1940s and 1950s brought low desires to have material objects, as a result of the Great Depression and WWII, as well as huge job opportunities, because of it being a post war period.  These two factors gave rise to a high relative income, which encouraged high fertility.  Following this period, the next generation had a greater desire for material objects; however, an economic slowdown in the United States made jobs harder to acquire.  This resulted in lower fertility rates, causing the Baby Bust.\n\n==State trends==\nBetween 1880 and 1900, the urban population of the United States rose from 28% to 40%, and reached 50% by 1920, in part due to 9,000,000 [[Europe]]an [[Immigration|immigrants]]. After 1890 the US rural population began to plummet, as farmers were displaced by mechanization and forced to migrate to urban factory jobs.  After World War II, the US experienced a shift away from the cities and into suburbs mostly due to the cost of land, the availability of low cost government home loans, fair housing policies and construction of  highways.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://infograph.venngage.com/p/97070/suburbanization-causes-and-effects|title=Suburbanization: Causes and Effects|author=|date=|website=infograph.venngage.com}}</ref>  Many of the original manufacturing cities lost as much as half their populations between 1950 and 1980.  There was a shift in the population from the dense city centers filled with apartments, row homes, and tenements; to less dense suburban neighborhoods outside the cities which were filled with single family homes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Demographic history]]\n* [[Depopulation of the Great Plains]]  \n* [[Great Migration (African American)]]\n* [[Historical demography]]\n* [[Historical racial and ethnic demographics of the United States]]\n* [[Historical religious demographics of the United States]]\n* [[Mean center of U.S. population]]\n* [[Rural exodus]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Richard E.

Most settlements were nearly independent of trade with Britain as most grew or made nearly everything they needed\u2014the average cost of imports per most households was only about 5-15 English pounds per year. Most settlements were created by complete family groups with several generations often present in each settlement. Probably close to 80% of the families owned the land they lived and farmed on. They nearly all used English Common Law as their basic code of law and, except for the French, Dutch and Germans, spoke some dialect of English. They established their own popularly elected governments and courts and were, within a few years, mostly self-governing, self-supporting and self-replicating.\n\nNearly all colonies and, later, states in the United States were settled by migration from another colony or state, as foreign immigration usually only played a minor role after the first initial settlements were \n====New England====\nThe New England colonists included more educated men as well as many skilled farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen. They were mostly farmers and settled in small villages for common religious activity. Shipbuilding, commerce, and fisheries were important in coastal towns. New England's healthy climate (the cold winters killed the mosquitoes and other disease-bearing insects), and abundant food supply resulted in the lowest death rate and highest birth rate of any place in the world (marriage was expected and birth control was not, and a much higher than average number of children and mothers survived).<ref>Daniel Scott Smith,  \"The demographic history of colonial New England.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 32#1 (1972): 165-183.</ref>\n\nThe eastern and northern frontier around the initial New England settlements was mainly settled by the [[Yankee]] descendants of the original New Englanders. Emigration to the New England colonies after 1640 and the start of the [[English Civil War]] decreased to less than 1% (about equal to the death rate) in nearly all years prior to 1845. The rapid growth of the New England colonies (total population \u2248700,000 by 1790) was almost entirely due to the high birth rate (>3%) and low death rate (<1%) per year.<ref>Howard Russell, '' A Long, Deep Furrow: Three Centuries of Farming in New England'' (1976)</ref>\n\n====Middle Colonies====\nThe middle colonies' settlements were scattered west of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] (est. 1626 by Dutch, taken over by the English in 1664) and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] (est. 1682). The Dutch-started colony of New York had the most eclectic collection of residents from many different nations and prospered as a major trading and commercial center after about 1700. The Pennsylvania colonial center was dominated by the Quakers for decades after they emigrated there, mainly from the North Midlands of England, from about 1680 to 1725. The main commercial center of Philadelphia was run mostly by prosperous Quakers, supplemented by many small farming and trading communities with strong German contingents located in the Delaware River valley.\n\nMany more settlers arrived in the middle colonies starting in about 1680, when Pennsylvania was founded and many Protestant sects were encouraged to settle there for freedom of religion and good, cheap land. These settlers were of about 60% German and 33% English extraction. By 1780 in New York about 27% of the population were descendants of Dutch settlers 55,000  of 204,000. New Jersey had the rest of the Dutch where they were 14% of the population of 140,000. The rest were mostly English with a wide mixture of other Europeans and about 6% Blacks. New Jersey and Delaware had a majority of British with 20% German-descended colonists, about a 6% black population, and a small contingent of Swedish descendants of [[New Sweden]]. Nearly all were at least third-generation natives.\n\n====South====\nThe main drive of the economy in Virginia, Maryland and South Carolina was large plantations growing staples for export, especially tobacco and rice. Outside the plantations, land was farmed by independent farmers who rented from the proprietors, or (most often) owned it outright. They emphasized subsistence farming to grow food for their large families. Many of the Irish and Irish immigrants specialized in rye-whiskey making, which they sold to obtain cash.  In Maryland, by 1700 there were about 25,000 people and by 1750 that had grown more than 5 times to 130,000. By 1755, about 40% of Maryland's population was black.<ref>Lois Green Carr, and Philip D. Morgan, eds. ''Colonial Chesapeake Society'' (1991)</ref>\n\n====Frontier====\nFrom 1717 to 1775 the western frontier was settled primarily by Presbyterian settlers who migrated in large part from Scotland and Ireland. Frontier settlers initially landed in Philadelphia or Baltimore before migrating to the western frontier for the cheaper land.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Ibpus.com|title=US Citizenship, Naturalization Regulation and Procedures Handbook: Practical Information and Contacts|date=2013|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=1577515544|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Natural growth===\nAll the colonies, after they were started, grew mostly by natural growth, with foreign born populations rarely exceeding 10% in isolated instances. The last significant colonies to be settled mainly by immigrants were Pennsylvania in the early 18th century and Georgia and the Borderlands in the late 18th century, as migration (not immigration) continued to provide nearly all the settlers for each new colony or state. This pattern would continue throughout U.S. history. The extent of colonial settlements by 1800 is shown by this map from the University of Texas map collection.<ref>http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/exploration_1675.jpg</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size:95%; text-align: right;\"\n|-\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"10\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"| Estimated Population of American Colonies 1620 to 1780 <br />\nSeries Z-19 U.S. Census<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/CT1970p2-13.pdf</ref><br />\nNote that the U.

The Irish in the 1790 census were mostly [[Ulster-Scots|Scots Irish]]. The French were mostly [[Huguenot]]s. The total U.S. Catholic population in 1790 is estimated at 40,000 or 1.6%, perhaps a low count due to prejudice. The Native American Indian population inside territorial U.S. 1790 boundaries was less than 100,000.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"| U.S. Historical Populations\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Country\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Immigrants Before 1790\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Population 1790 -1\n|-\n| colspan=3|<hr />\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Africa]] -2   || 360,000 ||757,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|England*   || 230,000 ||2,100,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Ulster]] Scot-Irish*   || 135,000 || 300,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Germany -3  || 103,000 || 270,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Scotland]]*   || 48,500 || 150,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Ireland]]*   || 8,000 || (Incl. in Scot-Irish)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Netherlands]]   || 6,000 || 100,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Wales]]*   || 4,000 || 10,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|France   || 3,000 || 15,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Jew]]s -4   || 1,000 || 2,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Sweden]]  || 500 || 2,000\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Other -5   ||50,000 ||200,000\n|-\n| colspan=3|<hr />\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Total -6   ||950,000 ||3,900,000\n|}\n</center>\n\n# Data From  [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPS)\n# Several West African regions were the home to most African slaves imported to America.

Nearly all states that lost their 1790 (and 1800) census records have tried to reconstitute their original census from tax records etc. with various degrees of success. The summaries of the 1790 and 1800 census from all states survived.\n# The Total is the total immigration over the approximately 130-year span of colonial existence of the U.S. colonies as found in the 1790 census. Many of the colonists, especially from the New England colonies, are already into their fifth  generation of being in America. At the time of the [[American Revolution]] the foreign born population is estimated to be from 300,000 to 400,000.\n\nDuring the 17th century, approximately 350-400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America. However only half stayed permanently. They were 90% of whites in 1700. From 1700 to 1775 between 400-500,000 Europeans immigrated, 90% being Scots, Scots-Irish, Irish, Germans and Huguenots.

The figure of 45,000 has been questioned as a \"mystery\". These numbers do not include the 50,000-120,000 convicts transported, 33,000 of whom were English.<ref name=Butler /> Even the very high birth rate may not account for all of the nine-fold increase from 230,000 to 2.1 million. Another estimate with very similar results to the ICPS study (except for the French and Swedish totals) gives the number of Americans of English ancestry as 1.9 million in 1790 or 47.9% of the total of 3.930 million (3.5% Welsh, 8.5% Scotch Irish, 4.3% Scots, Irish (South) 4.7%, German 7.3%, Dutch 2.7%, French 1.7%, Swedish 0.2% and Black, 19.3%.<ref>Colin Bonwick, The American Revolution, 1991, p. 253, {{ISBN|0-8139-1346-2}})</ref> The southern Irish were overwhelmingly Protestant.\n\nThe 1790 population already reflected the approximate 50,000 \"Loyalists\" who had emigrated to Canada during and at the end of the American Revolution, 7-10,000 who went to the UK and 6,000 to the Caribbean. 30,000 Americans emigrated to Ontario Canada in the 1790s, often referred to as \"Late Loyalists.\" They were for the most part not political refugees but went for generous land grants and tax 3/4 less than in the United States.\n\nAlready by 1790 the ancestry question was starting to become irrelevant to many, as intermarriage from different ethnic groups was becoming common, causing people to form a common American identity. The total white population in 1790 was about 80% of British ancestry, and would go on to roughly double by natural increase every 25 years. From about 1675 onward, the native-born population of what would become the United States would never again drop below 85% of the total.\n\n===Immigration 1791 to 1849===\nIn the early years of the U.S., immigration was only about 6,000 people a year on average, including French [[refugees]] from the slave revolt in [[Haiti]]. The [[French Revolution]], starting in 1789, and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1792 to 1814 severely limited immigration from Europe. The [[War of 1812]] (1812\u20131814) with Britain again prevented any significant immigration. By 1808 Congress had banned the importation of slaves, slowing that human traffic to a trickle.\n\nAfter 1820 immigration gradually increased. For the first time federal records, including ship passenger lists, were kept for immigration. Total immigration for the year 1820 was 8,385, gradually building to 23,322 by 1830, with 143,000 total immigrating during the decade. From 1831 to 1840 immigration increased greatly, to 599,000 total, as 207,000 Irish, even before the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|famine of 1845-49]], started to emigrate in large numbers as Britain eased travel restrictions. 152,000 Germans, 76,000 British, and 46,000 French formed the next largest immigrant groups in that decade.\n\nFrom 1841 to 1850 immigration exploded to 1,713,000 total immigrants and at least 781,000 Irish, with the famine of 1845-1849 driving them, fled their homeland to escape poverty and death. In attempting to divert some of this traffic to help settle Canada, the British offered bargain fares of 15 shillings for transit to Canada, instead of the normal 5 pounds (100 shillings). Thousands of poor Irish took advantage of this offer and headed to Canada on what came to be called the \"coffin ships\" because of their high death rates. Once in Canada, many Irish walked across the border or caught an intercoastal freighter to the nearest major city in the United States - usually Boston or New York. Bad potato crops and failed revolutions struck the heart of Europe in 1848, contributing to the decade's total of 435,000 Germans, 267,000 British and 77,000 French immigrants to America. Bad times in Europe drove people out; land, relatives, freedom, opportunity, and jobs in America lured them in.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"| Population and Foreign Born 1790 to 1849<br /> Census Population, Immigrants per Decade\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Census||Population || Immigrants-1 ||Foreign Born|| %\n|-\n| colspan=5|<hr />\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1790 || 3,918,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1800  || 5,236,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1810 ||7,036,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1820 ||10,086,000 || 60,000 ||||\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1830 ||12,785,000 || 143,000 ||200,000 -2||1.6%\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1840 ||17,018,000 || 599,000  ||800,000 -2 ||4.7%\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|1850 ||23,054,000 || 1,713,000 ||2,244,000 ||9.7%\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe number of immigrants from 1830 on are from immigration records. The census of 1850 was the first census in which place of birth was asked. It is probably a reasonable estimate that the foreign born population in the U.S. reached its minimum in about 1815 at something like 100,000, or 1.4% of the population. By 1815 most of the immigrants that arrived before the [[American Revolution]] had passed on, and there had been almost no new immigration.\n\n# ''The total number immigrating in each decade from 1790 to 1820 are estimates.''\n# ''The number foreign born in 1830 and 1840 decades are extrapolations.''\n\nNearly all population growth up to 1830 was by internal increase; about 98.5% of the population was native-born. By 1850, this had shifted to about 90% native-born. The first significant Catholic immigration started in the mid-1840s.\n\n===Immigration 1850 to 1965===\n\n===Immigration 1965 to Present===\nIn 1965, U.S. immigration law changes reduced the emphasis on national origin. Prior policy favored European immigrants. The 1965 law directed that those with relatives in the U.S. or employer sponsorship now had priority.  By the 1970s, most immigrants to the U.S. came from Latin America or Asia instead of Europe. Since 2000, over three quarters of all immigrants to the U.S. have come from Asia and Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/us-migration-trends/|title=Trends in Migration to the U.S. \u2013 Population Reference Bureau|author=|date=|website=www.prb.org}}</ref>\n<!--\n===Restriction===\n==Ethnic and racial structure==\n===European Americans (White)===\n===African Americans (Black)===\n===Native Americans and Pacific Islanders===\n===Asian Americans===\n===Hispanics/Latinos===\n==Population policies==\n===Natalism===\n===Abortion===\n===Birth control===\n===Child health===\n-->\n\n==Migration within the United States==\n\n===The American West===\nIn 1848, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], concluding the Mexican War, extended U.S. citizenship to approximately 60,000 Mexican residents of the [[New Mexico]] Territory and 10,000 living in [[California]].  However, much like Texas, the Mexican government had encouraged immigration and settlement of these regions from groups in the United States and Europe.  Approximately half of this population is estimated to have been of American origin.  In 1849, the [[California Gold Rush]] spurred significant immigration from Mexico, South America, China, Australia, Europe and caused a mass migration within the US, resulting in California gaining statehood in 1850, with a population of about 90,000.\n\n===Rural flight===\n[[File:Census Bureau population change in the United States 1960-2000.jpg|thumb|550px| Population change 1960 to 2000 by state]]\n''Rural flight'' is the departure of excess populations (usually young men and women) from farm areas. In some cases whole families left, as in the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s. Much of rural America  has seen steady population decline since 1920.\n\n===Black migration out of the South===\n{{main|Great Migration (African American)}}\n\nThe '''Great Migration''' was the movement of millions of [[African American]]s out of the rural [[Southern United States]] from 1914 to 1960. Most moved to large industrial cities, as well as to many smaller industrial cities.African-Americans moved as individuals or small groups. There was no government assistance. They migrated because of a variety of push and pull factors:<ref>James N.

During WWII birthrates had been low, as millions of men had been away fighting in WWII and this had deterred women from starting families: women also had to take the place of men in the workplace, while simultaneously fulfilling their household duties. The millions of men coming back to the US after WWII, and the couples eager to start families, led to a sharp rise in the US birth rate, and a surge in new housing construction in the suburbs and outlying areas of the cities. Since the men who came back got jobs in the workplace again, married women stayed home to take care of the house and children and let their husbands be the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] of the household.<ref>D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at war with America: Private lives in a patriotic era'' (12984)</ref>\n\nDuring the baby boom years, between 1946 and 1964, the birth rate doubled for third children and tripled for fourth children.<ref name=\"WHC\">{{cite book |author=Chafe, William Henry |year=2003 |title=The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War I |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-515048-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/unfinishedjourne0000chaf/page/118 118] |url=https://archive.org/details/unfinishedjourne0000chaf/page/118 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of children aged 0\u20134 increased to 16,410,000 in 1950 from 11,000,000 in 1940, it continued into the 1960s where it peaked at 20,000,000 children under the age of 5.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe number of children under 19 rose to 69 million in 1960 from 51 million in 1950, a 35.3% increase, while the proportion of the population rose to 38.8% up from 33.8% in 1950.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe total fertility rate of the United States jumped from 2.49 in 1945 to 2.94 in 1946, a rise of 0.45 children therefore beginning the baby boom.

Marriage rates increased and remained at high levels in the late 1930 to the mid-1940s. The number of marriages shot up to reach over 2 million in 1946, with a marriage rate of 16.4 per 1,000 people as WWII had ended. The average age at first marriage for both men and women began to fall after WWII, dropping 22.8 for men and 20.3 for women in 1950 and dropping even more to 22.5 and 20.1 years in 1956. In 1959, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 47% of all brides marrying for their first time were teenagers aged 19 and under. In 1955, 51.2% of women were married by their 20th birthday and 88% by their 25th birthday; 40.3% of men and 28.5% of women aged 20\u201324 in 1955 had never married, down from 77.8% for men and 57.4% for women in 1940.<ref>Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg,  ''Domestic revolutions: A social history of American family life'' (1989).</ref>\n\nAs of 2002, 4.3% of men and 18.1% of women aged 20 are married, increasing to 37% of men and 52% of women by age 25, and then 61% of men and 76% of women by age 30.\n\n===Population growth projections===\nThe U.S. population in 1900 was 76 million. In 1950, it rose to 152 million; by 2000 it had reached 282 million. By 2050, it is expected to reach 422-458 million, depending on immigration.<ref>https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2009/demo/us-pop-proj-2000-2050/analytical-document09.pdf</ref>\n<!--\n==Marriage and infertility==\n{{Empty section|date=November 2010}}\n==Mortality==\n===Demographic transition===\n===Infant mortality===\n==Morbidity and disease==\n===Malaria===\n===Tuberculosis===\n===Heart disease===\n===Infectious disease===\n===HIV-AIDS===\n==Age distribution==\n===Old age===\n===Welfare ratios===\n===Social Security and Medicare===\n==Internal migration==\n{{Empty section|date=November 2010}}\n==Population distribution==\n-->\n\n==Demographic models in historiography==\n[[Richard Easterlin]], an economist who has researched economic growth in the United States, explains the growth pattern of American population in the 20th century through fertility rate fluctuations and the decreasing mortality rate. Easterlin has attempted to explain the cause of the Baby Boom and Baby Bust through the \"relative income\" theory. The \"relative income\" theory suggests that couples choose to have children based on a couple's ratio of potential earning power and the desire to obtain material objects.  This ratio depends on the economic stability of the country in which they live and how people are raised to value material objects.  The \"relative income\" theory explains the Baby Boom by suggesting that the late 1940s and 1950s brought low desires to have material objects, as a result of the Great Depression and WWII, as well as huge job opportunities, because of it being a post war period.  These two factors gave rise to a high relative income, which encouraged high fertility.  Following this period, the next generation had a greater desire for material objects; however, an economic slowdown in the United States made jobs harder to acquire.  This resulted in lower fertility rates, causing the Baby Bust.\n\n==State trends==\nBetween 1880 and 1900, the urban population of the United States rose from 28% to 40%, and reached 50% by 1920, in part due to 9,000,000 [[Europe]]an [[Immigration|immigrants]]. After 1890 the US rural population began to plummet, as farmers were displaced by mechanization and forced to migrate to urban factory jobs.  After World War II, the US experienced a shift away from the cities and into suburbs mostly due to the cost of land, the availability of low cost government home loans, fair housing policies and construction of  highways.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://infograph.venngage.com/p/97070/suburbanization-causes-and-effects|title=Suburbanization: Causes and Effects|author=|date=|website=infograph.venngage.com}}</ref>  Many of the original manufacturing cities lost as much as half their populations between 1950 and 1980.  There was a shift in the population from the dense city centers filled with apartments, row homes, and tenements; to less dense suburban neighborhoods outside the cities which were filled with single family homes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Demographic history]]\n* [[Depopulation of the Great Plains]]  \n* [[Great Migration (African American)]]\n* [[Historical demography]]\n* [[Historical racial and ethnic demographics of the United States]]\n* [[Historical religious demographics of the United States]]\n* [[Mean center of U.S. population]]\n* [[Rural exodus]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Richard E.

The diocese comprises the department of [[Cantal]]. Erected in 1317, the diocese was suffragan of (subject to) the [[Archdiocese of Bourges]] until 2002.  With the general reorganization of the structure of the French church by Pope John Paul II, Saint-Flour became the suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Clermont]]. The seat of the bishop is located in [[Saint-Flour, Cantal]].\n\nThe current bishop is Bruno Grua, who was appointed in March 2006 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].  Like many French bishops, he was compelled to face the problem created by the dwindling number of priests in the Roman Catholic Church.  In 1970 in Saint-Flour there were 264 priests; in 2010 there were 85.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio'' 1971 and 2011, quoted by David M. Cheney, ''Catholic-Hierarchy:''  [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsflo.html ''Diocese of Saint-Flour''], retrieved: 2016-12-08.</ref>  The number of parishes was 161 in 2010, and half did not have a full-time priest.<ref>Compare the statistics for ca. 1920, printed in the article \"Saint-Flour\" in: {{cite book|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: Supplement 1 (c1922)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeFQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA654|year=1922|publisher=Encyclopedia Press|location=New York|page=654}}  There were 314 parishes and 486 secular priests.  The major seminary had 45 seminarians, and the minor seminary 60.</ref>  Bishop Grua therefore reorganized the parish structure, reducing the number of parishes from 161 to 32 to ensure that every Catholic had a priest who was responsible for his/her spiritual needs.  In 2014 there was one priest for every 1,914 Catholics. In 2017 there was one priest for every 2,553 Catholics. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese is named after [[Florus of Lod\u00e8ve|St. Florus]] (Flour), who is said to have been the first [[Bishop of Lod\u00e8ve]] and to have died at [[Indiciat]] (later Saint-Flour) while evangelizing [[Haute-Auvergne]]. These traditions have been the subject of numerous discussions. In two documents concerning the foundation of the second monastery of St-Flour, drawn up in 1013 and 1031, and in a letter written to [[Pope Urban IV]] in 1261 by [[Pierre de Saint-Haon]], prior of Saint-Flour, St. Flour is already considered as belonging to the Apostolic times, and the ''Speculum sanctorale'' of [[Bernard Gui]] in 1329 relates at length the legend of this \"disciple of Christ\". [[Marcellin Boudet]] believes it more likely that St. Flour lived in the fifth century, and that it was he who attended the [[Council of Arles]] in 450 or 451.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAt the close of the tenth century there was already a monastery at Indiciat. A local seigneur, Astorg de Brezons, surnamed \"the Red Bull\", gave this monastery to the abbey of Cluny, then under the direction of [[Odilo, Abbot of Cluny]], and the donation was confirmed by [[Pope Gregory V]] (996\u201399).<ref>''Gallia christiana'' II, pp. 419-420.</ref>  Amblard de Brezons, his nephew, surnamed \"le Mal Hivern\u00e9\", seized the monastery and destroyed all of it except the church. Amblard and Astorg, from 1010 to 1013, gave this church and its fief to [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] at Rome, together with the monastery of [[Sauxillanges]], governed by Odilo; but later Amblard considered this donation as void, and constructed a fortress, a remnant of which is now the [[sacristy]] of the cathedral, on the site of the old monastery; afterwards Amblard, seized with remorse at Rome, between 1025 and 1031 gave back to Odilo all he possessed, and a large monastery was again founded. [[Pope Urban II]], after the [[Council of Clermont]] (1095), consecrated the church of this new monastery. [[Pope Callistus II]] (1119\u20131124) passed some time there, on 1 and 2 June 1119.<ref>Philippus Jaffe, ''Regesta pontificum Romanorum'' I, editio altera (Leipzig 1885), p. 783, nos. 6698-6699.</ref>  The church collapsed in 1396, and no remains of it exist.\n\n===Creation of the diocese===\n\nIn August, 1317, [[Pope John XXII]] detached [[Haute-Auvergne]] from the [[bishopric of Clermont]] and raised St-Flour to the rank of a bishopric, the first ordinary of which was his chaplain [[Raymond de Montu\u00e9jols]]. Among his successors were [[Pierre d'Estaing]] (1361\u201367), afterwards [[Archbishop of Bourges]] and cardinal in 1370; and [[Louis-Siffrein-Joseph de Salamon]] (1820\u201329), former counseiller-clerc to the [[Parliament of Paris]], who during the [[French Revolution]] had secretly acted in France as the pope's agent, a r\u00f4le concerning which he has left very important memoirs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe diocese of Saint-Flour was particularly hard hit by the Black Death of 1348\u20131353.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marcellin Boudet|author2=Roger Grand|title=\u00c9tude historique sur les \u00e9pid\u00e9mies de peste en Haute-Auvergne (XIVe-XVIIIe si\u00e8cles)|url=https://archive.org/details/tudehistoriques00grangoog|year=1902|publisher=A.

The Assembly ordered that the number of dioceses in France be reduced from 135 to 83, and that these surviving dioceses should be coterminous with the new 'd\u00e9partements' which were being created for civil administration;  the new dioceses were to be grouped into new Metropolitanates.  Saint-Flour was one of the dioceses to be suppressed.  These revisions were contrary to the procedures of the Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn the Haut-Auvergne, the new Constitutional diocese was to be called 'Cantal', and it was assigned to the 'Metropole du Sud-Est'.  The legitimate bishop of Saint-Flour, Ruffo de Bonneval refused to take the oath to the Constitution, and therefore his seat was declared vacant.  The electors of 'Cantal' were convened at Aurillac in March 1791, and nearly every village had its candidate.  Half of the eligible electors refused to participate (198 out of 396), and the remaining voters took some time to sort out the candidates.  On 15 March, they elected Anne-Alexandre-Marie Thibault, who had been a parish priest at Souppes in the diocese of Meaux.  He was consecrated in Paris at N\u00f4tre-Dame on 3 April 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Lamourette, his Metropolitan.  Naturally he did not have his bulls of consecration from Rome, and therefore his consecration was valid, but illegitimate in Canon Law.  He returned to his diocese in May to considerable hostility; he dismissed all the faculty of the seminary, since they had refused to take the oath to the Constitution, and then returned to Paris, where he was elected a member of the [[National Convention]].  He never returned, becoming a politician and successfully maneuvering the changes in government up to 1801 and the Concordat. He was forced to retire into private life, and died on 26 February 1813 without having been reconciled to the Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=R\u00e9pertoire biographique de l'\u00e9piscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A.

The boundaries of the canonically re-established diocese were aligned, however, to coincide with those of the civil ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Cantal]], rather than the territory of the pre-revolutionary diocese.\n\nThe [[:fr:Abbaye Saint-G\u00e9raud d'Aurillac|Abbey of Aurillac]] (fr) is located in the diocesan territory.<ref>{{cite book|author=Guillaume-Marie-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bouange|title=Histoire de l'abbaye d'Aurillac, pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e de la vie de saint G\u00e9raud, son fondateur (894-1789)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uVxXwAACAAJ|year=1899|publisher=A.

The diocese comprises the department of [[Cantal]]. Erected in 1317, the diocese was suffragan of (subject to) the [[Archdiocese of Bourges]] until 2002.  With the general reorganization of the structure of the French church by Pope John Paul II, Saint-Flour became the suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Clermont]]. The seat of the bishop is located in [[Saint-Flour, Cantal]].\n\nThe current bishop is Bruno Grua, who was appointed in March 2006 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].  Like many French bishops, he was compelled to face the problem created by the dwindling number of priests in the Roman Catholic Church.  In 1970 in Saint-Flour there were 264 priests; in 2010 there were 85.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio'' 1971 and 2011, quoted by David M.

The major seminary had 45 seminarians, and the minor seminary 60.</ref>  Bishop Grua therefore reorganized the parish structure, reducing the number of parishes from 161 to 32 to ensure that every Catholic had a priest who was responsible for his/her spiritual needs.  In 2014 there was one priest for every 1,914 Catholics. In 2017 there was one priest for every 2,553 Catholics. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese is named after [[Florus of Lod\u00e8ve|St. Florus]] (Flour), who is said to have been the first [[Bishop of Lod\u00e8ve]] and to have died at [[Indiciat]] (later Saint-Flour) while evangelizing [[Haute-Auvergne]]. These traditions have been the subject of numerous discussions. In two documents concerning the foundation of the second monastery of St-Flour, drawn up in 1013 and 1031, and in a letter written to [[Pope Urban IV]] in 1261 by [[Pierre de Saint-Haon]], prior of Saint-Flour, St. Flour is already considered as belonging to the Apostolic times, and the ''Speculum sanctorale'' of [[Bernard Gui]] in 1329 relates at length the legend of this \"disciple of Christ\". [[Marcellin Boudet]] believes it more likely that St. Flour lived in the fifth century, and that it was he who attended the [[Council of Arles]] in 450 or 451.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAt the close of the tenth century there was already a monastery at Indiciat. A local seigneur, Astorg de Brezons, surnamed \"the Red Bull\", gave this monastery to the abbey of Cluny, then under the direction of [[Odilo, Abbot of Cluny]], and the donation was confirmed by [[Pope Gregory V]] (996\u201399).<ref>''Gallia christiana'' II, pp. 419-420.</ref>  Amblard de Brezons, his nephew, surnamed \"le Mal Hivern\u00e9\", seized the monastery and destroyed all of it except the church. Amblard and Astorg, from 1010 to 1013, gave this church and its fief to [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] at Rome, together with the monastery of [[Sauxillanges]], governed by Odilo; but later Amblard considered this donation as void, and constructed a fortress, a remnant of which is now the [[sacristy]] of the cathedral, on the site of the old monastery; afterwards Amblard, seized with remorse at Rome, between 1025 and 1031 gave back to Odilo all he possessed, and a large monastery was again founded. [[Pope Urban II]], after the [[Council of Clermont]] (1095), consecrated the church of this new monastery. [[Pope Callistus II]] (1119\u20131124) passed some time there, on 1 and 2 June 1119.<ref>Philippus Jaffe, ''Regesta pontificum Romanorum'' I, editio altera (Leipzig 1885), p. 783, nos. 6698-6699.</ref>  The church collapsed in 1396, and no remains of it exist.\n\n===Creation of the diocese===\n\nIn August, 1317, [[Pope John XXII]] detached [[Haute-Auvergne]] from the [[bishopric of Clermont]] and raised St-Flour to the rank of a bishopric, the first ordinary of which was his chaplain [[Raymond de Montu\u00e9jols]]. Among his successors were [[Pierre d'Estaing]] (1361\u201367), afterwards [[Archbishop of Bourges]] and cardinal in 1370; [[Louis-Siffrein-Joseph de Salamon]] (1820\u201329), former counseiller-clerc to the [[Parliament of Paris]], who during the [[French Revolution]] had secretly acted in France as the pope's agent, a r\u00f4le concerning which he has left very important memoirs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe diocese of Saint-Flour was particularly hard hit by the Black Death of 1348\u20131353.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marcellin Boudet|author2=Roger Grand|title=\u00c9tude historique sur les \u00e9pid\u00e9mies de peste en Haute-Auvergne (XIVe-XVIIIe si\u00e8cles)|url=https://archive.org/details/tudehistoriques00grangoog|year=1902|publisher=A.

The Assembly ordered that the number of dioceses in France be reduced from 135 to 83, and that these surviving dioceses should be coterminous with the new 'd\u00e9partements' which were being created for civil administration;  the new dioceses were to be grouped into new Metropolitanates.  Saint-Flour was one of the dioceses to be suppressed.  These revisions were contrary to the procedures of the Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn the Haut-Auvergne, the new Constitutional diocese was to be called 'Cantal', and it was assigned to the 'Metropole du Sud-Est'.  The legitimate bishop of Saint-Flour, Ruffo de Bonneval refused to take the oath to the Constitution, and therefore his seat was declared vacant.  The electors of 'Cantal' were convened at Aurillac in March 1791, and nearly every village had its candidate.  Half of the eligible electors refused to participate (198 out of 396), and the remaining voters took some time to sort out the candidates.  On 15 March, they elected Anne-Alexandre-Marie Thibault, who had been a parish priest at Souppes in the diocese of Meaux.  He was consecrated in Paris at N\u00f4tre-Dame on 3 April 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Lamourette, his Metropolitan.  Naturally he did not have his bulls of consecration from Rome, and therefore his consecration was valid, but illegitimate in Canon Law.  He returned to his diocese in May to considerable hostility; he dismissed all the faculty of the seminary, since they had refused to take the oath to the Constitution, and then returned to Paris, where he was elected a member of the [[National Convention]].  He never returned, becoming a politician and successfully maneuvering the changes in government up to 1801 and the Concordat. He was forced to retire into private life, and died on 26 February 1813 without having been reconciled to the Church.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=R\u00e9pertoire biographique de l'\u00e9piscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A.
