It is located at an altitude of 115 metres (380 feet).\n\n==History==\n'''Yazman''' is primarily called a gateway to the [[Cholistan Desert]]. It is the largest Tehsil of [[Bahawalpur District]]. Yazman is a unique offspring of the process of colonization of the defunct state of Bahawalpur and it was named after a city of \u201cYazman\u201d in a Syrian region of Balkh.\n\nYazman is actually a seven to eight decades older city. The following three factors played a vital role in its colonization and development.\n1-It is situated at a starting point of Cholistan, 32 kilometers from Bahawalpur (The capital of the ex-state of Bahawalpur and a commissionerate and divisional headquarters after its merger into Pakistan)\n2-The colonization as a result of the completion of Satluj Valley Project canal system.\n3-An important station of the Cholistan or Colony Railway Line laid down from Samma Satta, Bahawalpur to Fort Abbas via Yazman.\nYazman came into being because an administrative unit was required in the colony area of Cholistan.\n\nAfter 1955 the coming years heralded a new era of development and progress and its infrastructure was enhanced to the maximum extent. With effect from 1 July 1984 Yazman gained the status of Tahsil with a high profile socio-economic and agrarian progress.\n\nTehsil level offices of all important departments i.e. Police, Agriculture, Social Welfare, Education, Food, Forest, sports, irrigation, electricity, telephone and branches of all the national banks are operational here. Special focus on the development of Cholistan has been a special phenomenon. After devolution many development projects of education, irrigation, communication, public health engineering and electricity have so far been carried out. The famous village of this area is \n[[Chak_No_114/DNB]]\n[[Chak_No_39/DB Near Kudwala]]\n[[Chak_No_106/DB]], [[Yazman Mandi]]\n\n==Transportation ==\nKeeping in view to provide an effective infrastructural facility in the form of state controlled communication, a 124 miles project of a railway line from Samma Satta to Bahawal Nagar via Fort Abbas was started in November 1926. In the first phase railway line was laid down from Bahawal Nagar to Doga Bonga and was inaugurated in 1928. It was extended to Fort Abbas during the next two years. The project of remaining 80 miles from Fort Abbas to Samma Satta with the prominent stations of Mansoora, Quresh, Yazman and Qattal Ammara was completed during the period of next four to five years. This railway line could be utilized only for five years as on the request of the British Indian Government (a patron of the Bahawalpur state) all the infrastructure of railway line was given to the old patron to meet the urgent requirements of the Second World War at Indian Fronts.\n\nThe Nawab of Bahawalpur sanctioned the removal of 80 of the 124 miles railway track on 12 December 1940. It was lifted with a hope and plan to be re-laid after war. But that hope was never fulfilled and as a consequence the then required level of development in the colony area of Fort Abbas, Fort Marot and Yazman suffered a great setback in the days to come.\n\nIn 1943 Yazman was conferred upon the status of Notified Area Committee (NAC or Sub Tahsil) along with its neighboring cities of Hasilpur, for Abbas and others like Bahawal Nagar, Sadiq Abad, Chishtian and Haroon Abad with a subsequent extension up to 31 March 1947 and a Naib tahsildar was posted who was also ex-officio chairman of the Committee. In order to facilitate the agro based economy, the State had a norm to alleviate some of the cities to the level of Mandi. Yazman was given the status of non-permanent Mandi in 1943-44 and was upgraded to the level of Permanent Mandi in 1949. The construction work of the Yazman City was started through auction of plots for commercial and residential purpose by the state administration. A brick kiln was approved for the promotion of construction work. One dispensary was established in 1942\u201343. The figures of the income and expenditure of Yazman committee as Rs.1621, Rs.2531 and Rs.1016, Rs.1364 are available in the administrative reports for the years 1942-43 and 1943\u201344. In the same year there was a police station with a staff of one Sub inspector, one hawaldar and 18 constables. The state administration report for the year 1946-47 reflects that \u201cthe construction of water courses in Yazman is given due importance. Yazman is indicating a permanent low profile of development due to poor situation of the communication.\u201d The provision of communication facilities was a major motive in this area. Apart from the railway line (discarded after only five years), lorry service was started between Bahawalpur to Fort Abbas and Yazman on the non metaled road which continued up to the merger of the state in Pakistan till 1955. When the 32 kilometers road between Bahawalpur and Yazman was converted into metalled road, the transport service and its quality became better and comfortable.\n\n== Sites ==\n\n=== Cholistan Desert ===\nThe desert area which comprises one third of the total area of the Bahawalpur District is called \u201cCholistan\u201d or \u201cRohi\u201d. In local dialect the word \u201cCholistan\u201d which means desert without water and grass. The Cholistan can be divided into two parts: VIZ Smaller Cholistan and Greater Cholistan. Smaller Cholistan is situated along with the irrigated area while Greater Cholistan lies further south. Some parts of Cholistan are open plain spaces, locally called \u201cDahars\u201d where soil is alluvial and suitable for cultivation. The other parts consists of sand dunes, called \u201cTibas\u201d rising at some places up to 100 meters with vegetation peculiar to sandy tracts.\n\nCholistan was under regular irrigated cultivation till 1200 B.C and under seasonal regular irrigated cultivation till about 600 B.C. With the drying up of River Hakra the area was deserted with passage of time. There are more than 400 archeological sites which were once populated as per survey report of Dr. Rafique Mughal which was carried out in the winter of 1978 and published in an international magazine. Cholistan is also called as valley of Hakra.\n\nAverage rainfall in Cholistan is 7.5 to 12.5 centimeters and subsoil water is brackish. Density population in Cholistan is only 09 persons per square kilometers. Animal population is around 1,200,000 which comprises camels, goats, sheep and cows. Cholistan is home of wildlife. Main source of drinking water both for human beings and animals, is rain water which is stored in \u201cTobas\u201d and \u201cKunds\u201d (water reservoir). Cholistanis constantly move in search of water. The desert on south was once habitable and forts of Derawar, Din Garh, Mauj Garh and Marot were situated at the bank of the dried up river called Sarswati, Hakra or Chughra. With the passage of time, its feeder channels changed route thus the vast tract of irrigated land converted into desert now called Cholistan.\n\nThe population of Cholistan consists of Muslims and non-Muslims with culture and language of their own. Cholistani clans migrate to the plains of the district in summer with their animals when rain and water is scarce. The current major clans of Cholistan include Jaams, Jats, Arain, Rajputs and Balochis. Their sub-clans include Laars, Chatta, Cheema, Warraich, Rehan, Ghuman, Sidhu, Uppal, Janjua, Rathore, Bhatti, Leghari, Lashari, and Dashti. Though these clans are unique because of their historical past and maintenance of their tribal traditions. The crafts and folktales are very much recognized.\n\n=== The Shrine of Channan Pir ===\nA few kilometers from Yazman at the start of Cholistan, the Shrine of Channan Pir is situated. centre of the spiritual and cultural heritage of Yazman and Cholistan. Cultural activities are observed to be at the peak when Urs or Fair of Channan Pir is held on the consecutive seven Thursdays starting in the month of March every year. The visitors throw tabbaruk (the sacred sweet) and the persons who pick and taste this tabarruk are supposed to be fortunate in achieving their worldly pursuits. It is told that some time in the Seventh Century Hijri (the Islamic calendar) a well known spiritual celebrity of great stature at Uch Sharif Hazrat Makhdum Jalal-ud-Din Surkh Bukhari while traveling on route to Jasalmir a [[Hindu]] area, claimed that there was a Muslim residing in the area. He was replied in negative. He was told that the wife of the ruler (raja) of this area was expecting a baby. He predicted that he would be a staunch Muslim. The Raja became scared of the forecast of the saint and the newborn baby was laid alive in a cradle made of sandalwood and was thrown in the desert to vanish away. The supernatural phenomena protected and brought up the to be saint. He entered in the circle of Makhdum Jalal-ud-Din Surkh Bukhariand and was given the title Channan Pir. He converted many non-Muslims. The individuals of almost all the religions and sexes are devotees of Channan Pir and pay respects to him on the occasion of his death anniversary (Urs). The passionate devotees from all over the area pay homage to the saint as a token of acknowledgement of fulfillment of their desires for which they make vows. The Ruler Nawab of Bahawalpur paid a visit to the shrine along with the state Prime Minister Mr. Krafton and his spouse on March 14, 1943.\n\n=== Derawar Fort ===\nThe most visited ancient site is Fort Derawar which is situated in the middle and on the interlinked old communication network of the Great Desert of Cholistan. Its distance from Ahmad Pur East is 50&nbsp;km. The historians{{who|date=February 2016}} tell that Derawar Fort was constructed by the Raja of Bhatti tribes in 757 A.D. It is constructed in Hindu style of architecture. The first Nawab of Bahawalpur State Sadiq Muhammad Khan I while expanding the territory of the state attacked and got hold of the fort from Sardar Aghi Sing.\n\nRaja Jajja from a Bhatti tribe was the ruler of Khanpur and Ahmadpur. Another Raja Diwa Sing sought permission from his maternal uncle Sardar Jajja Sing to construct the fort at a bank of Hakra in Cholistan which was granted and its erection started in 837 A.D. Due to unknown reasons Raja Jajja ordered to suspend the process of construction. On the request of his sister, the mother of Diwa Sing, he again permitted to restart its construction. After its completion it was named as \u201cDewar Awal\u201d which became Derwar by the passage of time.\n\nIn 1825, Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan III built a mosque in front of it on the true model of Jamia Masjid Dheli. Marble of very fine quality was used in the mosque of Derawar. It is a unique monument which was constructed with a material which was brought there from the remote areas to that area of poor communication. The family graveyard of the Nawabs Half km from the mosque is also worth seeing because of its style and architecture.\n[[Chak_no_45/DNB|CHAK NO 45/DNB]]\n\n'''<big>Chak Number 108/DNB</big>'''\n\nChak number 108 DNB is present in Yazman as a village with population of about 1.34k.

It is located at an altitude of 115 metres (380 feet).\n\n==History==\n'''Yazman''' is primarily called a gateway to the [[Cholistan Desert]]. It is the largest Tehsil of [[Bahawalpur District]]. Yazman is a unique offspring of the process of colonization of the defunct state of Bahawalpur and it was named after a city of \u201cYazman\u201d in a Syrian region of Balkh.\n\nYazman is actually a seven to eight decades older city. The following three factors played a vital role in its colonization and development.\n1-It is situated at a starting point of Cholistan, 32 kilometers from Bahawalpur (The capital of the ex-state of Bahawalpur and a commissionerate and divisional headquarters after its merger into Pakistan)\n2-The colonization as a result of the completion of Satluj Valley Project canal system.\n3-An important station of the Cholistan or Colony Railway Line laid down from Samma Satta, Bahawalpur to Fort Abbas via Yazman.\nYazman came into being because an administrative unit was required in the colony area of Cholistan.\n\nAfter 1955 the coming years heralded a new era of development and progress and its infrastructure was enhanced to the maximum extent. With effect from 1 July 1984 Yazman gained the status of Tahsil with a high profile socio-economic and agrarian progress.\n\nTehsil level offices of all important departments i.e. Police, Agriculture, Social Welfare, Education, Food, Forest, sports, irrigation, electricity, telephone and branches of all the national banks are operational here. Special focus on the development of Cholistan has been a special phenomenon. After devolution many development projects of education, irrigation, communication, public health engineering and electricity have so far been carried out. The famous village of this area is \n[[Chak_No_114/DNB]]\n[[Chak_No_39/DB Near Kudwala]]\n[[Chak_No_106/DB]], [[Yazman Mandi]]\n\n==Transportation ==\nKeeping in view to provide an effective infrastructural facility in the form of state controlled communication, a 124 miles project of a railway line from Samma Satta to Bahawal Nagar via Fort Abbas was started in November 1926. In the first phase railway line was laid down from Bahawal Nagar to Doga Bonga and was inaugurated in 1928. It was extended to Fort Abbas during the next two years. The project of remaining 80 miles from Fort Abbas to Samma Satta with the prominent stations of Mansoora, Quresh, Yazman and Qattal Ammara was completed during the period of next four to five years. This railway line could be utilized only for five years as on the request of the British Indian Government (a patron of the Bahawalpur state) all the infrastructure of railway line was given to the old patron to meet the urgent requirements of the Second World War at Indian Fronts.\n\nThe Nawab of Bahawalpur sanctioned the removal of 80 of the 124 miles railway track on 12 December 1940. It was lifted with a hope and plan to be re-laid after war. But that hope was never fulfilled and as a consequence the then required level of development in the colony area of Fort Abbas, Fort Marot and Yazman suffered a great setback in the days to come.\n\nIn 1943 Yazman was conferred upon the status of Notified Area Committee (NAC or Sub Tahsil) along with its neighboring cities of Hasilpur, for Abbas and others like Bahawal Nagar, Sadiq Abad, Chishtian and Haroon Abad with a subsequent extension up to 31 March 1947 and a Naib tahsildar was posted who was also ex-officio chairman of the Committee. In order to facilitate the agro based economy, the State had a norm to alleviate some of the cities to the level of Mandi. Yazman was given the status of non-permanent Mandi in 1943-44 and was upgraded to the level of Permanent Mandi in 1949. The construction work of the Yazman City was started through auction of plots for commercial and residential purpose by the state administration. A brick kiln was approved for the promotion of construction work. One dispensary was established in 1942-43. The figures of the income and expenditure of Yazman committee as Rs.1621, Rs.2531 and Rs.1016, Rs.1364 are available in the administrative reports for the years 1942-43 and 1943-44. In the same year there was a police station with a staff of one Sub inspector, one hawaldar and 18 constables. The state administration report for the year 1946-47 reflects that \u201cthe construction of water courses in Yazman is given due importance. Yazman is indicating a permanent low profile of development due to poor situation of the communication.\u201d The provision of communication facilities was a major motive in this area. Apart from the railway line (discarded after only five years), lorry service was started between Bahawalpur to Fort Abbas and Yazman on the non metaled road which continued up to the merger of the state in Pakistan till 1955. When the 32 kilometers road between Bahawalpur and Yazman was converted into metalled road, the transport service and its quality became better and comfortable.\n\n== Sites ==\n\n=== Cholistan Desert ===\nThe desert area which comprises one third of the total area of the Bahawalpur District is called \u201cCholistan\u201d or \u201cRohi\u201d. In local dialect the word \u201cCholistan\u201d which means desert without water and grass. The Cholistan can be divided into two parts: VIZ Smaller Cholistan and Greater Cholistan. Smaller Cholistan is situated along with the irrigated area while Greater Cholistan lies further south. Some parts of Cholistan are open plain spaces, locally called \u201cDahars\u201d where soil is alluvial and suitable for cultivation. The other parts consists of sand dunes, called \u201cTibas\u201d rising at some places up to 100 meters with vegetation peculiar to sandy tracts.\n\nCholistan was under regular irrigated cultivation till 1200 B.C and under seasonal regular irrigated cultivation till about 600 B.C. With the drying up of River Hakra the area was deserted with passage of time. There are more than 400 archeological sites which were once populated as per survey report of Dr. Rafique Mughal which was carried out in the winter of 1978 and published in an international magazine. Cholistan is also called as valley of Hakra.\n\nAverage rainfall in Cholistan is 7.5 to 12.5 centimeters and subsoil water is brackish. Density population in Cholistan is only 09 persons per square kilometers. Animal population is around 1,200,000 which comprises camels, goats, sheep and cows. Cholistan is home of wildlife. Main source of drinking water both for human beings and animals, is rain water which is stored in \u201cTobas\u201d and \u201cKunds\u201d (water reservoir). Cholistanis constantly move in search of water. The desert on south was once habitable and forts of Derawar, Din Garh, Mauj Garh and Marot were situated at the bank of the dried up river called Sarswati, Hakra or Chughra. With the passage of time, its feeder channels changed route thus the vast tract of irrigated land converted into desert now called Cholistan.\n\nThe population of Cholistan consists of Muslims and non-Muslims with culture and language of their own. Cholistani clans migrate to the plains of the district in summer with their animals when rain and water is scarce. The current major clans of Cholistan include Jaams, Jats, Arain, Rajputs and Balochis. Their sub-clans include Laars, Chatta, Cheema, Warraich, Rehan, Ghuman, Sidhu, Uppal, Janjua, Rathore, Bhatti, Leghari, Lashari, and Dashti. Though these clans are unique because of their historical past and maintenance of their tribal traditions. The crafts and folktales are very much recognized.\n\n=== The Shrine of Channan Pir ===\nA few kilometers from Yazman at the start of Cholistan, the Shrine of Channan Pir is situated. centre of the spiritual and cultural heritage of Yazman and Cholistan.

Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. 5G communication requires the use of communications devices (mostly [[mobile phone]]s) designed to support the technology.\n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms. The latency to the server, farther back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25\u201340% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding \"Edge Servers\" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10\u201320 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. \n\nMassive MIMO ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016. Massive MIMO, typically uses 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell. In the right frequencies and configuration, it can increase performance from 4 to 10 times<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wirelessone.news/9-mimo/687-china-mobile-softbank-ordering-1-000-s-of-massive-mimo-bases-2|title=\"I am crazy about Massive MIMO,\" Kitihara of Softbank ordering 1,000's of Massive MIMO bases|website=wirelessone.news|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>.

Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

The term \"massive MIMO\" was coined by Nokia Bell Labs researcher Dr. Thomas L. Marzetta in 2010, and has been launched in [[4G]] networks, such as [[Softbank]] in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/zte-softbank-achieve-956-mbps-massive-mimo-test|title=ZTE, SoftBank achieve 956 Mbps in Massive MIMO test|website=FierceWireless|language=en|access-date=2019-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421014202/https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/zte-softbank-achieve-956-mbps-massive-mimo-test|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nOf more than 562 separate 5G demonstrations, tests or trials globally of 5G technologies, at least 94 of them have involved testing Massive MIMO in the context of 5G.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ 5G Investments: Trials, Deployments, Launches \u2013 Updated March 2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402105309/https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ |date=April 2, 2019 }} (retrieved 2 March 2019)</ref>\n\n=== Edge computing ===\n{{main|Mobile edge computing}}\n[[Edge computing]] is delivered by computing servers closer to the ultimate user.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. 5G communication requires the use of communications devices (mostly [[mobile phone]]s) designed to support the technology.\n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms. The latency to the server, farther back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25\u201340% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding \"Edge Servers\" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10\u201320 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018. Previously, some reserved the term 5G for systems that deliver download speeds of 20&nbsp;GHz shared called for by [[ITU]] [[IMT-2020]]. 3GPP will submit their 5G NR to the ITU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|title=Preparing the ground for IMT-2020|publisher=www.3gpp.org|access-date=2019-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414233657/https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|archive-date=April 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to traditional mobile operator services, 5G NR also addresses specific requirements for private mobile networks ranging from industrial [[Internet of things|IoT]] to critical communications.\n\n==Overview==\n5G networks are [[digital signal|digital]] [[cellular network]]s, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''. [[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. \n\nMassive MIMO ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016.

Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

The term \"massive MIMO\" was coined by Nokia Bell Labs researcher Dr. Thomas L. Marzetta in 2010, and has been launched in [[4G]] networks, such as [[Softbank]] in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/zte-softbank-achieve-956-mbps-massive-mimo-test|title=ZTE, SoftBank achieve 956 Mbps in Massive MIMO test|website=FierceWireless|language=en|access-date=2019-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421014202/https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/zte-softbank-achieve-956-mbps-massive-mimo-test|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nOf more than 562 separate 5G demonstrations, tests or trials globally of 5G technologies, at least 94 of them have involved testing Massive MIMO in the context of 5G.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ 5G Investments: Trials, Deployments, Launches \u2013 Updated March 2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402105309/https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ |date=April 2, 2019 }} (retrieved 2 March 2019)</ref>\n\n=== Edge computing ===\n{{main|Mobile edge computing}}\n[[Edge computing]] is delivered by computing servers closer to the ultimate user.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.
