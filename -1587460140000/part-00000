''RCGS Resolute'', which had a crew of 32 onboard but was not carrying passengers, survived the encounter with superficial damage and remained on site for over an hour to provide assistance until being allowed to continue towards Willemstad by Joint [[Rescue Coordination Centre]] (JRCC) Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"ccs_statement\">{{cite  web|url=https://www.columbia-cs.com/statement-on-rcgs-resolute-incident/|title=Statement on RCGS RESOLUTE incident|publisher=Columbia Cruise Services|date=1 April 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Portuguese investigation ====\n{{commonscat|IMO 9000168|RCGS Resolute}}\nOn 6 April, the Office for the Investigation of Maritime Accidents and the Aeronautical Meteorology Authority (Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica; GAMA) of Portugal released a technical investigation report on the incident involving the Portuguese-flagged cruise ship.<ref name=\"gamareport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gama.mm.gov.pt/images/Relatorios_Tecnicos/2020-065_RCGS_RESOLUTE.pdf|title=Relat\u00f3rio de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o T\u00e9cnica / Investigation report|language=Portuguese|publisher=Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica (GAMA)|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the report, ''RCGS Resolute'' had departed Buenos Aires on 5 March and sailed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] along the South American coastline. On 28 March, the vessel had stopped in the open sea to allow the crew to carry out maintenance work in the engine room. After drifting closer to the Venezuelan coast on the following day, ''RCGS Resolute'' had resumed sailing west for about 90 minutes until the ship had passed La Tortuga Island and then continued adrift to a westerly direction while the starboard main engine [[turbocharger]] was being serviced.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nOn the night of 30 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was contacted by the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat ''Naiguat\u00e1'' at around quarter past midnight. After a brief questioning over VHF, the cruise ship was ordered to follow the Venezuelan vessel to Puerto Moreno on the basis that the Portuguese-flagged vessel was violating Venezuelan territorial waters. After consulting with the company designated person ashore (DPA), ''RCGS Resolute'' announced that the vessel would start engines and resume voyage to Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAt around 01:05 [[Time in Venezuela|local time]], ''Naiguat\u00e1'' approached ''RCGS Resolute'' from the starboard quarter and, after suddenly changing course to port, collided with the bow of the cruise ship at a relative angle of about 45 degrees between the vessels. Few minutes after the initial impact, ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s master ordered the port side [[controllable pitch propeller]] first to zero pitch and then to astern thrust in order to separate the two vessels. The company DPA instructed the cruise ship to remain on site and contact the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). At 01:38, about half an hour after the collision, ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s [[AIS-SART]] was activated but ''RCGS Resolute'' was unable to establish contact with the sinking Venezuelan vessel over VHF and instead reached out to JRCC Cura\u00e7ao. About one hour later, the Venezuelan crew was seen preparing [[liferaft]]s for launching. At 02:43, JRCC Cura\u00e7ao relayed a statement from the Venezuelan authority responsible for the region, MRCC La Guairaa, that ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s assistance was no longer needed on site and instructed the cruise ship to proceed to Willemstad in order to avoid problems with the Venezuelan Navy.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAlthough the Portuguese authorities have not obtained statements from Venezuela, the report discusses the possibility that the unexpected change in ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s heading just before the collision, as reported by ''RCGS Resolute'', may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the bow of the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hapag-Lloyd Cruises}}\n{{1996 shipwrecks}}\n{{1997 shipwrecks}}\n{{2005 shipwrecks}}\n{{2013 shipwrecks}}\n{{2020 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RCGS Resolute}}\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n[[Category:1991 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Rauma, Finland]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1996]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1997]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2005]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2013]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2020]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Cruise ship}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin|display title=''RCGS Resolute''}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image = RCGS Resolute.jpg\n| Ship caption = ''RCGS Resolute'' in [[Aberdeen]] in June 2019\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n| Hide header = \n| Ship name = *''Society Adventurer'' (1991\u20131993)\n*''Hanseatic'' (1993\u20132018)\n*''RCGS Resolute'' (2018\u2013present)\n| Ship owner = * [[Discoverer Reederei]] (planned)<ref name=\"id\" />\n* Society Adventurer Shipping Company (1991\u20131993)<ref name=\"id\" />\n* Bunnys Adventure & Cruise Shipping Co Ltd (1993\u2013present)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship operator = * [[Hanseatic Tours]] (1993\u20131997)\n* [[Hapag-Lloyd Cruises]] (1997\u20132018)\n* [[One Ocean Expeditions]] (2018\u20132019)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship registry = *{{flagicon|Bahamas|civil}} [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], Bahamas (1991\u20132018)\n*{{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Madeira, Portugal]] (2018\u2013present)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship route = \n| Ship ordered = 22 December 1989<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship builder = [[Rauma Yards]] ([[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Finland]])<ref name=\"id\">{{cite|last1=Id|first1=Kalle|last2=Peter|first2=Bruce|title=Innovation and Specialisation \u2014 A History of Shipbuilding in Finland|publisher=Nautilus|year=2017|ISBN=9788790924683|page=}}</ref>\n| Ship original cost = US$75 million<ref name=\"id\" />\n| Ship yard number =306<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship laid down = 3 September 1990<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship launched = 5 January 1991<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship completed = 7 June 1991<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship sponsor=Ursel Klein<ref name=\"maritimereporter\">{{cite web|url=https://magazines.marinelink.com/Magazines/MaritimeReporter/199102/content/launches-luxury-cruise-200306|title=Rauma Yards Launches Luxury Cruise Ship|work=Maritime Reporter and Engineering News|date=February 1991|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship christened = \n| Ship acquired = \n| Ship maiden voyage = 27 March 1993<ref name=\"fof\" />\n| Ship in service = \n| Ship out of service = \n|Ship identification=* [[Maritime call sign|Call sign]]: CQAL6\n* {{IMO Number|9000168}}\n* {{MMSI|255806208}}<ref name=\"equasis\">{{csr|register=E|id=9000168|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n* {{ship register|DNV|G99209}}<ref name=\"dnv\">{{csr|register=DNV|id=G99209|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship status = In service\n| Ship notes = \n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header = \n| Header caption = <ref name=\"dnv\" /><ref name=\"Hapag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurolloyd.com/Hapag-Lloyd/HANSEATIC.pdf|title=MS ''Hanseatic'' Ship details|publisher=Hapag-Lloyd|accessdate=28 February 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| Ship type = [[Cruise ship]]\n| Ship tonnage =* {{GT|8,445}}\n* {{NetT|2,573}}\n* {{DWT|1,177}}\n| Ship displacement = 5,892{{nbsp}}tonnes<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship length = {{convert|124.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship beam = {{convert|18.00|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship height = \n| Ship draught = \n| Ship draft = {{convert|4.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship depth = {{convert|7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship decks = 6\n| Ship deck clearance = \n| Ship ramps = \n| Ship ice class = [[DNV GL]] E4\n| Ship power = 2{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}[[MaK]] 8M453C (2{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}2,940{{nbsp}}kW)<ref name=\"seaweb\">{{csr|register=SEAWEB|id=9000168|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship propulsion = Two shafts; [[controllable pitch propeller]]s\n| Ship speed = {{convert|16|kn}}\n| Ship range= {{convert|8600|nmi}}\n| Ship capacity = 184 passengers in 88 cabins and four suites\n| Ship crew = 125\n| Ship notes = \n}}\n|}\n'''''RCGS Resolute''''' is a [[star (classification)|five-star]] [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] expedition [[cruise ship]] built in 1991 by [[Rauma Yards]] in Finland.

''RCGS Resolute'', which had left Buenos Aires on 5 March,<ref name=\"chronicleherald17march\" /> had been adrift in the open sea for a day while carrying out routine maintenance on the starboard main engine before reaching her next destination, [[Willemstad]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]]. After having questioned her intentions over radio, the Venezuelan Coast Guard vessel ordered ''RCGS Resolute'' to follow her to  [[Puerto Moreno]] on the eastern side of [[Margarita Island]]. While the master was in contact with the company's head office and [[designated person ashore]] (DPA), warning shots were fired from ''Naiguat\u00e1'' and, shortly afterwards, the Venezuelan patrol boat purposely rammed the cruise ship's starboard bow. During an apparent attempt to change the heading of ''RCGS Resolute'' towards Venezuelan territorial waters, ''Naiguat\u00e1'' came in contact with the cruise ship's [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]], started to take water, and eventually sank. ''RCGS Resolute'', which had a crew of 32 onboard but was not carrying passengers, survived the encounter with superficial damage and remained on site for over an hour to provide assistance until being allowed to continue towards Willemstad by Joint [[Rescue Coordination Centre]] (JRCC) Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"ccs_statement\">{{cite  web|url=https://www.columbia-cs.com/statement-on-rcgs-resolute-incident/|title=Statement on RCGS RESOLUTE incident|publisher=Columbia Cruise Services|date=1 April 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Portuguese investigation ====\n{{commonscat|IMO 9000168|RCGS Resolute}}\nOn 6 April, the Office for the Investigation of Maritime Accidents and the Aeronautical Meteorology Authority (Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica; GAMA) of Portugal released a technical investigation report on the incident involving the Portuguese-flagged cruise ship.<ref name=\"gamareport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gama.mm.gov.pt/images/Relatorios_Tecnicos/2020-065_RCGS_RESOLUTE.pdf|title=Relat\u00f3rio de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o T\u00e9cnica / Investigation report|language=Portuguese|publisher=Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica (GAMA)|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the report, ''RCGS Resolute'' had departed Buenos Aires on 5 March and sailed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] along the South American coastline. On 28 March, the vessel had stopped in the open sea to allow the crew to carry out maintenance work in the engine room. After drifting closer to the Venezuelan coast on the following day, ''RCGS Resolute'' had resumed sailing west for about 90 minutes until the ship had passed La Tortuga Island and then continued adrift to a westerly direction while the starboard main engine [[turbocharger]] was being serviced.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nOn the night of 30 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was contacted by the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat ''Naiguat\u00e1'' at around quarter past midnight. After a brief questioning over VHF, the cruise ship was ordered to follow the Venezuelan vessel to Puerto Moreno on the basis that the Portuguese-flagged vessel was violating Venezuelan territorial waters. After consulting with the company designated person ashore (DPA), ''RCGS Resolute'' announced that the vessel would start engines and resume voyage to Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAt around 01:05 [[Time in Venezuela|local time]], ''Naiguat\u00e1'' approached ''RCGS Resolute'' from the starboard quarter and, after suddenly changing course to port, collided with the bow of the cruise ship at a relative angle of about 45 degrees between the vessels. Few minutes after the initial impact, ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s master ordered the port side [[controllable pitch propeller]] first to zero pitch and then to astern thrust in order to separate the two vessels. The company DPA instructed the cruise ship to remain on site and contact the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). At 01:38, about half an hour after the collision, ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s [[AIS-SART]] was activated but ''RCGS Resolute'' was unable to establish contact with the sinking Venezuelan vessel over VHF and instead reached out to JRCC Cura\u00e7ao. About one hour later, the Venezuelan crew was seen preparing [[liferaft]]s for launching. At 02:43, JRCC Cura\u00e7ao relayed a statement from the Venezuelan authority responsible for the region, MRCC La Guairaa, that ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s assistance was no longer needed on site and instructed the cruise ship to proceed to Willemstad in order to avoid problems with the Venezuelan Navy.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAlthough the Portuguese authorities have not obtained statements from Venezuela, the report discusses the possibility that the unexpected change in ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s heading just before the collision, as reported by ''RCGS Resolute'', may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the bow of the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hapag-Lloyd Cruises}}\n{{1996 shipwrecks}}\n{{1997 shipwrecks}}\n{{2005 shipwrecks}}\n{{2013 shipwrecks}}\n{{2020 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RCGS Resolute}}\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n[[Category:1991 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Rauma, Finland]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Merchant ships of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1996]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1997]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2005]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2013]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2020]]\n", "name_user": "GRDN711", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eRCGS Resolute:Left-justifying name of ship.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCGS_Resolute"}

Until the mid-1970s, [[India men's national field hockey team|India men's team]] dominated international field hockey, winning seven Olympic gold medals and won the [[1975 Men's Hockey World Cup]]. Since then, barring a gold medal at the [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]], India's performance in field hockey has been dismal, as [[Australia men's national field hockey team|Australia]], [[Netherlands men's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]] improved. Its decline is also due to the change in rules of the game, introduction of artificial turf, and internal politics in Indian field hockey bodies. The popularity of field hockey has also declined massively parallel to the decline of the Indian hockey team. In recent years, the standard of Indian hockey has deteriorated, with the [[India men's national field hockey team|Men's team]] not qualifying for the [[2008 Olympics]] and finishing last in the [[2012 Olympics]]. Since 2014, the men's team has improved, becoming runners up at the [[Hockey at the 2014 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's tournament|2014 Commonwealth Games]], then winning [[Field hockey at the 2014 Asian Games|2014]] Asian Games gold and [[2017 Men's Hockey Asia Cup]], finally restoring dominance in Asia. Before that India lost to [[Belgium men's national field hockey team|Belgium]] in the quarter final of [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]]. Currently, the Indian men's team is [[FIH World Rankings|5th]] in the rankings of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH, English:[[International Hockey Federation]]), the international governing body of field hockey and indoor field hockey.<ref name=\"Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/rankings/outdoor/|title=Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor|website=fih.ch|access-date=23 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032150/http://www.fih.ch/rankings/outdoor/|archive-date=24 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[India women's national field hockey team|Women's team]] came of age in [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|1980]] when they first participated at the Summer Olympics and achieved the fourth place. The first golden moment for the team was in [[Field hockey at the 1982 Asian Games|1982]] at the Asian Games. Since then not much of happening moments in the team history, though in [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2016]] after 34 years, it is a little hope when Indian women's team qualified for the Summer Olympics and they went on to win the [[2017 Women's Hockey Asia Cup]] claiming the Asian dominance after 2004. India Women's team failed to win any medal in the [[Women's Hockey World Cup]]. The present team is ranked [[FIH World Rankings|10th]] by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey]].<ref name=\"Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor\"/>\n\nIndia has hosted three Men's Hockey World Cups\u2013one in [[1982 Men's Hockey World Cup|1982]] in [[Mumbai]], another in [[2010 Men's Field hockey World Cup|2010]] in Delhi, where they finished fifth and eighth respectively, and the third at Bhubaneswar in [[2018 Men's Hockey World Cup|2018]].

However, following revelations of corruption and other scandals in the IHF, the federation was dissolved and de-recognised, and a new apex body for Indian hockey called [[Hockey India]] (HI) was formed on 20 May 2009, with support from the IOA and former hockey players. HI, recognised by the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), has the sole mandate to govern and conduct all activities for both [[India men's national field hockey team|men's]] and [[India women's national Field hockey team|women's]] field hockey in India.

However, it is not approved by HI or the FIH.\n\nHI also conducts a franchise-based tournament called the [[Hockey India League]] (HIL). Its first season was in [[2013 Hockey India League|2013]] and is inspired from the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI's) highly successful Indian Premier League.

The sport of wrestling began its journey in India several centuries ago, during the [[Middle Ages]]. Wrestling is among the most prestigious and oldest events in the [[Olympic Games]]. It was included in the Olympics in 708 BC. In ancient times, wrestling in India was mainly used as a way to stay physically fit. It was also used as a [[military exercise]] without any weapons. Wrestling in India is also known as ''dangal,'' and it is the basic form of a wrestling tournament.\n\nIn India, wrestling is mostly known as ''Malla-Yuddha''. Wrestling was mentioned in ancient times, found in the [[Sanskrit]] epic of [[Indian history]], ''[[Mahabharata]]''. One of the premier characters in Mahabharata, [[Bhima]], was considered a great wrestler. Other great wrestlers included [[Jarasandha]], [[Duryodhana]], and [[Karna]]. Another Indian epic, [[Ramayana]], also mentions wrestling in India, describing [[Hanuman]] as one of the greatest wrestlers of that time. The 13th-century ''[[Malla Purana]]'' references a group of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Brahmin]] wrestlers known as [[Jyesthimalla]]s.\n\n=== Weightlifting and powerlifting ===\n{{Main|Weightlifting in India}}\n[[Karnam Malleswari]] won a [[bronze medal]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, making her the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2054437,00.html| author=Time| title='I Did What I Could for My Country'| date=27 December 2000| access-date=14 September 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118051127/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2054437,00.html| archive-date=18 November 2011| url-status=live}}</ref> The headquarters of the Indian [[Olympic weightlifting|Weightlifting]] Federation is in New Delhi.

The International Weightlifting Federation banned the Indian Weightlifting Federation from participating in all international competitions for one year when three Indian women weightlifters were accused of [[Doping in sport|doping]] offences in various international competitions in a single year.\n\n=== Archery ===\n{{Main|Archery in India}}\n\nThe game of [[archery]] has historical significance, as royals in the ancient days used to practice archery. Modern-day archery in India began in the early 1970s, before its introduction as an Olympic event in 1972, and it was formalised in 1973 when the [[Archery Association of India]] (AAI) came into existence. Since its inception, AAI has been promoting an organisation for the sport.

Some Indian sporting clubs are beginning to embrace the game, and it is the second-most popular winter sport after football in India,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} which itself trails in popularity after cricket and field hockey.\n\n=== Cycling ===\n{{Main|Cycling in India}}\n{{See also|Cycling Federation of India}}\nThe history of cycling in India dates back to 1938, and the [[Cycling Federation of India]] governs the sport. Though cycling is unknown as a professional sport in India, it is popular as a common recreational sport and a way to keep fit.\n\n;Mountain biking\n\n[[Mountain biking]] is becoming a popular sport in India. For the last six years, [[Mtb himachal]], a hardcore endurance event, has been organised regularly by Himalayan Adventure Sports & Tourism Promotion Association (HASTPA), a non-governmental organisation (NGO). A number of national and international riders participate, including Indian Army, [[Indian Air Force]], [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP), and a number of young and energetic mountain biking individual riders from cities including [[Pune]], Bangalore, Delhi and [[Chandigarh]]. Last year{{when|date=July 2013}}, the government of [[Sikkim]] (Department of Tourism) introduced its own mountain biking race, with Southeast Asia's biggest prize money.

The community soon got together, chalked out plans, figured out a route and realised they would need a framework to support such a large group of people, got sponsors on board to mitigate costs as well as popularise the Tour and the Cause of popularising Cycling as a viable and sustainable means of travel. Ever since its first edition, the TfN has stayed true to the Community of Cyclists in India by being a Tour for the Community, Of the Community and By the Community. It has grown in size, stature and visibility. From 40 riders in the first edition, it has grown to 100 cyclists in 2013.\n\nThe tour has grown bigger and the routes tougher, allowing cyclists to test their endurance, enjoy the biodiversity of the Nilgiris covering the southern states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. For the racing aficionados, there are racing segments on the tour with colour coded jerseys, recognition and prizes. TfN as it is lovingly called is pushing cycling to new frontiers with more and more interested cyclists, applying for the tour. The tour has acquired quite a name, and currently about 25% of registrations are selected for the tour by the organisers.\n\n=== Equestrian sports ===\n{{Main|Equestrian sport in India}}\nIndia has a wide following in various [[equestrian sports]], including [[show jumping]], [[eventing]], [[dressage]], [[endurance riding]] and [[tent pegging]]. Supported by the Equestrian Federation of India, eventing is the most popular of the five, with teams representing the country at most [[Asian Games]], winning a bronze medal in the 2002 and 2006 games. India has been represented at the Olympics twice, by Wing Commander I.J. Lamba, and Imtiaz Anees.\n\n===Kayaking===\n{{Main|Kayaking in India}}\n\n;Flat water and sea kayaking\nIndian flat water [[kayak]]ers are an emerging powerhouse on the Asian circuit. Outside of professional flat water [[kayaking]], there is very limited recreational kayaking. The potential to generate interest in flat water kayaking is held by leisure [[resort]]s located near the sea or other water bodies. Indian tourists tend to consider kayaking a one-time activity, rather than a sport to be pursued.\n\n;Whitewater kayaking\nEnthusiasts of [[whitewater]] kayaking are concentrated in the north towards the [[Himalayas]], with some in the south in Bangalore in [[Karnataka]]. Most of these enthusiasts are or were whitewater raft guides who took to the sport of whitewater kayaking. Some of the prominent whitewater kayakers include Abhinav Kala, Shalabh Gahlaut, and John Pollard. Many of them have notched first descents (similar to climbing ascents) on rivers in India and Nepal.\n\n\"Bangalore Kayakers\" or \"Southern River Runners\" are India's first amateur group of white water kayakers. Based out of Bangalore, they explore rivers around [[Western Ghats]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=149952787372&ref=ts |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317213745/https://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=149952787372&ref=ts |archive-date=17 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The lure for most of these participants is adventure. Whitewater kayaking in India allows for exploration of places where, literally, no human has been before.\n\nGear availability is a problem that plagues kayakers.

Until the mid-1970s, [[India men's national field hockey team|India men's team]] dominated international field hockey, winning seven Olympic gold medals and won the [[1975 Men's Hockey World Cup]]. Since then, barring a gold medal at the [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]], India's performance in field hockey has been dismal, as [[Australia men's national field hockey team|Australia]], [[Netherlands men's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]] improved. Its decline is also due to the change in rules of the game, introduction of artificial turf, and internal politics in Indian field hockey bodies. The popularity of field hockey has also declined massively parallel to the decline of the Indian hockey team. In recent years, the standard of Indian hockey has deteriorated, with the [[India men's national field hockey team|Men's team]] not qualifying for the [[2008 Olympics]] and finishing last in the [[2012 Olympics]]. Since 2014, the men's team has improved, becoming runners up at the [[Hockey at the 2014 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's tournament|2014 Commonwealth Games]], then winning [[Field hockey at the 2014 Asian Games|2014]] Asian Games gold and [[2017 Men's Hockey Asia Cup]], finally restoring dominance in Asia. Before that India lost to [[Belgium men's national field hockey team|Belgium]] in the quarter final of [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]]. Currently, the Indian men's team is [[FIH World Rankings|5th]] in the rankings of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH, English:[[International Hockey Federation]]), the international governing body of field hockey and indoor field hockey.<ref name=\"Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/rankings/outdoor/|title=Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor|website=fih.ch|access-date=23 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032150/http://www.fih.ch/rankings/outdoor/|archive-date=24 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[India women's national field hockey team|Women's team]] came of age in [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|1980]] when they first participated at the Summer Olympics and achieved the fourth place. The first golden moment for the team was in [[Field hockey at the 1982 Asian Games|1982]] at the Asian Games. Since then not much of happening moments in the team history, though in [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2016]] after 34 years, it is a little hope when Indian women's team qualified for the Summer Olympics and they went on to win the [[2017 Women's Hockey Asia Cup]] claiming the Asian dominance after 2004. India Women's team failed to win any medal in the [[Women's Hockey World Cup]]. The present team is ranked [[FIH World Rankings|10th]] by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey]].<ref name=\"Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor\"/>\n\nIndia has hosted three Men's Hockey World Cups\u2013one in [[1982 Men's Hockey World Cup|1982]] in [[Mumbai]], another in [[2010 Men's Field hockey World Cup|2010]] in Delhi, where they finished fifth and eighth respectively, and the third at Bhubaneswar in [[2018 Men's Hockey World Cup|2018]]. India also hosted the annual [[Hockey Champions Trophy]] in 1996, 2005 2014 and 2016 Until 2008, the [[Indian Hockey Federation]] (IHF) was the apex body for hockey in the country. However, following revelations of corruption and other scandals in the IHF, the federation was dissolved and de-recognised, and a new apex body for Indian hockey called [[Hockey India]] (HI) was formed on 20 May 2009, with support from the IOA and former hockey players. HI, recognised by the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), has the sole mandate to govern and conduct all activities for both [[India men's national field hockey team|men's]] and [[India women's national Field hockey team|women's]] field hockey in India. Although the IHF was reinstated in 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breakingnewsonline.net/sports/2154-kps-gill-and-ihf-reinstated-by-delhi-high-court.html |title=KPS Gill and IHF reinstated by Delhi High Court |publisher=Breakingnewsonline.net |date=22 May 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509174210/http://www.breakingnewsonline.net/sports/2154-kps-gill-and-ihf-reinstated-by-delhi-high-court.html |archive-date=9 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> it is not recognised by the FIH. The IHF conducts a franchise-based tournament called [[World Series Hockey]] (WSH), with its first season conducted in [[2012 World Series Hockey|2012]]. However, it is not approved by HI or the FIH.\n\nHI also conducts a franchise-based tournament called the [[Hockey India League]] (HIL).

Lamba, and Imtiaz Anees.\n\n===Kayaking===\n{{Main|Kayaking in India}}\n\n;Flat water and sea kayaking\nIndian flat water [[kayak]]ers are an emerging powerhouse on the Asian circuit. Outside of professional flat water [[kayaking]], there is very limited recreational kayaking. The potential to generate interest in flat water kayaking is held by leisure [[resort]]s located near the sea or other water bodies. Indian tourists tend to consider kayaking a one-time activity, rather than a sport to be pursued.\n\n;Whitewater kayaking\nEnthusiasts of [[whitewater]] kayaking are concentrated in the north towards the [[Himalayas]], with some in the south in Bangalore in [[Karnataka]]. Most of these enthusiasts are or were whitewater raft guides who took to the sport of whitewater kayaking. Some of the prominent whitewater kayakers include Abhinav Kala, Shalabh Gahlaut, and John Pollard. Many of them have notched first descents (similar to climbing ascents) on rivers in India and Nepal.\n\n\"Bangalore Kayakers\" or \"Southern River Runners\" are India's first amateur group of white water kayakers. Based out of Bangalore, they explore rivers around [[Western Ghats]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=149952787372&ref=ts |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317213745/https://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=149952787372&ref=ts |archive-date=17 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The lure for most of these participants is adventure. Whitewater kayaking in India allows for exploration of places where, literally, no human has been before.\n\nGear availability is a problem that plagues kayakers. While the global designs for whitewater boats and paddles change annually, Indian kayakers have to pay high fees if they want to import any kind of gear, or they have to buy used gear in Nepal. More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp, Piroutte or Dancer designs, while the kayakers from abroad ride the river in their new design, planing hull, centred-volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha, or Wave Sport.\n\nKayaking India groups on Facebook are good resources for kayakers in India.\n\n=== Athletics: Track, Field and Road ===\n{{Main|Athletics in India}}\n[[File:The President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee presenting the Arjuna Award for the year-2016 to Ms. Lalita Babar for Athletics, in a glittering ceremony, at Rashtrapati Bhavan, in New Delhi on August 29, 2016.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Lalita Babar]], an Indian long-distance runner, was honoured with [[Arjuna Award]] in 2016.]]\nIndia is unfortunately not affluent in the field of athletics and track events.

The largest individual pan is about {{convert|1900|sqmi|km2|1|abbr=on}}. In comparison, [[Salar de Uyuni]] in [[Bolivia]] is a single salt flat of {{convert|4100|sqmi|km2|1|abbr=on}}, rarely has much water, and is generally claimed to be the world's largest salt pan. A dry, salty, clay crust most of the year, the pans are seasonally covered with water and grass, and are then a refuge for birds and animals in this very arid part of the world. The climate is hot and dry, but with regular annual rains. \n \nThe main water source is the [[Nata River]], called'' Amanzanyama'' in [[Zimbabwe]], where it rises at [[Sandown, Botswana|Sandown]] about {{convert|37|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} from [[Bulawayo]]. A smaller amount of water is supplied by the [[Boteti River]] from the Okavango Delta. \n\nThese salt pans cover {{convert|6200|sqmi|km2|1|abbr=on}} in the [[Kalahari Basin]] and form the bed of the ancient Lake Makgadikgadi, which evaporated many millennia ago. [[Archaeological]] recovery in the Makgadikgadi Pan has revealed the presence of prehistoric man through abundant finds of stone tools; some of these tools have been dated sufficiently early to establish their origin as earlier than the era of ''Homo sapiens''.<ref>C.

The wet season also brings migratory birds such as ducks, geese and [[great white pelican]]s. The pan is home of one of only two breeding populations of [[greater flamingo]]s in southern Africa, and only on the Soa pan, which is part of the Makgadikgadi pans. The other breeding population is at Etosha, in the Northern part of Namibia.

Modern commercial operations to extract [[salt]] and [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] began on Sua Pan in 1991, and there are also plans to divert water from the [[Nata River]] for irrigation, which would cause severe damage to the salt pan ecosystem. Another threat is the use of quad bikes and off-road vehicles by tourists, which disturbs breeding colonies of flamingos.

The Makgadikgadi Pans Game Reserve is the scene of large migrations of zebra and wildebeest from the Boteti River across to Nwetwe Pan, while the Nata Sanctuary in Sua Pan is a place to see birdlife and antelopes.

Vinovich would then serve as a replay official from 2007 to 2011. He would later be given a clean bill of health and return to the field as a referee in 2012.\n\n==Television==\n{{Details|NFL on television}}\nThe 2007 season marked the second year of the current television contracts with NBC, CBS, Fox, ESPN, and the NFL Network. The pre-game shows made some changes, with former Steelers coach [[Bill Cowher]] joining host [[James Brown (TV personality)|James Brown]], [[Boomer Esiason]], [[Shannon Sharpe]] and [[Dan Marino]] on CBS\u2019 ''[[The NFL Today]]''. On Fox, after one season on the road, ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' returned to Los Angeles as [[Curt Menefee]] took over as full-time host. [[Chris Rose]], who had been doing in-game updates of other NFL games, was reverted to a part-time play-by-play role.\n\n[[File:2007AFCC1.jpg|thumb|300px|New England takes on San Diego in the AFC Championship Game]]\n\nThe biggest changes were at NBC and ESPN. [[Michael Irvin]]\u2019s contract with ESPN was not renewed, and former coach [[Bill Parcells]] returned to the network after four years as Cowboys head coach. Parcells left before the season ended to become [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|the Miami Dolphins]] VP of Player Personnel. Another pair of former Cowboys, [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Keyshawn Johnson]] also provided roles in the studio for ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' and ''[[Monday Night Countdown]]''. At ''Monday Night Football'', [[Joe Theismann]] was dropped (and would later resign from the network) after seventeen years in the booth between the Sunday and Monday Night packages, and former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback and current [[Philadelphia Soul]] ([[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|AFL]]) president [[Ron Jaworski]] took his place alongside [[Mike Tirico]] and [[Tony Kornheiser]]. Part of the reason that Jaworski replaced Theismann was because of his chemistry with Kornheiser on ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'', where Jaworski was a frequent guest during the football season.\n\nNBC\u2019s ''[[Football Night in America]]'' also made two changes. [[MSNBC]] ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann|Countdown]]'' anchor [[Keith Olbermann]] joined [[Bob Costas]] and [[Cris Collinsworth]] as another co-host, while [[Sterling Sharpe]] exited as a studio analyst, and former [[New York Giants]] running back [[Tiki Barber]] replaced him. In another change, [[Faith Hill]] took over singing \u201cWaiting All Day For Sunday Night\u201d for [[Pink (singer)|Pink]].\n\nIn the second year of the NFL Network's \u201c''[[Run to the Playoffs]]''\u201d, [[Marshall Faulk]] and [[Deion Sanders]] replaced [[Dick Vermeil]] for two games when Collinsworth was unavailable. An unforced change saw [[Bryant Gumbel]] miss the Broncos\u2013Texans game December 13 due to a sore throat and NBC announcer [[Tom Hammond]] step into Gumbel's play-by-play role in what turned out to be more or less a preview of one of NBC's Wild Card Game announcing teams.\n\n===Controversy surrounding NFL Network coverage===\n{{see also|NFL Network#Distribution controversy|2007 New England Patriots-New York Giants game}}\nThe dispute between the NFL Network and various cable companies involving the distribution of the cable channel continued throughout the season, getting the attention of government officials when the NFL Network was scheduled to televise two high-profile regular season games: the Packers-Cowboys game on November 29 and the Patriots-Giants game on December 29. In the case of the Packers-Cowboys game, the carriage was so limited that even [[Governor of Wisconsin]] [[Jim Doyle]] went to his brother's house to watch the game on satellite (which is where the majority of the viewers watch the network). The contest drew a network record 10.1 million viewers, a high-water mark at that time.\n\nSome politicians urged the league to seek a resolution to conflict. In December, [[Massachusetts]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]] wrote a letter to NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] asking for the league to settle their differences in time for the Patriots-Giants game. Because the game, as it turned out, would be the Patriots' attempt to seal the record that would make them the first undefeated team in 35 years, Kerry urged for a solution to be decided upon in time so that Americans can witness \"an historic event.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/kerry_presses_t.html |work=The Boston Globe |first=Mike |last=Reiss |title=Kerry presses on NFL Network |date=December 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810174649/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/kerry_presses_t.html |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Also, [[Pennsylvania]] Senator [[Arlen Specter]] threatened to introduce legislation to eliminate the league's freedom from [[antitrust laws]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/07/AR2006120701608.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Specter Wants to Revisit NFL\u2019s Antitrust Status |date=December 8, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105131715/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/07/AR2006120701608.html |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn December 26, the NFL announced that, despite initial plans to broadcast the game only on the NFL Network, the game would be presented in a three-network simulcast with both CBS and NBC, the first time an NFL game would be broadcast on three networks, and the first simulcast of any pro football game since [[Super Bowl I]].<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80579400&template=with-video&confirm=true Patriots' historic game to be available to all of America, after all] NFL.com.

The franchise moved to the new [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in time for the 2008 season, located directly across the street. The dome would be demolished, and an extension to the [[Indiana Convention Center]] would replace the stadium.\n\nAlltel Stadium reverts back to [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium]] after [[Alltel]] declines to renew the naming rights of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]'s home.\n\n==Coaching changes==\nThe following teams hired new head coaches prior to the start of the 2007 season:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An updated version first seen on August 31 in ''[[USA Today]]'' was put into use starting with the [[2008 NFL Draft]] in April.<ref name=NFL_SHIELD_USAT>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-08-30-shield-change_N.htm |title=NFL to revamp shield with redesigned logo |work=USA Today |first=Michael |last=McCarthy |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822015141/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-08-30-shield-change_N.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> The new logo design features eight stars (one for each division) instead of the current 25 stars, the football now resembles that on the top of the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], given to the [[Super Bowl]] champion and the lettering and point has been updated and modified to that of the league's current typeface for other logos.\n* Teams that have permanent captains are allowed to wear a \"C\" patch (similar to those in [[ice hockey]]) on their right shoulder. The patch is in team colors with four stars under the \"C.\" A gold star is placed on a bar below the \"C\" signaling how many years (with a maximum of four years) that player has been captain. The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]\u2014who were using up two patches as it was for the season with their own logo (which was already part of the standard uniforms) and the team's 75th anniversary logo\u2014and [[Oakland Raiders]] elected not to use the \"C\" patch.\n* San Francisco 49ers coach [[Mike Nolan]] and Jaguars coach [[Jack Del Rio]] each wore suits on the sidelines for all of the teams' home games to honor Nolan's father, former 49ers and Saints coach [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]]. In 2006, both coaches were allowed to wear a suit on the sidelines for a maximum of two home games. Del Rio did not wear a suit in the September 16 game against the Falcons due to the extreme heat in Jacksonville that day. Nolan wore a suit at the Meadowlands against the Giants on October 21.\n* The Washington Redskins celebrated their 75th anniversary season (the franchise having been founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves), and wore [[Vince Lombardi]]-styled uniforms against the New York Giants on September 23. The Philadelphia Eagles and their cross-state rival Pittsburgh Steelers also celebrated their respective 75th seasons, having been founded in 1933. The Eagles wore replicas of their inaugural season uniforms against the Detroit Lions on September 23, while the Steelers wore 1960 uniforms against the Buffalo Bills on September 16 and did so again when the Baltimore Ravens visited on November 5.\n* Throwback uniforms were not just limited to team anniversary celebrations. The Cleveland Browns wore their 1957 throwbacks in a game against the Houston Texans on November 25, the Minnesota Vikings wore 1970s uniforms against the Green Bay Packers on September 30 (in the same game that [[Brett Favre]] passed [[Dan Marino]] for most touchdown passes in NFL history), while the Jets honored their historic predecessors on October 14 against the Eagles and, in a rare instance, wore them in a road game at Miami December 2 by wearing the New York Titans' 1960 through 1962 uniforms. The team did not become the Jets until 1963. The Cowboys wore their 1960 uniforms on November 29 against the Packers, and the Bills wore their 1960s throwbacks at home against Dallas October 7 and against Miami December 9.\n* The 49ers also honored the late Bill Walsh, coach of their wins in [[Super Bowl XVI|Super Bowls XVI]], [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], and [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] by wearing throwback uniforms from the 1980s in their opener on September 10 against the Arizona Cardinals. Mike Nolan had been considering wearing the 1980s uniforms for the entire season to honor Walsh's memory. The retro uniforms were worn again on November 18 against the Seahawks. In addition, all season long, the team wore a black football-shaped decal on their helmets with the initials \"BW\" in white.\n* The Kansas City Chiefs honored their late former owner and team founder [[Lamar Hunt]] by wearing special [[American Football League]] logo patches on their jerseys with the letters \"LH\" emblazoned inside the logo's football. Originally meant to be a one-season tribute, the Chiefs announced that as of the [[2008 NFL season]], the patch will be a permanent fixture on the jerseys, joining the Chicago Bears (for [[George Halas]]) and Cleveland Browns (for [[Al Lerner]]) for such memorial patches.\n\n==Schedule==\n===Preseason===\nThe [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Game]] was played in [[Canton, Ohio]] on Sunday August 5, 2007, with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] defeating the [[New Orleans Saints|Saints]] by a score of 20\u20137;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07218/807333-66.stm |title=Steelers start strong in 20\u20137 victory |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 28, 2008 |first=Ed |last=Bouchette |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522074422/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07218/807333-66.stm |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> the game was televised by the NFL Network, replacing NBC, who had been previously scheduled to broadcast the [[China Bowl (NFL)|China Bowl]] exhibition game from [[Beijing, China]] on August 8, 2007 between the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] at [[Workers Stadium]].

In addition to the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|traditional games]] hosted by the [[Detroit Lions]] and Cowboys (with those teams respectively playing the [[Green Bay Packers]] and the [[New York Jets]], with the Packers\u2013Lions game starting at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. US EST and the Jets\u2013Cowboys game kicking off at 4:15&nbsp;p.m. US EST respectively), the Colts faced the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[Georgia Dome]], with kickoff at 8:15&nbsp;p.m. US EST.\n\n==Schedule formula==\nBased on the [[Regular Season (NFL)#Formula|NFL's scheduling formula]], the intraconference and interconference matchups for 2007 were:<ref name=\"matchups\">{{cite book | title=2006 NFL Record and Fact Book | isbn=978-1-933405-32-2 | page=[https://archive.org/details/2006nflrecordfac00edit/page/16 16] | url=https://archive.org/details/2006nflrecordfac00edit/page/16 }}</ref>\n\n{{col-float|width=48%}}\n'''Intraconference'''\n* [[AFC East]] vs. [[AFC North]]\n* [[AFC West]] vs. [[AFC South]]\n* [[NFC East]] vs. [[NFC North]]\n* [[NFC West]] vs. [[NFC South]]\n{{col-float-break|width=48%}}\n'''Interconference'''\n* [[AFC East]] vs. [[NFC East]]\n* [[AFC North]] vs. [[NFC West]]\n* [[AFC South]] vs. [[NFC South]]\n* [[AFC West]] vs. [[NFC North]]\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n===Flex scheduling===\nThe NFL entered its second year of flexible scheduling in the final weeks of the season.

more than fifty arrests by local law enforcement since the start of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]]. The hardest hit came on April 10 when [[Pacman Jones|Adam \"Pacman\" Jones]] of the [[Tennessee Titans]] was suspended for the entire season for his five arrests, the most blatant while in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Weekend]] in February where he was accused of causing a riot/shooting in a strip club. That same day, [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]] of the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] was suspended for the first eight games of the season for his run-ins with the legal system. The other big name that has been caught in the web of controversy was Falcons' quarterback [[Michael Vick]]. Vick was charged on July 24, 2007 with [[Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation|dogfighting and animal abuse]], and was suspended following a guilty plea in the case, on which he was sentenced to 23 months in prison (retroactive to November) and three years probation on December 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d801c1644&template=with-video&confirm=true |title=Vick suspended indefinitely after filing plea |date=August 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121200813/http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d801c1644&template=with-video&confirm=true |archivedate=January 21, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Death of Marquise Hill===\nOn the evening of May 27, 2007, [[Marquise Hill]], a defensive end for the [[New England Patriots]] and a friend fell off a [[jet ski]] in [[Lake Pontchartrain]], north of New Orleans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=1004553 |title=Hero told friend: \u2018Be calm, Don\u2019t panic\u2019 |date=June 3, 2007 |publisher=Boston Herald |accessdate=February 9, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The two were wearing neither [[personal flotation device|personal flotation]] nor [[tracking device]]s.

The pre-game shows made some changes, with former Steelers coach [[Bill Cowher]] joining host [[James Brown (TV personality)|James Brown]], [[Boomer Esiason]], [[Shannon Sharpe]] and [[Dan Marino]] on CBS\u2019 ''[[The NFL Today]]''. On Fox, after one season on the road, ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' returned to Los Angeles as [[Curt Menefee]] took over as full-time host. [[Chris Rose]], who had been doing in-game updates of other NFL games, was reverted to a part-time play-by-play role.\n\n[[File:2007AFCC1.jpg|thumb|300px|New England takes on San Diego in the AFC Championship Game]]\n\nThe biggest changes were at NBC and ESPN. [[Michael Irvin]]\u2019s contract with ESPN was not renewed, and former coach [[Bill Parcells]] returned to the network after four years as Cowboys head coach. Parcells left before the season ended to become [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|the Miami Dolphins]] VP of Player Personnel. Another pair of former Cowboys, [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Keyshawn Johnson]] also provided roles in the studio for ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' and ''[[Monday Night Countdown]]''. At ''Monday Night Football'', [[Joe Theismann]] was dropped (and would later resign from the network) after seventeen years in the booth between the Sunday and Monday Night packages, and former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback and current [[Philadelphia Soul]] ([[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|AFL]]) president [[Ron Jaworski]] took his place alongside [[Mike Tirico]] and [[Tony Kornheiser]]. Part of the reason that Jaworski replaced Theismann was because of his chemistry with Kornheiser on ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'', where Jaworski was a frequent guest during the football season.\n\nNBC\u2019s ''[[Football Night in America]]'' also made two changes. [[MSNBC]] ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann|Countdown]]'' anchor [[Keith Olbermann]] joined [[Bob Costas]] and [[Cris Collinsworth]] as another co-host, while [[Sterling Sharpe]] exited as a studio analyst, and former [[New York Giants]] running back [[Tiki Barber]] replaced him. In another change, [[Faith Hill]] took over singing \u201cWaiting All Day For Sunday Night\u201d for [[Pink (singer)|Pink]].\n\nIn the second year of the NFL Network's \u201c''[[Run to the Playoffs]]''\u201d, [[Marshall Faulk]] and [[Deion Sanders]] replaced [[Dick Vermeil]] for two games when Collinsworth was unavailable. An unforced change saw [[Bryant Gumbel]] miss the Broncos\u2013Texans game December 13 due to a sore throat and NBC announcer [[Tom Hammond]] step into Gumbel's play-by-play role in what turned out to be more or less a preview of one of NBC's Wild Card Game announcing teams.\n\n===Controversy surrounding NFL Network coverage===\n{{see also|NFL Network#Distribution controversy|2007 New England Patriots-New York Giants game}}\nThe dispute between the NFL Network and various cable companies involving the distribution of the cable channel continued throughout the season, getting the attention of government officials when the NFL Network was scheduled to televise two high-profile regular season games: the Packers-Cowboys game on November 29 and the Patriots-Giants game on December 29. In the case of the Packers-Cowboys game, the carriage was so limited that even [[Governor of Wisconsin]] [[Jim Doyle]] went to his brother's house to watch the game on satellite (which is where the majority of the viewers watch the network). The contest drew a network record 10.1 million viewers, a high-water mark at that time.\n\nSome politicians urged the league to seek a resolution to conflict. In December, [[Massachusetts]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]] wrote a letter to NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] asking for the league to settle their differences in time for the Patriots-Giants game. Because the game, as it turned out, would be the Patriots' attempt to seal the record that would make them the first undefeated team in 35 years, Kerry urged for a solution to be decided upon in time so that Americans can witness \"an historic event.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/kerry_presses_t.html |work=The Boston Globe |first=Mike |last=Reiss |title=Kerry presses on NFL Network |date=December 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810174649/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/kerry_presses_t.html |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Also, [[Pennsylvania]] Senator [[Arlen Specter]] threatened to introduce legislation to eliminate the league's freedom from [[antitrust laws]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/07/AR2006120701608.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Specter Wants to Revisit NFL\u2019s Antitrust Status |date=December 8, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105131715/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/07/AR2006120701608.html |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn December 26, the NFL announced that, despite initial plans to broadcast the game only on the NFL Network, the game would be presented in a three-network simulcast with both CBS and NBC, the first time an NFL game would be broadcast on three networks, and the first simulcast of any pro football game since [[Super Bowl I]].<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80579400&template=with-video&confirm=true Patriots' historic game to be available to all of America, after all] NFL.com.

An updated version first seen on August 31 in ''[[USA Today]]'' was put into use starting with the [[2008 NFL Draft]] in April.<ref name=NFL_SHIELD_USAT>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-08-30-shield-change_N.htm |title=NFL to revamp shield with redesigned logo |work=USA Today |first=Michael |last=McCarthy |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822015141/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-08-30-shield-change_N.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> The new logo design features eight stars (one for each division) instead of the current 25 stars, the football now resembles that on the top of the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], given to the [[Super Bowl]] champion and the lettering and point has been updated and modified to that of the league's current typeface for other logos.\n* Teams that have permanent captains are allowed to wear a \"C\" patch (similar to those in [[ice hockey]]) on their right shoulder. The patch is in team colors with four stars under the \"C.\" A gold star is placed on a bar below the \"C\" signaling how many years (with a maximum of four years) that player has been captain. The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]\u2014who were using up two patches as it was for the season with their own logo (which was already part of the standard uniforms) and the team's 75th anniversary logo\u2014and [[Oakland Raiders]] elected not to use the \"C\" patch.\n* San Francisco 49ers coach [[Mike Nolan]] and Jaguars coach [[Jack Del Rio]] each wore suits on the sidelines for all of the teams' home games to honor Nolan's father, former 49ers and Saints coach [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]]. In 2006, both coaches were allowed to wear a suit on the sidelines for a maximum of two home games. Del Rio did not wear a suit in the September 16 game against the Falcons due to the extreme heat in Jacksonville that day. Nolan wore a suit at the Meadowlands against the Giants on October 21.\n* The Washington Redskins celebrated their 75th anniversary season (the franchise having been founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves), and wore [[Vince Lombardi]]-styled uniforms against the New York Giants on September 23. The Philadelphia Eagles and their cross-state rival Pittsburgh Steelers also celebrated their respective 75th seasons, having been founded in 1933. The Eagles wore replicas of their inaugural season uniforms against the Detroit Lions on September 23, while the Steelers wore 1960 uniforms against the Buffalo Bills on September 16 and did so again when the Baltimore Ravens visited on November 5.\n* Throwback uniforms were not just limited to team anniversary celebrations. The Cleveland Browns wore their 1957 throwbacks in a game against the Houston Texans on November 25, the Minnesota Vikings wore 1970s uniforms against the Green Bay Packers on September 30 (in the same game that [[Brett Favre]] passed [[Dan Marino]] for most touchdown passes in NFL history), while the Jets honored their historic predecessors on October 14 against the Eagles and, in a rare instance, wore them in a road game at Miami December 2 by wearing the New York Titans' 1960 through 1962 uniforms. The team did not become the Jets until 1963. The Cowboys wore their 1960 uniforms on November 29 against the Packers, and the Bills wore their 1960s throwbacks at home against Dallas October 7 and against Miami December 9.\n* The 49ers also honored the late Bill Walsh, coach of their wins in [[Super Bowl XVI|Super Bowls XVI]], [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], and [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] by wearing throwback uniforms from the 1980s in their opener on September 10 against the Arizona Cardinals. Mike Nolan had been considering wearing the 1980s uniforms for the entire season to honor Walsh's memory. The retro uniforms were worn again on November 18 against the Seahawks. In addition, all season long, the team wore a black football-shaped decal on their helmets with the initials \"BW\" in white.\n* The Kansas City Chiefs honored their late former owner and team founder [[Lamar Hunt]] by wearing special [[American Football League]] logo patches on their jerseys with the letters \"LH\" emblazoned inside the logo's football. Originally meant to be a one-season tribute, the Chiefs announced that as of the [[2008 NFL season]], the patch will be a permanent fixture on the jerseys, joining the Chicago Bears (for [[George Halas]]) and Cleveland Browns (for [[Al Lerner]]) for such memorial patches.\n\n==Schedule==\n===Preseason===\nThe [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Game]] was played in [[Canton, Ohio]] on Sunday August 5, 2007, with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] defeating the [[New Orleans Saints|Saints]] by a score of 20\u20137;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07218/807333-66.stm |title=Steelers start strong in 20\u20137 victory |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 28, 2008 |first=Ed |last=Bouchette |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522074422/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07218/807333-66.stm |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> the game was televised by the NFL Network, replacing NBC, who had been previously scheduled to broadcast the [[China Bowl (NFL)|China Bowl]] exhibition game from [[Beijing, China]] on August 8, 2007 between the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] at [[Workers Stadium]].

Founded on 1 June 1977, as a result of a split up with RKSV (founded 1920).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fcvolendam.nl/clubinfo/historie/ |title=FC Volendam official website |language=nl |access-date=2010-03-22 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/669Wo3U53?url=http://www.fcvolendam.nl/clubinfo/historie/ |archive-date=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It currently plays in the ''[[Eerste Divisie]]'', holding home games at [[Kras Stadion]], with a 6,984-seat capacity.\n\n==History==\n''Football Club Volendam'' was founded as ''Victoria'' on 1 June 1920 by local fishermen. By 1923, the club had already been renamed to its most famous denomination. In 1977 RKSV Volendam split up in RKSV (non-pro) en FC Volendam (pro), this situation is still actual today.\n\nBeing from the piously catholic village of [[Volendam]], the club quickly joined the Catholic Football Association of the Netherlands. In 1935 and 1938, Volendam won that competition and, in the [[World War II|Second World War]], was forced by the nazis to join the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]]. In 1955, the club joined the professional football league, soon establishing its reputation as the ''Heen-en-weer club'' (the back-and-forth club) due to the many times the club was promoted and relegated throughout its history.\n\nThroughout the years, Volendam spawned many talented players, such as [[Wim Jonk]], [[Edwin Zoetebier]], [[Arnold M\u00fchren|Arnold]] and [[Gerrie M\u00fchren]]. The club also has an accomplished scouting and youth system, which spreads across many different countries.\n\n==Honours==\n* '''[[Eerste Divisie]]'''\n**Winners: [[Eerste Divisie

based in [[Volendam]], [[Netherlands]]. Founded on 1 June 1977, as a result of a split up with RKSV (founded 1920).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fcvolendam.nl/clubinfo/historie/ |title=FC Volendam official website |language=nl |access-date=2010-03-22 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/669Wo3U53?url=http://www.fcvolendam.nl/clubinfo/historie/ |archive-date=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It currently plays in the ''[[Eerste Divisie]]'', holding home games at [[Kras Stadion]], with a 6,984-seat capacity.\n\n==History==\n''Football Club Volendam'' was founded as ''Victoria'' on 1 June 1920 by local fishermen. By 1923, the club had already been renamed to its most famous denomination. In 1977 RKSV Volendam split up in RKSV (non-pro) en FC Volendam (pro), this situation is still actual today.\n\nBeing from the piously catholic village of [[Volendam]], the club quickly joined the Catholic Football Association of the Netherlands. In 1935 and 1938, Volendam won that competition and, in the [[World War II|Second World War]], was forced by the nazis to join the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]]. In 1955, the club joined the professional football league, soon establishing its reputation as the ''Heen-en-weer club'' (the back-and-forth club) due to the many times the club was promoted and relegated throughout its history.\n\nThroughout the years, Volendam spawned many talented players, such as [[Wim Jonk]], [[Edwin Zoetebier]], [[Arnold M\u00fchren|Arnold]] and [[Gerrie M\u00fchren]]. The club also has an accomplished scouting and youth system, which spreads across many different countries.\n\n==Honours==\n* '''[[Eerste Divisie]]'''\n**Winners: [[Eerste Divisie
