Having defeated Spain, [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] issued the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]]. However, 6 months later in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]], Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States.

They were each given a district where they were responsible for the return of displaced peoples to their communities. They were tasked with encouraging reconstruction, convincing the ''[[Principal\u00eda|principales]]'' to swear an oath to the U.S. and organizing local government. Daza, being part of the Principal\u00eda, was vital in convincing the other ''principales'' of Samar''.'' With the support of Daza, Major-General Frederick D.

In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades.

Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

founded in 1775 by Luis de C\u00f3rdova, is a city and [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] located in the northwestern tip of [[Puerto Rico]], bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, north of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]], and [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] and west of [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]]. Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel.

There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

Fuels used to power agricultural vehicles, and/or home [[heating oil]] which is similar to [[diesel fuel|diesel]] are taxed at a different, usually lower rate. The fuel tax receipts are often dedicated or [[hypothecation (taxation)|hypothecated]] to transportation projects so that the fuel tax is considered by many a [[user fee]].

His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years. In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\". Still slim in figure and soulful in his performance, he dazzled the audience and show hosts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2020/03/682_280113.html|title=Yang Joon-il, a musician living ahead of his time, finally recognized 30 year later|date=2019-12-10|website=koreatimes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> When asked his next plans amid this viral syndrome, he simply said: \"I don't make any plans; I just focus on fully living every moment.
