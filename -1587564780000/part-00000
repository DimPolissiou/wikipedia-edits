He is mostly known for his poems and books for children. His poetry is characterized by vivid natural scenery, patriotism, as well as a venerated image of the sacred mother.

In 1993 he was elected a correspondent member of the Romanian Academy.<ref name=\"Acad.ro_2020-04-21\">{{Citation | url=https://acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=V| title=Academia Romana (membri)| newspaper=Acad.ro| date= | accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in [[Perer\u00eeta]] village, [[Hotin County]], at the time, part of [[Romania]] (today part of [[Briceni district]], Moldova). His parents, Pavel and Eudochia Vieru (''n\u00e9e'' Didic) were engaged in farming. \n\nIn 1950, he graduated from the 7-grade school of his native village, after which he attended the middle school in [[Lipcani]], which he graduated in 1953.\n\n==Personal life==\nVieru was married to Raisa Vieru since 1959; they had two sons, Teodor and [[C\u0103lin Vieru]].\n\n==  Creative work ==\nHis first publishing debut was in 1957, a booklet of poems for children, ''\"Alarma\"'' (''\"Alarm\"''), appreciated by literary critics.The following year, Vieru graduated from the [[Ion Creang\u0103 Pedagogical State University]] in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] with a degree in history and philology. He was employed as an editor in the magazine called ''\"Sc\u00eenteia Leninist\u0103\"'' (''\"The Lenin\u2019s sparkle\"'') designed for children, currently it is called ''\"Noi\"'' (''\"We\"''), and the newspaper ''\"T\u00een\u0103rul leninist\"'' (''\"The Young Lenin\u2019s follower\"''), currently ''\"Florile Dalbe\"'' (''\"Glowing Flowers\"'').\n\nIn 1959, he became editor at the ''\"Nistru'\"' magazine, currently ''\"Basarabia\"'', a publication of the [[Writers' Union of Moldova]]. \n\nFrom 1960 to 1963, he served as editor in chief of the \"''Cartea Moldoveneasc\u0103''\" publishing house.\n\nIn 1967, Vieru's book \"Poetry for Readers of All Ages\" (published in 1965) was awarded the Moldavian Prize for Youth Literature. The following year, his book \"Your Name\" became part of the contemporary literature curriculum in Moldavian universities.\n\nHe wrote another children's story/picture book \"Bread and Dew\" which features Doru, a 4 or 5-year-old boy who lives in Chi\u0219in\u0103u with his parents.\n\nMany moldavian composers were inspired by the poetry of Grigore Vieru (songbook \"Poftim de intra\u021bi\", \"Cine crede\" etc.), the poet himself is the author of a lot of melodies (\"S\u0103 cre\u0219ti mare\" etc.) and since 1964 he began to collaborate with composer [[Yulia Tsibulskaya]] (\"Soare, soare\", \"Clopo\u021beii\", \"Stea-stea, logostea\", \"Ramule-neamule\", \"C\u00eent\u00eend cu iubire\" etc.).\n\nHe was a frequent guest of the \"Poetry House\" in [[Cociulia]] village, [[Cantemir District]]. The famous book for preschoolers ''\"Albinu\u021ba\"'' was also written here.\n\n1968 was turning point for the poet's destiny; this year became remarkable by the volume of lyrical ''\"Numele T\u0103u\"'' (\"Your name\"), with an introductory written by [[Ion Dru\u021b\u0103]]. The book was appreciated by literary critics as the most original poetic appearance. In the year of it publishing, it became a subject of the study at the university within the courses designated for the contemporary national literature. Three poems in the volume are entitled: ''[[Tudor Arghezi]]'', ''[[Lucian Blaga]]'', [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i|''Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i'']], and another two are dedicated to [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] and [[Marin Sorescu]]. For the first time, in the post war period, such dedications has appeared in the Bessarabian lyrics.\n\n== Political activity ==\nSince 1971, Grigore Vieru has been a member of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].\n\nIn 1973, Grigore Vieru has passed the [[Prut]] within a delegation of Soviet writers.

He returned to Chi\u0219in\u0103u with a bag of books. Later the poet makes the following confession:{{cquote|''\"If somebody dreamed of getting to outer space, for my whole life I have dreamed of crossing the [[Prut River]]''\"}}\n\nIn 1974 and 1977, invited by the president of the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Romanian Writers' Union]], Vieru visited [[Bucharest]], [[Constan\u021ba]], [[Ia\u0219i]], and cities in [[Transylvania]].\n\nIn 1978, the \"[[Junimea]]\" publishing house printed \"The Friday Star\", Vieru's first work published in [[Romania]].\n\nIn 1989 he was elected member of [[Parliament of Moldova|Moldova's Parliament]] and campaigned for the [[Movement for unification of Romania and Moldova|unification of Romania and Moldova]]. The following year he was elected Honorary Member of the [[Romanian Academy]]. In 1992, the Romanian Academy recommended Vieru for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\nIn 1995, he became a member of the Board of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]], and in 1996 he won several Romanian literary awards.\n\nIn 2000, Vieru was awarded the \"[[Mihai Eminescu|Eminescu]]\" Medal by the [[Government of Romania|Romanian government]].\n\n=== Involvement in the Bessarabia National Liberation Movement  ===\n[[File:Grigore Vieru, Ion Vatamanu si Serafim Saka.jpg|thumb|313x313px|right| Grigore Vieru, [[Ion Vatamanu]] and [[Serafim Saka]] in  '70.]]\nAt the end of the [[1980s|80s]], Grigore Vieru is in the first line of the National Liberation Movement in Bessarabia, his texts (including the songs laid on his lyrics) playing a big role in awakening of the national consciousness of Romanians in Bessarabia. Vieru is one of the founders of the People's Front of Moldova and is among the organizers and leaders of the Great National Assembly of August 27, 1989. He actively participates in the debates of the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet of the SSR, in which the [[Romanian language]] is voted as the official language and the transition to Latin spelling.\n\n==Death==\nOn January 16, 2009 Vieru suffered a serious traffic accident<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Votes_Have_No_Language/1372065.html Death Of A Moldovan Poet]. rferl.org</ref> and was admitted to the Emergency Hospital in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.

Later, the song was taken over by [[Zdob \u0219i Zdub]].\n\nIn 1988, in the newspaper ''[[Literatura \u015fi Arta]]'' (''Literature and Art'') in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the first Latin-written text from post-war Bessarabia has appeared.

Under these conditions, Grigore Vieru and the editor-in-chief of ''Literatura \u0219i Arta'', [[Nicolae Dabija]], went to [[Bucharest]] to get the typewriter for the newspaper. The Romanian authorities were delaying the answer, and the antiquarian shop from which they could buy such a device was closed these days because of some technical issues. However, Vieru and Dabija were helped by the priest Vasile \u021aepordei, who brought to the station a bag containing the 31 metallic signs of the Latin alphabet, cut by him from his own typewriter. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the Latin signs are welded to a typewriter instead of the Cyrillic ones, so ''Literatura \u0219i Arta'' magazine became the first newspaper of Bessarabia to start systematically coming out in Latin spelling.\n\nIn 1994 the neo-communists of the [[Democratic Agrarian Party]], who came to power in Moldova, have gave up to the state hymn ''[[De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!]]'' (''Awake the romanian'') and have proposed to the poet Grigore Vieru and the composer [[Eugen Doga]] to compose the lyrics and the music for a new hymn. They both refuse. Grigore Vieru has wrote in the ''Literatura \u0219i Arta'' magazine the following: {{cquote|''\"Historical justice will blame the poets and composers who will dare to raise their hands on the National Hymn \"Desteapt\u0103-te Rom\u00e2ne!\" stooping instead of his historical need and brilliance.\"''}}<ref name=\"adev2014-06-09\">{{Citation | url=https://adevarul.ro/moldova/actualitate/20-ani-desteapta-te-romane-1_53955a820d133766a86b3947/index.html| title=20 de ani f\u0103r\u0103 \u201eDe\u015fteapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!\u201c| newspaper=Adev\u0103rul| date= June 9, 2014| accessdate=April 21, 2020 |author = Https://facebook.

He was employed as an editor in the magazine called ''\"Sc\u00eenteia Leninist\u0103\"'' (''\"The Lenin\u2019s sparkle\"'') designed for children, currently it is called ''\"Noi\"'' (''\"We\"''), and the newspaper ''\"T\u00een\u0103rul leninist\"'' (''\"The Young Lenin\u2019s follower\"''), currently ''\"Florile Dalbe\"'' (''\"Glowing Flowers\"'').\n\nIn 1959, he became editor at the ''\"Nistru'\"' magazine, currently ''\"Basarabia\"'', a publication of the [[Writers' Union of Moldova]]. \n\nFrom 1960 to 1963, he served as editor in chief of the \"''Cartea Moldoveneasc\u0103''\" publishing house.\n\nIn 1967, Vieru's book \"Poetry for Readers of All Ages\" (published in 1965) was awarded the Moldavian Prize for Youth Literature. The following year, his book \"Your Name\" became part of the contemporary literature curriculum in Moldavian universities.\n\nHe wrote another children's story/picture book \"Bread and Dew\" which features Doru, a 4 or 5-year-old boy who lives in Chi\u0219in\u0103u with his parents.\n\nMany moldavian composers were inspired by the poetry of Grigore Vieru (songbook \"Poftim de intra\u021bi\", \"Cine crede\" etc.), the poet himself is the author of a lot of melodies (\"S\u0103 cre\u0219ti mare\" etc.) and since 1964 he began to collaborate with composer [[Yulia Tsibulskaya]] (\"Soare, soare\", \"Clopo\u021beii\", \"Stea-stea, logostea\", \"Ramule-neamule\", \"C\u00eent\u00eend cu iubire\" etc.).\n\nHe was a frequent guest of the \"Poetry House\" in [[Cociulia]] village, [[Cantemir District]]. The famous book for preschoolers ''\"Albinu\u021ba\"'' was also written here.\n\n1968 was turning point for the poet's destiny; this year became remarkable by the volume of lyrical ''\"Numele T\u0103u\"'' (\"Your name\"), with an introductory written by [[Ion Dru\u021b\u0103]]. The book was appreciated by literary critics as the most original poetic appearance. In the year of it publishing, it became a subject of the study at the university within the courses designated for the contemporary national literature. Three poems in the volume are entitled: ''[[Tudor Arghezi]]'', ''[[Lucian Blaga]]'', [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i|''Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i'']], and another two are dedicated to [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] and [[Marin Sorescu]].

He returned to Chi\u0219in\u0103u with a bag of books. Later the poet makes the following confession:{{cquote|''\"If somebody dreamed of getting to outer space, for my whole life I have dreamed of crossing the [[Prut River]]''\"}}\n\nIn 1974 and 1977, invited by the president of the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Romanian Writers' Union]], Vieru visited [[Bucharest]], [[Constan\u021ba]], [[Ia\u0219i]], and cities in [[Transylvania]].\n\nIn 1978, the \"[[Junimea]]\" publishing house printed \"The Friday Star\", Vieru's first work published in [[Romania]].\n\nIn 1989 he was elected member of [[Parliament of Moldova|Moldova's Parliament]] and campaigned for the [[Movement for unification of Romania and Moldova|unification of Romania and Moldova]]. The following year he was elected Honorary Member of the [[Romanian Academy]]. In 1992, the Romanian Academy recommended Vieru for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\nIn 1995, he became a member of the Board of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]], and in 1996 he won several Romanian literary awards.\n\nIn 2000, Vieru was awarded the \"[[Mihai Eminescu|Eminescu]]\" Medal by the [[Government of Romania|Romanian government]].\n\n=== Involvement in the Bessarabia National Liberation Movement  ===\n[[File:Grigore Vieru, Ion Vatamanu si Serafim Saka.jpg|thumb|313x313px|right| Grigore Vieru, [[Ion Vatamanu]] and [[Serafim Saka]] in  '70.]]\nAt the end of the [[1980s|80s]], Grigore Vieru is in the first line of the National Liberation Movement in Bessarabia, his texts (including the songs laid on his lyrics) playing a big role in awakening of the national consciousness of Romanians in Bessarabia.

Later, the song was taken over by [[Zdob \u0219i Zdub]].\n\nIn 1988, in the newspaper ''[[Literatura \u015fi Arta]]'' (''Literature and Art'') in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the first Latin-written text from post-war Bessarabia has appeared.

Under these conditions, Grigore Vieru and the editor-in-chief of ''Literatura \u0219i Arta'', [[Nicolae Dabija]], went to [[Bucharest]] to get the typewriter for the newspaper. The Romanian authorities were delaying the answer, and the antiquarian shop from which they could buy such a device was closed these days because of some technical issues. However, Vieru and Dabija were helped by the priest Vasile \u021aepordei, who brought to the station a bag containing the 31 metallic signs of the Latin alphabet, cut by him from his own typewriter. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the Latin signs are welded to a typewriter instead of the Cyrillic ones, so ''Literatura \u0219i Arta'' magazine became the first newspaper of Bessarabia to start systematically coming out in Latin spelling.\n\nIn 1994 the neo-communists of the [[Democratic Agrarian Party]], who came to power in Moldova, have gave up to the state hymn ''[[De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!]]'' (''Awake the romanian'') and have proposed to the poet Grigore Vieru and the composer [[Eugen Doga]] to compose the lyrics and the music for a new hymn. They both refuse. Grigore Vieru has wrote in the ''Literatura \u0219i Arta'' magazine the following: {{cquote|''\"Historical justice will blame the poets and composers who will dare to raise their hands on the National Hymn \"Desteapt\u0103-te Rom\u00e2ne!\" stooping instead of his historical need and brilliance.\"''}}<ref name=\"adev2014-06-09\">{{Citation | url=https://adevarul.ro/moldova/actualitate/20-ani-desteapta-te-romane-1_53955a820d133766a86b3947/index.html| title=20 de ani f\u0103r\u0103 \u201eDe\u015fteapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!\u201c| newspaper=Adev\u0103rul| date= June 9, 2014| accessdate=April 21, 2020 |author = Https://facebook.

Some Christian churches built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a [[mosaic]] in the St. Sophia church of [[Kiev]], Ukraine dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in [[Milan]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n8YNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA541&dq=Basilica+of+St.+Ambrose+in+Milan+swastika&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2kYD78dPlAhUyUt8KHeZAAmwQ6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=Basilica%20of%20St.%20Ambrose%20in%20Milan%20swastika&f=false|title=The Open Court|last=Carus|first=Paul|date=1907|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA ceiling painted in 1910 in the church of St Laurent in [[Grenoble]] has many swastikas. It can be visited today because the church became the archaeological museum of the city. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], which was built on top of a pagan site at [[Amiens]], France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] worn by a priest in the 1445 [[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|painting of the Seven Sacraments]] by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.\n\nSwastikas also appear in art and architecture during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era. The fresco ''The School of Athens'' shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the ''Santa Maria della Salute'', a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of [[Venice]].\n\nIn the Polish First Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], who in the 9th century [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|attacked Constantinople]], nailed his shield (which had a large red swastika painted on it) to the city's gates.<ref name=\"distedu.ru\" /> Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their [[coat of arms]]. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.\nThe swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the [[Boreyko coat of arms]], used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine. In the 19th century the swastika was one of the Russian Empire's symbols, and was used on coinage as a backdrop to the [[Coat of arms of Russia#1721\u20131917: Russian Empire|Russian eagle]].<ref name=\"klk.pp.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://klk.pp.ru/2007/01/26/svastika_istoricheskie_korni.html |author=Vladimir Nikolaevich|title=The Swastika, the historical roots|publisher=Klk.pp.ru |language=Russian |date= |access-date=2 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"ruskolan.xpomo.com\" />\n\nA swastika can be seen on stonework at [[Valle Crucis Abbey]], near [[Llangollen]].{{clear left}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"230px\" heights=\"187px\">\nFile:Greca a svastica - palazzo Roncale - Rovigo.JPG|Because the outer lines point counterclockwise instead of the swastika's clockwise-pointing ends, this is referred to as a sauwastika.

Since its adoption by the [[Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], the swastika has been associated with Nazism, fascism, racism in its ([[white supremacy]]) form, the [[Axis powers]] in World War II, and [[the Holocaust]] in much of the West. The swastika remains a core symbol of neo-Nazi groups.\n\nThe Benedictine choir school at [[Lambach Abbey]], Upper Austria, which Hitler attended for several months as a boy, had a swastika chiseled into the monastery portal and also the wall above the spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868.

The Grand Cross with the swastika collar has been awarded 41 times to foreign heads of state. To avoid misunderstandings, the swastika decorations were replaced by fir crosses at the decision of president [[Urho Kekkonen]] in 1963 after it became known that the [[President of France]] [[Charles De Gaulle]] was uncomfortable with the swastika collar.\n\nAlso a design by Gallen-Kallela from 1918, the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty|Cross of Liberty]] has a swastika pattern in its arms.

Its inclusion was to subliminally draw parallels between the movie's Federal Bureau of Termination and Nazi Germany, and also refer to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s experiences as a [[POW]] and the influence [[World War II]] played in his imagining of a population-controlled future where authorities use [[gas chambers]] to terminate people. The Federal Bureau of Termination logo appears as a white geometric design with a black outline, centered on vertical banners, in reference to the Third Reich banners. These banners were initially red, until the crew felt the allusion was too strong. The movie's hospital was envisaged as the Bureau's branch that controlled birth, and their [[red cross]] was given 'wings' to transform it into a swastika, and link it to the Bureau's logo.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Masson |first=Sophie |author-link=Sophie Masson |title=2BR02B: the journey of a dystopian film \u2013 an interview with Leon Coward |website=Feathers of the Firebird |url=https://firebirdfeathers.com/2016/10/19/2br02b-the-journey-of-a-dystopian-film-an-interview-with-leon-coward/ |date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Contemporary use==\n===Asia===\n==== Central Asia ====\nIn 2005, authorities in [[Tajikistan]] called for the widespread adoption of the swastika as a national [[symbol]].

It is commonly found in Buddhist temples, religious artefacts, texts related to Buddhism and schools founded by Buddhist religious groups.

All of them show the swastika in their logos.\n\nAmong the predominantly Hindu population of [[Bali]], in [[Indonesia]], the swastika is common in temples, homes and public spaces. Similarly, the swastika is a common icon associated with Buddha's footprints in Theravada Buddhist communities of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.<ref name=lee86 />\n\nIn Japan, the swastika is also used as a [[List of Japanese map symbols|map symbol]] and is designated by the Survey Act and related Japanese governmental rules to denote a [[Buddhist temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/MAPSAKUSEI/25000SAKUSEI/zushiki-zushiki.html#tatemono |script-title=ja:\u5e73\u6210\uff11\uff14\u5e74\uff12\u4e07\uff15\u5343\u5206\uff11\u5730\u5f62\u56f3\u56f3\u5f0f |author= |date= |month= |year= |website= |publisher=Geospatial Information Authority of Japan |language=Japanese |trans-title=2002 1:25000 Topographical Map Scheme |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Hirosaki]] in [[Aomori Prefecture]] designates this symbol as its official flag, which stemmed from its use in the emblem of the [[Tsugaru clan]], the lords of [[Hirosaki Domain]] during the [[Edo period]].\n\n==== Indian subcontinent ====\n[[File:Seal of Bihar.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Seal of Bihar]]]]\nIn Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the swastika is common.

This has resulted in several such products having been boycotted or pulled from shelves.\n\nWhen a ten-year-old boy in [[Lynbrook, New York]], bought a set of [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game|Pok\u00e9mon cards]] imported from Japan in 1999, two of the cards contained the left-facing Buddhist swastika. The boy's parents misinterpreted the symbol as the right-facing Nazi swastika and filed a complaint to the manufacturer. [[Nintendo of America]] announced that the cards would be discontinued, explaining that what was acceptable in one culture was not necessarily so in another; their action was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who recognised that there was no intention to offend, but said that international commerce meant that, \"Isolating [the Swastika] in Asia would just create more problems.\"<ref name=\"Pok\u00e9mon cards\" />\n\nIn 2002, [[Christmas cracker]]s containing plastic toy red pandas sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from consumers in Canada. The manufacturer, based in China, said the symbol was presented in a traditional sense and not as a reference to the Nazis, and apologized to the customers for the cross-cultural mixup.<ref>[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]] 30 December 2002: [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/12/30/swastika021230.html Toy pandas bearing swastikas a cultural mix-up]</ref>\n\n=== New religious movements ===\nBesides its use as a religious symbol in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], which can be traced back to pre-modern traditions, the swastika is also used by adherents of a large number of [[new religious movements]] which were established in the modern period.\n\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 227\n| image_style = border:none;\n| image1 = Raelian_symbol.svg\n| width1 = 96\n| image2 = Raelian_symbol_alternate.svg\n| width2 = 96\n| footer = The Ra\u00eblian symbol with the swastika (left) and the alternative spiral version (right)\n}}\n* The [[Ra\u00eblism|Ra\u00eblian Movement]], whose adherents believe that extraterrestrials originally created all life on earth, use a symbol that is often the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced [[star of David]] and a swastika.

Its usage is taken from traditional Chinese symbolism, and it alludes to [[Dan Tian]], a [[chakra]]-like portion of esoteric human anatomy, which is located in the stomach.\n* The swastika is a holy symbol in [[Germanic Heathenry]], along with the [[Mj\u00f6lnir|hammer of Thor]] and [[runes]]. This tradition \u2013 which is found in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], and elsewhere \u2013 considers the swastika to be derived from a Norse symbol for the sun.

Some Christian churches built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a [[mosaic]] in the St. Sophia church of [[Kiev]], Ukraine dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in [[Milan]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n8YNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA541&dq=Basilica+of+St.+Ambrose+in+Milan+swastika&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2kYD78dPlAhUyUt8KHeZAAmwQ6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=Basilica%20of%20St.%20Ambrose%20in%20Milan%20swastika&f=false|title=The Open Court|last=Carus|first=Paul|date=1907|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA ceiling painted in 1910 in the church of St Laurent in [[Grenoble]] has many swastikas. It can be visited today because the church became the archaeological museum of the city. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], which was built on top of a pagan site at [[Amiens]], France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] worn by a priest in the 1445 [[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|painting of the Seven Sacraments]] by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.\n\nSwastikas also appear in art and architecture during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era. The fresco ''The School of Athens'' shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the ''Santa Maria della Salute'', a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of [[Venice]].\n\nIn the Polish First Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], who in the 9th century [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|attacked Constantinople]], nailed his shield (which had a large red swastika painted on it) to the city's gates.<ref name=\"distedu.ru\" /> Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their [[coat of arms]]. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.\nThe swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the [[Boreyko coat of arms]], used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine.

The icon is also found as a sacred symbol in the Bon tradition, but in the left facing mode.<ref>{{cite book|author= John Powers|title= Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy980CH84mEC&pg=PA509 |year=2007|publisher= Shambhala|isbn= 978-1-55939-835-0|pages=508\u2013509}}</ref><ref name=lee86 />\n\nMany [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religions]] make use of the swastika symbol, including [[Guiyidao]] and [[Shanrendao]]. The [[Red Swastika Society]], which is the philanthropic branch of Guiyidao, runs two schools in Hong Kong (the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tai Po Secondary School<ref>[Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tai Po Secondary School Official website http://www.hkrsstpss.edu.hk]</ref> and the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tuen Mun Primary School<ref>[Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tuen Mun Primary School website http://www.hkrsstmps.edu.hk]</ref>) and one in Singapore ([[Red Swastika School]]). All of them show the swastika in their logos.\n\nAmong the predominantly Hindu population of [[Bali]], in [[Indonesia]], the swastika is common in temples, homes and public spaces. Similarly, the swastika is a common icon associated with Buddha's footprints in Theravada Buddhist communities of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.<ref name=lee86 />\n\nIn Japan, the swastika is also used as a [[List of Japanese map symbols|map symbol]] and is designated by the Survey Act and related Japanese governmental rules to denote a [[Buddhist temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/MAPSAKUSEI/25000SAKUSEI/zushiki-zushiki.html#tatemono |script-title=ja:\u5e73\u6210\uff11\uff14\u5e74\uff12\u4e07\uff15\u5343\u5206\uff11\u5730\u5f62\u56f3\u56f3\u5f0f |author= |date= |month= |year= |website= |publisher=Geospatial Information Authority of Japan |language=Japanese |trans-title=2002 1:25000 Topographical Map Scheme |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Hirosaki]] in [[Aomori Prefecture]] designates this symbol as its official flag, which stemmed from its use in the emblem of the [[Tsugaru clan]], the lords of [[Hirosaki Domain]] during the [[Edo period]].\n\n==== Indian subcontinent ====\n[[File:Seal of Bihar.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Seal of Bihar]]]]\nIn Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the swastika is common.

The swastika remains prominent in Hindu ceremonies such as weddings. The left facing ''sauwastika'' symbol is found in tantric rituals.<ref name=britswast />\n\n[[Musaeus College]] in Colombo, [[Sri Lanka]], a Buddhist girls' school, has a left facing swastika in their school logo.\n\nIn India, swastik and swastika, with their spelling variants, are first names for males and females respectively, for instance with [[Swastika Mukherjee]]. The [[Seal of Bihar]] contains two swastikas.{{clear left}}\n\nIn Bhutan, swastika motif is found in its architecture, fabric and religious ceremonies.\n\n==== Western misinterpretation of Asian use ====\nSince the end of the 20th century, and through the early 21st century, confusion and controversy has occurred when consumer goods bearing the traditional Jain, Buddhist, or Hindu symbols have been exported to the West, notably to North America and Europe, and have been interpreted by consumers as bearing a Nazi symbol. This has resulted in several such products having been boycotted or pulled from shelves.\n\nWhen a ten-year-old boy in [[Lynbrook, New York]], bought a set of [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game|Pok\u00e9mon cards]] imported from Japan in 1999, two of the cards contained the left-facing Buddhist swastika. The boy's parents misinterpreted the symbol as the right-facing Nazi swastika and filed a complaint to the manufacturer. [[Nintendo of America]] announced that the cards would be discontinued, explaining that what was acceptable in one culture was not necessarily so in another; their action was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who recognised that there was no intention to offend, but said that international commerce meant that, \"Isolating [the Swastika] in Asia would just create more problems.\"<ref name=\"Pok\u00e9mon cards\" />\n\nIn 2002, [[Christmas cracker]]s containing plastic toy red pandas sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from consumers in Canada. The manufacturer, based in China, said the symbol was presented in a traditional sense and not as a reference to the Nazis, and apologized to the customers for the cross-cultural mixup.<ref>[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]] 30 December 2002: [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/12/30/swastika021230.html Toy pandas bearing swastikas a cultural mix-up]</ref>\n\n=== New religious movements ===\nBesides its use as a religious symbol in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], which can be traced back to pre-modern traditions, the swastika is also used by adherents of a large number of [[new religious movements]] which were established in the modern period.\n\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 227\n| image_style = border:none;\n| image1 = Raelian_symbol.svg\n| width1 = 96\n| image2 = Raelian_symbol_alternate.svg\n| width2 = 96\n| footer = The Ra\u00eblian symbol with the swastika (left) and the alternative spiral version (right)\n}}\n* The [[Ra\u00eblism|Ra\u00eblian Movement]], whose adherents believe that extraterrestrials originally created all life on earth, use a symbol that is often the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced [[star of David]] and a swastika. The Raelians state that the Star of David represents infinity in space whereas the swastika represents infinity in time \u2013 no beginning and no end in time, and everything being cyclic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proswastika.org |title=Pro-Swastika |publisher=Pro-Swastika |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> In 1991, the symbol was changed in order to remove the swastika, out of respect to the victims of the [[Holocaust]], but as of 2007 it has been restored to its original form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raelianews.org/news.php?item.206.3 |title=The Official Raelian Symbol gets its swastika back |publisher=Raelianews |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref>\n* The [[Tantra]]-based movement [[Ananda Marga]] (Devanagari: \u0906\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917, meaning ''Path of Bliss'') uses a motif which is similar to the one used by the Ra\u00eblians, but in its case the apparent [[Star of David]] is defined as intersecting triangles with no specific reference to [[Jewish culture]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016|reason=not mentioned in the main article}}\n* The [[Falun Gong]] [[qigong]] movement uses a symbol that features a large swastika surrounded by four smaller (and rounded) ones, interspersed with [[yin and yang|yin-and-yang]] symbols. Its usage is taken from traditional Chinese symbolism, and it alludes to [[Dan Tian]], a [[chakra]]-like portion of esoteric human anatomy, which is located in the stomach.\n* The swastika is a holy symbol in [[Germanic Heathenry]], along with the [[Mj\u00f6lnir|hammer of Thor]] and [[runes]]. This tradition \u2013 which is found in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], and elsewhere \u2013 considers the swastika to be derived from a Norse symbol for the sun. Their use of the symbol has led people to accuse them of being a neo-Nazi group.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marijke Gijswijt-Hofstra|author2=Brian P.
