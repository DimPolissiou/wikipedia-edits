The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of Roy Kapur Films, [[RSVP Movies]], and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], respectively, in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]], who suffered from [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, as they navigate their marriage while dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while the Hindi dialogue were written by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/ |title=The Sky Is Pink Cast & Crew |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya's Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan's Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of Roy Kapur Films, [[RSVP Movies]], and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], respectively, in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]] who suffered from [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, as they navigate their marriage while dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while the Hindi dialogue were written by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house.

Three people were killed and 30 were taken to hospital with injuries when one train rear-ended another train. The subway line was shut down for five days following the incident. Investigations found that [[human error]] and a design flaw in the mechanical safety devices caused this accident. It remains the deadliest accident in a [[rapid transit]] system in Canadian history.<ref name=\"TTC archives\">{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/data/200508061136.shtml |title=Ten years after |publisher=Transit Toronto |date=August 6, 2005 |accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nAt 6:02&nbsp;p.m. on Friday, August 11, 1995, a subway train running southbound on [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]] ran into the rear of a stationary train halfway between [[St. Clair West station|St. Clair West]] and [[Dupont station]]s. There were between 200 and 300 passengers on the two trains, of whom three (Christina Munar Reyes, 33; Kinga Szabo, 43; and Xian Hui Lin, 23) were killed and 30 taken to hospital with injuries; about 100 more later filed injury claims against the TTC. Many of the seriously injured were extracted from the twisted remains of the most damaged subway cars by rescue workers who worked through the evening under extremely hot and humid conditions. Of the four crew members, three were taken to hospital with injuries.\n\n== Direct causes ==\nThe accident had two direct causes: first the inexperienced driver, Robert Jeffrey, who mistook the [[Toronto subway signals|signals]]; and the [[train stop]] which failed to protect the train due to a design error.\n\n=== Signals ===\n\n{{Main|Signals on the TTC}}\n[[File:Toronto-subway-lightbox-2006.jpg|thumb|Signal lightbox at a switch of the Toronto subway]]\nAt the time of the accident, the TTC subway used conventional wayside [[railway signal|signal]]s without [[cab signalling]].  Thus drivers were expected to remember each signal aspect and act accordingly until they receive new information from the following signal. As of 2019, the TTC has converted some sections of the line, including the Russell Hill portion, to more modern [[automatic train control]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ttc.ca/News/2019/May/12_05_19NR_atc_to_stpatrick.jsp | title=TTC's ATC signal upgrades extend to St Patrick Station}}</ref> The following description is limited to aspects relevant to the accident.\n\nSome signals are \"automatic\" and have a single head that shows one of the three basic colours.  Red means stop and stay (until presented with a less restrictive signal aspect), yellow means that the next signal is red and the driver should prepare to stop, and green means that the next signal is not red and it is safe to proceed at normal speed.\n\n\"Interlocking\" or \"home\" signals have a double head and show two coloured lights.  The top light has the same meaning as that of an automatic signal. The second light is red if the top light is red; otherwise it shows yellow if the [[railroad switch|switch]]es are set for a secondary route, and green for the main route or if no relevant switches exist. Thus the combination yellow over green means the same as a single yellow.\n\nAt locations such as downgrades, curves, and switches, the same signals additionally serve to enforce speed limits.  A system called \"grade timing\" regulates speeds, and is indicated by an additional \"lunar white\" light below the one or two coloured lights previously mentioned. The white light means that the next signal is red (or double red) ''only'' because of grade timing, and if the train approaches at the ''proper'' speed, the signal will clear to a less restrictive aspect before the train gets there. If the train goes too fast, it will pass the red signal and be stopped by the [[train stop]].\n\nIn 1995 the second signal did not provide any confirmation that it was about to change and the operator was expected to remember the previous signal aspect correctly.  With the tolerant attitudes of management, it had become common practice for operators to travel at the fastest speed that the system allowed, passing the signals at the same instant they were clearing.\n\nA long downgrade would therefore have several consecutive grade-timing sections. If all the signals were automatic and no trains were present, the first signal would be yellow over white, followed by a series of red over whites, and finally a red.  When the train approaches each red over white signal, it would clear to yellow over white and the train stop would be lowered; and the final red signal would clear to green.  Interlocking signals can also take part in grade timing, with aspects such as yellow over green over white (meaning the same as yellow over white).\n[[File:St Clair West southbound platform looking south at tracks and signal.jpg|thumb|Looking south from St. Clair West station. Signal '''SP77/X38''' can be seen showing red over red.]]\nFrom St. Clair West to Dupont the subway runs continuously downhill and grade timing is used.  The signal at the end of St. Clair West station, '''SP77/X38''', is an interlocking signal and therefore shows yellow over green over white whenever there is nothing to delay a train.  As Jeffrey's train passed the signal, however, it was showing yellow over green.  He should have stopped at the following signal, '''SP71''', which was red because another train was occupying the block ahead.\n\nAfter the accident Jeffrey said he remembered '''SP77/X38''' as yellow over white (actually an impossible aspect for that signal) therefore he must have either \"misremembered\" it at the time, or else have been fooled by some reflection off the signal head into thinking he had seen the usual yellow over green over white.  In any case, he believed that grade timing was in use and so approached signal '''SP71''' at the same speed as he would normally drive on this section.\n\nAfter this Jeffrey did not remember what he had seen, but it is easy to reconstruct the events.  When the train passed '''SP71''' without him seeing it change, he must have assumed that he had passed it just as it cleared. He continued coasting downhill, still thinking that he was under grade timing and violated the signal, without realizing that if this was true, the signal would have shown red over white as he approached.\n\nHe must therefore have expected the third signal, (the '''SP65''') to clear in the same way.  Again it was showing red, not red over white, but Jeffrey repeated his mistake and violated the signal. He braked only when he actually saw the train just ahead (it was stopped at the next signal, '''SP53'''); by then, a collision was unavoidable.\n\nNews media accounts of the accident often say that Jeffrey \"passed three red lights.\"  This count includes the repeater signal provided in advance of '''SP65''' because a curve in the tunnel interferes with sighting. Drivers are not expected to stop at the repeater even if it is red.\n\n=== Train stop ===\nThe \"trip\" or \"[[train stop]]\" consists of a T-shaped arm placed just outside the right-hand rail near each signal (except a repeater). If the signal is red (or double red), with or without a lunar white, the trip arm rises enough for its crossbar to strike a \"trip valve\" or \"tripcock\" lever on the bottom of a train's first car as it passes; and by doing so triggers the emergency brakes of the train.\n\nOn the relevant [[H-series (Toronto subway car)|class of trains]], the trip valve is located near the centre of the right side of the leading [[bogie]], where its position in relation to the rail is well controlled.\n\n[[Wismer and Becker, Inc.]], the contractors who installed the signal system on the Spadina line portion of the subway, chose to use an Ericsson [[train stop]] that was designed to have the trip arm located in the middle of the track.  A subcontractor, [[Gayle Manufacturing]], designed a mechanical extension that would allow the device to drive a trip arm in its actual position outside of the rail.\n\nWhat was not realized was that the mechanism they designed (when the trip arm was raised) did not have the clearance specified for the train and therefore would not have the desired effect of activating the train's emergency braking system.\n\nWhen both the trip arm and trip valve were new, this did not matter; the train did not fill its entire clearance envelope, and the trip arm would contact the trip valve normally.  However, with normal wear of the wheels and rails, and with the train rounding a curve at speed (and therefore riding off-centre) it was another matter. The first wheel on the right-hand side of the train hit a bolt in the mechanism attached to the trip arm and ''knocked the arm down''. It would then rise again, but too late: with the train moving quickly, the trip valve, just a few feet behind the wheel, would already have gone past,<ref name = \"TTC archives\" /> thus making the train stop useless for ensuring signal compliance.\n\n== Inquest ==\nThe jury at the coroner's inquest produced 18 recommendations:\n\n#Reform of the Railways Act (1950) to provide oversight of the Toronto Transit Commission.\n#The TTC should submit to an independent safety audit every two years, beyond that done by APTA. This independent agency will be set up under the revised Railway Act.\n#Completion of the \"Due Diligence Checklist\" of deficiencies identified by the TTC.\n#The Province and Metro commit to a \"State of Good Repair\" funding policy; repair to take precedence over new works (see [[Line 4 Sheppard]]); future capital funding based on the State of Good Repair. The jury indicated that underfunding since the mid-1980s has contributed to the deterioration of the system and had jeopardized the safety of the Toronto Transit Commission.\n#Improvements to the Operations Training Centre starting with the hiring of an accredited adult training specialist. The updated training package should include at least: realistic pass / fail grading, annual refresher for all operators, emphasis on the meaning of the signal system, route supervisory accompaniment for at least one day of complete runs after training completion.\n#An updated Operations Training Centre to include a suitable subway simulator.\n#A comprehensive review of the signal system with emphasis in the following areas: Lunar Whites, removal of signal identification markers, consistent placement of signal aspects, progressive speed control, expansion of IPHC to identify headway and train separation, all trip valves activated and relocation of reset.\n#Elimination of auto key-by facility and implementation of raised trip arm immediately after train has passed.\n#Advanced implementation of the new subway communications system.\n#Improved communication within the organisation.\n#A new Transit Control Centre including the updating of the skills of TTC staff.\n#The current Transit Control Centre should only be responsible for Operations.

Each year the Toronto Transit Commission receives a report on the outstanding items. By 2009, only 2 of the recommendations had yet to be completed.<ref>http://www3.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2009/August_26_2009/Reports/Russell_Hill_Subway_.pdf</ref> By 2015, all 236 recommendations had been implemented.<ref name=Star>{{cite news|last1=Pelley|first1=Lauren|title=20 years after Russell Hill, Toronto's deadliest subway crash|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/08/10/20-years-after-russell-hill-torontos-deadliest-subway-crash.html|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe TTC acted quickly following the accident to repair the defective modified Ericsson train stops.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  They also began requiring drivers to traverse grade-timing sections at a speed that would allow them to actually see the red signal change before they left the section.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, the behaviour of the signals themselves was changed.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Now, when a signal is red (or double red) only because of grade timing, the (top) red light begins flashing once a train has passed the preceding signal that displayed the lunar white light.

There were between 200 and 300 passengers on the two trains, of whom three (Christina Munar Reyes, 33; Kinga Szabo, 43; and Xian Hui Lin, 23) were killed and 30 taken to hospital with injuries; about 100 more later filed injury claims against the TTC. Many of the seriously injured were extracted from the twisted remains of the most damaged subway cars by rescue workers who worked through the evening under extremely hot and humid conditions. Of the four crew members, three were taken to hospital with injuries.\n\n== Direct causes ==\nThe accident had two direct causes: first the inexperienced driver, Robert Jeffrey, who mistook the [[Toronto subway signals|signals]]; and the [[train stop]] which failed to protect the train due to a design error.\n\n=== Signals ===\n\n{{Main|Signals on the TTC}}\n[[File:Toronto-subway-lightbox-2006.jpg|thumb|Signal lightbox at a switch of the Toronto subway]]\nAt the time of the accident, the TTC subway used conventional wayside [[railway signal|signal]]s without [[cab signalling]].  Thus drivers were expected to remember each signal aspect and act accordingly until they receive new information from the following signal. As of 2019, the TTC has converted some sections of the line, including the Russell Hill portion, to more modern [[automatic train control]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ttc.ca/News/2019/May/12_05_19NR_atc_to_stpatrick.jsp | title=TTC's ATC signal upgrades extend to St Patrick Station}}</ref> The following description is limited to aspects relevant to the accident.\n\nSome signals are \"automatic\" and have a single head that shows one of the three basic colours.  Red means stop and stay (until presented with a less restrictive signal aspect), yellow means that the next signal is red and the driver should prepare to stop, and green means that the next signal is not red and it is safe to proceed at normal speed.\n\n\"Interlocking\" or \"home\" signals have a double head and show two coloured lights.  The top light has the same meaning as that of an automatic signal. The second light is red if the top light is red; otherwise it shows yellow if the [[railroad switch|switch]]es are set for a secondary route, and green for the main route or if no relevant switches exist. Thus the combination yellow over green means the same as a single yellow.\n\nAt locations such as downgrades, curves, and switches, the same signals additionally serve to enforce speed limits.  A system called \"grade timing\" regulates speeds, and is indicated by an additional \"lunar white\" light below the one or two coloured lights previously mentioned. The white light means that the next signal is red (or double red) ''only'' because of grade timing, and if the train approaches at the ''proper'' speed, the signal will clear to a less restrictive aspect before the train gets there. If the train goes too fast, it will pass the red signal and be stopped by the [[train stop]].\n\nIn 1995 the second signal did not provide any confirmation that it was about to change and the operator was expected to remember the previous signal aspect correctly.  With the tolerant attitudes of management, it had become common practice for operators to travel at the fastest speed that the system allowed, passing the signals at the same instant they were clearing.\n\nA long downgrade would therefore have several consecutive grade-timing sections. If all the signals were automatic and no trains were present, the first signal would be yellow over white, followed by a series of red over whites, and finally a red.  When the train approaches each red over white signal, it would clear to yellow over white and the train stop would be lowered; and the final red signal would clear to green.  Interlocking signals can also take part in grade timing, with aspects such as yellow over green over white (meaning the same as yellow over white).\n[[File:St Clair West southbound platform looking south at tracks and signal.jpg|thumb|Looking south from St. Clair West station. Signal '''SP77/X38''' can be seen showing red over red.]]\nFrom St. Clair West to Dupont the subway runs continuously downhill and grade timing is used.  The signal at the end of St. Clair West station, '''SP77/X38''', is an interlocking signal and therefore shows yellow over green over white whenever there is nothing to delay a train.  As Jeffrey's train passed the signal, however, it was showing yellow over green.  He should have stopped at the following signal, '''SP71''', which was red because another train was occupying the block ahead.\n\nAfter the accident Jeffrey said he remembered '''SP77/X38''' as yellow over white (actually an impossible aspect for that signal) therefore he must have either \"misremembered\" it at the time, or else have been fooled by some reflection off the signal head into thinking he had seen the usual yellow over green over white.  In any case, he believed that grade timing was in use and so approached signal '''SP71''' at the same speed as he would normally drive on this section.\n\nAfter this Jeffrey did not remember what he had seen, but it is easy to reconstruct the events.  When the train passed '''SP71''' without him seeing it change, he must have assumed that he had passed it just as it cleared. He continued coasting downhill, still thinking that he was under grade timing and violated the signal, without realizing that if this was true, the signal would have shown red over white as he approached.\n\nHe must therefore have expected the third signal, (the '''SP65''') to clear in the same way.  Again it was showing red, not red over white, but Jeffrey repeated his mistake and violated the signal. He braked only when he actually saw the train just ahead (it was stopped at the next signal, '''SP53'''); by then, a collision was unavoidable.\n\nNews media accounts of the accident often say that Jeffrey \"passed three red lights.\"  This count includes the repeater signal provided in advance of '''SP65''' because a curve in the tunnel interferes with sighting. Drivers are not expected to stop at the repeater even if it is red.\n\n=== Train stop ===\nThe \"trip\" or \"[[train stop]]\" consists of a T-shaped arm placed just outside the right-hand rail near each signal (except a repeater). If the signal is red (or double red), with or without a lunar white, the trip arm rises enough for its crossbar to strike a \"trip valve\" or \"tripcock\" lever on the bottom of a train's first car as it passes; and by doing so triggers the emergency brakes of the train.\n\nOn the relevant [[H-series (Toronto subway car)|class of trains]], the trip valve is located near the centre of the right side of the leading [[bogie]], where its position in relation to the rail is well controlled.\n\n[[Wismer and Becker, Inc.]], the contractors who installed the signal system on the Spadina line portion of the subway, chose to use an Ericsson [[train stop]] that was designed to have the trip arm located in the middle of the track.

However, with normal wear of the wheels and rails, and with the train rounding a curve at speed (and therefore riding off-centre) it was another matter.

It was also used in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], but was later replaced with the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[Th (digraph)|th]],'' except in [[Iceland]], where it survives. The letter originated from the [[runic alphabet|rune]] {{Runic|[[\u16a6]]}} in the [[Elder Fu\u00feark]] and was called ''thorn'' in the Anglo-Saxon and ''thorn'' or ''[[J\u00f6tunn|thurs]]'' in the Scandinavian [[rune poem]]s. <!-- UNSUPPORTED: Its reconstructed [[Proto-Germanic]] name is ''[[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]]''.--> It is similar in appearance to the archaic Greek letter [[Sho (letter)|sho (\u03f8)]], although the two are historically unrelated.\n\nIt is pronounced as either a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} or the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced counterpart of it]] {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}.

Both letters were used for the phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, sometimes by the same scribe. This sound was regularly realised in [[Old English#Phonology|Old English]] as the voiced fricative {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} between voiced sounds, but either letter could be used to write it; the modern use of {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic alphabets]] is not the same as the [[Old English#Orthography|Old English orthographic use]]. A thorn with the [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] crossed ([[Thorn with stroke|\ua764]]) was a popular abbreviation for the word ''[[that]]''.\n\n==== Middle and Early Modern English ====\n\nThe modern [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'' began to grow in popularity during the 14th century; at the same time, the shape of thorn grew less distinctive, with the letter losing its ascender (becoming similar in appearance to the old [[wynn]] ({{lang|ang|\u01f7, \u01bf}}), which had fallen out of use by 1300, and to ancient through modern ''P'', ''p''). In some hands, such as that of the scribe of the unique mid-15th-century manuscript of ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|The Boke of Margery Kempe]]'', it ultimately became indistinguishable from the letter Y. By this stage, ''th'' was predominant and the use of thorn was largely restricted to certain common words and abbreviations.

It was also used in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], but was later replaced with the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[Th (digraph)|th]],'' except in [[Iceland]], where it survives. The letter originated from the [[runic alphabet|rune]] {{Runic|[[\u16a6]]}} in the [[Elder Fu\u00feark]] and was called ''thorn'' in the Anglo-Saxon and ''thorn'' or ''[[J\u00f6tunn|thurs]]'' in the Scandinavian [[rune poem]]s. <!-- UNSUPPORTED: Its reconstructed [[Proto-Germanic]] name is ''[[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]]''.--> It is similar in appearance to the archaic Greek letter [[Sho (letter)|sho (\u03f8)]], although the two are historically unrelated.\n\nIt is pronounced as either a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} or the [[voiced dental fricative|voiced counterpart of it]] {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}.

Modern Icelandic usage generally excludes the latter, which is instead represented with the letter [[eth]] {{angbr|\u00d0, \u00f0}}; however, {{IPA|[\u00f0\u0320]}} may occur as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/\u03b8\u0320/}}, and written {{angle bracket|\u00fe}}, when it appears in an unstressed pronoun or adverb after a voiced sound.<ref name=\"Einarsson 1949\">{{cite book|last=Einarsson|first=Stef\u00e1n|title=Icelandic: Grammar, Texts, Glossary|year=1949|publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn [[typography]], the lowercase thorn [[glyph|character]] is unusual in that it has both an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] and a [[descender]] (other examples are lowercase [[Ef (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic \u0444]] and in some fonts, the Latin letter [[f]]).\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== English ===\n\n==== Old English ====\n\nThe letter thorn was used for writing [[Old English language|Old English]] very early on, as was [[\u00f0]]; unlike \u00f0, thorn remained in common use through most of the [[Middle English]] period. Both letters were used for the phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, sometimes by the same scribe. This sound was regularly realised in [[Old English#Phonology|Old English]] as the voiced fricative {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} between voiced sounds, but either letter could be used to write it; the modern use of {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic alphabets]] is not the same as the [[Old English#Orthography|Old English orthographic use]]. A thorn with the [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] crossed ([[Thorn with stroke|\ua764]]) was a popular abbreviation for the word ''[[that]]''.\n\n==== Middle and Early Modern English ====\n\nThe modern [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'' began to grow in popularity during the 14th century; at the same time, the shape of thorn grew less distinctive, with the letter losing its ascender (becoming similar in appearance to the old [[wynn]] ({{lang|ang|\u01f7, \u01bf}}), which had fallen out of use by 1300, and to ancient through modern ''P'', ''p''). In some hands, such as that of the scribe of the unique mid-15th-century manuscript of ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|The Boke of Margery Kempe]]'', it ultimately became indistinguishable from the letter Y. By this stage, ''th'' was predominant and the use of thorn was largely restricted to certain common words and abbreviations. In [[William Caxton]]'s pioneering printed English, it is rare except in an abbreviated ''the'', written with a thorn and a superscript E. This was the longest-lived use, though the substitution of Y for thorn soon became ubiquitous, leading to the common 'ye', as in '[[Ye Olde]] Curiositie Shoppe'. One major reason for this was that Y existed in the printer's type fonts that were imported from Germany or Italy, while thorn did not. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The word was never pronounced with a \"y\" sound, though, even when so written.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/ye-olde|title=ye-olde - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes {{!}} Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> The first printing of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] in 1611 used the Y form of thorn with a superscript E in places such as Job 1:9, John 15:1, and Romans 15:29.

Later, as AE3803 tries to find her way to the lungs to make the delivery, she discovers one of the bacteria has escaped and is planning an attack on the lungs, so she and U-1146 accompany each other to the lungs to pursue it. Upon reaching the lungs and parting ways with U-1146, AE3803 discovers Pneumococcus had been hiding in her package the entire time, waiting to target red blood cells for their nutrients. However, U-1146, who had caught onto the bacterium's plan, arrives in time and lures the bacterium into a trap, where he is ultimately sneezed out of the lungs.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Scrape Wound\n| TranslitTitle       = Surikizu\n| NativeTitle         = \u3059\u308a\u50b7\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|7|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = The red blood cells find themselves in trouble when the vessel they are travelling on is broken by a skin abrasion, with U-1146 and the other white blood cells forced to deal with all the germs that come through as a result.

Naive T Cell is filled with self-loathing until Dendritic Cell sees him and speaks to him kindly. This encouragement transforms him into Effector T Cell, a much braver and stronger form that joins the other immune cells in wiping out the influenza virus.

The stomach then gets invaded by a massive [[Anisakis]] parasite. The immune cells are no match for it, but Eosinophil explains she is designed to battle parasites and kills it with a single stab.

Though U-1146 points out the creatures are mindless and non-malicious, Memory Cell claims they bring impending doom. B Cell easily defeats the allergens, but Mast Cell releases a profuse amount of [[histamine]]s within the body, which causes violent allergic reactions that damage the surroundings.

One day, while practicing to evacuate from bacteria, she got lost and was separated from the others. She got captured by a ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' bacterium who intended to torture and kill her before moving on to other blood cells. A young [[Myelocyte]] came to her rescue, and although no match for the bacterium, bought enough time for Macrophage and a Neutrophil to arrive and kill the bacterium. She thanked the Myelocyte for helping her and they went their separate ways hoping to someday see each other again. In the present, she runs into U-1146. As he offers to guide her to her destination, she suspects the Myelocyte who saved her grew up to be U-1146.\n\t\nLater, U-1146 saves a Normal Cell from a Cancer Cell. The Normal Cell explains there are more Cancer Cells in his apartment complex. The Normal Cell leads U-1146, Killer T Cell, and NK Cell to his apartment, but Killer T Cell continually trades spats with NK Cell and stubbornly refuse working with her.

She got captured by a ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' bacterium who intended to torture and kill her before moving on to other blood cells. A young [[Myelocyte]] came to her rescue, and although no match for the bacterium, bought enough time for Macrophage and a Neutrophil to arrive and kill the bacterium. She thanked the Myelocyte for helping her and they went their separate ways hoping to someday see each other again. In the present, she runs into U-1146.
