Also noticeable was the Newton and Eden result where Newton ran in 12 tries but only managed to convert one of them. Goal kicking in general was relatively poor and was shared amongst the teams with it not uncommon to see 3 or 4 players used.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 22 June\n| time = 3:45\n| home = North Shore\n| score = 10\u20135\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n  | title = North Shore V City\n  | page = 8\n  | work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIII| issue=150\n  | date = 1912-06-24\n  | url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19120624.2.92\n  | accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>| away = City\n| try1 = E Rogers, [[Jim Griffen|Jim Griffin]]\n| con1 = E Rogers, C Clark\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = William Moeki\n| con2 = [[Alex Stanaway]]\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Devonport Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = Cunningham\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 22 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 38\u20130\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n  | title = Newton V Eden\n  | page = 8\n  | work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIII| issue=150\n  | date = 1912-06-24\n  | url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19120624.2.92\n  | accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>| away = Eden\n| try1 = Knowles 2, Alan Blakey 2, D Healy 4, Malcolm, Charles Brockliss, Tobin 2\n| con1 = Len Farrant\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Eden Park #

The Defense Forces are under overall leadership of the [[Ministry of Defense of Georgia|Minister of Defense of Georgia]] and directly headed by the [[Chief of Georgian Defense Forces|Chief of Defense Forces]].\n\nThe first regular military was established in the [[First Republic of Georgia|first Georgian Republic]] in 1918 and was in existence until after the republic's overthrow by the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|invading]] [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russian]] forces in 1921. The modern Georgian military were founded in accordance with the government decree of 24 April 1991. 30 April, the day when the first conscripts were called up for military service in 1991, has been celebrated as the day of the Georgian military forces.<ref name=\"agenda1\">{{cite news |title=Georgia marks Armed Forces Day |url=https://www.agenda.ge/en/news/2018/916 |accessdate=10 January 2019 |work=Agenda.ge |date=30 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe Georgian military have fought in the [[Georgian Civil War|civil war and separatist conflicts]] in the 1990s and the [[Russo-Georgian War]] of 2008 as well as major international military missions such as in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Georgia was one of the first former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] to join the [[NATO]] [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) in 2004 and has sought to bring its military in line with the NATO standards.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Georgian\u2013Armenian War 1918|Red Army invasion of Georgia|Georgian\u2013Ossetian conflict (1918\u20131920)|1991\u20131992 South Ossetia War|War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|Russo-Georgian War|Military history of Georgia}}\n\nThe [[Georgia Train and Equip Program]] (GTEP) training was conducted using [[U.S. Special Operations Forces]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] forces from May 2002 to May 2004. During this time approximately 2,600 Georgian soldiers, including a headquarters staff element and 5 tactical units, received training. Another assistance program, the [[Georgia Security and Stability Operations Program]] (Georgia SSOP), was launched in January 2005 as a continuation of the (GTEP) of 2002-2004. [[Georgian Kosovo contingent|Georgian contingents]] were involved in the [[Kosovo Force]] and continue to participate in the operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nThe DFG have been extensively reformed in the recent years to meet Georgia\u2019s aspirations to join NATO and for better response to the existing challenges such as the ongoing tensions in the unresolved separatist conflict areas in [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] as well as to the threats of global terrorism. Georgia also views a large-scale foreign invasion and the spillover of conflicts from Russia\u2019s [[North Caucasus]] as the worst potential near- and long-term scenarios, respectively.<ref>The Strategic Defense Review (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 2008 the Georgian military conducted an operation in Georgia's breakaway region [[South Ossetia]] (see [[2008 South Ossetia War]]). The operation led to an armed conflict with forces from the [[Russian Federation]] and resulted in the defeat and expulsion of Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following the military operations, Russia recognized independence of the regions, declared a decade ago.\n\nThe military budget of Georgia increased more than 50 times over the period from 2002 (US$18 mln.) to 2007 (US$780 mln.), reaching over 7% of Georgia's GDP. The military budget was then\ndoubled to the end of 2008 and currently since February 2009, counts 660 mln lari (US$366 mln.)\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n{{main article|Russo-Georgian War}}\n\nIn August 2008, following a series of fierce clashes in [[South Ossetia]], Georgia attempted to re-take the separatist territory by force. In the resulting military conflict with [[Russia]], Georgia was driven out of South Ossetia and [[Abkhazia]], and lost parts of its military capabilities.

Much of the captured equipment that was not subsequently destroyed got transferred to Russia or given to the separatists. Parts of Georgia's relatively modern artillery and anti-aircraft units were captured and later destroyed. Russian forces sank four Georgian naval vessels in the port of Poti, a coast guard gunboat in a naval skirmish, and hauled away nine rigid-hull inflatable boats. The Georgian Air Force lost two [[L-29]] jet trainers, one [[AN-2]] airplane, and four helicopters, all destroyed on the ground. Despite these mostly non combat losses, President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] claimed that Georgia had lost less than 5% of its military hardware, contradicting figures from the Georgian military itself.<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/5jZjEpcOy?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=33974</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n\nGeorgia immediately began a process of re-armament after the war.

NATO officially announced the complete support of the country's efforts in establishing the efficient military force that is required to defend the country against any regional threats and agreed on delivering high end sophisticated defense capabilities and boosting the overall quality of the GAF. The package also includes a group of NATO experts monitoring the process in order to control and ensure its successful implementation for the given time period. Further a large training center for joint military drills will be constructed. NATO did not state that it would directly arm the GAF but fully assist in acquiring requested military hardware and that it would lift the general arms embargo on Georgia that was in effect since 2008. After the last major conflict with Russia, Georgia repeatedly was denied the delivery of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons and other heavy equipment despite heavy shortage on said weapons and numerous demands and harsh criticism from both the former and current ruling parties.\n\nAlmost immediately after the summit US defense secretary Chuck Hagel announced during his visit to Georgia that the US will start providing long requested UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters which is an arrangement reportedly outside the NATO package. Russia reacted very critical to the plan of building an international training center in Georgia claiming it would bring instability to the region. The statement was denied by NATO reminding that Georgia is a [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]] member and already provides similar capabilities such as an alpine warfare school for NATO and partner nations.<ref>http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_38988.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/u-s-to-strengthen-its-military-cooperation-with-georgia-34788|title=U.S. to strengthen its military cooperation with Georgia|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-enlargement/nato-to-draw-up-measures-to-bring-georgia-closer-to-alliance-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625|title=NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/20406/eng|title=NATO chief details package to \"bring Georgia closer\" to Alliance|website=agenda.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.2758750|title=CBC News - U.S., Georgia strengthen defence ties over Russian aggression|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-georgia-nato-idUKKCN0I60SB20141017|title=Defying Russia, Georgia to host NATO training centre - minister|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27100|title=Civil.Ge - NATO, Georgian FMs Hold Meeting|first=Civil|last=Georgia|website=www.civil.ge}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative to MAP ===\nDespite knowing that there would not be any newcomers announced during the Wales summit, the Georgian government was confident that their country would at least receive the Membership Action Plan, which is the primary precondition for aspirant nations to become NATO member.

The aim was to create two independently acting military districts which would consist of forces in accordance to the strategic value of their deployment areas yet being balanced in their type of equipment. In case of war each group will be able to coordinate its operations independently from high command, having its own logistical and administrative reserves.\n\n===Special Operations Forces===\n{{main article|Georgian Special Operations Forces}}\n\nThe Special Operations Forces of the Defence Forces of Georgia were established to conduct unconventional warfare and the full spectrum of special operation missions. They also serve in supporting capacity for regular military forces, primarily in the areas of education and training.\n\nTheir structure is as follows:\n\n*Finance and Accounting Service\n*Headquarters\n*[[File:Special Forces Group.png|31px]] Special Operations Forces\n** Special Operations Battalion East\n** Special Operations Battalion West \n*[[File:Special Forces School PNG.png|31px]] Special Operations Training Center named after Major Gela Chedia\n*Staff Company\n\nGeorgian special forces became first active in 1999 as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]. Georgian commandos participated in the [[Iraq War]] from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an [[2008 South Ossetia War|escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia]]. According to independent accounts, a number of Georgian operatives were also deployed prior in Afghanistan to aide US Special Forces in hunting down [[Taliban]] leaders. Georgian officials have stated that a group of servicemen were deployed in Afghanistan for medical purposes.\n\n=== Army Air Section (former Air Force) ===\n[[File:Su-25ub.JPG|thumb|Georgian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground attack aircraft]]\n{{main article|Georgian Air Force}}\nThe Strategic Defence Review in 2007 described the Air Force consists of aviation and air defence assets and provides security to Georgia\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe Georgian Air Force was merged into the Army in 2010, and was renamed the Army Air Section, undergoing massive reorganization and restructuring. The additional operative section of the [[Georgian Land Forces]] currently consists of an unknown amount of planes, transport helicopters, gunships and 3,000 personnel. The Georgian Air Force lost two helicopters and a number of transport and trainer aircraft on ground during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]],\n\nTwo major airfields are located near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Alekseevka, Georgia|Alekseevka]] and [[Marneuli]].\n\n=== Georgian Coast Guard (Former Naval Force) ===\n{{main article|Georgian Navy}}\nIn 2007 the Strategic Defence Review said the Georgian Navy protects Georgia\u2019s territorial waters and contributes to the collective maritime defence in the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Georgian Navy was abolished in 2009 and was incorporated into the Coast Guard, which is not structurally part of the Defense Forces, but rather it is a subunit of the Border Guard of Georgia, which is under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  The [[Coast Guard of Georgia]] is responsible for maintenance of the sovereignty of the country and for protection of internal territorial waters and economic zones. The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Poti]].\n\n[[File:Georgian coast guard in the port of Batumi.jpg|thumb|Georgian [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] vessels]]\nThe other, smaller Coast Guard base is in [[Batumi]]. Besides the naval force, the navy also includes a Special Counter-terrorist Detachment force. Georgia is also one of the founding members and a participant of the [[Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group]]. Before the war with Russia, the Georgian navy had 19 naval vessels. 4 of them were sunk during the conflict, and nine rigid-hull inflatables were captured by Russia. The Georgians raised and returned to service two of the sunken vessels, and partially replaced their losses with Turkish-built patrol/fast attack boats. Their heaviest armaments are 25\u221230mm cannons. However, no Georgian navy vessels are armed with ship-to-ship missiles.\n\n=== National Guard of Georgia ===\nThe [[National Guard of Georgia]] was established on December 20, 1990 and was manned mainly by volunteers. It represents the first Georgian armed formation, which became the base of the foundation for modern Defense Forces of Georgia. The Guard actively participated in the conflicts that occurred in Georgian territory (Samachablo, Abkhazia).\n\nThe National Guard used to consist of 20,554 personnel, but has now been reduced to 550. The main missions of the National Guard are:\n\n#Support civil government in crisis situations (natural, technological, ecological);\n#Register mobilization resources, study and deliver;\n#Convene, select and man of citizens on the basis of the agreement, for the units, subunits and bases of the Defense Forces;\n#Provide ceremonial activity support;\n#Assisting in training the Reserve Forces.\n\n=== Army Reserve and Territorial Defence Forces ===\n\nThe Army Reserve is a professional reserve force consisting of former regular army personnel only. Due to the amount of experience, the Reserve personnel would be set-in for replacement of losses in the ranks of regular formations and will if needed also operate in the vanguard of a combined mechanized group or an infantry assault.\n\nThe Territorial Defence Forces were established for immediate readiness of the population in crisis events, such as war. Its main goals would be the fortification and defence of all populated and strategically important areas as well as providing quick aid or security for evacuation operations in case of natural catastrophes.\n\nOther than the active army reserve which consists of only ex military personnel, the Territorial Defence Forces are rather sparsely prepared for complex military operations. It instead provides more comfort for the regular forces in case of war. By acting as additional logistical arm and leaving the actual combat to them. With the land forces and reserve army engaged in direct action the Defence Force's most important task would be to construct trenches, bunkers and obstacles around strategically important areas and position themselves on systematically formed defensive lines. The number of conscripts does not exceed 140,000 and is reasonably large, as it is in the strategy's intention to use any possible geographical advantage over the enemy, when professionalism is compensated by that factor.\n\nThe TDF reservist is comparably poorly equipped for modern warfare. The number of combat, protection gear and supplies will be most likely limited in the event of war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare.

From 2004 in Iraq were 300 Georgian troops. From 2005 approximately 850 troops were serving under Coalition Command ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] and [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq|UNAMI]]). On July 2007 Georgia sent an extra 1,400 troops to [[Iraq]]; that brought the total number of troops in Iraq to 2,000. About 300 of these troops were assigned to Taskforce Petro and stationed at COP Cleary outside the town of Wahida near Salman Pak, Iraq. On August 8, 2008 Georgia announced it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq due to rising hostilities with Russia. Their preparedness and training skills are evaluated on highest level by international experts. The entire Iraq contingent has been airlifted back to Georgia.\n\nHence, owing to participation in international [[peacekeeping]] missions the military members are able to obtain practical experience and to show readiness to cooperate with [[NATO]] and with other partner countries' forces.\n\nCurrently there are more than 1,570 Georgian combat troops  deployed in [[Helmand]], [[Afghanistan]] where Georgia has thus far suffered 22 deaths and over a hundred injuries.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23895 Tenth Georgia Soldier Killed in Afghanistan] Retrieved: September 1, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Seth Robson |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-training-a-dual-mission-for-georgians-1.136920 |title=U.S. training a dual mission for Georgians |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> In September 2012, Georgia stated that it would continue its contributions in Afghanistan following the 2014 NATO withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2012_new_army_military_defence_industry/georgia_will_continue_its_contribution_for_nato_mission_in_afghanistan_in_post-2014_period_1009122.html Georgia keeps helping Afghanistan] - Armyrecognition.com, September 10, 2012</ref>\nIn November 2012, Georgia had doubled the number of troops deployed to fight with Nato-led forces in Afghanistan to over 1,500.

More recent developments however have their roots in the Soviet Union. In 1941 Georgia became one of the most important Soviet weapon manufacturing countries during the [[Second World War]]. It was responsible for providing the Soviet Army with all types of aircraft and ammunition. [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]]'s role didn't change after the war. Up until 1990 Georgia was producing various types of fighter aircraft, most notably the [[Su-25]] since it was produced almost exclusively in Georgia, unmanned areal vehicles, missiles, satellite components and orbital satellites. The company lost most of its functionality and production capability when the Soviet Union dissolved, yet was not abandoned. In the late 1990s Georgia's JSC RMP and later the newly established Ministry of Defence section [[STC Delta|\"Delta\"]] started to work on the development of ballistic equipment using their own ingredients. The advanced research unit had successfully developed a variety of personal protection gear, such as bomb disposal suits and level I-IV body armour using classified mixtures of domestic resource. These projects never went beyond some prototypes, mainly due to poor attention and financing from the government.\n\nWith foreign support primarily from the United States since 2005, Georgia became able to start building a solid industrial base for the military. From 2001 to 2007, Delta experimented with unmanned aerial vehicles and modified parts for helicopters and Su-25 aircraft until it got involved in the modification of Georgia's T-72 tank fleet. In 2009-10, with enough experience and expertise and the assistance of designer [[Zviad Tsikolia]], Delta created its first prototype of an armored personnel carrier, the [[Didgori Armoured Personnel Carrier|Didgori]]. Early tests were highly successful so that its first production line started already in 2011.  Two versions would initially serve in the armed forces in 2012, followed by different modifications from 2013 on. The [[Lazika]] is Delta's attempt to manufacture a suitable modular infantry fighting vehicle created for multiple tasks. While still under development, some Lazikas are already in active service. Delta considers the Lazika as one of the best vehicles of its class bearing armour technology similar to that of Israel. The remotely operated systems are locally produced as well. Due to \"misdirected financing\" and heavy interfering of former government officials, project Lazika was temporarily cancelled in late 2012, also due to \"sabotage\" and shortcomings in its armour research, but then later continued in early 2013 when a newly elected government took charge. \n\nAs of 2007 Georgia has been domestically producing uniforms for its military personnel. Early products were of poor quality, and such shortcomings were only corrected beginning in 2012. Since then only high quality fabrics are licensed for use. Other main production lines include various types of artillery systems such as [[MLRS]], mortars and corresponding ammunition, anti-tank weapons and devices, full uniform sets for ceremonies and for all service branches, including boots, hats, assault vests, pouches, and backpacks. New kind of ballistic vests and helmets have been developed and produced for military service since 2013. The Georgian production uses techniques based on know-how from aerospace research whose methods differ slightly yet significantly from foreign ones. Among the first units to use these new items is the peacekeeping contingent currently stationed in the Central African Republic.\n\n== Bases ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Location\n|-\n|Ministry of Defence Headquarters\n|[[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Vaziani Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Krtsanisi National Training Centre|Krtsanisi Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Akhalkalaki Military Base\n|[[Akhalkalaki]]\n|-\n|Alekseevka Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Marneuli Airbase\n|[[Marneuli]]\n|-\n|Bolnisi Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Gori Military Base\n|[[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]\n|-\n|Senaki Military Base\n|[[Senaki]]\n|-\n|Poti naval base\n|[[Poti]]\n|-\n|Mukhrovani Military Base\n|[[Mukhrovani]]\n|-\n|Kutaisi Military Base\n|[[Kutaisi]]\n|-\n|Khelvachauri Military Base\n|[[Khelvachauri]]\n|-\n|Khoni Military Base\n|[[Khoni]]\n|-\n|Batumi naval base\n|[[Batumi]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Georgia and NATO]]\n*[[Modern equipment of the Georgian Army]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{StateDept}} 2005\n{{CIA World Factbook|year=2005}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Denise Hammick, Country Briefing: Georgia On the Cusp, [[Jane's Defence Weekly]], 2 January 2008\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Military of Georgia}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052953/http://www.geo-army.ge/ geo-army.ge, an information website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121207132407/http://www.mod.gov.ge/2007/downloads/The_Strategic_Defence_Review(www.mod.gov.ge).pdf Ministry of Defence of Georgia: The Strategic Defence Review 2007.] ''mod.gov.ge''.

NATO officially announced the complete support of the country's efforts in establishing the efficient military force that is required to defend the country against any regional threats and agreed on delivering high end sophisticated defense capabilities and boosting the overall quality of the GAF. The package also includes a group of NATO experts monitoring the process in order to control and ensure its successful implementation for the given time period. Further a large training center for joint military drills will be constructed. NATO did not state that it would directly arm the GAF but fully assist in acquiring requested military hardware and that it would lift the general arms embargo on Georgia that was in effect since 2008. After the last major conflict with Russia, Georgia repeatedly was denied the delivery of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons and other heavy equipment despite heavy shortage on said weapons and numerous demands and harsh criticism from both the former and current ruling parties.\n\nAlmost immediately after the summit US defense secretary Chuck Hagel announced during his visit to Georgia that the US will start providing long requested UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters which is an arrangement reportedly outside the NATO package. Russia reacted very critical to the plan of building an international training center in Georgia claiming it would bring instability to the region. The statement was denied by NATO reminding that Georgia is a [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]] member and already provides similar capabilities such as an alpine warfare school for NATO and partner nations.<ref>http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_38988.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/u-s-to-strengthen-its-military-cooperation-with-georgia-34788|title=U.S. to strengthen its military cooperation with Georgia|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-enlargement/nato-to-draw-up-measures-to-bring-georgia-closer-to-alliance-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625|title=NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/20406/eng|title=NATO chief details package to \"bring Georgia closer\" to Alliance|website=agenda.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.2758750|title=CBC News - U.S., Georgia strengthen defence ties over Russian aggression|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-georgia-nato-idUKKCN0I60SB20141017|title=Defying Russia, Georgia to host NATO training centre - minister|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27100|title=Civil.Ge - NATO, Georgian FMs Hold Meeting|first=Civil|last=Georgia|website=www.civil.ge}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative to MAP ===\nDespite knowing that there would not be any newcomers announced during the Wales summit, the Georgian government was confident that their country would at least receive the Membership Action Plan, which is the primary precondition for aspirant nations to become NATO member.

The aim was to create two independently acting military districts which would consist of forces in accordance to the strategic value of their deployment areas yet being balanced in their type of equipment. In case of war each group will be able to coordinate its operations independently from high command, having its own logistical and administrative reserves.\n\n===Special Operations Forces===\n{{main article|Georgian Special Operations Forces}}\n\nThe Special Operations Forces of the Defence Forces of Georgia were established to conduct unconventional warfare and the full spectrum of special operation missions. They also serve in supporting capacity for regular military forces, primarily in the areas of education and training.\n\nTheir structure is as follows:\n\n*Finance and Accounting Service\n*Headquarters\n*[[File:Special Forces Group.png|31px]] Special Operations Forces\n** Special Operations Battalion East\n** Special Operations Battalion West \n*[[File:Special Forces School PNG.png|31px]] Special Operations Training Center named after Major Gela Chedia\n*Staff Company\n\nGeorgian special forces became first active in 1999 as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]. Georgian commandos participated in the [[Iraq War]] from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an [[2008 South Ossetia War|escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia]]. According to independent accounts, a number of Georgian operatives were also deployed prior in Afghanistan to aide US Special Forces in hunting down [[Taliban]] leaders. Georgian officials have stated that a group of servicemen were deployed in Afghanistan for medical purposes.\n\n=== Army Air Section (former Air Force) ===\n[[File:Su-25ub.JPG|thumb|Georgian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground attack aircraft]]\n{{main article|Georgian Air Force}}\nThe Strategic Defence Review in 2007 described the Air Force consists of aviation and air defence assets and provides security to Georgia\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe Georgian Air Force was merged into the Army in 2010, and was renamed the Army Air Section, undergoing massive reorganization and restructuring. The additional operative section of the [[Georgian Land Forces]] currently consists of an unknown amount of planes, transport helicopters, gunships and 3,000 personnel. The Georgian Air Force lost two helicopters and a number of transport and trainer aircraft on ground during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]],\n\nTwo major airfields are located near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Alekseevka, Georgia|Alekseevka]] and [[Marneuli]].\n\n=== Georgian Coast Guard (Former Naval Force) ===\n{{main article|Georgian Navy}}\nIn 2007 the Strategic Defence Review said the Georgian Navy protects Georgia\u2019s territorial waters and contributes to the collective maritime defence in the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Georgian Navy was abolished in 2009 and was incorporated into the Coast Guard, which is not structurally part of the Defense Forces, but rather it is a subunit of the Border Guard of Georgia, which is under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  The [[Coast Guard of Georgia]] is responsible for maintenance of the sovereignty of the country and for protection of internal territorial waters and economic zones. The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Poti]].\n\n[[File:Georgian coast guard in the port of Batumi.jpg|thumb|Georgian [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] vessels]]\nThe other, smaller Coast Guard base is in [[Batumi]]. Besides the naval force, the navy also includes a Special Counter-terrorist Detachment force. Georgia is also one of the founding members and a participant of the [[Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group]]. Before the war with Russia, the Georgian navy had 19 naval vessels. 4 of them were sunk during the conflict, and nine rigid-hull inflatables were captured by Russia. The Georgians raised and returned to service two of the sunken vessels, and partially replaced their losses with Turkish-built patrol/fast attack boats. Their heaviest armaments are 25\u221230mm cannons. However, no Georgian navy vessels are armed with ship-to-ship missiles.\n\n=== National Guard of Georgia ===\nThe [[National Guard of Georgia]] was established on December 20, 1990 and was manned mainly by volunteers. It represents the first Georgian armed formation, which became the base of the foundation for modern Defense Forces of Georgia. The Guard actively participated in the conflicts that occurred in Georgian territory (Samachablo, Abkhazia).\n\nThe National Guard used to consist of 20,554 personnel, but has now been reduced to 550. The main missions of the National Guard are:\n\n#Support civil government in crisis situations (natural, technological, ecological);\n#Register mobilization resources, study and deliver;\n#Convene, select and man of citizens on the basis of the agreement, for the units, subunits and bases of the Defense Forces;\n#Provide ceremonial activity support;\n#Assisting in training the Reserve Forces.\n\n=== Army Reserve and Territorial Defence Forces ===\n\nThe Army Reserve is a professional reserve force consisting of former regular army personnel only. Due to the amount of experience, the Reserve personnel would be set-in for replacement of losses in the ranks of regular formations and will if needed also operate in the vanguard of a combined mechanized group or an infantry assault.\n\nThe Territorial Defence Forces were established for immediate readiness of the population in crisis events, such as war. Its main goals would be the fortification and defence of all populated and strategically important areas as well as providing quick aid or security for evacuation operations in case of natural catastrophes.\n\nOther than the active army reserve which consists of only ex military personnel, the Territorial Defence Forces are rather sparsely prepared for complex military operations. It instead provides more comfort for the regular forces in case of war. By acting as additional logistical arm and leaving the actual combat to them. With the land forces and reserve army engaged in direct action the Defence Force's most important task would be to construct trenches, bunkers and obstacles around strategically important areas and position themselves on systematically formed defensive lines. The number of conscripts does not exceed 140,000 and is reasonably large, as it is in the strategy's intention to use any possible geographical advantage over the enemy, when professionalism is compensated by that factor.\n\nThe TDF reservist is comparably poorly equipped for modern warfare. The number of combat, protection gear and supplies will be most likely limited in the event of war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare. The weapons trained on are mainly of soviet origin and abandoned material used formerly by the regular land forces, including tanks. Such weapons are the AK series assault rifles and the [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled launchers.\n\n=== Commissioned officers ===\n{{Main article|Officer (armed forces)}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|}\n\n== International cooperation ==\n[[File:Georgian Army - Operations abroad since 1991.png|thumb|Operations abroad since 1991.]]\n[[File:GeorgianArmy.jpg|thumb|Georgian troops listening to a speech in Baghdad, Iraq]]\n\nThe Defense Forces have been participating in peacekeeping missions (the [[Balkans]], [[Persian Gulf]]) since 1999.\n\nUnits participating in peacekeeping missions are manned by professional soldiers, the duration of the mission is six months and participation is voluntary. The readiness assessment criteria are, as follows: health condition, physical fitness, professional skills and experience.\n\n=== Peacekeeping missions ===\n[[File:U.S. Marines and Georgian Army soldiers conduct operation Northern Lion II, Part I 130703-M-YH552-0074.jpg|thumb|right|Georgian soldiers during Operation Northern Lion II, Afghanistan]]\n{{Main article|Role of Georgia in the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Role of Georgia in the Iraq War}}\n\nAbout 200 Georgian troops were deployed in the Kosovo ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) in 1999\u20132008, 70 were deployed in Iraq ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]]) in 2003 and 50 in Afghanistan in 2004 ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]). From 2004 in Iraq were 300 Georgian troops. From 2005 approximately 850 troops were serving under Coalition Command ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] and [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq|UNAMI]]). On July 2007 Georgia sent an extra 1,400 troops to [[Iraq]]; that brought the total number of troops in Iraq to 2,000. About 300 of these troops were assigned to Taskforce Petro and stationed at COP Cleary outside the town of Wahida near Salman Pak, Iraq. On August 8, 2008 Georgia announced it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq due to rising hostilities with Russia. Their preparedness and training skills are evaluated on highest level by international experts. The entire Iraq contingent has been airlifted back to Georgia.\n\nHence, owing to participation in international [[peacekeeping]] missions the military members are able to obtain practical experience and to show readiness to cooperate with [[NATO]] and with other partner countries' forces.\n\nCurrently there are more than 1,570 Georgian combat troops  deployed in [[Helmand]], [[Afghanistan]] where Georgia has thus far suffered 22 deaths and over a hundred injuries.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23895 Tenth Georgia Soldier Killed in Afghanistan] Retrieved: September 1, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Seth Robson |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-training-a-dual-mission-for-georgians-1.136920 |title=U.S. training a dual mission for Georgians |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> In September 2012, Georgia stated that it would continue its contributions in Afghanistan following the 2014 NATO withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2012_new_army_military_defence_industry/georgia_will_continue_its_contribution_for_nato_mission_in_afghanistan_in_post-2014_period_1009122.html Georgia keeps helping Afghanistan] - Armyrecognition.com, September 10, 2012</ref>\nIn November 2012, Georgia had doubled the number of troops deployed to fight with Nato-led forces in Afghanistan to over 1,500.

More recent developments however have their roots in the Soviet Union. In 1941 Georgia became one of the most important Soviet weapon manufacturing countries during the [[Second World War]]. It was responsible for providing the Soviet Army with all types of aircraft and ammunition. [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]]'s role didn't change after the war. Up until 1990 Georgia was producing various types of fighter aircraft, most notably the [[Su-25]] since it was produced almost exclusively in Georgia, unmanned areal vehicles, missiles, satellite components and orbital satellites. The company lost most of its functionality and production capability when the Soviet Union dissolved, yet was not abandoned. In the late 1990s Georgia's JSC RMP and later the newly established Ministry of Defence section [[STC Delta|DELTA]] started to work on the development of ballistic equipment using their own ingredients. The advanced research unit had successfully developed a variety of personal protection gear, such as bomb disposal suits and level I-IV body armour using classified mixtures of domestic resource. These projects never went beyond some prototypes, mainly due to poor attention and financing from the government.\n\nWith foreign support primarily from the United States since 2005, Georgia became able to start building a solid industrial base for the military. From 2001 to 2007, Delta experimented with unmanned aerial vehicles and modified parts for helicopters and Su-25 aircraft until it got involved in the modification of Georgia's T-72 tank fleet. In 2009-10, with enough experience and expertise and the assistance of designer [[Zviad Tsikolia]], Delta created its first prototype of an armored personnel carrier, the [[Didgori Armoured Personnel Carrier|Didgori]]. Early tests were highly successful so that its first production line started already in 2011.  Two versions would initially serve in the armed forces in 2012, followed by different modifications from 2013 on. The [[Lazika]] is Delta's attempt to manufacture a suitable modular infantry fighting vehicle created for multiple tasks. While still under development, some Lazikas are already in active service. Delta considers the Lazika as one of the best vehicles of its class bearing armour technology similar to that of Israel. The remotely operated systems are locally produced as well. Due to \"misdirected financing\" and heavy interfering of former government officials, project Lazika was temporarily cancelled in late 2012, also due to \"sabotage\" and shortcomings in its armour research, but then later continued in early 2013 when a newly elected government took charge. \n\nAs of 2007 Georgia has been domestically producing uniforms for its military personnel. Early products were of poor quality, and such shortcomings were only corrected beginning in 2012. Since then only high quality fabrics are licensed for use. Other main production lines include various types of artillery systems such as [[MLRS]], mortars and corresponding ammunition, anti-tank weapons and devices, full uniform sets for ceremonies and for all service branches, including boots, hats, assault vests, pouches, and backpacks. New kind of ballistic vests and helmets have been developed and produced for military service since 2013. The Georgian production uses techniques based on know-how from aerospace research whose methods differ slightly yet significantly from foreign ones.

It is used throughout the [[Hebrew Bible]] in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, kings, priests and prophets, the altar in the Temple, vessels, unleavened bread, and even a non-Jewish king (Cyrus the Great).<ref>[[Tanakh]] verses:\n*{{Bibleverse|1 Samuel|10:1-2|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|1 Kings|1:39|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Leviticus|4:3|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Exodus|40:9-11|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Numbers|6:15|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|45:1|HE}}\n</ref>\n\nIn [[Jewish eschatology]], the term came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|king]] from the Davidic line, who will be \"anointed\" with holy anointing oil, to be king of [[God's kingdom]], and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be [[God]] or a pre-existent divine [[Son of God]]. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David. That is why he is referred to as [[Messiah ben David]], which means \"Messiah, son of David\". The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|publisher=Jewfaq.org|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:3-4|HE}}</ref>\n\nBelief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMaimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:\n{{quote|And if a king shall arise from among the House of David, studying Torah and occupied with commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will impel all of Israel to follow it and to strengthen breaches in its observance, and will fight God's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded and built the Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: \"For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all proclaim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9).\"<ref>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4</ref>}}\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\"/>\n\nA common modern [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The [[Talmud]], which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|95:7|HE}}</ref>\n\nA [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace, Messiah ben David, will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then [[Armilus]], according to one group of sources, or [[Gog and Magog]], according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Messiah |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah |year=1906 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Chabad ===\n{{further information|Chabad messianism|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies|List of Jewish messiah claimants}}\n[[File:Psak din messiah.jpg|thumb|right|Chabad Halachic ruling declaring \"every single Jew\" had to believe in the imminent second coming of the deceased 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe as the Messiah<ref name=\"DVED-250\"/>]]\n\n[[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth ''[[Rebbe]]'' (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch,<ref name=\"LubavitcherFalseMessiahs\"/><ref name=\"MS-HabadMinuth\"/> and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh ''Rebbe'' of Chabad,<ref name=\"SHandelman\">Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.

It is used throughout the [[Hebrew Bible]] in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, kings, priests and prophets, the altar in the Temple, vessels, unleavened bread, and even a non-Jewish king (Cyrus the Great).<ref>[[Tanakh]] verses:\n*{{Bibleverse|1 Samuel|10:1-2|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|1 Kings|1:39|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Leviticus|4:3|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Exodus|40:9-11|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Numbers|6:15|HE}}\n*{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|45:1|HE}}\n</ref>\n\nIn [[Jewish eschatology]], the term came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|king]] from the Davidic line, who will be \"anointed\" with holy anointing oil, to be king of [[God's kingdom]], and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be [[God]] or a pre-existent divine [[Son of God]]. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David. That is why he is referred to as [[Messiah ben David]], which means \"Messiah, son of David\". The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|publisher=Jewfaq.org|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:3-4|HE}}</ref>\n\nBelief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMaimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:\n{{quote|And if a king shall arise from among the House of David, studying Torah and occupied with commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will impel all of Israel to follow it and to strengthen breaches in its observance, and will fight God's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded and built the Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: \"For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all proclaim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9).\"<ref>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4</ref>}}\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\"/>\n\nA common modern [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The [[Talmud]], which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|95:7|HE}}</ref>\n\nA [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace, Messiah ben David, will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then [[Armilus]], according to one group of sources, or [[Gog and Magog]], according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Messiah |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah |year=1906 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Chabad ===\n{{further information|Chabad messianism|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies|List of Jewish messiah claimants}}\n[[File:Psak din messiah.jpg|thumb|right|Chabad Halachic ruling declaring \"every single Jew\" had to believe in the imminent second coming of the deceased 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe as the Messiah<ref name=\"DVED-250\"/>]]\n\n[[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth ''[[Rebbe]]'' (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch,<ref name=\"LubavitcherFalseMessiahs\"/><ref name=\"MS-HabadMinuth\"/> and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh ''Rebbe'' of Chabad,<ref name=\"SHandelman\">Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.
