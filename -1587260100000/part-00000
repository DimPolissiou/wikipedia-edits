In 1346, the attacking army experienced an epidemic of bubonic plague. The Italian chronicler Gabriele de\u2019 Mussi, in his ''Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Domini 1348'', describes quite plausibly how the plague was transmitted by the Mongols by throwing diseased cadavers with catapults into the besieged city, and how ships transporting Genovese soldiers, fleas and rats fleeing from there brought it to the Mediterranean ports. Given the highly complex epidemiology of plague, this interpretation of the Black Death (which might have killed >25 million people in the following years throughout Europe) as stemming from a specific and localized origin of the Black Death remains controversial.

In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicaemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.<ref name=\"Byrne2004pp21-9\">{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=21\u201329}}</ref> In 2014, [[Public Health England]] announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed in the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n\n==Recurrences==\n\n=== Second plague pandemic ===\n{{Main|Second plague pandemic}}\n[[File:Great plague of london-1665.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Great Plague of London]], in 1665, killed up to 100,000 people.]]\n\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2EBkPNnUXEC&pg=PA25 The Great Plague]'' {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401124035/https://books.google.com/books?id=x2EBkPNnUXEC&pg=PA25 |date=1 April 2019 }}.
