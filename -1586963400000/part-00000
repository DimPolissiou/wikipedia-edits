{"title_page": "Symphony No. 3 (Ch\u00e1vez)", "text_new": "{{Use Harvard referencing|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Concha Ac\u00fastica of Bello Monte.jpg|thumb|Anfiteatro Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lamas, Caracas, where Ch\u00e1vez's Third Symphony was premiered]]\nThe '''Symphony No. 3''' by [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]] was composed in 1951\u201354 on a commission from [[Clare Boothe Luce]], and is dedicated to the memory of her daughter, Anne Clare Brokaw.\n\n==History==\nCh\u00e1vez had evidently met former U.S. congresswoman, ambassador, publisher, playwright, and journalist Clare Boothe Luce in Florence at some point in the late 1940s. An unlikely friendship sprang up between them, which continued for nearly three decades. In February 1950 Luce came to Mexico City for a week of cultural exploration, and on 18 February 1950 wrote on a scrap of newspaper a commission for a musical work (initially envisioned as a piano concerto), \"for Ann Clare Brokaw the most beautiful and sad and gay thing you ever wrote that has her lovely face and my broken heart in it\". Brokaw, who had died as the result of an automobile accident in 1944 at the age of nineteen, was Mrs. Luce's only child, from her first marriage {{harv|Parker|1984|loc=48\u201349}}.\n\nComposition of the Third Symphony began in 1951, but was interrupted repeatedly. After completing the first movement and a large part of the second, Ch\u00e1vez fell ill. By the time he recovered, there were more urgent deadlines requiring Ch\u00e1vez to put the score aside in order to work on the [[Symphony No. 4 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fourth]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fifth Symphonies]], both of which were completed before the Third. In April 1954 Ch\u00e1vez resumed work, completing the piano score on 14 June and the full score by the end of the same month ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=152\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Parker|1984|loc=65}}). It was premiered in the Anfiteatro [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lamas]] in Caracas, Venezuela, by the [[Venezuela Symphony Orchestra|Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Venezuela]], conducted by the composer. According to {{harvtxt|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=80}}, this was on 9 December 1954, though others put the date at 11 December 1954 ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=153}}; {{harvnb|Weinstock|1959|loc=15}}). It received further performances, in Europe in June 1955 at the [[International Society for Contemporary Music|I.S.C.M. Festival]] in Baden-Baden (in an orchestral concert conducted by [[Ernest Bour]]), in London with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro]] (29 November 1955), and in the United States, with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the composer's baton (26 January 1956) ({{harvnb|Copland|1955|loc=10}}; {{harvnb|Mitchell|1956|loc=34}}; {{harvnb|Reizenstein|1955|loc=8}}; {{harvnb|Taubman|1956}}). Thanks to the efforts of his friend [[Aaron Copland]], Ch\u00e1vez was able to secure a contract with Boosey & Hawkes in 1955, and the Third Symphony was the first of his works published by that firm {{harv|Parker|1987|loc=436\u201337}}.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (three players), harp, and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe Third Symphony consists of four movements:\n#Introduzione: Andante moderato\n#Allegro\n#Scherzo\n#Finale\n\nThe opening movement introduces a number of thematic elements that will be developed throughout the symphony\u2014a procedure known as [[cyclic form]] {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=73}}. The character at the outset is dramatic and tense, recalling somewhat the \"Greek\" style of the ''[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]'' and the ballet ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=154\u201355}}. Later in the movement (at rehearsal-number 16), a jarring contrast is created when Ch\u00e1vez introduces a universally familiar five-note children's chant, a figure that is also found in a number of the composer's contemporaneous and earlier works\u2014the Fourth Symphony, the choral works ''Tierra mojada'' and ''Llamadas'', and the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor]]''\u2014whose presence here may be explained by a hidden program connected to the terms of the Symphony's commission {{harv|Parker|1991|loc=160\u201364}}.\n\nAfter the slow first movement, the fast tempo and [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]] design of the second movement more closely resembles the traditional opening movement of a symphony. This Allegro is the main focus of the symphony because of the solidity of its formal structure and its greater length than the other movements {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=74}}. To describe it as a sonata-allegro, however, refers to its character but not its form, which is both simple and original. Ch\u00e1vez replaces the usual [[Exposition (music)|exposition]]\u2013[[Musical development|development]]\u2013[[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] with two alternating sections, each of which occurs three times. Development occurs during the appearances of the second of these, through either the reappearance of motives from the first section, or the production from them of variants {{harv|Orb\u00f3n|1987b|loc=89}}.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''The Six Symphonies of Carlos Ch\u00e1vez''.

An unlikely friendship sprang up between them, which continued for nearly three decades. In February 1950 Luce came to Mexico City for a week of cultural exploration, and on 18 February 1950 wrote on a scrap of newspaper a commission for a musical work (initially envisioned as a piano concerto), \"for Ann Clare Brokaw the most beautiful and sad and gay thing you ever wrote that has her lovely face and my broken heart in it\". Brokaw, who had died as the result of an automobile accident in 1944 at the age of nineteen, was Mrs. Luce's only child, from her first marriage {{harv|Parker|1984|loc=48\u201349}}.\n\nComposition of the Third Symphony began in 1951, but was interrupted repeatedly. After completing the first movement and a large part of the second, Ch\u00e1vez fell ill. By the time he recovered, there were more urgent deadlines requiring Ch\u00e1vez to put the score aside in order to work on the [[Symphony No. 4 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fourth]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fifth Symphonies]], both of which were completed before the Third. In April 1954 Ch\u00e1vez resumed work, completing the piano score on 14 June and the full score by the end of the same month ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=152\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Parker|1984|loc=65}}). It was premiered in the Anfiteatro [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lamas]] in Caracas, Venezuela, by the [[Venezuela Symphony Orchestra|Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Venezuela]], conducted by the composer. According to {{harvtxt|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=80}}, this was on 9 December 1954, though others put the date at 11 December 1954 ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=153}}; {{harvnb|Weinstock|1959|loc=15}}). It received further performances, in Europe in June 1955 at the [[International Society for Contemporary Music|I.S.C.M. Festival]] in Baden-Baden (in an orchestral concert conducted by [[Ernest Bour]]), in London with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro]] (29 November 1955), and in the United States, with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the composer's baton (26 January 1956) ({{harvnb|Copland|1955|loc=10}}; {{harvnb|Mitchell|1956|loc=34}}; {{harvnb|Reizenstein|1955|loc=8}}; {{harvnb|Taubman|1956}}). Thanks to the efforts of his friend [[Aaron Copland]], Ch\u00e1vez was able to secure a contract with Boosey & Hawkes in 1955, and the Third Symphony was the first of his works published by that firm {{harv|Parker|1987|loc=436\u201337}}.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (three players), harp, and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe Third Symphony consists of four movements:\n#Introduzione: Andante moderato\n#Allegro\n#Scherzo\n#Finale\n\nThe opening movement introduces a number of thematic elements that will be developed throughout the symphony\u2014a procedure known as [[cyclic form]] {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=73}}. The character at the outset is dramatic and tense, recalling somewhat the \"Greek\" style of the ''[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]'' and the ballet ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=154\u201355}}.

It was officially titled '''Demolitions on Reich Territory Decree''' (''Befehl betreffend Zerst\u00f6rungsma\u00dfnahmen im Reichsgebiet'') and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree, after the Roman Emperor [[Nero]], who supposedly engineered the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 AD.

However, Hitler was not willing to accept the terms of [[unconditional surrender]], and considered this as repeating the same shame of [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]].<ref name=\"Wired\"/>\n\n[[File:American soldiers watch as the Tricolor flies from the Eiffel Tower again.jpg|thumb|upright|American soldiers look at the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]] flying from the Eiffel Tower]]\nThis was not the first time Hitler had tried to destroy infrastructure before it could be taken. Shortly before the [[Liberation of Paris]], Hitler ordered explosives to be placed around important landmarks, such as the [[Eiffel Tower]], and key transportation hubs. If the Allies came near the city, the military governor, [[Dietrich von Choltitz]] was to detonate these bombs, leaving Paris \"lying in complete debris.\"<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0000BH4NK/ |title=''...

The enemy will leave us nothing but [[scorched earth]] when he withdraws, without paying the slightest regard to the population. I therefore order:\n\n: \"1) All military transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments and supply depots, as well as anything else of value within Reich territory, which could in any way be used by the enemy immediately or within the foreseeable future for the prosecution of the war, will be destroyed.\"<ref name=\"Roper 1971\">[[Hugh R.

The responsibility for carrying it out fell to [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production. Speer was appalled by the order and lost faith in the dictator. Just as von Choltitz had several months earlier, Speer deliberately failed to carry out the order. Upon receiving it, he requested to be given exclusive power to implement the plan, instead using his power to convince the generals and ''Gauleiters'' to ignore the order. Hitler remained unaware of this until the very end of the war, when Speer, while visiting Hitler in his Berlin bunker, admitted to him that he deliberately disobeyed.<ref>Hamsher (Wiliam), Albert Speer / Victim of Nuremberg ?, Londres, Frewin, 1970; Schmidt (Matthias), Albert Speer / Das Ende eines Mythos, Munich, Scherz, 1982</ref> Hitler was angry with his minister, but allowed Speer to leave nonetheless. Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945, 42 days after issuing the order.

It was officially titled '''Demolitions on Reich Territory Decree''' (''Befehl betreffend Zerst\u00f6rungsma\u00dfnahmen im Reichsgebiet'') and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree, after the Roman Emperor [[Nero]], who supposedly engineered the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 AD. The decree was deliberately disobeyed by [[Albert Speer]].\n\n== Background ==\nBy the beginning of 1945, the German situation was desperate.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72855 | work=Wired | title=March 19, 1945: Blow It All Up | date=19 March 2007}}</ref> Most of the conquered territories had been liberated or recaptured, the [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes Offensive]] had failed, and Allied armies were advancing on Germany proper from both the [[Eastern Front of World War II|East]] and the [[Western Front of World War II|West]]. However, Hitler was not willing to accept the terms of [[unconditional surrender]], and considered this as repeating the same shame of [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]].<ref name=\"Wired\"/>\n\n[[File:American soldiers watch as the Tricolor flies from the Eiffel Tower again.jpg|thumb|upright|American soldiers look at the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]] flying from the Eiffel Tower]]\nThis was not the first time Hitler had tried to destroy infrastructure before it could be taken. Shortly before the [[Liberation of Paris]], Hitler ordered explosives to be placed around important landmarks, such as the [[Eiffel Tower]], and key transportation hubs. If the Allies came near the city, the military governor, [[Dietrich von Choltitz]] was to detonate these bombs, leaving Paris \"lying in complete debris.\"<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0000BH4NK/ |title=''...

The enemy will leave us nothing but [[scorched earth]] when he withdraws, without paying the slightest regard to the population. I therefore order:\n\n: \"1) All military transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments and supply depots, as well as anything else of value within Reich territory, which could in any way be used by the enemy immediately or within the foreseeable future for the prosecution of the war, will be destroyed.\"<ref name=\"Roper 1971\">[[Hugh R.

The responsibility for carrying it out fell to [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production. Speer was appalled by the order and lost faith in the dictator. Just as von Choltitz had several months earlier, Speer deliberately failed to carry out the order. Upon receiving it, he requested to be given exclusive power to implement the plan, instead using his power to convince the generals and ''Gauleiters'' to ignore the order. Hitler remained unaware of this until the very end of the war, when Speer, while visiting Hitler in his Berlin bunker, admitted to him that he deliberately disobeyed.<ref>Hamsher (Wiliam), Albert Speer / Victim of Nuremberg ?, Londres, Frewin, 1970; Schmidt (Matthias), Albert Speer / Das Ende eines Mythos, Munich, Scherz, 1982</ref> Hitler was angry with his minister, but allowed Speer to leave nonetheless. Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945, 42 days after issuing the order. Shortly afterwards, on May 7, 1945, General [[Alfred Jodl]] signed the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German military surrender]], and on May 23 Speer was arrested on the orders of U.S. General [[Dwight D.

The SESI Rio units spread throughout the state offer an infrastructure conducive to leisure, sports, health and culture to society.\n\nIn addition to the actions carried out in its unities, the entity conducts the program ''Global Action'', a campaign that provides services to populations in need of basic services in the areas of health (such as eye examination and identification of blood type), citizenship (such as [[Cadastro de Pessoas F\u00edsicas|CPF]] issuing and legal advice) leisure, culture and sports (such as handicrafts, choral presentation and sports activities). In communities pacified by the [[Pacifying Police Unit|UPP]], the [[SESI Citizenship]] program makes a similar work, i.e., promotes education, sports, leisure and culture to the locals, only permanently and ''in loco''.\n\nWhen the goal is to foment access to art, ''Cultural SESI Rio'' steps in. It is a program that offers music, theater, dance and other activities at popular prices. Noteworthy are the ''SESI's X-Everything Cultural'', annual event that promotes various artistic events with free admission, and the ''SESI In Jazz Festival'', gathering which unites renowned artists and new talents of Jazz.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn order to foment the Brazilian industry, in 1831 it was founded the ''Helper Society of the National Industry'' (Sain).<ref group=\"note\">It marks \"the origin of the class representation of the industrial sector in Brazil\" and, in the 1870s, it sponsored the first Industrial School in Brazil (the one that about one century later became [[SENAI]]).</ref><ref name=\"Livro 170\"/> This [[private company]] has served for 50 years as an advisory body to the [[Federal Government]], especially in economic affairs of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. In 1850 \u2013 with the extinction of the Board of Trade, Agriculture, Factories and Navigation \u2013 Sain also became plants and [[invention]]s organ granting, which Sain itself considered an obstacle to industrial development.\n\nDiscontented, industrials associated with Sain requested review of statutes and policies so that they met their interests. In Rio, who defended the interests of the textile sector was the ''Industrial Center of Cotton Spinning and Weaving'', but it lacked a body that would unify all representatives of the domestic industry.

But the big change came a few years later, when Vargas took power in 1930.\n\nTo meet both the workers and the entrepreneurs, he created the ''Ministry of Labour, Industry and Commerce'', an industrial [[nationalist]] policy.\n* <u>Benefits for workers</u>: through new legislation, he set the [[working time]] in eight hours and regulated the labor of women and children. He also created [[social insurance]] institutes and transformed simple labour into [[wage labour]];\n* <u>Benefits for businessmen</u>: he invested in industries, new technologies and diversification of the economy, going against the dominant [[oligarchies]].\n\n=== The birth of the entities ===\n\nIn 1931, the ''Industrial Center of Brazil (CIB)'' became the ''Industrial Federation of Rio de Janeiro (Firj)'' to represent Rio de Janeiro's [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] class. Less than two years later the ''Industrial Confederation of Brazil'' (who inherited the acronym ''CIB'') was founded, and in 1938, it became the ''National Confederation of Industry''.<ref group=\"note\">CNI now coordinates 27 industrial federations (of the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District) and represents about 1,300 employer's syndicates.

Immediately after the World War II, Dutra requested CNI to create the ''Industry Social Service (SESI)'' \u2013 to improve the conditions of workers in areas such as housing, health and transport, aiming at [[social inclusion]] and [[citizenship]] \u2013 and the ''National Industrial Training Service (SENAI)'' \u2013 to \"imbue workers with the work ethic by which industrials love to be guided\", i.e., order, dedication and commitment.

The two-year project evaluated a new model of health service delivery where chiropractors are integrated as staff practitioners into a teaching hospital.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1839937 Deborah Kopansky-Giles, FCCS(C), FICC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The project was deemed a success and as of June 2007 Kopansky-Giles and Igor Steinman, FCCS(C) have both been given permanent funding and have been integrated into the primary care staff at the hospital.\n\nFurthermore, chiropractic doctors are now working on Family Health Teams and Community Health Centres as interdisciplinary models of care and an increased focus on wellness and preventative health evolve as the new paradigm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/fht/guides/fht_inter_provider.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108184259/http://www.health.gov.on.ca./transformation/fht/guides/fht_inter_provider.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Research: Academic integration ==\n\n===Consortium of University-Based Research Centres===\nThe Consortium of Canadian Chiropractic Research Centres (CCCRC), established in 1998 by the Canadian Chiropractic Association (The CCA) represents research collaborations with many universities and institutions across the country. The CCCRC currently comprises the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College and twelve university-based research sites where chiropractic researchers either hold faculty appointments or are taking advanced research training. The CCCRC facilitates inter-disciplinary research and has sponsored four significant research symposia since its inception.\n\nThe CCRC, partnered with the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) have successly developed the University Chiropractic Research Chairs where chiropractic scientists study manual medicine and public health measures.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.ccachiro.org/Client/cca/cca.nsf/web/Chiropractic%20Research?OpenDocument Chiropractic Research<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426202358/http://www.ccachiro.org/Client/cca/cca.nsf/web/Chiropractic%20Research?OpenDocument |date=2007-04-26 }}</ref>\n\n===International collaboration===\n\nThe Canadian Chiropractic Association is an affiliate member of the Canadian Cochrane Network and Centre and a representative of the chiropractic profession serves on the Executive Committee of the Network. The Cochrane Collaboration, established in the United Kingdom in 1993, is an international organization whose mission is to prepare, maintain and promote the accessibility of systematic reviews of the effects of health care interventions.  The CCA also participates in international projects such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s Bone and Joint Decade Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders which is conducting multi-disciplinary, international studies.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===The Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College===\n\nThe Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) has been recognized as an international leader in chiropractic research for more than five decades. Over the years, members of CMCC's faculty have developed collaborative research relationships with faculty at many academic institutions in North America. CMCC and the profession also participate in inter-professional health policy development. An example of this is the 2003 award of almost $2 million by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to faculty at CMCC for a primary care project to develop a model of collaborative, inter-disciplinary practice.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Researchers===\nThe profession's researchers are funded by many premier agencies such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Health Canada, Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Industry Canada, Alberta Provincial CIHR Training Program in Bone and Joint Health, and the Canada Primary Care Transition Fund, to name a few. The profession's researchers undertake broad-based, substantive research in biomedical and clinical sciences, health systems and services, and in social cultural areas, and they are widely published in both chiropractic and non-chiropractic peer-reviewed journals. Some of these journals include the New England Journal of Medicine, the Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, Arthritis and Rheumatism, British Medical Journal, Canadian Medical Association Journal, Spine, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the Clinical Journal of Pain, the Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association and the [[Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Building a research culture===\nOne of the primary goals of the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation (CCRF) is to support chiropractors to obtain their Masters and PhD degrees and support their research projects. This is one of the ways in which the profession continually nurtures a chiropractic research culture that will inform the quality of care. The Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) has also partnered with the profession to fund doctoral and fellowship awards.  The training of chiropractic researchers through sponsored PhD programs will enable the profession to further develop the research leadership to ensure continued research into chiropractic health care. A national community of full-time research scholars in chiropractic will ensure that Canadians benefit from high quality, evidence-based care.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Chiropractic research agenda===\nIn 2000, the Canadian Chiropractic Association began a complex process to establish a national chiropractic research agenda in Canada. This process is funded in part by four CIHR Institutes: the Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis, the Institute of Aging, the Institute of Neuroscience, Mental Health and Addiction, and the Institute of Population and Public Health.\n\n===University chairs in chiropractic===\nThe Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation has established a university Research Chair program, jointly funded with the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR), which currently funds Chiropractic research in 12 different public universities across Canada.<ref name=CCRF>{{cite journal|journal= Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation|year= 2012|title= Research Chairs and Professorships|url= http://www.canadianchiropracticresearchfoundation.com/research-chairs--professorships.html|access-date= 2012-12-02|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121107123722/http://www.canadianchiropracticresearchfoundation.com/research-chairs--professorships.html|archive-date= 2012-11-07|url-status= dead}}</ref> Greg Kawchuk was the first member of the profession to be awarded a university-based Chiropractic Research Chair.

Jean-S\u00e9bastien Blouin has been named to the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation (CCRF) Professorship in Spine Biomechanics and Neurophysiology at the University of British Columbia (UBC). This five-year, full-time tenure tracked position for a DC begins with an initial investment of $500,000 and is funded by the CCRF, UBC, the British Columbia Chiropractic Association (BCCA) and the British Columbia College of Chiropractors (BCCC).  Martin Descarreaux has been named to the Chiropractic Research Chair at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec a Trois Rivi\u00e8res. The Fondation de Recherche Chiropratique du Qu\u00e9bec and Platinum Systems, a firm specializing in clinical management software, are both contributing to finance the Chair. Descarreaux is a full-time professor at UQTR teaching clinical biomechanics. In collaboration with the Department of Kinesiology, he is currently studying the effect of muscular fatigue and pain on the control of head and neck movements. Descarreaux is also pursuing research on low back pain and is conducting a study on low back muscle fatigue and neuromuscular control of lumbar stability.  The profession's Research Chair program will significantly build the profession's intellectual research capacity and help Canadians live healthier lives.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn June 2007, Jill Hayden became the profession's newest Chiropractic Research Chair and will take up the CCRF/CIHR Chair at the Toronto Western Research Institute.
