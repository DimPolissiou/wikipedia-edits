{"title_page": "Inverse problem", "text_new": "{{For|the use in [[geodesy]]|Inverse geodetic problem}}\n\nAn '''inverse problem''' in science is the process of calculating from a set of observations the [[causal]] factors that produced them: for example, calculating an image in [[X-ray computed tomography]], source reconstruction in acoustics, or calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of its [[gravity field]]. It is called an inverse problem because it starts with the effects and then calculates the causes. It is the inverse of a forward problem, which starts with the causes and then calculates the effects.\n\nInverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe. They have wide application in [[system identification]], [[optics]], [[radar]], [[acoustics]], [[communication theory]], [[signal processing]], [[medical imaging]], [[computer vision]], [[geophysics]], [[oceanography]], [[astronomy]], [[remote sensing]], [[natural language processing]], [[machine learning]], [[nondestructive testing]], and many other fields.\n\n==History==\nStarting with the effects to discover the causes has concerned physicists for centuries. A historical example is the calculations of [[John Couch Adams|Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]] which led to the discovery of [[Neptune]] from the perturbed trajectory of [[Uranus]]. However, a formal study of inverse problems was not initiated until the 20th century.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a solution to an inverse problem was discovered by [[Hermann Weyl]] and published in 1911, describing the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weyl |first=Hermann |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |title=\u00dcber die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte |journal=Nachrichten der K\u00f6niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen |pages=110\u2013117 |year=1911 |access-date=2018-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801090504/http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |archive-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Today known as ''[[Weyl's law]]'', it is perhaps most easily understood as an answer to the question of whether it is possible to [[Hearing the shape of a drum|hear the shape of a drum]]. Weyl conjectured that the eigenfrequencies of a drum would be related to the area and perimeter of the drum by a particular equation, a result improved upon by later mathematicians.\n\nThe field of inverse problems was later touched on by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] physicist, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]].<ref>[http://ambartsumian.ru/en/papers/epilogue-ambartsumian\u2019-s-paper/ \u00bb Epilogue \u2014 Ambartsumian\u2019 s paper Viktor Ambartsumian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A life in astrophysics.

He then asked: given a family of eigenvalues, is it possible to find the form of the equations whose eigenvalues they are? Essentially Ambartsumian was examining the inverse [[Sturm\u2013Liouville problem]], which dealt with determining the equations of a vibrating string. This paper was published in 1929 in the German physics journal ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'' and remained in obscurity for a rather long time. Describing this situation after many decades, Ambartsumian said, \"If an astronomer publishes an article with a mathematical content in a physics journal, then the most likely thing that will happen to it is oblivion.\"\n\nNonetheless, toward the end of the Second World War, this article, written by the 20-year-old Ambartsumian, was found by Swedish mathematicians and formed the starting point for a whole area of research on inverse problems, becoming the foundation of an entire discipline.\n\nThen important efforts have been devoted to a \"direct solution\" of the inverse scattering problem especially by [[Marchenko equation|Gelfand and Levitan]] in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Burridge |first1=Robert |title=The Gelfand-Levitan, the Marchenko, and the Gopinath-Sondhi integral equations of inverse scattering theory, regarded in the context of inverse impulse-response problems |journal=Wave Motion |date=1980 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013323 |doi=10.1016/0165-2125(80)90011-6 }}</ref> They proposed an analytic constructive method for determining the solution.  When computers became available, some authors have investigated the possibility of applying their approach to similar problems such as the inverse problem in the 1D wave equation. But it rapidly turned out that the inversion is an unstable process : noise and errors can be tremendously amplified making a direct solution hardly practicable.\nThen, around the seventies, the least-squares and probabilistic approaches came in and turned out to be very helpful for the determination of parameters involved in various physical systems. This approach met a lot of success. Nowadays inverse problems are also investigated in fields outside physics, such as chemistry, economy, and computer science. Eventually, as numerical models invade the whole society, we may expect an inverse problem associated with each of these numerical models.\n\n==Conceptual understanding==\nSince Newton, scientists have extensively attempted to model the world. In particular, when a [[mathematical model]] is available (for instance, Newton's gravitational law or Coulomb's equation for electrostatics), we can foresee, given some parameters that describe a physical system (such as a distribution of mass or a distribution of electric charges), the behavior of the system. This approach is known as mathematical modeling and the above-mentioned physical parameters are called the '''model parameters''' or simply the '''model'''. To be precise, we introduce the notion of '''state of the physical system''': it is the solution of the mathematical model's equation. In [[Optimal control|optimal control theory]], these equations are referred to as the [[State-space representation|state equations]]. In many situations we are not truly interested in knowing the physical state but just its effects on some objects (for instance, the effects the gravitational field on a specific planet). Hence we have to introduce another operator, called the '''observation operator''', which converts the state of the physical system (here the predicted gravitational field) into what we want to observe (here the movements of the considered planet). We can now introduce the so-called '''forward problem''', which consists of two steps:\n* determination of the state of the system from the physical parameters that describe it\n* application of the observation operator to estimated state of the system so as to predict the behavior of what we want to observe.\nThis leads to introduce another [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] <math>F</math> ('''''F''''' stands for \"forward\") which maps model parameters <math>p</math> into <math>F(p)</math>, the data that model <math>p</math> predicts that is the result of this two-step procedure. Operator <math>F</math> is called '''forward operator''' or '''forward map'''.\nIn this approach we basically attempt at predicting the effects knowing the causes.\n\nThe table below shows, the Earth being considered as the physical system and for different physical phenomena, the model parameters that describe the system, the physical quantity that describes the state of the physical system and observations commonly made on the state of the system. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Governing equations !! Model parameters !! State of the physical system !! Common observations on the system\n|-\n| [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravity]] || Distribution of mass || [[Gravitational field]] || Measurement made by [[gravimeter]]s at different surface locations\n|-\n| [[Maxwell's equations]] || Distribution of [[magnetic susceptibility]] || [[Magnetic field]] ||Magnetic field measured at different surface locations by [[magnetometer]]s (case of a steady state) ||\n|-\n| [[Wave equation]] || Distribution of wave-speeds and densities || Wave-field caused by artificial or natural [[seismic source]]s || [[Particle velocity]] measured by seismometers placed at different surface locations\n|-\n| [[Diffusion equation]] || Distribution of [[Mass diffusivity|Diffusion coefficient]] || Diffusing material concentration as a function of space and time || Monitoring of this concentration measured at different locations\n|}\nIn the inverse problem approach we, roughly speaking, try to know the causes given the effects.\n\n==General statement of the inverse problem==\nThe inverse problem is the \"inverse\" of the forward problem : we want to determine the model parameters that produce the data <math>d_{obs}</math> that is the observation we have recorded (the subscript '''''obs ''''' stands for observed).\nSo that we look for the model parameters <math>p</math> such that (at least approximately)\n:<math>\\ d_{obs} = F(p)</math>\nwhere <math>F</math> is the forward map. We denote by <math>M</math> the number (possibly infinite) of model parameters, and by <math>N</math> the number of recorded data.\nWe introduce some useful concepts and the associated notations that will be used in the sequel :\n* The '''space of models''' denoted by <math>P</math> : the [[vector space]] spanned by model parameters; it has <math>M</math> dimensions;\n* The '''space of data''' denoted by <math>D</math> : <math>D=\\mathbb{R}^N</math> if we organize the measured samples in a vector with <math>N</math> components (if our measurements consist of functions, <math>D</math> is a vector space with infinite dimensions);\n* <math>F(p)</math> : the '''response of model'''   <math>p</math>; it consists of the '''data predicted by model''' <math>p</math>;\n* <math>F(P)</math> : the image of <math>P</math> by the forward map, it is a subset of <math>D</math> (but not a subspace unless <math>F</math> is linear) made of responses of all models;\n* <math>d_{obs}-F(p)</math> : the '''data misfits (or residuals)''' associated with model  <math>p</math> : they can be arranged as a vector, an element of <math>D</math>.\nThe concept of residuals is very important : in the scope of finding a model that matches the data, '''their analysis reveals if the considered model can be considered as realistic or not'''. Systematic unrealistic discrepancies between the data and the model responses also reveals that the forward map is inadequate and may give insights about an improved forward map.\n\nWhen operator <math>F</math> is linear, the inverse problem is linear. Otherwise, that is most often, the inverse problem is nonlinear.\nAlso, models cannot always be described by a finite number of parameters. It is the case when we look for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed parameters]] (a distribution of wave-speeds for instance): in such cases the goal of the inverse problem is to retrieve one or several functions. Such inverse problems are inverse problems with infinite dimension.\n\n==<span id=\"Linear inverse problem\"></span>Linear inverse problems==\nIn the case of a linear forward map and when we deal with a finite number of model parameters, the forward map can be written as a [[linear system]]\n:<math>\\ d = Fp</math>\nwhere <math>F</math> is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that characterizes the forward map.\n\n===An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field===\nOnly a few physical systems are actually linear with respect to the model parameters. One such system from geophysics is that of the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]]. The Earth's gravitational field is determined by the density distribution of the Earth in the subsurface. Because the [[lithology]] of the Earth changes quite significantly, we are able to observe minute differences in the Earth's gravitational field on the surface of the Earth. From our understanding of gravity (Newton's Law of Gravitation), we know that the mathematical expression for gravity is:\n:<math>d= \\frac{G p}{r^2};</math>\nhere <math>d</math> is a measure of the local gravitational acceleration, <math>G</math> is the [[Gravitational acceleration|universal gravitational constant]], <math>p</math> is the local mass (which is related to density) of the rock in the subsurface and <math>r</math> is the distance from the mass to the observation point.\n\nBy discretizing the above expression, we are able to relate the discrete data observations on the surface of the Earth to the discrete model parameters (density) in the subsurface that we wish to know more about. For example, consider the case where we have measurements carried out at 5 locations on the surface of the Earth. In this case, our data vector, <math>d</math> is a column vector of dimension (5x1): its <math>i</math>th component is associated with the <math>i</math>th observation location.  We also know that we only have five unknown masses <math>p_j</math> in the subsurface (unrealistic but used to demonstrate the concept) with known location : we denote by <math>r_{ij}</math> the distance between the <math>i</math>th observation location and the <math>j</math>th mass. Thus, we can construct the linear system relating the five unknown masses to the five data points as follows:\n:<math>d = F p, \\,</math>\n:<math>d =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nd_1 \\\\\nd_2 \\\\\nd_3 \\\\\nd_4 \\\\\nd_5 \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>p =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\np_1 \\\\\np_2 \\\\\np_3 \\\\\np_4 \\\\\np_5\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>F =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{G}{r_{11}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{12}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{13}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{14}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{15}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{21}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{22}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{23}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{24}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{25}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{31}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{32}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{33}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{34}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{35}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{41}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{42}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{43}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{44}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{45}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{51}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{52}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{53}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{54}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{55}^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nTo solve for the model parameters that fit our data, we might be able to invert the matrix <math>F</math> to directly convert the measurements into our model parameters. For example:\n:<math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math>\nA system with five equations and five unknowns is a very specific situation : our example was designed to end up with this specificity. In general, the numbers of data and unknowns are different so that matrix <math>F</math> is not square.\n\nHowever, even a square matrix can have no inverse : matrix <math>F</math> can be [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] deficient (i.e. has zero eigenvalues) and the solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> is not unique. Then the solution of the inverse problem will be undetermined. This is a first difficulty. Over-determined systems (more equations than unknowns) have other issues.\nAlso noise may corrupt our observations making <math>d</math> possibly outside the space <math>F(P)</math> of possible responses to model parameters so that solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> may not exist. This is another difficulty.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the first difficulty ====\nThe first difficulty reflects a crucial problem: Our observations do not contain enough information and additional data are required. Additional data can come from physical '''prior information''' on the parameter values, on their spatial distribution or, more generally, on their mutual dependence. It can also come from other experiments: For instance, we may think of integrating data recorded by gravimeters and seismographs for a better estimation of densities. \nThe integration of this additional information is basically a problem of [[statistics]]. This discipline is the one that can answer the question: How to mix quantities of different nature? We will be more precise in the section \"Bayesian approach\" below.\n\nConcerning distributed parameters, prior information about their spatial distribution often consists of information about some derivatives of these distributed parameters. Also, it is common practice, although somewhat artificial, to look for the \"simplest\" model that reasonably matches the data. This is usually achieved by [[Penalty method|penalizing]] the [[Lp space|<math>L^1</math> norm]] of the gradient (or the [[total variation]]) of the parameters (this approach is also referred to as the maximization of the entropy). One can also make the model simple through a parametrization that introduces freedom degrees only when necessary.\n\nAdditional information may also be integrated through inequality constraints on the model parameters or some functions of them. Such constraints are important to avoid unrealistic values for the parameters (negative values for instance). In this case, the space spanned by model parameters will no longer be a vector space but a '''subset of admissible models''' denoted by <math>P_{adm}</math> in the sequel.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the second difficulty ====\nAs mentioned above, noise may be such that our measurements are not the image of any model, so that we cannot look for a model that produces the data but rather look for [[model selection|the best (or optimal) model]]: that is, the one that best matches the data. This leads us to minimize an [[objective function]], namely a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]  that quantifies how big the residuals are or how far the predicted data are from the observed data. Of course, when we have perfect data (i.e. no noise) then the recovered model should fit the observed data perfectly. A standard objective function, <math>\\varphi</math>, is of the form:\n:<math>\\varphi(p) = \\|F p-d_{obs} \\|^2 \\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\| \\| \\,</math> is the Euclidean norm (it will be the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math> norm]] when the measurements are functions instead of samples) of the residuals. This approach amounts to making use of [[Least squares|ordinary least squares]], an approach widely used in statistics. However, the Euclidean norm is known to be very sensitive to outliers: to avoid this difficulty we may think of using other distances, for instance the <math>L^1</math> norm, in replacement of the <math>L^2</math> norm.\n\n==== Bayesian approach ====\nVery similar to the least-squares approach is the probabilistic approach: If we know the statistics of the noise that contaminates the data, we can think of seeking the most likely model m, which is the model that matches the [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood criterion]]. If the noise is [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], the maximum likelihood criterion appears as a least-squares criterion, the Euclidean scalar product in data space being replaced by a scalar product involving the [[Covariance|co-variance]] of the noise. Also, should prior information on model parameters be available, we could think of using [[Bayesian inference]] to formulate the solution of the inverse problem. This approach is described in detail in Tarantola's book.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tarantola |first1=Albert |title=Inverse problem theory |url=https://archive.org/details/inverseproblemth0000tara |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780444599674 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of our elementary example ====\nHere we make use of the Euclidean norm to quantify the data misfits. As we deal with a linear inverse problem, the objective function is quadratic. For its minimization, it is classical to compute its gradient using the same rationale (as we would to minimize a function of only one variable). At the optimal model <math>p_{opt}</math>, this gradient vanishes which can be written as :\n:<math>\\nabla_p \\varphi = 2(F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} - F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs}) = 0 \\,</math>\nwhere ''F''<sup>T</sup> denotes the [[matrix transpose]] of ''F''. This equation simplifies to:\n:<math>F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} = F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs} \\,</math>\n\nThis expression is known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Normal_equations&redirect=no normal equation] and gives us a possible solution to the inverse problem. \nIn our example matrix <math>F^\\mathrm{T} F</math> turns out to be generally full rank so that the equation above makes sense and determines uniquely the model parameters : we do not need integrating additional information for ending up with a unique solution.\n\n=== Mathematical and computational aspects ===\n\nInverse problems are typically ill posed, as opposed to the [[well-posed problem]]s usually met in mathematical modeling. Of the three conditions for a [[well-posed problem]] suggested by [[Jacques Hadamard]] (existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution or solutions) the condition of stability is most often violated. In the sense of [[functional analysis]], the inverse problem is represented by a mapping between [[metric space]]s. While inverse problems are often formulated in infinite dimensional spaces, limitations to a finite number of measurements, and the practical consideration of recovering only a finite number of unknown parameters, may lead to the problems being recast in discrete form. In this case the inverse problem will typically be ''[[condition number|ill-conditioned]]''. In these cases, [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] may be used to introduce mild assumptions on the solution and prevent [[overfitting]]. Many instances of regularized inverse problems can be interpreted as special cases of [[Bayesian inference]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ipgp.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/Books/InverseProblemTheory.pdf|title=Inverse Problem Theory and Methods for Model Parameter Estimation|pages=i\u2013xii|first=Albert|last=Tarantola|publisher=SIAM|doi=10.1137/1.9780898717921.fm|chapter=Front Matter|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89871-572-9}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of the optimization problem ====\nSome inverse problems have a very simple solution, for instance, when one has a set of [[unisolvent functions]], meaning a set of {{tmath|n}} functions such that evaluating them at {{tmath|n}} distinct points yields a set of [[linearly independent]] vectors. This means that given a linear combination of these functions, the coefficients can be computed by arranging the vectors as the columns of a matrix and then inverting this matrix. The simplest example of unisolvent functions are polynomials constructed, using the [[unisolvence theorem]], so as to be unisolvent. Concretely, this is done by inverting the [[Vandermonde matrix]]. But this a very specific situation.\n\nIn general, the solution of an inverse problem requires sophisticated optimization algorithms. When the model is described by a large number of parameters (the number of unknowns involved in some diffraction tomography applications can reach one billion), solving the linear system associated with the normal equations can be cumbersome. The numerical method to be used for solving the optimization problem depends in particular on the cost required for computing the solution  <math>F p</math> of the forward problem. Once chosen the appropriate algorithm for solving the forward problem (a straightforward matrix-vector multiplication may be not adequate when matrix <math>F</math> is huge), the appropriate algorithm for carrying out the minimization can be found in textbooks dealing with numerical methods for the solution of linear systems and for the minimization of quadratic functions (see for instance Ciarlet<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ciarlet |first1=Philippe |title=Introduction \u00e0 l'analyse num\u00e9rique matricielle et \u00e0 l'optimisation |date=1994 |publisher=Masson |location=Paris |isbn=9782225688935}}</ref> or Nocedal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |title=Numerical optimization |date=2006 |publisher=Springer}}</ref>).\n\nAlso, the user may wish to add physical constraints to the models: In this case, they have to be familiar with [[Constrained optimization|constrained optimization methods]], a subject in itself. In all cases, computing the gradient of the objective function often is a key element for the solution of the optimization problem. As mentioned above, information about the spatial distribution of a distributed parameter can be introduced through the parametrization. One can also think of adapting this parametrization during the optimization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ben Ameur |first1=Hend |last2=Chavent |first2=Guy |last3=Jaffr\u00e9 |first3=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Refinement and coarsening indicators for adaptive parametrization: application to the estimation of hydraulic transmissivities |journal=Inverse Problems |date=2002 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=775\u2013794|url=https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/22/95/PDF/RR-4292.pdf|doi=10.1088/0266-5611/18/3/317 |bibcode=2002InvPr..18..775B }}</ref>\n\nShould the objective function be based on a norm other than the Euclidean norm, we have to leave the area of quadratic optimization. As a result, the optimization problem becomes more difficult. In particular, when the <math>L^1</math> norm is used for quantifying the data misfit the objective function is no longer differentiable: its gradient does not make sense any longer. Dedicated methods (see for instance Lemar\u00e9chal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lemar\u00e9chal |first1=Claude |title=Optimization, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science |date=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=529\u2013572}}</ref>) from non differentiable optimization come in.\n\nOnce, the optimal model computed, we have to address the question: \"Can we trust this model?\" The question can be formulated as follows: How large is the set of models that match the data \"nearly as well\" as this model? In the case of quadratic objective functions, this set is contained in a hyper-ellipsoid, a subset of <math>{R}^M</math> (<math>M</math> is the number of unknowns), whose size depends on what we mean with \"nearly as well\", that is on the noise level. The direction of the largest axis of this ellipsoid ([[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] associated with the smallest eigenvalue of matrix <math>F^TF</math>) is the direction of poorly determined components: if we follow this direction, we can bring a strong perturbation to the model without changing significantly the value of the objective function and thus end up with a significantly different quasi-optimal model. We clearly see that the answer to the question \"can we trust this model\" is governed by the noise level and by the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the objective function or equivalently, in the case where no regularization has been integrated, by the [[singular value]]s of matrix <math>F</math>. Of course, the use of regularization (or other kinds of prior information) reduces the size of the set of almost optimal solutions and, in turn, increases the confidence we can put in the computed solution.\n\n==== Stability, regularization and model discretization in infinite dimension ====\n\nWe focus here on the recovery of a distributed parameter.\nWhen looking for distributed parameters we have to discretize these unknown functions. Doing so, we reduce the dimension of the problem to something finite. But now, the question is : is there any link between the solution we compute and the one of the initial problem ? Then another question : what do we mean with the solution of the initial problem ? Since a finite number of data does not allow the determination of an infinity of unknowns, the original data misfit functional has to be regularized to ensure uniqueness of the solution. Many times, reducing the unknowns to a finite dimensional space will provide an adequate regularization : the computed solution will look like a discrete version of the solution we were looking for. For example, a naive discretization will often work for solving the [[deconvolution]] problem : it will work as long as we do not allow missing frequencies to show up in the numerical solution. But many times, regularization has to be integrated explicitly in the objective function.\n\nIn order to understand what may happen, we have to keep in mind that solving such a linear inverse problem amount to solving a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind: \n:<math>d(x)=\\int_{\\Omega}K(x,y)p(y) dy</math>\n\nwhere <math>K</math> is the kernel, <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are vectors of <math>{R}^2</math>, and <math>{\\Omega}</math> is a domain in <math>{R}^2</math>. This holds for a 2D application. For a 3D application, we consider <math> x,y\\in {R}^3</math>. Note that here the model parameters <math>p</math> consist of a function and that the response of a model also consists of a function denoted by <math>d(x)</math>. This equation is an extension to infinite dimension of the matrix equation <math>d=Fp</math> given in the case of discrete problems.\n\nFor sufficiently smooth <math>K</math> the operator defined above is [[compact operator|compact]] on reasonable [[Banach space]]s such as the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math>]]. [[Compact operator|F. Riesz theory]] states that the set of singular values of such an operator contains zero (hence the existence of a null-space), is finite or at most countable, and, in the latter case, they constitute a sequence that goes to zero. In the case of a symmetric kernel, we have an infinity of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors constitute a hilbertian basis of <math>L^2</math>.  Thus any solution of this equation is determined up to an additive function in the null-space and, in the case of infinity of singular values, the solution (which involves the reciprocal of arbitrary small eigenvalues) is unstable : two ingredients that make the solution of this integral equation a typical ill-posed problem! However we can define a solution through the [[Generalized inverse|pseudo-inverse]] of the forward map (again up to an arbitrary additive function). When the forward map is compact, the classical [[Tikhonov regularization]] will work if we use it for integrating prior information stating that the <math>L^2</math> norm of the solution should be as small as possible : this will make the inverse problem well-posed. Yet, as in the finite dimension case, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution. Again, basically, the information lies in the eigenvalues of the Hessian operator. Should subspaces containing eigenvectors associated with small eigenvalues be explored for computing the solution, then the solution can hardly be trusted : some of its components will be poorly determined. The smallest eigenvalue is equal to the weight introduced in Tikhonov regularization.\n\nIrregular kernels may yield a forward map which is not compact and even [[Unbounded operator|unbounded]] if we naively equip the space of models with the <math>L^2</math> norm. In such cases, the Hessian is not a bounded operator and the notion of eigenvalue does not make sense any longer. A mathematical analysis is required to make it a [[bounded operator]] and design a well-posed problem: an illustration can be found in.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title= SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts 1991|date=1993 |volume=98 |pages=6589\u20136605|doi=10.1190/1.1888774 |chapter=Ill\u2010posed and well\u2010posed formulations of the reflection tomography problem }}</ref> Again, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution and we have to generalize the notion of eigenvalue to get the answer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title=What information on the Earth model do reflection traveltimes provide |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=1992 |volume=98 |issue=B13 |pages=827\u2013844|doi=10.1029/92JB01739 |bibcode=1992JGR....9719827D }}</ref>\n\nAnalysis of the spectrum of the Hessian operator is thus a key element to determine how reliable the computed solution is.  However, such an analysis is usually a very heavy task. This has led several authors to investigate alternative approaches in the case where we are not interested in all the components of the unknown function but only in sub-unknowns that are the images of the unknown function by a linear operator. These approaches are referred to as the \" Backus and Gilbert method<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Backus |first1=George |last2=Gilbert |first2=Freeman |title=The Resolving Power of Gross Earth Data |journal=Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=1968 |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=169\u2013205|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1968.tb00216.x |bibcode=1968GeoJ...16..169B |doi-access=free }}</ref>\", [[Jacques-Louis Lions|Lions]]'s sentinels approach,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lions |first1=Jacques Louis |title=Sur les sentinelles des syst\u00e8mes distribu\u00e9s |journal=C.

But, generally speaking, these poorly determined components of the model are not necessarily associated with high frequencies.\n\n===Some classical linear inverse problems for the recovery of distributed parameters===\nThe problems mentioned below correspond to different versions of the Fredholm integral : each of these is associated with a specific kernel <math>K</math>.\n\n====Deconvolution====\nThe goal of [[deconvolution]] is to reconstruct the original image or signal <math>p(x)</math> which appears as noisy and blurred on the data <math>d(x)</math>.<ref>Kaipio, J., & Somersalo, E. (2010). Statistical and computational inverse problems.

We denote by <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math> the line in this family associated with measurement point <math>x</math>. The observation at <math>x</math> can thus be written as :\n:<math>d(x)=\\int_{\\Gamma_x} w(x,y) p(y) \\, ds</math>\nwhere <math>s</math> is the arc-length along <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math> and <math>w(x,y)</math> a known weighting function. Comparing this equation with the Fredholm integral above, we notice that the kernel <math>K(x,y)</math> is kind of a [[Dirac delta function|delta function]] that peaks on line <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math>. With such a kernel, the forward map is not compact.\n\n===== Computed tomography =====\nIn [[X-ray computed tomography]] the lines on which the parameter is integrated are straight lines : the [[tomographic reconstruction]] of the parameter distribution is based on the inversion of the [[Radon transform]]. Although from a theoretical point of view many linear inverse problems are well understood, problems involving the Radon transform and its generalisations still present many theoretical challenges with questions of sufficiency of data still unresolved. Such problems include incomplete data for the x-ray transform in three dimensions and problems involving the generalisation of the x-ray transform to tensor fields. Solutions explored include [[Algebraic Reconstruction Technique]], [[filtered backprojection]], and as computing power has increased, [[iterative reconstruction]] methods such as [[SAMV (algorithm)|iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance]].<ref name=AbeidaZhang>{{cite journal | last=Abeida | first=Habti | last2=Zhang | first2=Qilin | last3=Li | first3=Jian | last4=Merabtine | first4=Nadjim | title=Iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance Based Approaches for Array Processing | journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing | volume=61 | issue=4 | year=2013 | issn=1053-587X | doi=10.1109/tsp.2012.2231676 | pages=933\u2013944 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/SAMVpaper.pdf | arxiv=1802.03070 | bibcode=2013ITSP...61..933A }}</ref>\n\n===== Diffraction tomography =====\nDiffraction tomography is a classical linear inverse problem in exploration seismology : the amplitude recorded at one time for a given source-receiver pair is the sum of contributions arising from points such that the sum of the distances, measured in traveltimes, from the source and the receiver, respectively, is equal to the corresponding recording time. In 3D the parameter is not integrated along lines but over surfaces. Should the propagation velocity be constant, such points are distributed on an ellipsoid. The inverse problems consists in retrieving the distribution of diffracting points from the seismograms recorded along the survey, the velocity distribution being known.

As explained in Marsh<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=Tom |title=Doppler tomography |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=296 |date=2005 |issue=1\u20134 |pages=403\u2013415 |doi=10.1007/s10509-005-4859-3 |arxiv=astro-ph/0011020 }}</ref> this linear inverse problem is tomography like : we have to recover a distributed parameter which has been integrated along lines to produce its effects in the recordings.\n\n==Non-linear inverse problems==\n\nNon-linear inverse problems constitute an inherently more difficult family of inverse problems. Here the forward map <math>F</math> is a non-linear operator. Modeling of physical phenomena often relies on the solution of a partial differential equation (see table above except for gravity law) : although these partial differential equations are often linear, the physical parameters that appear in these equations depend in a non-linear way of the state of the system and therefore on the observations we make on it.\n\n=== Some classical non-linear inverse problems ===\n\n==== Inverse scattering problems ====\n\nWhereas linear inverse problems were completely solved from the theoretical point of view at the end of the nineteenth century {{Citation needed|reason=What specific date ? Is there a publication that marks the complete solution of linear inverse problems ?|date=November 2019}}, only one class of nonlinear inverse problems was so before 1970, that of inverse spectral and (one space dimension) [[inverse scattering problem]]s, after the seminal work of the Russian mathematical school ([[Mark Grigoryevich Krein|Krein]], [[Israel Gelfand|Gelfand]], Levitan, [[Vladimir Marchenko|Marchenko]]). A large review of the results has been given by Chadan and Sabatier in their book \"Inverse Problems of Quantum Scattering Theory\" (two editions in English, one in Russian).\n\nIn this kind of problem, data are properties of the spectrum of a linear operator which describe the scattering. The spectrum is made of [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenfunction]]s, forming together the \"discrete spectrum\", and generalizations, called the continuous spectrum. The very remarkable physical point is that scattering experiments give information only on the continuous spectrum, and that knowing its full spectrum is both necessary and sufficient in recovering the scattering operator. Hence we have invisible parameters, much more interesting than the null space which has a similar property in linear inverse problems. In addition, there are physical motions in which the spectrum of such an operator is conserved as a consequence of such motion. This phenomenon is governed by special nonlinear partial differential evolution equations, for example the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]]. If the spectrum of the operator is reduced to one single eigenvalue, its corresponding motion is that of a single bump that propagates at constant velocity and without deformation, a solitary wave called a \"[[soliton]]\".\n\nA perfect signal and its generalizations for the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation or other integrable nonlinear partial differential equations are of great interest, with many possible applications. This area has been studied as a branch of mathematical physics since the 1970s. Nonlinear inverse problems are also currently studied in many fields of applied science (acoustics, mechanics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetic scattering - in particular radar soundings, seismic soundings, and nearly all imaging modalities).\n\nA final example related to the [[Riemann hypothesis]] was given by Wu and Sprung, the idea is that in the [[semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] [[old quantum theory]] the inverse of the potential inside the Hamiltonian is proportional to the [[half-derivative]] of the eigenvalues (energies) counting function&nbsp;''n''(''x'').\n\n====Permeability matching in oil and gas reservoirs====\nThe goal is to recover the diffusion coefficient in the [[Diffusion equation|parabolic partial differential equation]] that models single phase fluid flows in porous media.

In particular they aimed at inverting for the propagation velocity distribution, knowing the arrival times of wave-fronts observed on seismograms. These wave-fronts can be associated with direct arrivals or with reflections associated with reflectors whose geometry is to be determined, jointly with the velocity distribution.\n\nThe arrival time distribution  <math>{\\tau}(x)</math> (<math>x</math> is a point in physical space) of a wave-front issued from a point source, satisfies the [[Eikonal equation]] :\n:<math>\\|\\nabla {\\tau} (x)\\| =  s(x),</math>\nwhere <math>s(x)</math> denotes the [[Slowness (seismology)|slowness]] (reciprocal of the velocity) distribution. The presence of <math>\\| \\| </math> makes this equation nonlinear. It is classically solved by shooting [[Ray tracing (physics)|rays]] (trajectories about which the arrival time is stationary) from the point source.\n\nThis problem is tomography like : the measured arrival times are the integral along the ray-path of the slowness. But this tomography like problem is nonlinear, mainly because the unknown ray-path geometry depends upon the velocity (or slowness) distribution. In spite of its nonlinear character, travel-time tomography turned out to be very effective for determining the propagation velocity in the Earth or in the subsurface, the latter aspect being a key element for seismic imaging, in particular using methods mentioned in Section \"Diffraction tomography\".\n\n=== Mathematical aspects : Hadamard's questions ===\n\nThe questions concern well-posedness : does the least-squares problem have a unique solution which depends continuously on the data (stability problem) ? It is the first question, but it is also a difficult one because of the non-linearity of <math>F</math>. \nIn order to see where the difficulties arise from, Chavent<ref name=Chavent>{{cite book |last1=Chavent |first1=Guy |title=Nonlinear Least Squares for Inverse problems |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2785-6}}</ref> proposed to conceptually split the minimization of the data misfit function into two consecutive steps (<math>P_{adm}</math> is the subset of admissible models):\n* projection step : given <math>d_{obs}</math> find a projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> (nearest point on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> according to the distance involved in the definition of the objective function)\n* given this projection find one pre-image that is a model whose image by operator <math>F</math> is this projection.\nDifficulties can - and usually will - arise in both steps :\n# operator <math>F</math> is not likely to be one-to-one, therefore there can be more than one pre-image,\n# even when <math>F</math> is one-to-one, its inverse may not be continuous over <math>F(P)</math> ,\n# the projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> may not exist, should this set be not closed,\n# the projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> can be non-unique and not continuous as this can be non-convex due to the non-linearity of <math>F</math>.\nWe refer to Chavent<ref name=Chavent/> for a mathematical analysis of these points.\n\n=== Computational aspects ===\n\n==== A non-convex data misfit function ====\nThe forward map being nonlinear, the data misfit function is likely to be non-convex, making local minimization techniques inefficient.

When the forward map is nonlinear, the computational difficulties increase and minimizing the objective function can be difficult. Contrary to the linear situation, an explicit use of the Hessian matrix for solving the normal equations does not make sense here : the Hessian matrix varies with models. Much more effective is the evaluation of the gradient of the objective function for some models.

It is called an inverse problem because it starts with the effects and then calculates the causes. It is the inverse of a forward problem, which starts with the causes and then calculates the effects.\n\nInverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe. They have wide application in [[system identification]], [[optics]], [[radar]], [[acoustics]], [[communication theory]], [[signal processing]], [[medical imaging]], [[computer vision]], [[geophysics]], [[oceanography]], [[astronomy]], [[remote sensing]], [[natural language processing]], [[machine learning]], [[nondestructive testing]], and many other fields.\n\n==History==\nStarting with the effects to discover the causes has concerned physicists for centuries. A historical example is the calculations of [[John Couch Adams|Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]] which led to the discovery of [[Neptune]] from the perturbed trajectory of [[Uranus]]. However, a formal study of inverse problems was not initiated until the 20th century.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a solution to an inverse problem was discovered by [[Hermann Weyl]] and published in 1911, describing the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weyl |first=Hermann |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |title=\u00dcber die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte |journal=Nachrichten der K\u00f6niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen |pages=110\u2013117 |year=1911 |access-date=2018-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801090504/http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=63048 |archive-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Today known as ''[[Weyl's law]]'', it is perhaps most easily understood as an answer to the question of whether it is possible to [[Hearing the shape of a drum|hear the shape of a drum]]. Weyl conjectured that the eigenfrequencies of a drum would be related to the area and perimeter of the drum by a particular equation, a result improved upon by later mathematicians.\n\nThe field of inverse problems was later touched on by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] physicist, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]].<ref>[http://ambartsumian.ru/en/papers/epilogue-ambartsumian\u2019-s-paper/ \u00bb Epilogue \u2014 Ambartsumian\u2019 s paper Viktor Ambartsumian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A life in astrophysics.

He then asked: given a family of eigenvalues, is it possible to find the form of the equations whose eigenvalues they are? Essentially Ambartsumian was examining the inverse [[Sturm\u2013Liouville problem]], which dealt with determining the equations of a vibrating string. This paper was published in 1929 in the German physics journal ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]'' and remained in obscurity for a rather long time. Describing this situation after many decades, Ambartsumian said, \"If an astronomer publishes an article with a mathematical content in a physics journal, then the most likely thing that will happen to it is oblivion.\"\n\nNonetheless, toward the end of the Second World War, this article, written by the 20-year-old Ambartsumian, was found by Swedish mathematicians and formed the starting point for a whole area of research on inverse problems, becoming the foundation of an entire discipline.\n\nThen important efforts have been devoted to a \"direct solution\" of the inverse scattering problem especially by [[Marchenko equation|Gelfand and Levitan]] in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Burridge |first1=Robert |title=The Gelfand-Levitan, the Marchenko, and the Gopinath-Sondhi integral equations of inverse scattering theory, regarded in the context of inverse impulse-response problems |journal=Wave Motion |date=1980 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013323 |doi=10.1016/0165-2125(80)90011-6 }}</ref> They proposed an analytic constructive method for determining the solution.  When computers became available, some authors have investigated the possibility of applying their approach to similar problems such as the inverse problem in the 1D wave equation. But it rapidly turned out that the inversion is an unstable process : noise and errors can be tremendously amplified making a direct solution hardly practicable.\nThen, around the seventies, the least-squares and probabilistic approaches came in and turned out to be very helpful for the determination of parameters involved in various physical systems. This approach met a lot of success. Nowadays inverse problems are also investigated in fields outside physics, such as chemistry, economy, and computer science. Eventually, as numerical models invade the whole society, we may expect an inverse problem associated with each of these numerical models.\n\n==Conceptual understanding==\nSince Newton, scientists have extensively attempted to model the world. In particular, when a [[mathematical model]] is available (for instance, Newton's gravitational law or Coulomb's equation for electrostatics), we can foresee, given some parameters that describe a physical system (such as a distribution of mass or a distribution of electric charges), the behavior of the system. This approach is known as mathematical modeling and the above-mentioned physical parameters are called the '''model parameters''' or simply the '''model'''. To be precise, we introduce the notion of '''state of the physical system''': it is the solution of the mathematical model's equation. In [[Optimal control|optimal control theory]], these equations are referred to as the [[State-space representation|state equations]]. In many situations we are not truly interested in knowing the physical state but just its effects on some objects (for instance, the effects the gravitational field on a specific planet). Hence we have to introduce another operator, called the '''observation operator''', which converts the state of the physical system (here the predicted gravitational field) into what we want to observe (here the movements of the considered planet). We can now introduce the so-called '''forward problem''', which consists of two steps:\n* determination of the state of the system from the physical parameters that describe it\n* application of the observation operator to estimated state of the system so as to predict the behavior of what we want to observe.\nThis leads to introduce another [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] <math>F</math> ('''''F''''' stands for \"forward\") which maps model parameters <math>p</math> into <math>F(p)</math>, the data that model <math>p</math> predicts that is the result of this two-step procedure. Operator <math>F</math> is called '''forward operator''' or '''forward map'''.\nIn this approach we basically attempt at predicting the effects knowing the causes.\n\nThe table below shows, the Earth being considered as the physical system and for different physical phenomena, the model parameters that describe the system, the physical quantity that describes the state of the physical system and observations commonly made on the state of the system. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

We denote by <math>M</math> the number (possibly infinite) of model parameters, and by <math>N</math> the number of recorded data.\nWe introduce some useful concepts and the associated notations that will be used in the sequel :\n* The '''space of models''' denoted by <math>P</math> : the [[vector space]] spanned by model parameters; it has <math>M</math> dimensions;\n* The '''space of data''' denoted by <math>D</math> : <math>D=\\mathbb{R}^N</math> if we organize the measured samples in a vector with <math>N</math> components (if our measurements consist of functions, <math>D</math> is a vector space with infinite dimensions);\n* <math>F(p)</math> : the '''response of model'''   <math>p</math>; it consists of the '''data predicted by model''' <math>p</math>;\n* <math>F(P)</math> : the image of <math>P</math> by the forward map, it is a subset of <math>D</math> (but not a subspace unless <math>F</math> is linear) made of responses of all models;\n* <math>d_{obs}-F(p)</math> : the '''data misfits (or residuals)''' associated with model  <math>p</math> : they can be arranged as a vector, an element of <math>D</math>.\nThe concept of residuals is very important : in the scope of finding a model that matches the data, '''their analysis reveals if the considered model can be considered as realistic or not'''. Systematic unrealistic discrepancies between the data and the model responses also reveals that the forward map is inadequate and may give insights about an improved forward map.\n\nWhen operator <math>F</math> is linear, the inverse problem is linear. Otherwise, that is most often, the inverse problem is nonlinear.\nAlso, models cannot always be described by a finite number of parameters. It is the case when we look for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed parameters]] (a distribution of wave-speeds for instance): in such cases the goal of the inverse problem is to retrieve one or several functions. Such inverse problems are inverse problems with infinite dimension.\n\n==<span id=\"Linear inverse problem\"></span>Linear inverse problems==\nIn the case of a linear forward map and when we deal with a finite number of model parameters, the forward map can be written as a [[linear system]]\n:<math>\\ d = Fp</math>\nwhere <math>F</math> is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that characterizes the forward map.\n\n===An elementary example : Earth's gravitational field===\nOnly a few physical systems are actually linear with respect to the model parameters. One such system from geophysics is that of the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]]. The Earth's gravitational field is determined by the density distribution of the Earth in the subsurface. Because the [[lithology]] of the Earth changes quite significantly, we are able to observe minute differences in the Earth's gravitational field on the surface of the Earth. From our understanding of gravity (Newton's Law of Gravitation), we know that the mathematical expression for gravity is:\n:<math>d= \\frac{G p}{r^2};</math>\nhere <math>d</math> is a measure of the local gravitational acceleration, <math>G</math> is the [[Gravitational acceleration|universal gravitational constant]], <math>p</math> is the local mass (which is related to density) of the rock in the subsurface and <math>r</math> is the distance from the mass to the observation point.\n\nBy discretizing the above expression, we are able to relate the discrete data observations on the surface of the Earth to the discrete model parameters (density) in the subsurface that we wish to know more about. For example, consider the case where we have measurements carried out at 5 locations on the surface of the Earth. In this case, our data vector, <math>d</math> is a column vector of dimension (5x1): its <math>i</math>th component is associated with the <math>i</math>th observation location.  We also know that we only have five unknown masses <math>p_j</math> in the subsurface (unrealistic but used to demonstrate the concept) with known location : we denote by <math>r_{ij}</math> the distance between the <math>i</math>th observation location and the <math>j</math>th mass. Thus, we can construct the linear system relating the five unknown masses to the five data points as follows:\n:<math>d = F p, \\,</math>\n:<math>d =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nd_1 \\\\\nd_2 \\\\\nd_3 \\\\\nd_4 \\\\\nd_5 \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>p =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\np_1 \\\\\np_2 \\\\\np_3 \\\\\np_4 \\\\\np_5\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n:<math>F =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{G}{r_{11}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{12}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{13}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{14}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{15}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{21}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{22}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{23}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{24}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{25}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{31}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{32}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{33}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{34}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{35}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{41}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{42}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{43}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{44}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{45}^2} \\\\\n\\frac{G}{r_{51}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{52}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{53}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{54}^2} & \\frac{G}{r_{55}^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nTo solve for the model parameters that fit our data, we might be able to invert the matrix <math>F</math> to directly convert the measurements into our model parameters. For example:\n:<math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math>\nA system with five equations and five unknowns is a very specific situation : our example was designed to end up with this specificity. In general, the numbers of data and unknowns are different so that matrix <math>F</math> is not square.\n\nHowever, even a square matrix can have no inverse : matrix <math>F</math> can be [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] deficient (i.e. has zero eigenvalues) and the solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> is not unique. Then the solution of the inverse problem will be undetermined. This is a first difficulty. Over-determined systems (more equations than unknowns) have other issues.\nAlso noise may corrupt our observations making <math>d</math> possibly outside the space <math>F(P)</math> of possible responses to model parameters so that solution of the system <math>p = F^{-1} d_{obs} \\,</math> may not exist. This is another difficulty.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the first difficulty ====\nThe first difficulty reflects a crucial problem: Our observations do not contain enough information and additional data are required. Additional data can come from physical '''prior information''' on the parameter values, on their spatial distribution or, more generally, on their mutual dependence. It can also come from other experiments: For instance, we may think of integrating data recorded by gravimeters and seismographs for a better estimation of densities. \nThe integration of this additional information is basically a problem of [[statistics]]. This discipline is the one that can answer the question: How to mix quantities of different nature? We will be more precise in the section \"Bayesian approach\" below.\n\nConcerning distributed parameters, prior information about their spatial distribution often consists of information about some derivatives of these distributed parameters. Also, it is common practice, although somewhat artificial, to look for the \"simplest\" model that reasonably matches the data. This is usually achieved by [[Penalty method|penalizing]] the [[Lp space|<math>L^1</math> norm]] of the gradient (or the [[total variation]]) of the parameters (this approach is also referred to as the maximization of the entropy). One can also make the model simple through a parametrization that introduces freedom degrees only when necessary.\n\nAdditional information may also be integrated through inequality constraints on the model parameters or some functions of them. Such constraints are important to avoid unrealistic values for the parameters (negative values for instance). In this case, the space spanned by model parameters will no longer be a vector space but a '''subset of admissible models''' denoted by <math>P_{adm}</math> in the sequel.\n\n==== Tools to overcome the second difficulty ====\nAs mentioned above, noise may be such that our measurements are not the image of any model, so that we cannot look for a model that produces the data but rather look for [[model selection|the best (or optimal) model]]: that is, the one that best matches the data. This leads us to minimize an [[objective function]], namely a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]  that quantifies how big the residuals are or how far the predicted data are from the observed data. Of course, when we have perfect data (i.e. no noise) then the recovered model should fit the observed data perfectly. A standard objective function, <math>\\varphi</math>, is of the form:\n:<math>\\varphi(p) = \\|F p-d_{obs} \\|^2 \\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\| \\| \\,</math> is the Euclidean norm (it will be the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math> norm]] when the measurements are functions instead of samples) of the residuals. This approach amounts to making use of [[Least squares|ordinary least squares]], an approach widely used in statistics. However, the Euclidean norm is known to be very sensitive to outliers: to avoid this difficulty we may think of using other distances, for instance the <math>L^1</math> norm, in replacement of the <math>L^2</math> norm.\n\n==== Bayesian approach ====\nVery similar to the least-squares approach is the probabilistic approach: If we know the statistics of the noise that contaminates the data, we can think of seeking the most likely model m, which is the model that matches the [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood criterion]]. If the noise is [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], the maximum likelihood criterion appears as a least-squares criterion, the Euclidean scalar product in data space being replaced by a scalar product involving the [[Covariance|co-variance]] of the noise. Also, should prior information on model parameters be available, we could think of using [[Bayesian inference]] to formulate the solution of the inverse problem. This approach is described in detail in Tarantola's book.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tarantola |first1=Albert |title=Inverse problem theory |url=https://archive.org/details/inverseproblemth0000tara |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780444599674 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of our elementary example ====\nHere we make use of the Euclidean norm to quantify the data misfits. As we deal with a linear inverse problem, the objective function is quadratic. For its minimization, it is classical to compute its gradient using the same rationale (as we would to minimize a function of only one variable). At the optimal model <math>p_{opt}</math>, this gradient vanishes which can be written as :\n:<math>\\nabla_p \\varphi = 2(F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} - F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs}) = 0 \\,</math>\nwhere ''F''<sup>T</sup> denotes the [[matrix transpose]] of ''F''. This equation simplifies to:\n:<math>F^\\mathrm{T} F p_{opt} = F^\\mathrm{T} d_{obs} \\,</math>\n\nThis expression is known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Normal_equations&redirect=no normal equation] and gives us a possible solution to the inverse problem. \nIn our example matrix <math>F^\\mathrm{T} F</math> turns out to be generally full rank so that the equation above makes sense and determines uniquely the model parameters : we do not need integrating additional information for ending up with a unique solution.\n\n=== Mathematical and computational aspects ===\n\nInverse problems are typically ill posed, as opposed to the [[well-posed problem]]s usually met in mathematical modeling. Of the three conditions for a [[well-posed problem]] suggested by [[Jacques Hadamard]] (existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution or solutions) the condition of stability is most often violated. In the sense of [[functional analysis]], the inverse problem is represented by a mapping between [[metric space]]s. While inverse problems are often formulated in infinite dimensional spaces, limitations to a finite number of measurements, and the practical consideration of recovering only a finite number of unknown parameters, may lead to the problems being recast in discrete form. In this case the inverse problem will typically be ''[[condition number|ill-conditioned]]''. In these cases, [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] may be used to introduce mild assumptions on the solution and prevent [[overfitting]]. Many instances of regularized inverse problems can be interpreted as special cases of [[Bayesian inference]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ipgp.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/Books/InverseProblemTheory.pdf|title=Inverse Problem Theory and Methods for Model Parameter Estimation|pages=i\u2013xii|first=Albert|last=Tarantola|publisher=SIAM|doi=10.1137/1.9780898717921.fm|chapter=Front Matter|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89871-572-9}}</ref>\n\n==== Numerical solution of the optimization problem ====\nSome inverse problems have a very simple solution for instance when one has a set of [[unisolvent functions]], meaning a set of {{tmath|n}} functions such that evaluating them at {{tmath|n}} distinct points yields a set of [[linearly independent]] vectors. This means that given a linear combination of these functions, the coefficients can be computed by arranging the vectors as the columns of a matrix and then inverting this matrix. The simplest example of unisolvent functions are polynomials constructed, using the [[unisolvence theorem]], so as to be unisolvent . Concretely, this is done by inverting the [[Vandermonde matrix]]. But this a very specific situation.\n\nIn general, the solution of an inverse problem requires sophisticated optimization algorithms. When the model is described by a large number of parameters (the number of unknowns involved in some diffraction tomography applications can reach one billion), solving the linear system associated with the normal equations can be cumbersome. The numerical method to be used for solving the optimization problem depends in particular on the cost required for computing the solution  <math>F p</math> of the forward problem. Once chosen the appropriate algorithm for solving the forward problem (a straightforward matrix-vector multiplication may be not adequate when matrix <math>F</math> is huge), the appropriate algorithm for carrying out the minimization can be found in textbooks dealing with numerical methods for the solution of linear systems and for the minimization of quadratic functions (see for instance Ciarlet<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ciarlet |first1=Philippe |title=Introduction \u00e0 l'analyse num\u00e9rique matricielle et \u00e0 l'optimisation |date=1994 |publisher=Masson |location=Paris |isbn=9782225688935}}</ref> or Nocedal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |title=Numerical optimization |date=2006 |publisher=Springer}}</ref>).\n\nAlso the user may wish to add physical constraints to the models : in this case they have to be familiar with [[Constrained optimization|constrained optimization methods]], a subject in itself. In all cases, computing the gradient of the objective function often is a key element for the solution of the optimization problem. As mentioned above, information about the spatial distribution of a distributed parameter can be introduced through the parametrization. One can also think of adapting this parametrization during the optimization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ben Ameur |first1=Hend |last2=Chavent |first2=Guy |last3=Jaffr\u00e9 |first3=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Refinement and coarsening indicators for adaptive parametrization: application to the estimation of hydraulic transmissivities |journal=Inverse Problems |date=2002 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=775\u2013794|url=https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/22/95/PDF/RR-4292.pdf|doi=10.1088/0266-5611/18/3/317 |bibcode=2002InvPr..18..775B }}</ref>\n\nShould the objective function be based on a norm other than the Euclidean norm, we have to leave the area of quadratic optimization. As a result, the optimization problem becomes more difficult. In particular, when the <math>L^1</math> norm is used for quantifying the data misfit the objective function is no longer differentiable : its gradient does not make sense any longer. Dedicated methods (see for instance Lemar\u00e9chal<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lemar\u00e9chal |first1=Claude |title=Optimization, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science |date=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=529\u2013572}}</ref>) from non differentiable optimization come in.\n\nOnce, the optimal model computed, we have to address the question : \"can we trust this model\" ? The question can be formulated as follows : how large is the set of models that match the data \"nearly as well\" as this model. In the case of quadratic objective functions, this set is contained in a hyper-ellipsoid, a subset of <math>{R}^M</math> (<math>M</math> is the number of unknowns), whose size depends on what we mean with \"nearly as well\", that is on the noise level. The direction of the largest axis of this ellipsoid ([[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] associated with the smallest eigenvalue of matrix <math>F^TF</math>) is the direction of poorly determined components : if we follow this direction, we can bring a strong perturbation to the model without changing significantly the value of the objective function and thus end up with a significantly different quasi-optimal model. We clearly see that the answer to the question \"can we trust this model\" is governed by the noise level and by the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the objective function or equivalently, in the case where no regularization has been integrated, by the [[singular value]]s of matrix <math>F</math>. Of course, use of regularization (or other kind of prior information) reduces the size of the set of almost optimal solutions and, in turn, increases the confidence we can put in the computed solution.\n\n==== Stability, regularization and model discretization in infinite dimension ====\n\nWe focus here on the recovery of a distributed parameter.\nWhen looking for distributed parameters we have to discretize these unknown functions. Doing so, we reduce the dimension of the problem to something finite. But now, the question is : is there any link between the solution we compute and the one of the initial problem ? Then another question : what do we mean with the solution of the initial problem ? Since a finite number of data does not allow the determination of an infinity of unknowns, the original data misfit functional has to be regularized to ensure uniqueness of the solution. Many times, reducing the unknowns to a finite dimensional space will provide an adequate regularization : the computed solution will look like a discrete version of the solution we were looking for. For example, a naive discretization will often work for solving the [[deconvolution]] problem : it will work as long as we do not allow missing frequencies to show up in the numerical solution. But many times, regularization has to be integrated explicitly in the objective function.\n\nIn order to understand what may happen, we have to keep in mind that solving such a linear inverse problem amount to solving a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind: \n:<math>d(x)=\\int_{\\Omega}K(x,y)p(y) dy</math>\n\nwhere <math>K</math> is the kernel, <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are vectors of <math>{R}^2</math>, and <math>{\\Omega}</math> is a domain in <math>{R}^2</math>. This holds for a 2D application. For a 3D application, we consider <math> x,y\\in {R}^3</math>. Note that here the model parameters <math>p</math> consist of a function and that the response of a model also consists of a function denoted by <math>d(x)</math>. This equation is an extension to infinite dimension of the matrix equation <math>d=Fp</math> given in the case of discrete problems.\n\nFor sufficiently smooth <math>K</math> the operator defined above is [[compact operator|compact]] on reasonable [[Banach space]]s such as the [[Lp space|<math>L^2</math>]]. [[Compact operator|F. Riesz theory]] states that the set of singular values of such an operator contains zero (hence the existence of a null-space), is finite or at most countable, and, in the latter case, they constitute a sequence that goes to zero. In the case of a symmetric kernel, we have an infinity of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors constitute a hilbertian basis of <math>L^2</math>.  Thus any solution of this equation is determined up to an additive function in the null-space and, in the case of infinity of singular values, the solution (which involves the reciprocal of arbitrary small eigenvalues) is unstable : two ingredients that make the solution of this integral equation a typical ill-posed problem! However we can define a solution through the [[Generalized inverse|pseudo-inverse]] of the forward map (again up to an arbitrary additive function). When the forward map is compact, the classical [[Tikhonov regularization]] will work if we use it for integrating prior information stating that the <math>L^2</math> norm of the solution should be as small as possible : this will make the inverse problem well-posed. Yet, as in the finite dimension case, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution. Again, basically, the information lies in the eigenvalues of the Hessian operator. Should subspaces containing eigenvectors associated with small eigenvalues be explored for computing the solution, then the solution can hardly be trusted : some of its components will be poorly determined. The smallest eigenvalue is equal to the weight introduced in Tikhonov regularization.\n\nIrregular kernels may yield a forward map which is not compact and even [[Unbounded operator|unbounded]] if we naively equip the space of models with the <math>L^2</math> norm. In such cases, the Hessian is not a bounded operator and the notion of eigenvalue does not make sense any longer. A mathematical analysis is required to make it a [[bounded operator]] and design a well-posed problem: an illustration can be found in.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title= SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts 1991|date=1993 |volume=98 |pages=6589\u20136605|doi=10.1190/1.1888774 |chapter=Ill\u2010posed and well\u2010posed formulations of the reflection tomography problem }}</ref> Again, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution and we have to generalize the notion of eigenvalue to get the answer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delprat-Jannaud |first1=Florence |last2=Lailly |first2=Patrick |title=What information on the Earth model do reflection traveltimes provide |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=1992 |volume=98 |issue=B13 |pages=827\u2013844|doi=10.1029/92JB01739 |bibcode=1992JGR....9719827D }}</ref>\n\nAnalysis of the spectrum of the Hessian operator is thus a key element to determine how reliable the computed solution is.  However, such an analysis is usually a very heavy task. This has led several authors to investigate alternative approaches in the case where we are not interested in all the components of the unknown function but only in sub-unknowns that are the images of the unknown function by a linear operator.

We denote by <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math> the line in this family associated with measurement point <math>x</math>. The observation at <math>x</math> can thus be written as :\n:<math>d(x)=\\int_{\\Gamma_x} w(x,y) p(y) \\, ds</math>\nwhere <math>s</math> is the arc-length along <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math> and <math>w(x,y)</math> a known weighting function. Comparing this equation with the Fredholm integral above, we notice that the kernel <math>K(x,y)</math> is kind of a [[Dirac delta function|delta function]] that peaks on line <math>{\\Gamma_x}</math>. With such a kernel, the forward map is not compact.\n\n===== Computed tomography =====\nIn [[X-ray computed tomography]] the lines on which the parameter is integrated are straight lines : the [[tomographic reconstruction]] of the parameter distribution is based on the inversion of the [[Radon transform]]. Although from a theoretical point of view many linear inverse problems are well understood, problems involving the Radon transform and its generalisations still present many theoretical challenges with questions of sufficiency of data still unresolved. Such problems include incomplete data for the x-ray transform in three dimensions and problems involving the generalisation of the x-ray transform to tensor fields.

In 3D the parameter is not integrated along lines but over surfaces. Should the propagation velocity be constant, such points are distributed on an ellipsoid. The inverse problems consists in retrieving the distribution of diffracting points from the seismograms recorded along the survey, the velocity distribution being known.

As explained in Marsh<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=Tom |title=Doppler tomography |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=296 |date=2005 |issue=1\u20134 |pages=403\u2013415 |doi=10.1007/s10509-005-4859-3 |arxiv=astro-ph/0011020 }}</ref> this linear inverse problem is tomography like : we have to recover a distributed parameter which has been integrated along lines to produce its effects in the recordings.\n\n==Non-linear inverse problems==\n\nNon-linear inverse problems constitute an inherently more difficult family of inverse problems. Here the forward map <math>F</math> is a non-linear operator. Modeling of physical phenomena often relies on the solution of a partial differential equation (see table above except for gravity law) : although these partial differential equations are often linear, the physical parameters that appear in these equations depend in a non-linear way of the state of the system and therefore on the observations we make on it.\n\n=== Some classical non-linear inverse problems ===\n\n==== Inverse scattering problems ====\n\nWhereas linear inverse problems were completely solved from the theoretical point of view at the end of the nineteenth century {{Citation needed|reason=What specific date ? Is there a publication that marks the complete solution of linear inverse problems ?|date=November 2019}}, only one class of nonlinear inverse problems was so before 1970, that of inverse spectral and (one space dimension) [[inverse scattering problem]]s, after the seminal work of the Russian mathematical school ([[Mark Grigoryevich Krein|Krein]], [[Israel Gelfand|Gelfand]], Levitan, [[Vladimir Marchenko|Marchenko]]). A large review of the results has been given by Chadan and Sabatier in their book \"Inverse Problems of Quantum Scattering Theory\" (two editions in English, one in Russian).\n\nIn this kind of problem, data are properties of the spectrum of a linear operator which describe the scattering. The spectrum is made of [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenfunction]]s, forming together the \"discrete spectrum\", and generalizations, called the continuous spectrum. The very remarkable physical point is that scattering experiments give information only on the continuous spectrum, and that knowing its full spectrum is both necessary and sufficient in recovering the scattering operator. Hence we have invisible parameters, much more interesting than the null space which has a similar property in linear inverse problems. In addition, there are physical motions in which the spectrum of such an operator is conserved as a consequence of such motion. This phenomenon is governed by special nonlinear partial differential evolution equations, for example the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]]. If the spectrum of the operator is reduced to one single eigenvalue, its corresponding motion is that of a single bump that propagates at constant velocity and without deformation, a solitary wave called a \"[[soliton]]\".\n\nA perfect signal and its generalizations for the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation or other integrable nonlinear partial differential equations are of great interest, with many possible applications. This area has been studied as a branch of mathematical physics since the 1970s. Nonlinear inverse problems are also currently studied in many fields of applied science (acoustics, mechanics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetic scattering - in particular radar soundings, seismic soundings, and nearly all imaging modalities).\n\nA final example related to the [[Riemann hypothesis]] was given by Wu and Sprung, the idea is that in the [[semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] [[old quantum theory]] the inverse of the potential inside the Hamiltonian is proportional to the [[half-derivative]] of the eigenvalues (energies) counting function&nbsp;''n''(''x'').\n\n====Permeability matching in oil and gas reservoirs====\nThe goal is to recover the diffusion coefficient in the [[Diffusion equation|parabolic partial differential equation]] that models single phase fluid flows in porous media.

These wave-fronts can be associated with direct arrivals or with reflections associated with reflectors whose geometry is to be determined, jointly with the velocity distribution.\n\nThe arrival time distribution  <math>{\\tau}(x)</math> (<math>x</math> is a point in physical space) of a wave-front issued from a point source, satisfies the [[Eikonal equation]] :\n:<math>\\|\\nabla {\\tau} (x)\\| =  s(x),</math>\nwhere <math>s(x)</math> denotes the [[Slowness (seismology)|slowness]] (reciprocal of the velocity) distribution. The presence of <math>\\| \\| </math> makes this equation nonlinear. It is classically solved by shooting [[Ray tracing (physics)|rays]] (trajectories about which the arrival time is stationary) from the point source.\n\nThis problem is tomography like : the measured arrival times are the integral along the ray-path of the slowness. But this tomography like problem is nonlinear, mainly because the unknown ray-path geometry depends upon the velocity (or slowness) distribution. In spite of its nonlinear character, travel-time tomography turned out to be very effective for determining the propagation velocity in the Earth or in the subsurface, the latter aspect being a key element for seismic imaging, in particular using methods mentioned in Section \"Diffraction tomography\".\n\n=== Mathematical aspects : Hadamard's questions ===\n\nThe questions concern well-posedness : does the least-squares problem have a unique solution which depends continuously on the data (stability problem) ? It is the first question, but it is also a difficult one because of the non-linearity of <math>F</math>. \nIn order to see where the difficulties arise from, Chavent<ref name=Chavent>{{cite book |last1=Chavent |first1=Guy |title=Nonlinear Least Squares for Inverse problems |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2785-6}}</ref> proposed to conceptually split the minimization of the data misfit function into two consecutive steps (<math>P_{adm}</math> is the subset of admissible models):\n* projection step : given <math>d_{obs}</math> find a projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> (nearest point on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> according to the distance involved in the definition of the objective function)\n* given this projection find one pre-image that is a model whose image by operator <math>F</math> is this projection.\nDifficulties can - and usually will - arise in both steps :\n# operator <math>F</math> is not likely to be one-to-one, therefore there can be more than one pre-image,\n# even when <math>F</math> is one-to-one, its inverse may not be continuous over <math>F(P)</math> ,\n# the projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> may not exist, should this set be not closed,\n# the projection on <math>F(P_{adm})</math> can be non-unique and not continuous as this can be non-convex due to the non-linearity of <math>F</math>.\nWe refer to Chavent<ref name=Chavent/> for a mathematical analysis of these points.\n\n=== Computational aspects ===\n\n==== A non-convex data misfit function ====\nThe forward map being nonlinear, the data misfit function is likely to be non-convex, making local minimization techniques inefficient. Several approaches have been investigated to overcome this difficulty : \n* use of global optimization techniques such as sampling of the posterior density function and [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm|Metropolis algorithm]] in the inverse problem probabilistic framework,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koren |first1=Zvi |last2=Mosegaard |first2=Klaus |last3=Landa |first3=Evgeny |last4=Thore |first4=Pierre |last5=Tarantola |first5=Albert |title=Monte Carlo Estimation and Resolution Analysis of Seismic Background Velocities |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=1991 |volume=96 |issue=B12|pages=20289\u201320299 |doi=10.1029/91JB02278 |bibcode=1991JGR....9620289K }}</ref> genetic algorithms (alone or in combination with Metropolis algorithm : see<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad|title=Stochastic shale permeability matching: Three-dimensional characterization and modeling|journal=International Journal of Coal Geology|date=August 2016|volume=165|pages=231\u2013242|doi=10.1016/j.coal.2016.08.024|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307626119}}</ref> for an application to the determination of permeabilities that match the existing permeability data), neural networks, regularization techniques including multi scale analysis;\n* reformulation of the least-squares objective function so as to make it smoother (see<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> for the inverse problem in the wave equations.)\n\n==== Computation of the gradient of the objective function ====\n\nInverse problems, especially in infinite dimension, may be large size, thus requiring important computing time. When the forward map is nonlinear, the computational difficulties increase and minimizing the objective function can be difficult. Contrary to the linear situation, an explicit use of the Hessian matrix for solving the normal equations does not make sense here : the Hessian matrix varies with models. Much more effective is the evaluation of the gradient of the objective function for some models. Important computational effort can be saved when we can avoid the very heavy computation of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] ( often called \"[[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]]s\")  : the adjoint state method, proposed by Chavent and Lions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chavent |first1=Guy |title=Identification de coefficients r\u00e9partis dans les \u00e9quations aux d\u00e9riv\u00e9es partielles |date=1971 |publisher=Th\u00e8se d'Etat |location=Universit\u00e9 Paris 6}}</ref> is aimed to avoid this very heavy computation.

The story takes place in the [[California Gold Rush]]. A twelve-year-old boy named Jack, who has lived with his Aunt Arabella since his parents died, heads to [[California]] to search for gold after Aunt Arabella loses all her money. He is accompanied by Aunt Arabella's [[butler]], Praiseworthy.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe book starts off with Praiseworthy and Jack stowing away on a ship, the ''Lady Wilma''.  They eventually confront Captain Swain, who makes them work their passage in the coal bunkers. The captain also tells them that he is in a race against a ship called the ''Sea Raven'' for a new clipper ship when he is warming up his beard from visiting the ship's deck. Jack also becomes a friend with a pig, whom he names \"Good Luck\". Praiseworthy and Jack use a dust-covered Good Luck to find who stole their money for the passage. They discover that an imposter named Cut-Eye Higgins stole their money. Captain Swain makes Cut-Eye Higgins work in the coal bunkers instead, and Praiseworthy and Jack find their money. They also meet their roommates: Mountain Jim, Dr. Buckbee, and Azariah Jones.\n\nA few days later, the ''Lady Wilma'', decides to tow a stranded square-rigger. The square-rigger's crew tells them that the ''Sea Raven'' had already gone ahead. The cook begins hunting for Good Luck to cook him, but Praiseworthy, Jack, and Mountain Jim fool him. At night, Jack stores Good Luck in a stern boat. After a stop in Rio de Janeiro, where the ship refills on coal and supplies, Dr. Buckbee finds out that his map leading to a gold mine is gone, and Cut-Eye Higgins and the stern boat in which Good Luck was hidden are also gone. As genius detectives, the passengers find out that Cut-Eye Higgins stole Dr. Buckbee's map and escaped in the stern boat. Eventually, the ''Lady Wilma'' arrives at Cape Horn and manages to make it through after a long period of weeks and days. Praiseworthy finds out that they actually cut through the Strait of Magellan, and that the ''Sea Raven'' is behind them. While they keep steaming, Jack and Praiseworthy strike a deal with Monsieur Gaunt and Azariah Jones. Azariah's potatoes were spoiling, and Monsieur Gaunt's grape cuttings were drying up. Jack tells them that Azariah's potatoes were very juicy and that by sticking Monsieur Gaunt's grape cuttings in them so the grapes would survive. So, Monsieur Gaunt buys Azariah's potatoes. Both Monsieur Gaunt and Azariah promise to buy the pair the last pick and shovel they can find. However, the ''Sea Raven'' soon passes the ''Lady Wilma'' again.\n\nThe ''Lady Wilma'' stops at Callao, and Monsieur Gaunt and Azariah Jones buy Praiseworthy and Jack the last two picks and shovels they could find, along with two wash pans. The ''Lady Wilma'' takes supplies, but discovers that the ''Sea Raven'' took all the coal. Praiseworthy and Jack board the ship, with some cats joining them on the ship as well. The ''Lady Wilma'' soon passes the ''Sea Raven'', since the ''Sea Raven'' in being weighed down by the tons of coal it took from Callao. However, the ''Sea Raven'' later passes the ''Lady Wilma'' again, since the ''Sea Raven'' has fresh coal. However, Praiseworthy reminds Captain Swain about the lumber in the ship's hold, and Captain Swain uses it as fuel. This allows the ''Lady Wilma'' to pass the Sea Raven and win the race.\n\nAfter arriving in California, Praiseworthy and Jack give a miner named Quartz Jackson a haircut. Quartz Jackson teaches them how to pan for gold, and he manages to find some gold dust in his beard, which he gives to Praiseworthy, who puts the gold dust in his left glove. Praiseworthy and Jack then start a barbering business. Later, Jack buys a horn spoon, and Praiseworthy and Jack leave to the diggings. While on a stagecoach, Jack and Praiseworthy meet unintentionally with Cut-Eye Higgins. However, road agents hold up the stagecoach. They take most of the passengers' valuables. When a road agent tries to take Aunt Arabella's picture from Praiseworthy, Praiseworthy grabs him and knocks him uphill with a punch from his left glove, which was weighted by the gold dust. Later, when Praiseworthy and Jack try to get Dr. Buckbee's map from Cut-Eye Higgins, Cut-Eye Higgins says the map was in his coat, which was taken by the road agents.\n\nLater, Jack and Praiseworthy arrive in Hang town and meet Pitch-pine Billy, a miner who gives Jack coffee and teaches them how to get gold as an apology for shooting one of their wash pans, since he thought it was his. Pitch-pine Billy also gives them permission to squat on his claim. Later in the day, when Praiseworthy and Jack enter Hang town, they discover that the miners in Hangtown heard about Praiseworthy punching the road agent and knocking him uphill. The miners then give Praiseworthy a nickname&nbsp;\u2014 \"Bullwhip\". Later, Jack finds a nugget but accidentally is forced to use half of it to buy a bushel of neckties from the Cheap John auction. Jimmie-from-Town admits it was his fault and offers to pay back the money to Jack, but Praiseworthy politely declines the offer, telling Jack that he has made an exceptional purchase. Later, a challenge to Praiseworthy arrives from the Mountain Ox, a brawler who says he wants to fight Praiseworthy in boxing. Quartz Jackson and his new wife arrive in Hang town, and Jack and Praiseworthy earn money by selling the neckties to miners who want to look neat and clean to see Quartz's wife. Praiseworthy and Jack then use the money to buy a burro and a squirrel gun. Later, while exploring, Jack encounters a grizzly bear during a hunting trip. Jack falls down a coyote hole by accident and is rescued by a former road agent wearing Cut-Eye Higgins' coat. Jack takes the coat from the road agent and rips it open with Praiseworthy, but finds out that the map isn't there. They then agree that Cut-Eye Higgins must have the map somewhere else.\n\nThey start walking and find a miner who has a toothache, who tells them there is a dentist at Shirt-Tail Camp. The miner also tells Jack and Praiseworthy the dentist's name is Doc Higgins, who is really Cut-Eye Higgins. They quickly head to Shirt-Tail Camp and arrive just in time for Cut-Eye's hanging for stealing a horse. Praiseworthy quickly comes up with a plan to get the map and releasing Cut-Eye Higgins by pretending Jack has a toothache. The Justice of the Peace of Shirt-tail Camp negotiates to build a jail for Higgins and lets him extract teeth, but once another dentist comes along he would be hanged. The Justice then orders Jack and Praiseworthy to dig Higgins a grave that is six feet deep. They pick a beautiful spot, but then, as they hit bedrock, Jack and Praiseworthy find gold and strike it rich! They work for a couple of weeks, digging for gold. Afterward, they sell their burro Stub to the Justice of the Peace and turn in their mining tools. They then set off for Hang town for Praiseworthy's fight with the Mountain Ox. There is a big crowd waiting for them. The Mountain Ox is big and strong, but Praiseworthy keeps dodging his punches and in the end, wins with a big punch. The next day they almost drown as the captain of the ship they were on, going to San Francisco was rushing and the boiler explodes! They lose all of their gold in order to survive. Praiseworthy and Jack then proceed to head for ''Lady Wilma.'' But it has been deserted except for the cats from Callao, Peru. Mr. Azariah Jones, who is now an auctioneer, tells them that Captain Swain's crew ran off to the diggings, which led to the captain just finding a way back to Boston. He then explains that rats are trying to ruin his business, which leads to Jack and Praiseworthy giving him the cats from Callao. Soon after, Mr. Azariah Jones has a huge line of customers. By the afternoon, Jack and Praiseworthy's share of the money is over four hundred dollars. While they talk, Jack suddenly sees a girl who looks like his sister Sarah, a girl who looks like his sister Constance, and a woman who looks, Aunt Arabella! It was them! At first, they do not recognize Jack and Praiseworthy under the disguise of their hats and boots. But Jack and Praiseworthy call out to them, and the family is officially reunited. It is unknown what happened to the family after Aunt Arabella agreed to marry Praiseworthy, as there is no sequel. It is presumed that they dug for gold to replace the previous batch and then lived out their lives in California.\n\n==Film adaptation==\nthat is very true .\nThis book was turned into a movie called ''[[The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin]]'' (1967) by [[Disney]], which changed the name of the butler character (Praiseworthy), as well as many other components of the storyline and plot.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Portal |Children's literature}}\n\n[[Category:1963 American novels]]\n[[Category: Children's historical novels]]\n[[Category: American children's novels]]\n[[Category: American historical novels]]\n[[Category: California Gold Rush in fiction]]\n[[Category: American novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:1963 children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=May 2017}}\n{{Long plot|date=July 2015}}\n{{Rewrite|date=September 2018}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = By The Great Horn Spoon!\n| image         = ByTheGreatHornSpoon.jpg\n| caption =  First edition\n| author        = [[Sid Fleischman]]\n| illustrator   = Eric von Schmidt\n| cover_artist  = \n| country       = United States\n\n| language      = English\n\n| genre         = [[Children's literature|Children's novel]]\n| publisher     = [[Little, Brown and Company]]\n| pub_date      = 1963\n| media_type    = Print ([[Hardcover|Hardback]] & [[Paperback]])\n| pages         = 193\n| isbn          =  \n}}\n\n'''''By The Great Horn Spoon!''''' is a children's novel by [[Sid Fleischman]], published in 1963. The story takes place in the [[California Gold Rush]]. A twelve-year-old boy named Jack, who has lived with his Aunt Arabella since his parents died, heads to [[California]] to search for gold after Aunt Arabella loses all her money. He is accompanied by Aunt Arabella's [[butler]], Praiseworthy.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe book starts off with Praiseworthy and Jack stowing away on a ship, the ''Lady Wilma''.  They eventually confront Captain Swain, who makes them work their passage in the coal bunkers. The captain also tells them that he is in a race against a ship called the ''Sea Raven'' for a new clipper ship when he is warming up his beard from visiting the ship's deck. Jack also becomes a friend with a pig, whom he names \"Good Luck\". Praiseworthy and Jack use a dust-covered Good Luck to find who stole their money for the passage. They discover that an imposter named Cut-Eye Higgins stole their money. Captain Swain makes Cut-Eye Higgins work in the coal bunkers instead, and Praiseworthy and Jack find their money. They also meet their roommates: Mountain Jim, Dr. Buckbee, and Azariah Jones.\n\nA few days later, the ''Lady Wilma'', decides to tow a stranded square-rigger. The square-rigger's crew tells them that the ''Sea Raven'' had already gone ahead. The cook begins hunting for Good Luck to cook him, but Praiseworthy, Jack, and Mountain Jim fool him. At night, Jack stores Good Luck in a stern boat. After a stop in Rio de Janeiro, where the ship refills on coal and supplies, Dr. Buckbee finds out that his map leading to a gold mine is gone, and Cut-Eye Higgins and the stern boat in which Good Luck was hidden are also gone. As genius detectives, the passengers find out that Cut-Eye Higgins stole Dr. Buckbee's map and escaped in the stern boat. Eventually, the ''Lady Wilma'' arrives at Cape Horn and manages to make it through after a long period of weeks and days. Praiseworthy finds out that they actually cut through the Strait of Magellan, and that the ''Sea Raven'' is behind them. While they keep steaming, Jack and Praiseworthy strike a deal with Monsieur Gaunt and Azariah Jones. Azariah's potatoes were spoiling, and Monsieur Gaunt's grape cuttings were drying up. Jack tells them that Azariah's potatoes were very juicy and that by sticking Monsieur Gaunt's grape cuttings in them so the grapes would survive. So, Monsieur Gaunt buys Azariah's potatoes. Both Monsieur Gaunt and Azariah promise to buy the pair the last pick and shovel they can find. However, the ''Sea Raven'' soon passes the ''Lady Wilma'' again.\n\nThe ''Lady Wilma'' stops at Callao, and Monsieur Gaunt and Azariah Jones buy Praiseworthy and Jack the last two picks and shovels they could find, along with two wash pans. The ''Lady Wilma'' takes supplies, but discovers that the ''Sea Raven'' took all the coal. Praiseworthy and Jack board the ship, with some cats joining them on the ship as well. The ''Lady Wilma'' soon passes the ''Sea Raven'', since the ''Sea Raven'' in being weighed down by the tons of coal it took from Callao. However, the ''Sea Raven'' later passes the ''Lady Wilma'' again, since the ''Sea Raven'' has fresh coal. However, Praiseworthy reminds Captain Swain about the lumber in the ship's hold, and Captain Swain uses it as fuel.

Birds are one of only four taxonomic groups to have [[evolution|evolved]] powered [[flight]].]]\n\nA number of [[animal]]s have [[evolution|evolved]] '''aerial locomotion''', either by powered [[flight]] or by [[gliding (flight)|gliding]]. '''Flying and gliding animals''' (''volant'' animals) have evolved separately many times, without any single ancestor. [[Flight]] has evolved at least four times, in the [[insect]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[bat]]s. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] animals in getting from tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among [[rainforest]] animals, especially in the rainforests in [[Asia]] (most especially [[Borneo]]) where the [[tree]]s are tall and widely spaced. Several species of [[aquatic animal]]s, and a few [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] have also evolved to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically as a means of evading predators.\n\n==Types==\nAnimal aerial locomotion can be divided into two categories\u2014powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces to climb or to maintain steady, level flight. Those who can find air that is rising faster than they are falling can gain altitude by [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]].\n\n===Unpowered===\nThese modes of locomotion typically require an animal start from a raised location, converting that [[potential energy]] into [[kinetic energy]] and using aerodynamic forces to control trajectory and angle of descent. Energy is continually lost to drag without being replaced, thus these methods of locomotion have limited range and duration.\n* [[Free fall|Falling]]: decreasing altitude under the force of [[gravity]], using no adaptations to increase [[Drag (physics)|drag]] or provide [[lift (force)|lift]].\n* [[Parachuting]]: falling at an angle greater than 45\u00b0 from the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] with adaptations to increase drag forces. Very small animals may be carried up by the [[wind]]. Some gliding animals may use their gliding membranes for drag rather than lift, to safely descend.\n* [[gliding (flight)|Gliding flight]]: falling at an angle less than 45\u00b0 from the horizontal with lift from adapted [[airfoil|aerofoil]] [[Patagium|membranes]]. This allows slowly falling directed horizontal movement, with streamlining to decrease drag forces for aerofoil efficiency and often with some maneuverability in air. Gliding animals have a lower [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] (wing length/breadth) than true flyers.\n\n===Powered flight===\nPowered [[flight]] has evolved only four times: first in the [[insect]]s, then in [[pterosaur]]s, next in [[bird]]s, and last in [[bat]]s. Powered flight uses muscles to generate [[aerodynamic force]], which allows the animal to produce lift and thrust. The animal may ascend without the aid of rising air.\n\n===Externally powered===\nBallooning and soaring are not powered by muscle, but rather by external aerodynamic sources of energy: the wind and rising thermals, respectively. Both can continue as long as the source of external power is present. Soaring is typically only seen in species capable of powered flight, as it requires extremely large wings.\n* [[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning]]: being carried up into the air from the aerodynamic effect on long strands of silk in the wind. Certain silk-producing [[arthropod]]s, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight [[Gossamer (spider silk)|gossamer silk]] for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude. \n* [[Lift (soaring)|Soaring]]: gliding in rising or otherwise moving air that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air is due to [[thermals]], [[ridge lift]] or [[lift (soaring)|other meteorological features]]. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without expending energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring.\n\nMany species will use multiple of these modes at various times; a hawk will use powered flight to rise, then soar on thermals, then descend via free-fall to catch its prey.\n\n==Evolution and ecology==\n\n===Gliding and parachuting===\nWhile gliding occurs independently from powered flight,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/11/new_theory_on_bat_flight_has_e_1.html|title=New theory on bat flight has experts a-flutter|date=5 November 2011|author=Ivan Semeniuk}}</ref> it has some ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very [[energy]]-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as [[fruit]]s, [[nectar]], and insects.<ref name=\"rainforest\">{{cite web | url=http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709003610/http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archivedate=2006-07-09 |title=Life in the Rainforest |accessdate=15 April 2006}}</ref> In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a dozen times among extant vertebrates); however these groups have not radiated nearly as much as have groups of flying animals.\n\nWorldwide, the distribution of gliding animals is uneven as most inhabit rain forests in [[Southeast Asia]]. (Despite seemingly suitable rain forest habitats, few gliders are found in India or New Guinea and none in Madagascar.) Additionally, a variety of gliding vertebrates are found in [[Africa]], a family of [[Hylidae|hylids]] ([[flying frog]]s) lives in [[South America]] and several species of gliding squirrels are found in the forests of northern Asia and North America.<ref name=Corlett>{{cite book |last1=Corlett |first1=Richard T. |title=Tropical rain forests : an ecological and biogeographical comparison |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2011 |location=Chichester |isbn=978-1444332551 |pages=197, 200 |edition=2nd |author2=Primack, Richard B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=R0j8NROHQi8C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=south+american+gliding+frog#v=onepage&q=south%20american%20gliding%20frog&f=false}}</ref> Various factors produce these disparities. In the forests of Southeast Asia, the dominant canopy trees (usually [[Dipterocarpaceae|dipterocarp]]s) are taller than the canopy trees of the other forests. A higher start provides a competitive advantage of further glides and farther travel. Gliding predators may more efficiently search for prey. The lower abundance of insect and small vertebrate prey for carnivorous animals (such as lizards) in Asian forests may be a factor.<ref name=Corlett/>  In Australia, many mammals (and all mammalian gliders) possess, to some extent, prehensile tails.\n\n===Powered flight evolution===\n[[File:Homology.jpg|upright|thumbnail| [[Homology (biology)|Analogous flying adaptions in vertebrates]]: {{ordered list |1=pterosaur ([[Pterosauria]]) |2=bat ([[Chiroptera]]) |3=bird ([[Aves]])}}]]\n\nPowered flight has evolved unambiguously only four times\u2014[[birds]], [[bats]], [[pterosaurs]], and [[insects]]. In contrast to gliding, which has evolved more frequently but typically gives rise to only a handful of species, all three extant groups of powered flyers have a huge number of species, suggesting that flight is a very successful strategy once evolved. [[Bat]]s, after [[rodent]]s, have the most species of any [[mammal]]ian order, about 20% of all mammalian [[species]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Simmons |first1=N.B. |title=Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference|date=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=312\u2013529 |author2=D.E. Wilson, D.C. Reeder}}</ref> [[Bird]]s have the most species of any class of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s. Finally, [[insect]]s (most of which fly at some point in their life cycle) have more species than all other animal groups combined.\n\nThe evolution of flight is one of the most striking and demanding in animal evolution, and has attracted the attention of many prominent scientists and generated many theories. Additionally, because flying animals tend to be small and have a low mass (both of which increase the surface-area-to-mass ratio), they tend to fossilize infrequently and poorly compared to the larger, heavier-boned terrestrial species they share habitat with. Fossils of flying animals tend to be confined to exceptional fossil deposits formed under highly specific circumstances, resulting in a generally poor fossil record, and a particular lack of transitional forms. Furthermore, as fossils do not preserve behavior or muscle, it can be difficult to discriminate between a poor flyer and a good glider.\n\n[[Insect wing#Evolution|Insects were the first to evolve flight]], approximately 350 million years ago. The developmental origin of the insect wing remains in dispute, as does the purpose prior to true flight. One suggestion is that wings initially were used to catch the wind for small insects that live on the surface of the water, while another is that they functioned in parachuting, then gliding, then flight for originally arboreal insects.\n\n[[Pterosaurs]] were the next to evolve flight, approximately 228 million years ago. These reptiles were close relatives of the dinosaurs (and sometimes mistakenly considered dinosaurs by laymen), and reached enormous sizes, with some of the last forms being the largest flying animals ever to inhabit the Earth, having wingspans of over 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft). However, they spanned a large range of sizes, down to a 250&nbsp;mm (10&nbsp;in) wingspan in ''[[Nemicolopterus]]''.\n\n[[Bird flight#Evolution of bird flight|Birds]] have an extensive fossil record, along with many forms documenting both their evolution from small theropod dinosaurs and the numerous bird-like forms of theropod which did not survive the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Indeed, ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is arguably the most famous transitional fossil in the world, both due to its mix of reptilian and avian anatomy and the luck of being discovered only two years after Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. However, the ecology of this transition is considerably more contentious, with various scientists supporting either a \"trees down\" origin (in which an arboreal ancestor evolved gliding, then flight) or a \"ground up\" origin (in which a fast-running terrestrial ancestor used wings for a speed boost and to help catch prey).\n\n[[Bat]]s are the most recent to evolve (about 60 million years ago), most likely from a fluttering ancestor,<ref name=\"Kaplan2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Matt |title=Ancient bats got in a flap over food |journal=Nature |year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9304}}</ref> though their poor fossil record has hindered more detailed study.\n\nOnly a few animals are known to have specialised in soaring: the larger of the extinct [[pterosaur]]s, and some large birds. Powered flight is very energetically expensive for large animals, but for soaring their size is an advantage, as it allows them a low wing loading, that is a large wing areas relative to their weight, which maximizes lift.<ref name=\"berkeleyenter\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/enter.html | title=Vertebrate Flight |accessdate=15 April 2006}}</ref> Soaring is very energetically efficient.\n\n==Biomechanics==\n\n===Gliding and parachuting===\nDuring a free-fall with no aerodynamic forces, the object accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity as the object descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented at an angle to the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.\n\nDuring gliding, lift plays an increased role. Like drag, lift is proportional to velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.\n\n===Powered flight===\nUnlike most air vehicles, in which the objects that generate lift (wings) and thrust (engine/propeller) are separate and the wings remain fixed, flying animals use their wings to generate both lift and thrust by moving them relative to the body. This has made the flight of organisms considerably harder to understand than that of vehicles, as it involves varying speeds, angles, orientations, areas, and flow patterns over the wings.\n\nA [[Bird flight|bird]] or [[bat]] flying through the air at a constant speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of its wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This will generate lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. [[Pterosaur]] flight likely worked in a similar manner, though no living pterosaurs remain for study.\n\n[[Insect flight]] is considerably different, due to their small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Shizhao |last2=Zhang |first2=Xing |last3=He |first3=Guowei |last4= Liu |first4=Tianshu |title=Lift Enhancement by Dynamically Changing Wingspan in Forward Flapping Flight|date=Sep 2013|arxiv=1309.2726|doi=10.1063/1.4884130 |volume=26 |issue=6 |journal=Physics of Fluids |page=061903|bibcode=2014PhFl...26f1903W}}</ref> There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight.

Circulation and lift are increased, at the price of wear and tear on the wings.<ref name=\"physics\"/><ref name=\"aerodynamics\"/>\n\n==Limits and extremes==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Flying/soaring===\n* Largest. The largest known flying animal was formerly thought to be ''[[Pteranodon]]'', a [[pterosaur]] with a wingspan of up to {{Convert|7.5|m}}. However, the more recently discovered [[azhdarchid]] pterosaur ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' is much larger, with estimates of the wingspan ranging from {{Convert|9|to|12|m}}. Some other recently discovered azhdarchid pterosaur species, such as ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]'', may have also wingspans of a similar size or even slightly larger. Although it is widely thought that ''Quetzalcoatlus'' reached the size limit of a flying animal, the same was once said of ''Pteranodon''. The heaviest living flying animals are the [[kori bustard]] and the [[great bustard]] with males reaching {{Convert|21|kg}}. The [[wandering albatross]] has the greatest wingspan of any living flying animal at {{Convert|3.63|m}}. Among living animals which fly over land, the [[Andean condor]] and the [[marabou stork]] have the largest wingspan at {{Convert|3.2|m}}. Studies have shown{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} that it is physically possible for flying animals to reach {{Convert|18|m|adj=on}} wingspans, but there is no firm evidence that any flying animal, not even the azhdarchid pterosaurs, got that large.\n\n[[Image:Comparison of Quetzalcoatlus and Cessna 172.svg|thumb|left|Comparison of ''Quetzalcoatlus northropi'' with a Cessna 172 light aircraft]]\n\n* Smallest. There is no real minimum size for getting airborne. Indeed, there are many bacteria floating in the atmosphere that constitute part of the [[aeroplankton]]. However, to move about under one's own power and not be overly affected by the wind requires a certain amount of size. The smallest flying vertebrates are the [[bee hummingbird]] and the [[bumblebee bat]], both of which may weigh less than {{Convert|2|g}}. They are thought to represent the lower size limit for [[endotherm (biology)|endotherm]] flight.\n* Fastest.

Most flying animals need to travel forward to stay aloft. However, some creatures can stay in the same spot, known as hovering, either by rapidly flapping the wings, as do [[hummingbird]]s, [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], and some others, or carefully using thermals, as do some [[birds of prey]]. The slowest flying non-hovering bird recorded is the [[American woodcock]], at {{Convert|8|km/h}}.\n* Highest flying.

One species, ''[[Deinonychus|Deinonychus antirrhopus]]'', may display partial volancy, with the young being capable of flight while the adults are flightless, a characteristic also seen in some modern birds like the [[Horned coot]] and the [[Flying steamer duck]].

All arboreal [[dolichoderine]]s and non-cephalotine [[myrmicine]]s except ''[[Daceton armigerum]]'' do not glide.

Five species of snake from Southeast Asia, [[Melanesia]], and [[India]]. The [[paradise tree snake]] of southern [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Borneo]], [[Philippines]], and [[Sulawesi]] is the most capable glider of those snakes studied. It glides by stretching out its body sideways and opening its ribs so the belly is concave, and by making lateral slithering movements. It can remarkably glide up to {{Convert|100|m}} and make 90 degree turns.\n\n====Mammals====\n[[Bat]]s are the only mammal with flapping or powered [[Bat flight|flight]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.  A few other mammals glide or parachute; the best known are [[flying squirrel]]s and [[Colugo|flying lemur]]s.\n\n* [[Flying squirrel]]s (subfamily [[Petauristinae]]). There are more than 40 living species divided between 14 genera of flying [[squirrel]]. Flying squirrels are found in Asia (most species), North America (genus ''[[Glaucomys]]'') and Europe ([[Siberian flying squirrel]]). They inhabit tropical, temperate, and even [[Subarctic]] environments. They tend to be [[nocturnal]]. When a flying squirrel wishes to cross to a tree that is further away than the distance possible by jumping, it extends the cartilage spur on its elbow or wrist. This opens out the flap of furry skin (the [[patagium]]) that stretches from its wrist to its ankle. It glides spread-eagle and with its tail fluffed out like a parachute, and grips the tree with its claws when it lands. Flying squirrels have been reported to glide over {{Convert|200|m}}.\n* [[Anomalure]]s or scaly-tailed flying squirrels (family [[Anomaluridae]]). These brightly coloured African rodents are not squirrels but have evolved to a resemble flying squirrels by [[convergent evolution]]. There are seven species, divided in three genera. All but one species have gliding membranes between their front and hind legs. The genus ''Idiurus'' contains two particularly small species known as [[flying mice]], but similarly they are not true mice.\n* [[Colugo]]s or \"flying lemurs\" (order [[Dermoptera]]). There are two species of colugo. Despite their common name, colugos are not [[lemur]]s; true lemurs are [[primate]]s. Molecular evidence suggests that colugos are a [[sister group]] to primates; however, some mammalogists suggest they are a sister group to [[bat]]s.

Birds are one of only four taxonomic groups to have [[evolution|evolved]] powered [[flight]].]]\n\nA number of [[animal]]s have [[evolution|evolved]] '''aerial locomotion''', either by powered [[flight]] or by [[gliding (flight)|gliding]]. '''Flying and gliding animals''' (''volant'' animals) have evolved separately many times, without any single ancestor. [[Flight]] has evolved at least four times, in the [[insect]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[bat]]s. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] animals in getting from tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among [[rainforest]] animals, especially in the rainforests in [[Asia]] (most especially [[Borneo]]) where the [[tree]]s are tall and widely spaced. Several species of [[aquatic animal]]s, and a few [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] have also evolved to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically as a means of evading predators.\n\n==Types==\nAnimal aerial locomotion can be divided into two categories\u2014powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces to climb or to maintain steady, level flight. Those who can find air that is rising faster than they are falling can gain altitude by [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]].\n\n===Unpowered===\nThese modes of locomotion typically require an animal start from a raised location, converting that [[potential energy]] into [[kinetic energy]] and using aerodynamic forces to control trajectory and angle of descent. Energy is continually lost to drag without being replaced, thus these methods of locomotion have limited range and duration.\n* [[Free fall|Falling]]: decreasing altitude under the force of [[gravity]], using no adaptations to increase [[Drag (physics)|drag]] or provide [[lift (force)|lift]].\n* [[Parachuting]]: falling at an angle greater than 45\u00b0 from the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] with adaptations to increase drag forces. Very small animals may be carried up by the [[wind]]. Some gliding animals may use their gliding membranes for drag rather than lift, to safely descend.\n* [[gliding (flight)|Gliding flight]]: falling at an angle less than 45\u00b0 from the horizontal with lift from adapted [[airfoil|aerofoil]] [[Patagium|membranes]]. This allows slowly falling directed horizontal movement, with streamlining to decrease drag forces for aerofoil efficiency and often with some maneuverability in air. Gliding animals have a lower [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] (wing length/breadth) than true flyers.\n\n===Powered flight===\nPowered [[flight]] has evolved only four times: first in the [[insect]]s, then in [[pterosaur]]s, next in [[bird]]s, and last in [[bat]]s. Powered flight uses muscles to generate [[aerodynamic force]], which allows the animal to produce lift and thrust. The animal may ascend without the aid of rising air.\n\n===Externally powered===\nBallooning and soaring are not powered by muscle, but rather by external aerodynamic sources of energy: the wind and rising thermals, respectively. Both can continue as long as the source of external power is present. Soaring is typically only seen in species capable of powered flight, as it requires extremely large wings.\n* [[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning]]: being carried up into the air from the aerodynamic effect on long strands of silk in the wind. Certain silk-producing [[arthropod]]s, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight [[Gossamer (spider silk)|gossamer silk]] for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude. \n* [[Lift (soaring)|Soaring]]: gliding in rising or otherwise moving air that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air is due to [[thermals]], [[ridge lift]] or [[lift (soaring)|other meteorological features]]. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without expending energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring.\n\nMany species will use multiple of these modes at various times; a hawk will use powered flight to rise, then soar on thermals, then descend via free-fall to catch its prey.\n\n==Evolution and ecology==\n\n===Gliding and parachuting===\nWhile gliding occurs independently from powered flight,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/11/new_theory_on_bat_flight_has_e_1.html|title=New theory on bat flight has experts a-flutter|date=5 November 2011|author=Ivan Semeniuk}}</ref> it has some ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very [[energy]]-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as [[fruit]]s, [[nectar]], and insects.<ref name=\"rainforest\">{{cite web | url=http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709003610/http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archivedate=2006-07-09 |title=Life in the Rainforest |accessdate=15 April 2006}}</ref> In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a dozen times among extant vertebrates); however these groups have not radiated nearly as much as have groups of flying animals.\n\nWorldwide, the distribution of gliding animals is uneven as most inhabit rain forests in [[Southeast Asia]]. (Despite seemingly suitable rain forest habitats, few gliders are found in India or New Guinea and none in Madagascar.) Additionally, a variety of gliding vertebrates are found in [[Africa]], a family of [[Hylidae|hylids]] ([[flying frog]]s) lives in [[South America]] and several species of gliding squirrels are found in the forests of northern Asia and North America.<ref name=Corlett>{{cite book |last1=Corlett |first1=Richard T. |title=Tropical rain forests : an ecological and biogeographical comparison |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2011 |location=Chichester |isbn=978-1444332551 |pages=197, 200 |edition=2nd |author2=Primack, Richard B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=R0j8NROHQi8C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=south+american+gliding+frog#v=onepage&q=south%20american%20gliding%20frog&f=false}}</ref> Various factors produce these disparities. In the forests of Southeast Asia, the dominant canopy trees (usually [[Dipterocarpaceae|dipterocarp]]s) are taller than the canopy trees of the other forests. A higher start provides a competitive advantage of further glides and farther travel. Gliding predators may more efficiently search for prey. The lower abundance of insect and small vertebrate prey for carnivorous animals (such as lizards) in Asian forests may be a factor.<ref name=Corlett/>  In Australia, many mammals (and all mammalian gliders) possess, to some extent, prehensile tails.\n\n===Powered flight evolution===\n[[File:Homology.jpg|upright|thumbnail| [[Homology (biology)|Analogous flying adaptions in vertebrates]]: {{ordered list |1=pterosaur ([[Pterosauria]]) |2=bat ([[Chiroptera]]) |3=bird ([[Aves]])}}]]\n\nPowered flight has evolved unambiguously only four times\u2014[[birds]], [[bats]], [[pterosaurs]], and [[insects]]. In contrast to gliding, which has evolved more frequently but typically gives rise to only a handful of species, all three extant groups of powered flyers have a huge number of species, suggesting that flight is a very successful strategy once evolved. [[Bat]]s, after [[rodent]]s, have the most species of any [[mammal]]ian order, about 20% of all mammalian [[species]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Simmons |first1=N.B. |title=Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference|date=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=312\u2013529 |author2=D.E. Wilson, D.C. Reeder}}</ref> [[Bird]]s have the most species of any class of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s. Finally, [[insect]]s (most of which fly at some point in their life cycle) have more species than all other animal groups combined.\n\nThe evolution of flight is one of the most striking and demanding in animal evolution, and has attracted the attention of many prominent scientists and generated many theories. Additionally, because flying animals tend to be small and have a low mass (both of which increase the surface-area-to-mass ratio), they tend to fossilize infrequently and poorly compared to the larger, heavier-boned terrestrial species they share habitat with. Fossils of flying animals tend to be confined to exceptional fossil deposits formed under highly specific circumstances, resulting in a generally poor fossil record, and a particular lack of transitional forms. Furthermore, as fossils do not preserve behavior or muscle, it can be difficult to discriminate between a poor flyer and a good glider.\n\n[[Insect wing#Evolution|Insects were the first to evolve flight]], approximately 350 million years ago. The developmental origin of the insect wing remains in dispute, as does the purpose prior to true flight. One suggestion is that wings initially were used to catch the wind for small insects that live on the surface of the water, while another is that they functioned in parachuting, then gliding, then flight for originally arboreal insects.\n\n[[Pterosaurs]] were the next to evolve flight, approximately 228 million years ago. These reptiles were close relatives of the dinosaurs (and sometimes mistakenly considered dinosaurs by laymen), and reached enormous sizes, with some of the last forms being the largest flying animals ever to inhabit the Earth, having wingspans of over 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft). However, they spanned a large range of sizes, down to a 250&nbsp;mm (10&nbsp;in) wingspan in ''[[Nemicolopterus]]''.\n\n[[Bird flight#Evolution of bird flight|Birds]] have an extensive fossil record, along with many forms documenting both their evolution from small theropod dinosaurs and the numerous bird-like forms of theropod which did not survive the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Indeed, ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is arguably the most famous transitional fossil in the world, both due to its mix of reptilian and avian anatomy and the luck of being discovered only two years after Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. However, the ecology of this transition is considerably more contentious, with various scientists supporting either a \"trees down\" origin (in which an arboreal ancestor evolved gliding, then flight) or a \"ground up\" origin (in which a fast-running terrestrial ancestor used wings for a speed boost and to help catch prey).\n\n[[Bat]]s are the most recent to evolve (about 60 million years ago), most likely from a fluttering ancestor,<ref name=\"Kaplan2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Matt |title=Ancient bats got in a flap over food |journal=Nature |year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9304}}</ref> though their poor fossil record has hindered more detailed study.\n\nOnly a few animals are known to have specialised in soaring: the larger of the extinct [[pterosaur]]s, and some large birds. Powered flight is very energetically expensive for large animals, but for soaring their size is an advantage, as it allows them a low wing loading, that is a large wing areas relative to their weight, which maximizes lift.<ref name=\"berkeleyenter\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/enter.html | title=Vertebrate Flight |accessdate=15 April 2006}}</ref> Soaring is very energetically efficient.\n\n==Biomechanics==\n\n===Gliding and parachuting===\nDuring a free-fall with no aerodynamic forces, the object accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity as the object descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented at an angle to the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.\n\nDuring gliding, lift plays an increased role. Like drag, lift is proportional to velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.\n\n===Powered flight===\nUnlike most air vehicles, in which the objects that generate lift (wings) and thrust (engine/propeller) are separate and the wings remain fixed, flying animals use their wings to generate both lift and thrust by moving them relative to the body. This has made the flight of organisms considerably harder to understand than that of vehicles, as it involves varying speeds, angles, orientations, areas, and flow patterns over the wings.\n\nA [[Bird flight|bird]] or [[bat]] flying through the air at a constant speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of its wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This will generate lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. [[Pterosaur]] flight likely worked in a similar manner, though no living pterosaurs remain for study.\n\n[[Insect flight]] is considerably different, due to their small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Shizhao |last2=Zhang |first2=Xing |last3=He |first3=Guowei |last4= Liu |first4=Tianshu |title=Lift Enhancement by Dynamically Changing Wingspan in Forward Flapping Flight|date=Sep 2013|arxiv=1309.2726|doi=10.1063/1.4884130 |volume=26 |issue=6 |journal=Physics of Fluids |page=061903|bibcode=2014PhFl...26f1903W}}</ref> There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight.

Some other recently discovered azhdarchid pterosaur species, such as ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]'', may have also wingspans of a similar size or even slightly larger. Although it is widely thought that ''Quetzalcoatlus'' reached the size limit of a flying animal, the same was once said of ''Pteranodon''. The heaviest living flying animals are the [[kori bustard]] and the [[great bustard]] with males reaching {{Convert|21|kg}}. The [[wandering albatross]] has the greatest wingspan of any living flying animal at {{Convert|3.63|m}}. Among living animals which fly over land, the [[Andean condor]] and the [[marabou stork]] have the largest wingspan at {{Convert|3.2|m}}.

When a flying squirrel wishes to cross to a tree that is further away than the distance possible by jumping, it extends the cartilage spur on its elbow or wrist. This opens out the flap of furry skin (the [[patagium]]) that stretches from its wrist to its ankle. It glides spread-eagle and with its tail fluffed out like a parachute, and grips the tree with its claws when it lands. Flying squirrels have been reported to glide over {{Convert|200|m}}.\n* [[Anomalure]]s or scaly-tailed flying squirrels (family [[Anomaluridae]]). These brightly coloured African rodents are not squirrels but have evolved to a resemble flying squirrels by [[convergent evolution]]. There are seven species, divided in three genera. All but one species have gliding membranes between their front and hind legs. The genus ''Idiurus'' contains two particularly small species known as [[flying mice]], but similarly they are not true mice.\n* [[Colugo]]s or \"flying lemurs\" (order [[Dermoptera]]). There are two species of colugo. Despite their common name, colugos are not [[lemur]]s; true lemurs are [[primate]]s. Molecular evidence suggests that colugos are a [[sister group]] to primates; however, some mammalogists suggest they are a sister group to [[bat]]s. Found in Southeast Asia, the colugo is probably the mammal most adapted for gliding, with a patagium that is as large as geometrically possible. They can glide as far as {{Convert|70|m}} with minimal loss of height.\n* [[Sifaka]], a type of lemur, and possibly some other primates (possible limited gliding/parachuting). A number of primates have been suggested to have adaptations that allow limited gliding and/or parachuting: sifakas, [[indri]]s, [[galago]]s and [[saki monkey]]s. Most notably, the sifaka, a type of [[lemur]], has thick hairs on its forearms that have been argued to provide drag, and a small membrane under its arms that has been suggested to provide lift by having aerofoil properties.<ref name=\"darrennaish.blogspot.com\">[http://darrennaish.blogspot.com/2006/09/literally-flying-lemurs-and-not.html Darren Naish: Tetrapod Zoology: Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/08/literally_flying_lemurs.php Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans) \u2013 Tetrapod Zoology<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816034946/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/08/literally_flying_lemurs.php |date=16 August 2010 }}</ref>\n* [[Flying phalanger]]s or wrist-winged gliders (subfamily [[Petaurinae]]).

Arnprior Shamrocks claimed the 1910 UOVHL championship title on March 16, 1910 by defeating the Pembroke Hockey Club 3 goals to 2 in [[Renfrew, Ontario|Renfrew]] and Kelly scored two of the goals for Arnprior, including the game winning 3-2 goal in the second half of the game.<ref>\"Ottawa Valley league honors won by Arnprior Shamrocks\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', March 17 1910 (pg. 8)</ref>\n\nKelly played in [[Montreal]] during the 1910\u201311 and 1911\u201312 seasons, in the city league and in the [[Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union]] (IAHU), with the Montreal Stars and the [[Montreal Shamrocks]], and during the 1911\u201312 season his younger brother Ernie Kelly joined him playing on the Stars and the Shamrocks.<ref>\"Victorias now lead. Win From Shamrocks Puts Vics at Top of Table\", ''The Montreal Gazette'', February 7 1912 (pg. 12)</ref>\n\nIn 1912\u201313 and 1913\u201314 Kelly played for the Grand-M\u00e8re Hockey Club from [[Grand-M\u00e8re, Quebec|Grand-M\u00e8re]] in Qu\u00e9bec, in the IAHU. Grand-M\u00e8re HC had a strong team, where Kelly played a central role, and won the IAHU championship both in 1913 and 1914. In 1913 Grand-M\u00e8re HC won league honors by defeating the [[Ottawa New Edinburghs]] in the final 7 goals to 4 over two games (7-1, 0-3)<ref>\"New Edinburgh shut out Grand Mere by 3-0 but lost interprovincial championship. Easterners win on round 7 to 4 paddlers couldn't overcome lead\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', March 20 1913 (pg. 8)</ref>, and in 1914 the club again emerged victorious in the IAHU and challenged the Regina Victorias from Saskatchewan for the [[Allan Cup]], the premier amateur hockey prize in Canada, but the Victorias held on to the trophy by defeating Grand-M\u00e8re HC 10 goals to 5 over two games (6-4, 4-1) on home ice in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]].<ref>\"Regina Victorias held Allan Cup\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', March 19 1914 (pg. 9)</ref>\n\nKelly joined the [[Winnipeg Victorias]] in the Winnipeg Amateur Hockey League for the 1914\u201315 season, but mostly appeared as a spare player during the season behind [[Alex Romeril]], as well as with the Winnipeg Victorias intermediates, although he did start a league game at his natural center forward position on January 21, 1915 against the Winnipeg Hockey Club in a contest the Victorias won 11 games to 5, with Kelly scoring a goal off of [[Percy Galbraith]]'s skate.<ref>\"Aggressive hockey enables Victorias to outclass 'Pegs\", ''The Winnipeg Tribune'', January 22 1915 (pg. 10)</ref>\n\nThe three following seasons, between 1915 and 1918, Kelly played hockey in [[Saskatoon]]\u00a0(with the Saskatoon Pilgrims and the Saskatoon Quakers) where he was a prolific scorer. The March 5, 1917 issue of the ''Saskatoon Daily Star'' concluded that Kelly had not lost his speed from his Grand-M\u00e8re days and that he had also added more cunningness to his game, and that he had a \"flip\" shot that caused disruption for the opposing goaltenders.<ref>\"Pilgrim Combination to Pull Them Through \u2013 C. Fred \"King\" Kelly\", ''The Saskatoon Daily Star'', March 5, 1917 (pg. 9)</ref>\n\n[[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]] of the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA signed Kelly from the Vancouver Shipyards Coughlans well into the 1919 season, on January 31, and used him as a spare player for the rest of the regular season. Kelly was given sweater #10 with the Millionaires<ref name=sun/>, but he did not score any goals for the club.\n\nKelly joined the Calgary Columbus Club (colloquially known as the \"C.C.s\") of the Alberta Big-4 Hockey League for the 1919\u201320 season where he became a teammate of [[Mickey MacKay]] who had also starred on the 1919 Vancouver Millionaires in the PCHA. While not playing hockey with the Columbus Club Kelly worked as an [[claims adjuster|insurance adjuster]].<ref>\"Lost fairly and no complaint; M'Kinley\", ''The Calgary Herald'', January 10 1920 (pg. 27)</ref>\n\nAfter his playing career was over Kelly stayed in Calgary and in the 1930s he was both a hockey coach and referee in the city. In 1935\u201336 he coached the Calgary Rangers of the Alberta Senior Hockey League.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kelly, Fred}}\n[[Category:1974 deaths]]\n[[Category:Canadian ice hockey centres]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario]]\n[[Category:Montreal Shamrocks players]]\n[[Category:Winnipeg Victorias players]]\n[[Category:Vancouver Millionaires players]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kelly_(ice_hockey)"}
