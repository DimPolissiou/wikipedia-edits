He is a [[saint]] of the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[patron saint]] for teachers of youth. He is referred to both as '''La Salle''' and as '''De La Salle'''.\n\nLa Salle dedicated much of his life to the [[education]] of poor children in [[France]]; in doing so, he started many lasting educational practices. He is considered the founder of the first [[Catholic school|Catholic schools]].\n\n==Background==\nLa Salle was born no where  some nice soup look ms bennet im smart see to a wealthy family in [[Rheims]], France on April 30, in 1651. He was the oldest child of Louis de La Salle and Nicolle Moet de Brouillet.

When De La Salle had completed his classical, literary, and philosophical courses, he was sent to Paris to enter the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice on October 18, 1670. His mother died on July 19, 1671, and on April 9, 1672, his father died. This circumstance obliged him to leave Saint-Sulpice on April 19, 1672. He was now twenty-one, the head of the family, and as such had the responsibility of educating his four brothers and two sisters. He completed his theological studies and was ordained to the priesthood at the age of 26 on April 9, 1678. Two years later he received a [[doctorate]] in [[theology]].<ref name=graham>{{Catholic |last=Graham |first=Matthias |wstitle=St. John Baptist de la Salle |volume=8 |inline=1 |prescript=}}</ref>\n\n==Sisters of the Child Jesus==\n\nThe [[Sisters of the Child Jesus]] were a new [[religious congregation]] whose work was the care of the sick and education of poor girls. The young priest had helped them in becoming established, and then served as their chaplain and confessor. It was through his work with the Sisters that in 1679 he met [[Adrian Nyel]]. With De La Salle's help, a school was soon opened. Shortly thereafter, a wealthy woman in [[Reims|Rheims]] told Nyel that she also would endow a school, but only if La Salle would help. What began as an effort to help Adrian Nyel establish a school for the poor in La Salle's home town gradually became his life's work.<ref>Wanner, R., ''Claude Fleury (1640-1723) as an Educational Historiographer'' 1975 \"No survey of French education in the seventeenth century would be complete without reference to the educational work of Jean-Baptiste de La Salle.\"</ref>\n\n==Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools==\n[[File:\u00c9glise Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-la-Salle (Paris) 15.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue in the Church of Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, Paris, France]]\nAt that time, most children had little [[Life chances|hope]] for [[Social mobility|social]] and [[Economic mobility|economic advancement]].  Jean Baptiste de La Salle believed that education gave hope and opportunity for people to lead better lives of dignity and freedom. Moved by the plight of the poor who seemed so \"far from salvation\" either in this world or the next, he determined to put his own talents and advanced education at the service of the children \"often left to themselves and badly brought up\".<ref name=Lasalle/>\n\nLa Salle knew that the teachers in Reims were struggling, lacking leadership, purpose, and training, and he found himself taking increasingly deliberate steps to help this small group of men with their work. First, in 1680, he invited them to take their meals in his home, as much to teach them table manners as to inspire and instruct them in their work. This crossing of social boundaries was one that his relatives found difficult to bear. In 1681, De La Salle realized that he would have to take a further step \u2013 he brought the teachers into his own home to live with him. De La Salle's relatives were deeply disturbed, his social class was scandalized. When, a year later, his family home was lost at auction because of a family lawsuit, De La Salle rented a house into which he and the handful of teachers moved.<ref name=institute>[http://delasalle.org/resources/resources-signs-of-faith/sof_fall00/f00life.htm \"John Baptist de La Salle: His Life and Times\", ''Signs of Faith'', Winter 2000, De La Salle Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717090611/http://delasalle.org/resources/resources-signs-of-faith/sof_fall00/f00life.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nLa Salle decided to resign his canonry to devote his full attention to the establishment of schools and the training of teachers. He had inherited a considerable fortune, and this might have been used to further his aims, but on the advice of a Father Barre of Paris, he sold what he had and sent the money to the poor of the province of Champagne, where a famine was causing great hardship.<ref name=crawley>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/LASALLE.htm \"St. John Baptist de La Salle\", ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref>\n\nLa Salle thereby began a new [[religious institute]], the first one with no priests, at all, among its members: the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools,<ref name=Lasalle/> also known as the De La Salle Brothers (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Australasia, and Asia) or, most commonly in the United States, the Christian Brothers.  (They are sometimes confused with a different congregation of the same name founded by [[Edmund Ignatius Rice]] in Ireland, who are known in the U.S. as the [[Irish Christian Brothers]].) The De La Salle Brothers were the first Roman Catholic teaching religious institute that did not include any [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]].{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nOne decision led to another until La Salle found himself doing something that he had never anticipated. La Salle wrote:{{cquote|''I had imagined that the care which I assumed of the schools and the masters would amount only to a marginal involvement committing me to no more than providing for the subsistence of the masters and assuring that they acquitted themselves of their tasks with piety and devotion ...<ref name=graham/> Indeed, if I had ever thought that the care I was taking of the schoolmasters out of pure charity would ever have made it my duty to live with them, I would have dropped the whole project. ... God, who guides all things with wisdom and serenity, whose way it is not to force the inclinations of persons, willed to commit me entirely to the development of the schools. He did this in an imperceptible way and over a long period of time so that one commitment led to another in a way that I did not foresee in the beginning.''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSw3ucl9JI4C&pg=PA49 |title=Praying with John Baptist de La Salle |last=Koch |first=Carl |publisher=Saint Mary's Press |year=1990 |isbn=9780884892403 |pages=49\u201350 |language=en}}</ref>}}\n\nLa Salle's enterprise met opposition from the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities who resisted the creation of a new form of [[religious life]], a community of [[consecrated]] [[laymen]] to conduct free schools \"together and by association\".  The educational establishment resented his innovative methods.<ref name=crawley/> Nevertheless, La Salle and his  small group of free teachers set up the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools which is, according to the La Salle Web site, entirely dedicated to the Christian education of the \"children of artisans and the poor\", in a life close to that of the [[Religious (Catholicism)|Catholic religious]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lasallefrance.fr/jean-baptiste-de-la-salle/|title=Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle|website=La Salle France|date=2016|accessdate=21 January 2019|}}</ref>\n\nIn 1685, La Salle founded what is generally considered the first [[normal school]] &mdash; that is, a school whose purpose is to train teachers &mdash; in Rheims, France.<ref name=jefferson>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184207/http://www.discoverthepriesthood.org/Prayer/StLaSalle.html |date=October 29, 2013 |title=\"Discover the Priesthood\", Diocese of Jefferson City, Missouri }}.

When De La Salle had completed his classical, literary, and philosophical courses, he was sent to Paris to enter the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice on October 18, 1670. His mother died on July 19, 1671, and on April 9, 1672, his father died. This circumstance obliged him to leave Saint-Sulpice on April 19, 1672. He was now twenty-one, the head of the family, and as such had the responsibility of educating his four brothers and two sisters. He completed his theological studies and was ordained to the priesthood at the age of 26 on April 9, 1678. Two years later he received a [[doctorate]] in [[theology]].<ref name=graham>{{Catholic |last=Graham |first=Matthias |wstitle=St. John Baptist de la Salle |volume=8 |inline=1 |prescript=}}</ref>\n\n==Sisters of the Child Jesus==\n\nThe [[Sisters of the Child Jesus]] were a new [[religious congregation]] whose work was the care of the sick and education of poor girls. The young priest had helped them in becoming established, and then served as their chaplain and confessor. It was through his work with the Sisters that in 1679 he met [[Adrian Nyel]]. With De La Salle's help, a school was soon opened. Shortly thereafter, a wealthy woman in [[Reims|Rheims]] told Nyel that she also would endow a school, but only if La Salle would help. What began as an effort to help Adrian Nyel establish a school for the poor in La Salle's home town gradually became his life's work.<ref>Wanner, R., ''Claude Fleury (1640-1723) as an Educational Historiographer'' 1975 \"No survey of French education in the seventeenth century would be complete without reference to the educational work of Jean-Baptiste de La Salle.\"</ref>\n\n==Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools==\n[[File:\u00c9glise Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-la-Salle (Paris) 15.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue in the Church of Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, Paris, France]]\nAt that time, most children had little [[Life chances|hope]] for [[Social mobility|social]] and [[Economic mobility|economic advancement]].  Jean Baptiste de La Salle believed that education gave hope and opportunity for people to lead better lives of dignity and freedom. Moved by the plight of the poor who seemed so \"far from salvation\" either in this world or the next, he determined to put his own talents and advanced education at the service of the children \"often left to themselves and badly brought up\".<ref name=Lasalle/>\n\nLa Salle knew that the teachers in Reims were struggling, lacking leadership, purpose, and training, and he found himself taking increasingly deliberate steps to help this small group of men with their work. First, in 1680, he invited them to take their meals in his home, as much to teach them table manners as to inspire and instruct them in their work. This crossing of social boundaries was one that his relatives found difficult to bear. In 1681, De La Salle realized that he would have to take a further step \u2013 he brought the teachers into his own home to live with him. De La Salle's relatives were deeply disturbed, his social class was scandalized. When, a year later, his family home was lost at auction because of a family lawsuit, De La Salle rented a house into which he and the handful of teachers moved.<ref name=institute>[http://delasalle.org/resources/resources-signs-of-faith/sof_fall00/f00life.htm \"John Baptist de La Salle: His Life and Times\", ''Signs of Faith'', Winter 2000, De La Salle Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717090611/http://delasalle.org/resources/resources-signs-of-faith/sof_fall00/f00life.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nLa Salle decided to resign his canonry to devote his full attention to the establishment of schools and the training of teachers. He had inherited a considerable fortune, and this might have been used to further his aims, but on the advice of a Father Barre of Paris, he sold what he had and sent the money to the poor of the province of Champagne, where a famine was causing great hardship.<ref name=crawley>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/LASALLE.htm \"St. John Baptist de La Salle\", ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref>\n\nLa Salle thereby began a new [[religious institute]], the first one with no priests, at all, among its members: the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools,<ref name=Lasalle/> also known as the De La Salle Brothers (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Australasia, and Asia) or, most commonly in the United States, the Christian Brothers.  (They are sometimes confused with a different congregation of the same name founded by [[Edmund Ignatius Rice]] in Ireland, who are known in the U.S. as the [[Irish Christian Brothers]].) The De La Salle Brothers were the first Roman Catholic teaching religious institute that did not include any [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]].{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nOne decision led to another until La Salle found himself doing something that he had never anticipated. La Salle wrote:{{cquote|''I had imagined that the care which I assumed of the schools and the masters would amount only to a marginal involvement committing me to no more than providing for the subsistence of the masters and assuring that they acquitted themselves of their tasks with piety and devotion ...<ref name=graham/> Indeed, if I had ever thought that the care I was taking of the schoolmasters out of pure charity would ever have made it my duty to live with them, I would have dropped the whole project. ... God, who guides all things with wisdom and serenity, whose way it is not to force the inclinations of persons, willed to commit me entirely to the development of the schools. He did this in an imperceptible way and over a long period of time so that one commitment led to another in a way that I did not foresee in the beginning.''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSw3ucl9JI4C&pg=PA49 |title=Praying with John Baptist de La Salle |last=Koch |first=Carl |publisher=Saint Mary's Press |year=1990 |isbn=9780884892403 |pages=49\u201350 |language=en}}</ref>}}\n\nLa Salle's enterprise met opposition from the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities who resisted the creation of a new form of [[religious life]], a community of [[consecrated]] [[laymen]] to conduct free schools \"together and by association\".  The educational establishment resented his innovative methods.<ref name=crawley/> Nevertheless, La Salle and his  small group of free teachers set up the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools which is, according to the La Salle Web site, entirely dedicated to the Christian education of the \"children of artisans and the poor\", in a life close to that of the [[Religious (Catholicism)|Catholic religious]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lasallefrance.fr/jean-baptiste-de-la-salle/|title=Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle|website=La Salle France|date=2016|accessdate=21 January 2019|}}</ref>\n\nIn 1685, La Salle founded what is generally considered the first [[normal school]] &mdash; that is, a school whose purpose is to train teachers &mdash; in Rheims, France.<ref name=jefferson>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184207/http://www.discoverthepriesthood.org/Prayer/StLaSalle.html |date=October 29, 2013 |title=\"Discover the Priesthood\", Diocese of Jefferson City, Missouri }}.

Josh grew up on US 23, renamed Country Music Highway by the state of Kentucky in honor of the many country music artists and musicians that had come from the area, and developed a deep love of country music, particularly artists like [[Keith Whitley]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]].  His father encouraged him to write songs because of his love of music, and encouraged him to listen to [[The Beatles]], which made Josh want to become a songwriter.  Josh graduated from Shelby Valley High School in 1998 and moved right after graduation to Nashville where he signed his first publishing deal with [[Warner Chappell Music]].\n\n==Career==\nJosh Osborne signed a publishing agreement with [[Black River Entertainment]] in 2010.

Josh grew up on US 23, renamed Country Music Highway by the state of Kentucky in honor of the many country music artists and musicians that had come from the area, and developed a deep love of country music, particularly artists like [[Keith Whitley]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]].  His father encouraged him to write songs because of his love of music, and encouraged him to listen to [[The Beatles]], which made Josh want to become a songwriter.  Josh graduated from Shelby Valley High School in 1998 and moved right after graduation to Nashville where he signed his first publishing deal with [[Warner Chappell Music]].\n\n==Career==\nJosh Osborne signed a publishing agreement with [[Black River Entertainment]] in 2010. In 2015, Osborne announced he was joining [[Shane McAnally]]'s company, SMACKSongs as a partner and songwriter.

The [[East Coast]] institutions favoured a drilling site in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Caribbean]], while Scripps in [[San Diego]] favoured a [[North Pacific]] site.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> Any site had to be near a large port to make the logistics of the large expedition feasible, it had to have a Moho as shallow as possible, it could not be in a geologically active region, and it had to have stable weather conditions.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> In January 1965 a site north of [[Maui, Hawaii]], was selected.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/>\n\nA critical dispute was whether Mohole should begin at a modest, conservative pace with a program of drilling shallow bore holes in sediments, or whether it should proceed at once to drill the deep hole to the Moho.<ref name=\"Winterer\"/> The issue was critical since the two approaches required differing engineering, management, and allocation of resources. There was significant interest in a program of shallower holes from those in the [[oceanography|oceanographic community]] and the [[oil industry]]. The deeper hole addressed more fundamental questions about the structure of the Earth. Some viewed the more modest initial approach as developing essential engineering and drilling techniques that would later be required for the deep bore hole.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/>\n\nSome in the [[geology]] and [[geophysics]] communities objected to Mohole because, for its enormous cost, they expected that not much would be learned from drilling. They viewed the project as an engineering stunt of little scientific value.<ref name=\"G.Lill\"/>\n\n=== Management ===\nDuring the CUSS I test and shortly thereafter, the Mohole project was managed by the National Academy of Sciences, with AMSOC acting as an advisor. The informal AMSOC group was insufficient to manage what was expected to be a large project in its next phase, and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) took over management of the project in late 1961.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 17, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (II) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3603 |pages=223\u2013227| doi=10.1126/science.143.3603.223|pmid=17753144 |bibcode=1964Sci...143..223G }}</ref><ref name=\"Greenberg 3\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 24, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (III) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3604 |pages=334\u2013337| doi=10.1126/science.143.3604.334|bibcode=1964Sci...143..334G }}</ref> AMSOC was retained as an advisor to NSF.

Part of this disagreement resulted from a long tradition of competition between the four main oceanographic institutions: [[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont Geological Observatory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in [[Massachusetts]], the [[University of Miami]] in Florida, and the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in California.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> The competitive nature of these institutions meant that they often refused to cooperate. The [[East Coast]] institutions favoured a drilling site in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Caribbean]], while Scripps in [[San Diego]] favoured a [[North Pacific]] site.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> Any site had to be near a large port to make the logistics of the large expedition feasible, it had to have a Moho as shallow as possible, it could not be in a geologically active region, and it had to have stable weather conditions.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> In January 1965 a site north of [[Maui, Hawaii]], was selected.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/>\n\nA critical dispute was whether Mohole should begin at a modest, conservative pace with a program of drilling shallow bore holes in sediments, or whether it should proceed at once to drill the deep hole to the Moho.<ref name=\"Winterer\"/> The issue was critical since the two approaches required differing engineering, management, and allocation of resources. There was significant interest in a program of shallower holes from those in the [[oceanography|oceanographic community]] and the [[oil industry]]. The deeper hole addressed more fundamental questions about the structure of the Earth. Some viewed the more modest initial approach as developing essential engineering and drilling techniques that would later be required for the deep bore hole.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/>\n\nSome in the [[geology]] and [[geophysics]] communities objected to Mohole because, for its enormous cost, they expected that not much would be learned from drilling. They viewed the project as an engineering stunt of little scientific value.<ref name=\"G.Lill\"/>\n\n=== Management ===\nDuring the CUSS I test and shortly thereafter, the Mohole project was managed by the National Academy of Sciences, with AMSOC acting as an advisor. The informal AMSOC group was insufficient to manage what was expected to be a large project in its next phase, and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) took over management of the project in late 1961.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 17, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (II) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3603 |pages=223\u2013227| doi=10.1126/science.143.3603.223|pmid=17753144 |bibcode=1964Sci...143..223G }}</ref><ref name=\"Greenberg 3\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 24, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (III) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3604 |pages=334\u2013337| doi=10.1126/science.143.3604.334|bibcode=1964Sci...143..334G }}</ref> AMSOC was retained as an advisor to NSF.

The music was composed by [[Vidyasagar (music director)|Vidyasagar]].\n\n==Plot==\nMeenakshi ([[Manju Warrier]]), after her father's ([[Narendra Prasad]]) death, joins Uma ([[Vinaya Prasad]]) at ''Krishnagudi'', a small village in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Pavithran ([[Balachandra Menon]]), Uma's husband, is an Army officer posted there. The jovial and amiable atmosphere brings cheer and happiness back to Meenakshi.\n\nGiri ([[Jayaram]]), a family friend of Pavi, falls in love with Meenakshi, but she is not ready to accept his feelings. Akhilachandran ([[Biju Menon]]), Meenakshi's spoiled cousin, was supported by her father after the death of his parents. Her father always wanted her to marry Akhil, but his extra-possessive attitude and violent behavior had created problems for her. Though she never had any soft feelings for him, Meenakshi had promised her father on his deathbed that she would marry Akhil.\n\nPavi and Uma now want Meenakshi to marry Giri, who is a soft-spoken and fun-loving guy. Akhil goes missing for a long time. Pavi suggests that Meenakshi should wait six months. If Akhil doesn't turn up in that time, then Meenakshi should accept Giri. She agrees. She mails Akhil about this, but no reply comes back. Giri and Meenakshi become close. Suddenly one evening Renji ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) turns up at the quarter of Giri. Renji, a close friend of Akhil, informs Giri that Akhil had had an accident on his way back to Krishnagudi and is partially paralyzed. He was under Renji's care, but Renji has to leave for the U.S. So, Akhil should be handed over to Meenakshi. Giri breaks down after hearing the news that Akhil is returning.\n\nGiri and Jose ([[Jagadish]]), his roommate, take Akhil to a vacant quarter nearby and decide to take care of him, without letting Meenakshi or Pavi know. Akhil, a completely changed man, does not want to be a burden to Meenakshi and wants her to marry Giri as she had planned. When she learns this, Meenakshi thinks it is her moral responsibility to take care of the paralyzed Akhil; she decides to leave Krishnagudi for [[Kerala]] with Akhil. At the last moment, from the train, Akhil, using all his power, pushes her out, asking her to join Giri for the rest of her life.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jayaram]] as Giri Menon \n*[[Manju Warrier]] as Meenakshi \n*[[Biju Menon]] as Akhilachandran \n*[[Balachandra Menon]] as Pavithran\n*[[Vinaya Prasad]] as Uma \n*[[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]] as Renji \n*[[Jagadish]] as Jose Abraham\n*[[Narendra Prasad]] as Meenakshi's father \n*[[Augustine (actor)|Augustine]] as Gangadharan \n*[[Vineeth Kumar]] as Balan \n*[[Sukumari]] as Giri's mother \n*[[Kavya Madhavan]] as Anjali (Giri's sister)\n*[[Srividya]] as Mrs. Nair\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Krishnagudiyil Oru Pranayakalathu\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Vidyasagar (composer)|Vidyasagar]]\n| cover      = \n| alt        = \n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|1997|8|15}}\n| recorded   = 1997\n| venue      = [[Chennai]]\n| studio     = \n| genre      = [[Filmi]]\n| length     = \n| language   = [[Malayalam]]\n| label      = [[Satyam Audios]]\n| producer   = \n| prev_year  = 1997\n| next_title = \n| next_year  = \n| misc       = {{External media\n| audio1     = {{YouTube|bPVHrojyCFQ|Audio Jukebox}}\n}}\n}}\nThe music was composed by [[Vidyasagar (composer)|Vidyasagar]] and the lyrics were written by [[Gireesh Puthenchery]].

Akhilachandran ([[Biju Menon]]), Meenakshi's spoiled cousin, was supported by her father after the death of his parents. Her father always wanted her to marry Akhil, but his extra-possessive attitude and violent behavior had created problems for her. Though she never had any soft feelings for him, Meenakshi had promised her father on his deathbed that she would marry Akhil.\n\nPavi and Uma now want Meenakshi to get married to Giri, who is a soft-spoken and fun-loving guy. Akhil goes missing for a long time. Pavi suggests that Meenakshi should wait six months. If Akhil doesn't turn up in that time, then Meenakshi should accept Giri. She agrees. She mails Akhil about this, but no reply comes back. Giri and Meenakshi become close. Suddenly one evening Renji ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) turns up at the quarter of Giri. Renji, a close friend of Akhil, informs Giri that Akhil had had an accident on his way back to Krishnagudi and is partially paralyzed. He was under Renji's care, but Renji has to leave for the U.S. So, Akhil should be handed over to Meenakshi. Giri breaks down after hearing the news that Akhil is returning.\n\nGiri and Jose ([[Jagadish]]), his roommate, take Akhil to a vacant quarter nearby and decide to take care of him, without letting Meenakshi or Pavi know. Akhil, a completely changed man, does not want to be a burden to Meenakshi and wants her to marry Giri as she had planned. When she learns this, Meenakshi thinks it is her moral responsibility to take care of the paralyzed Akhil; she decides to leave Krishnagudi for [[Kerala]] with Akhil. At the last moment, from the train, Akhil, using all his power, pushes her out, asking her to join Giri for the rest of her life.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jayaram]] as  Giri Menon \n*[[Manju Warrier]] as  Meenakshi \n*[[Biju Menon]] as  Akhilachandran \n*[[Balachandra Menon]] as  Pavithran\n*[[Vinaya Prasad]] as  Uma \n*[[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]] as  Renji \n*[[Jagadish]] as Jose Abraham\n*[[Narendra Prasad]] as  Meenakshi's Father \n*[[Augustine (actor)|Augustine]] as  Gangadharan \n*[[Vineeth Kumar]] as  Balan \n*[[Sukumari]] as  Giri's Mother \n*[[Kavya Madhavan]] as  Anjali (Giri's Sister)\n*[[Srividya]] as  Mrs. Nair\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Krishnagudiyil Oru Pranayakalathu\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Vidyasagar (composer)|Vidyasagar]]\n| cover      = \n| alt        = \n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|1997|8|15}}\n| recorded   = 1997\n| venue      = [[Chennai]]\n| studio     = \n| genre      = [[Filmi]]\n| length     = \n| language   = [[Malayalam]]\n| label      = [[Satyam Audios]]\n| producer   = \n| prev_year  = 1997\n| next_title = \n| next_year  = \n| misc       = {{External media\n| audio1     = {{YouTube|bPVHrojyCFQ|Audio Jukebox}}\n}}\n}}\nThe music was composed by [[Vidyasagar (composer)|Vidyasagar]] and the lyrics were written by [[Gireesh Puthenchery]].
