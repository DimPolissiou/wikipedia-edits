Most of the content comes directly from primary sources and has not been documented anywhere yet:\n\n== 1868-1900 ==\nDr Andrew Murray was the only minister in the Nederduitsch Gereformeerde (NG) church in the Free State and Transvaal, and he was based in [[Bloemfontein]]. He was tasked to travel through both republics baptizing people, giving catechism and performing marriage ceremonies. Dr. Murray was surprised that he very seldom found young people that were illiterate, in reading, writing and arithmetic and this despite the fact that there were no schools in the area traveled. Nomad farmers bordering the north east of the Cape Colony in the eighteen hundreds had no schools, teachers or religious ministers, and yet literacy was a universal occurrence.<ref>Email from Leendert van Oostrum on Tuisondwerwys mailing list</ref>\n\n== 1900-1991 ==\nGovernment schools increased in implementation and the freedom of home schooling was increasingly limited. By the 1990s only a few families were allowed to homeschool under severe restrictions, if they could have their children exempted from compulsory school attendance. That was only granted up to Grade 3, if the family lived more than 80&nbsp;km from the nearest school and if the child(ren) were taught by a teacher qualified to teach the junior primary phase.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\">http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/</ref>\n\n== 1992 ==\nThe Association for Homeschooling is established.<ref>http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet</ref>\n\n== 1993 (Homeschoolers jailed) ==\nOn 14 December 1993 Andre and Bokkie Meintjies were sentenced to prison because their children did not attend formal school. In a court case that lasted for almost five years, Andre was sentenced to two years and Bokkie one year in separate jails in Johannesburg, and this while their three children were placed in an [[orphanage]] in the Eastern Cape to prevent contact between the parents and children. Several other parents were given suspended sentences on condition they put their children in schools. All of those parents still have criminal records.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\"/>\n\n== 1994 ==\nA group action was launched by the Association for Homeschooling and the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) from the USA that led to release of both Bokkie and Andre. The Meintjies couple were however released six months later under a blanket [[amnesty]] for prisoners with the implementation of the new constitution.<ref name=\"hslda.org\">https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000074.asp</ref>\n\n== 1995 ==\nConcept legislation was published to the effect that home schooling was to be illegal in South Africa. This led to a campaign being launched by home school leaders like Leendert van Oostrum, Graham Shortridge and Kate Durham with the HSLDA.<ref name=\"HSLDA 074\">{{Cite web|url=https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000074.asp|title=South Africa: The Struggle for the Freedom to Home School |access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> Thousands of home schoolers in the USA wrote letters to the South African embassy in the US in support of this campaign. In that time, SA was still expecting to receive large grants from America, and American public opinion was taken seriously.<ref name=\"HSLDA 074\" />\n\n== 1996 (SA Schools Act acknowledges home education) ==\nIn November of this year the SA Schools Act was promulgated wherein home schooling was recognized. In December of the same year, the new [[constitution of South Africa]] was accepted, in which the legal status of home schooling was entrenched more securely. The act requires that every home learner be registered with the relevant provincial education department \u2013 unless there is good reason not to.<ref name=\"hslda.org\"/>\n\n== 1998 ==\nThe Pestalozzi Trust is established in accordance with a brief from the general meeting of the Association for Homeschooling to serve as a legal fund to ensure the continued freedom and to promote such freedom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000073.asp</ref>\n\n== 1999 ==\nMr. Kader Asmal publishes the national policy concerning the registration of home schoolers, wherein the input from both the home schooling contingent and the provincial education departments is totally ignored. The Pestalozzi Trust advises home schoolers that the policy is in direct conflict with the SA Schools Act, and therefore not enforceable.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== 2001 - 2002 (Persecution of Doddie Kleynhans and Promulgation of NCS) ==\n\n* '''Feb''' : In February 2001 the police accompanied by the media arrived at the home of Doddie Kleyhans to arrest her. Within three minutes The Pestalozzi Trust had an attorney on the line to the senior police officer on the scene. The attorney made it clear to the policeman that the whole issue was not arrest worthy, and that it was completely sufficient to warn her that a case was being investigated against her. This they did. And Beeld newspaper carried a front-page article about the issue. The posters against lampposts led with \u201c''Government vs Mother''\u201d. Due to great pressure from the office of the minister of education, the case was never closed but also never prosecuted. Till her death the cloud of prosecution hung over Doddie.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\"/>\n* '''Oct''' : The Constitutional Court rules that the case of Harris that policies such as the registration of home schoolers may not be enforced on them.<ref>http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2001/25.html</ref>\n*'''Jun - Nov''': The draft NCS was released on 30 July 2001 for public comment and the closing date for comment was on 12 October.\n\nThe National Curriculum statement claims that it is based on the Manifesto, although the final publication of the Manifesto was only released after the National Curriculum Statement (NCS). It is put this way in the policy document in the NCS (pg.7). \u201cThe Manifesto on Values, Education and Democracy (Department of Education, 2001) identifies ten fundamental values of the Constitution\u2026The Manifesto further identifies sixteen strategies to acquaint young South Africans with the values of the Constitution. This strategy is articulated in the Revised National Curriculum Statement and includes the following:\u2026\u201d This time delay indicates that the values upon which the NCS is based, were established long beforehand, and that the process used to compose the manifesto is deceptive. Many groups have objections against this Curriculum statement. The most important points of criticism against the National curriculum are the following:<blockquote>a) It attempts to transfer the values of the Inter-faith religion to pupils. For those who wish to find out more about this aspect of the curriculum, the video \u201c''Die Intergeloofs \u2013 en New Age infiltrasie in die onderwys''\u201d by Sarel van der Merwe is strongly recommended. In Gr. 1 the following is expected: \u201c''Matches symbols associated with a range of religions in South Africa''\u201d From Gr. 4 pupils the following is expected: \u201c''demonstrate planning and skillful use of design elements in creating masks based on various nature gods of different cultures'';\u201d Gr. 6 pupils must \u201cFinds out about, tries out and explains a song-dance ritual (e.g. snake dance, rain dance, wedding dance circle dance, reed dance, stick dance), referring to its purpose and structure - patterns, repetition and sequence.\u201d\n\nb) Sex education from a secular perspective forms an integral part of the NCS. In Gr. 1 a pupil is expected to do the following: \u201c''Recognises situations that may be, or may lead to, sexual abuse,''...\u201d In Gr. 6 the following is expected: \u201c''Explains causes of communicable diseases (including HIV/AIDS) and available cures, and evaluates prevention strategies, in relation to community norms and personal values''.\u201d\n\nc) ) It attempts to break down cultural diversity and to transfer the culture of the regime\u2019s fabricated \u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019. In the learning area of Social Science, the French Huguenots, the British settlers and the Great Trek are not addressed. Western History is overwhelmingly portrayed in a negative light. Instead of his own history, for example the Afrikaans child is instructed in African civilizations in South Africa prior to 1600; inequality in existence, slavery etc. For instance, in Gr. 7 the following is expected of pupils: : \u201cComposes music, songs or jingles about human rights issues or to accompany a performance or presentation about human rights.\u201dThe summary of the NCS puts it this way: \u201cThe promotion of values is important not only for personal development, but also to ensure that a national South African identity is built on values that differ from those which undergirded apartheid education</blockquote>The following facts indicate that the aim of the department of education was to get this document approved without parents, teachers and school governing bodies noticing it and having enough time to react meaningfully.<blockquote>a) The document consists of 1 400 pages, available only in English, and makes liberal use of terms with which the average parent is not familiar. An example is the sentence, \u201cAn outcomes-based framework uses assessment methods that are able to accommodate divergent contextual factors.\u201d It would be quite justifiable to ask whether it is fair to expect average parents to be able to react meaningfully to such a document while they are busy at the same time with their normal daily routine.\n\nb) Although there are 29 000 schools in South Africa, excluding University Departments and Teacher training colleges, only 11 000 copies of the NCS were printed. Seeing as it is unlikely that the education department does not know how many schools there are in the country, this indicates that the intention of the education department was that the document would not be distributed to all schools, let alone to all teachers and parents. Some regional offices only notified schools on 4 October that they could view the NCS at the offices of specific officials. Given that it is an almost impossible task to adequately study and evaluate a document of 1 400 pages in somebody else\u2019s office within a period of 8 days, it indicates that it was not the intention of the education department to give teachers time to study the document and react meaningfully to it.\n\nd) In general, the education department reacted badly to requests from the public for the NCS to be posted to them.\n\ne) On the web page of the education department there was a hyperlink to the NCS from the main page. The hyperlink was removed two weeks before the closing date for comment.\n\nf) The education department did not take the trouble to make schools aware of the release of the NCS. In a survey of 100 schools in Gauteng in the last week of September, only 3 schools were aware of the NCS and only 2 had seen copies of it.</blockquote>Notwithstanding these obstacles, there was overwhelming reaction from the public against the NCS. The reaction consisted of thousands of letters to the press, letters to the education department and calls to parliamentarians. All of the large denominations in South Africa strongly criticised the curriculum.\n\nAfter the closing date, on 13 November 2001, public hearings were held, during which organisations could give oral input on the NCS. Although everybody could apply to make representation, the minister was able to choose whom he would allow to make representation. Although the minister said on radio the previous day that everybody would be heard, he only asked 19 organisations for input. The larger Afrikaans churches and Christian private schools were among those not permitted an opportunity to give input. During the public hearing there were demonstrations against the NCS in Cape Town and Pretoria.\n\nIn spite of the public reaction, the final NCS was promulgated on 31 May 2002, with no important changes. Some of the most repulsive sections were take out of the learning area Life Skills and hidden away in the learning area Art and Culture.\n\nAnyone who did not go through the whole curriculum diligently would not have noticed this subtle shift. [https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/campaign-against-ncs-in-2001.html Click here to view submissions, presentations and media releases from that period.]\n\n== 2004 (Gauteng meetings) ==\nThe Gauteng department of education arranges a series of meetings to try and intimidate parents to register and to demand compliance to a range of irregular demands. Representatives of the Pestalozzi Trust and the Association for Homeschooling attended all the meetings. The officials only wanted to discuss the registration process, and interactive discussion with homeschooling parents was strongly discouraged.<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/reports-by-association-for-homeschooling.html</ref>\n\n== 2005 (Department performs internal research) ==\nIn 2005 the Department of Basic Education (DBE) advertised for tenders for research on home education in South Africa. The budget was small and the terms of reference very restrictive. A tender by Wits Education Policy Unit was accepted, and they submitted their report in 2008.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\"/> The research report recommends that ''The only option for parents who do not want their children to be taught the national curriculum is to leave the country or send their children for education abroad.''<ref>\"Home Education in South Africa\" by the Wits Education Policy Unit\" - 17 March 2008</ref>\n\n== 2007 (Home education banned in Germany) ==\nIn opposition of the prosecution of home schoolers in Germany, the Association for Homeschooling holds a protest at the Deutsche Schule in Pretoria to bring this to the attention of the German community.<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents/80-2007-letter-to-the-german-embassy.html</ref>\n\n== 2008 (New regulations for NSC) ==\nNew regulations on the administration of matric were promulgated. These regulations require that learners must complete Gr. 10 and Gr. 11 in order to be admitted to write the Gr. 12 exam. Whereas it was possible for homelearners to obtain a matric in less than a year at a cost of about R1000, it will now take 3 years at a cost of about R30 000. Due to this increase in duration and cost of the National Senior Certificate, international matric qualifications such as Cambridge (UK) and General Educational Development (USA) became increasingly popular under homeschoolers.<ref>https://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ZlgknpSYL3g%3d&tabid=390&portalid=0&mid=1127</ref>\n\n== 2009 (Policy revision process starts) ==\nIn 2009 the Department of Education started the process of revising to Home Education Policy, when Ms. Mapaseka Letho from Department of Education requested Mr. Leendert van Oostrum to provide comments on the current policy and recommendations for revision. This initiative picked up momentum when the 2011 census reported that there were 56 000 home learners.\n\n== 2010 (Western Cape intimidates homeschoolers & CAPS introduced) ==\nThe Association for Homeschooling launches an initiative for an independent website on home education. The website ''SAHomeschoolers.Org'' has since grown to the most comprehensive independent website concerning home schooling in South Africa. Home Schooling Expos become more commonplace. Since this year there are annual expos in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and George.<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/mission.html</ref>\n* '''Aug''' : The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) publishes a notice in local papers in which they state that parents must register before 30 Sep in the year before they start with home education and that home education must be in line with the National Curriculum Statement. As a reaction the Association for Homeschooling and the Pestalozzi Trust wrote a letter to the WCED. A deputation of the Association, the Pestalozzi Trust and Cape Home Educators had a meeting with officials of the WCED to explain the issues caused by the notice.<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents/99-2014-letter-from-pestalozzi-trust-to-minister-donald-grant.html</ref>\n*'''Sep''' : The Department of Education releases CAPS documents for public comments. The Association for Home Education calls on home educators to analyse the documents and forwarded a consolidated list of objections to the Department of Education. The Association objects to CAPS, because it infringes on various constitutional rights. It infringes on the right to freedom of religion, because it does not make provision for teaching religions from a chosen religious perspective. It infringes on the rights of schools and parents the choose the education in the best interest of their learners. It infringes on political freedom, because it promotes a specific political agenda. It infringes on children's right to parental care, because it transmits values that conflict with the values of parents. The [https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents/71-2010-letter-national-department-of-education-1.html first letter] to the Department contains a table with all the objections to CAPS.

Homeschool representatives experienced the meeting positively, because they received ample time to present their case. DBE experienced the presentations by the representatives as well researched and providing valuable insights.<ref>[http://www.tuisskolers.org/home/entry/homeschool-associations-feedback-to-education-department.html Report on meeting with Department of Basic Education]</ref>\n\n== 2015 (KZN court case) ==\nAfter the meetings in October, it was the intention to have follow-up meetings in January 2015. As the date of the follow-up meeting approached, the meeting was postponed to February 2015, in order to provide more time to the DBE to prepare for the meeting. Two weeks before this meeting, representatives requested that the agenda and working documents be sent to them as a matter of common courtesy. Soon after this representatives were informed that the meeting was postponed indefinitely.\n\nMiddle June, representatives received another invite for a meeting on the 2nd and 3 July, with a proposed agenda and an updated Discussion Document by dr. Trevor Coombe. The representatives were surprised by the updated discussion document. This document confirmed that the DBE was indeed willing to attempt to understand home education, because a number of significant paradigms shifts have been made since the previous Discussion Document that was presented in October 2014. In the preparation for the meeting, the agenda was changed a few times. The Association for Homeschooling managed to reserve more than 90 minutes of the agenda for a screening of the \u201c[http://classdismissedmovie.com/ Class Dismissed]\u201d movie.\n\n* '''April''' : The Doe family (name changed) in KwaZulu-Natal was ripped apart. The Children's court ordered that the three young children be removed and placed in the care of their grandparents, where they are compelled to attend school.<ref>[http://www.tuisskolers.org/home/entry/home-schooling-family-ripped-apart-by-childrens-court.html Home Schooling Family ripped apart by Children's Court]</ref> The only reason for removing the children provided by the court and the social workers is that the children don't attend school.

The homeschool representatives were encouraged by the paradigm shifts that were made by DBE.<ref>[http://www.tuisskolers.org/home/entry/2nd-meeting-between-homeschool-associations-and-department-of-basic-education.html 2nd Meeting between Homeschool Associations and Department of Basic Education]</ref>\n* '''October - Dec''' : The working group was scheduled to meet every month from October to March. Three homeschooling individuals were invited to join these meeting. The first meeting was attended by Leendert van Oostrum and Joy Leavesley. Bouwe van der Eems, the third invitee, was unable to travel from Cape Town at short notice. From the start of the first working group meeting, it was made abundantly clear that a different dynamic was at work. During his opening remarks, for example, the chairman (the same Dr Simelane) claimed that \u201c''children belong to the state''\u201d. He proceeded to make it clear that those present were not there to represent their own stakeholder groups \u2013 they represented no-one except the Department of Basic Education. Very soon, it became obvious that the policy to be written would not represent anything that was presented by homeschool organisations during the consultation sessions. Instead, the discussions were aimed at implementing the original objective of the education minister \u2013 to bring home education in conformance with \u201c''the formal education system''\u201d. It became apparent to the two homeschoolers present that they were there only so that their names could be listed in the final policy proposal as \u201cmembers of the working group\u201d, giving the impression that homeschoolers were in support of the final proposals. During the second day, Leendert and Joy withdrew as members of the working group, but stated that they remained willing as resources to assist when needed. Only one of the three homeschoolers who had been invited on the working groups had not withdrawn \u2013 Bouwe van der Eems from Cape Town, who did not attend the first work group meeting. He was also unable to travel to Pretoria for the second meeting in November. Karin van Oostrum, another trustee of the Pestalozzi Trust, represented Bouwe at the November meeting. Karin's impressions of the second meeting were the same as those of the two who had withdrawn during the first meeting. Before the third meeting Karin also withdrew.\n* '''Sep - Dec''' : In April the children of the Doe (real name withheld) family of KwaZulu-Natal have been removed from their parents by social workers for \u201c''not attending school''\u201d. The only reasons given to the court were that the children were not attending schools and that their parents were allegedly \"''indoctrinating''\" the children with their religious beliefs. After this, the Pestalozzi Trust became involved. In December their three eldest children (of whom the youngest is only three years old) were permanently returned to the care of their parents by the children's court, and set aside all the previous court orders. The court also refused to accept the recommendations of the social worker and other \"''interested parties''\" that the court orders the social worker to supervise the family's homeschooling for a year. He commented that there is nothing wrong when parents bring up their children in their own beliefs, and that such an upbringing makes the children better people. He also made it very clear that, in his view, these children should never have been before the court in the first place - the matter should have been dealt with by other means.\n\n== 2016 (Home Education goes Global) ==\n\n* In '''March 2016''' the <u>Global Home Education Conference</u> (GHEC) 2016 took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Pestalozzi Trust Board of Trustees sent three of the trustees to the conference in Brazil, namely Leendert van Oostrum, Karin van Oostrum and Bouwe van der Eems.\n* In '''October 2016''' the Pestalozzi Trust announced that its founder and chairman, <u>Leendert van Oostrum passed away.</u> [http://www.tuisskolers.org/entry/in-memoriam-leendert-van-oostrum.html Click here] for an overview of his life. This was a great loss for the Pestalozzi trust. However, since the Pestalozzi Trust is essential for the continued existence of home education in South Africa, the trustees were determined to ensure that the trust continues to operate and grow its influence. After the passing away of Leendert van Oostrum, the previous Chairman and Manager of the Pestalozzi Trust, the Trustees resolved that the following three Trustees will fill the void left by Leendert's demise. Mr Bouwe van der Eems was appointed as Chairman. Mrs Karin van Oostrum was appointed as Manager and Advocate Andr\u00e9 Williams supports the Executive as a legal consultant.\n\n== 2017 (BELA Bill and draft policy on home education) ==\n\n* '''13 Oct''': The DBE invited public comment on the draft Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA Bill)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.za/Newsroom/MediaReleases/tabid/347/ctl/Details/mid/5986/ItemID/5500/Default.aspx|title=Basic Education Minister's messsage to the public in regard to comments received on the draft Basic Education Laws Ammendent bill, 13 November 2017|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> gazetted in Government Gazette no. 41178 and released via www.gpwonline.co.za. The Pestalozzi Trust, other associations of home educators and individual home educators only became aware of this in the course of the week-end of the 14th and 15 October. If a vigilant home educator did not notice this in a press article and alert organisations of home educators, the deadline for comment could easily have passed by without any comment or input from the home education community. The closing date for submissions was 10 November. The most important changes that the bill introduces are the following:\n*# The content and skills of the curriculum to be used by home learners must be at least comparable to the national curriculum.\n*# Home learners must be assessed annually by registered assessors.\n*# Home learners are not allowed to enrol for alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED.\n*# The penalty for not registering for home education is increased from 6 months to 6 years.\n* '''18 Oct''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and associations and individual parents requested that the closing date is extended. Reasons for an extension include: home educators have been procedurally prejudiced by lack of prior notice; the prescribed comment period (October\u2013November) is a period of preparation for and taking of exams for home educating families; the need for detailed consultation with members before responding; the impacts of the proposed changes are not merely technical, but may have multiple complex substantive financial, curricular, time, and legal impacts on home educating families and their supporting and representative organisations; the changes do not merely edit elements of the previous law but include entirely new provisions; many consequences thereof that may be unintended by the authors of the proposal bill and if not remedied may lead to unnecessary litigation which is neither in the interests of the Department of Basic Education, home educators nor any other party; homeschool organisations will need to take legal counsel on constitutional and other issues after consulting our members.\n* '''10 Nov''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the BELA Bell to the Department of Basic Education (DBE). Parents were also encouraged to send their comments in their own words. A total of about <u>1000 letters from homeschoolers</u> were sent to the DBE. Some of these letters were sent as anonymous submissions to the Pestalozzi Trust. The main objections to the BELA Bill were the following:\n*# The provision that home learners must register with the state is unreasonable and negatively affects the interests of children. It is untenable that parents, who are primarily responsible for the education of their children, require permission from the state to choose home education.\n*# The requirement that the proposed home education programme must cover contents and skills comparable to the national curriculum prohibits parents from choosing a curriculum or educational approach that would be in the best interests of the child, and which would not necessarily cover comparable skills and contents.\n*# The requirement for annual assessments by external assessors serves no educational purpose, covertly enforces the National Curriculum and will be costly to homeschooling parents and the taxpayer.\n*# The provision to outlaw alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED would give rise to the creation of a class of persons so disadvantaged that this would be in violation of the fundamental principle of equality which underlies the provisions of the Constitution. Secondly, the requirement that any person wishing to gain the National Senior Certificate should have to follow a three-year programme in order to do so significantly limits the rights of such a person to education.\n*# The provision to outlaw alternative curriculums and matric qualification would give an unfair financial advantage to CAPS compliant curriculum providers.\nTo ensure that statements on the negative consequences of the proposed bill can be proven empirically, homeschooling parents were requested to complete a survey. A total of <u>2750 parents completed the survey</u>.\n*'''14 Nov''' : The Western Cape Education Department submits objections to BELA Bill.

The reasons are similar to the reasons given to request and extension of the BELA Bill.\n* '''28 Nov''' : Parliament's oversight education committee has taken the exceptional step of calling a hearing \u2013 before the legislation is even tabled. In their presentation, DBE Director General Mathanzima Mweli said \u2018''the word avalanche would not describe''\u2019 the submissions they had received ''\u2018and that he had never seen it in his career in public service''\u2019. Democratic Alliance (DA) Shadow Minister of Basic Education Ian Ollis said \u201c''the reason you are getting such an avalanche is because you are tampering with the democratic rights of parents with this bill''\u201c. Ollis objected to the Director General saying they would be \u201c''processing inputs''\u201d without saying \u201c''they would be considering amendments''\u201d. He objected to the Director General's proposal to hold hearings in which to \u2018''educate the public about the bill''\u2019, which wrongly assumed they were uninformed and needed education until they agreed. He said they \u201c''needed to listen to the public''\u201c. The public participation process was also criticized by the ACDP and even ANC members of parliament. The meeting was extraordinary in a number of respects: First, a bill is normally only discussed in parliament after it is finalised and referred by cabinet. Second, the DBE sent their top officials to the meeting instead of a cabinet meeting discussing on education held at the same time. Third, they deferred to next year another scheduled parliamentary education briefing because after all the questions from parliamentarians, there was no time left for further discussion. Fourth, normally restrained ruling party parliamentarians showed strong independence, asking tough questions and making strong comments. Fifth, because a parliamentary committee requested the education department to extend the time for comment and received agreement. Sixth, strong feelings led the chair to calm the meeting. Seventh, a concerned mom brought her few month old baby, likely the youngest attendee of a parliamentary briefing, much to the delight of female parliamentarians. At the end of the session, Deputy Minister of Basic Education Enver Surty, granted an extension of time for public comment on the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA) till 10 January 2018.\n[[File:BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg|thumb|Homeschoolers at briefing on BELA Bill]]\n* '''5 Dec''' : The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) measured literacy levels between 2011 & 2016 and has found 78% of the Gr. 4 pupils who took part are functionally illiterate and South Africa scored the lowest out of 50 countries globally.\n* '''8 Dec''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the Draft Policy on Home Education to the Department of education. Parents were also encouraged to send their comments in their own words. A total of about 750 letters were sent to the Department of Basic Education, including letters requesting an extension of the closing as well as comments on the policy. Some of these letters were sent as anonymous submissions to the Pestalozzi Trust. The main objections to the policy are as follows:<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents.html</ref>\n*# A flawed consultation process means that there has not been the required meaningful consultation, and because home educators have not had sufficient input into the policy provisions, the Draft policy itself betrays a number of flaws.\n*# In general terms, the Draft Policy is flawed: while it asserts a very powerful set of constitutional and home education principles, it fails to translate those into a workable policy. In fact, it could be said that the practical provisions of the Draft Policy are diametrically opposed to the principles on which the Draft Policy is based.\n*# To further compound this problem, the Draft Policy is based on both the South African Schools Act (No. 84 of 1996) and the BELA Bill. It is highly problematic that a draft policy is being based on the provisions of a proposed bill that is still subject to the public comment process and parliamentary review.\n*# Underlying the above is the fact that the Draft Policy conflates home education and public education. These underlying flaws have led to a policy that is unworkable in practice, and will merely contribute to increased non-compliance by parents, and increased conflict between parents and education officials.\n*# The Draft Policy does not treat parents and children with dignity, as required by the founding provisions of the South African constitution.\n* '''11 Dec''' : Ms Phindile Ngcobo from the Department of Basic Education informed the Pestalozzi Trust that the Minister has granted extension till the 31st of January, 2018 for comments to the draft policy on home education.\n* '''14 Dec''' : The Pestalozzi Trust delivers 430 anonymous comments to the BELA Bill at the offices of the Department of Basic Education.\\\n\n== 2018 (Home Education Policy published) ==\n*'''16 July''' : In the week of 16 July 2018 the Pestalozzi Trust was tipped off that the Department of Basic Education (DBE) planned to approve the new policy, regardless of the flawed public participation process that was followed. When the Pestalozzi Trust was informed that the Council of Education Ministers (CEM) would discuss the policy on 16 July (the week of Mandela day), there was no option but to raise a red alert to homeschooling families. Parents were requested to contact the DBE and request a copy of the policy and an opportunity to engage with the CEM. The reaction of homeschoolers was amazing. In the week of 16 July the DBE was flooded with an estimated 600 - 1000 letters and telephone calls.\n*'''30 July''' : The DBE issued a media release in which it was confirmed that the CEM approved the policy on home education. The DBE described the concerned parents that contacted the DBE as \"''spammers''\". Although a campaign of a similar magnitude caused the City of Cape Town to stop the implementation of a water tariff, the DBE justified its decision to ignore parents by describing them as a \"small group\", as if there is a large group of parents that supports the policy.\n*'''16 Aug''' : ACDP MP Cheryllyn Dudley said in parliament that \u201c''DBE will be wasting money if the Minister promulgates the Policy on Home Education prematurely. There has been a fundamental misunderstanding between DBE and home education stakeholders resulting in a situation where the Minister of Basic Education is about to promulgate a Policy that is the result of a failed consultation process''.\u201d \"''The ACDP also calls on the Basic Education Portfolio Committee to address this issue with the department and seriously interrogate the department\u2019s handling of such an obviously important section of society during this review process.''\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pestalozzi.org/web2/af/2018/08/16/acdp-says-dbe-wasting-money-promulgating-home-education-policy-prematurely-2/|title=ACDP says DBE wasting money promulgating Home Education Policy prematurely|last=Karin|date=2018-08-16|website=Pestalozzi Trust|language=af|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>\n*'''2 Nov''' : Representatives of the Cape Home Educators and Pestalozzi Trust had meeting with MEC for Education in the Western Cape, me.

Delegates from Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, South Africa, USA, Canada and Russia gathered to confirm their solidarity as a global homeschooling movement. Policy-makers and government officials who attended the Indaba received solid researched information on all aspects of homeschooling. International researchers who attended the Indaba were Dr. Debra Bell, author and researcher from the US, and Dr. Brian Ray, from the National Home Education Research Institute in the USA. Research confirms that the amount and intensity of regulation of homeschooling does not contribute to the success of homeschoolers.\n\n== 2020 (Roundtable and Parliament) ==\n\n* '''28 Feb''' : On 28 February 2020, the Minister of Education held a Roundtable discussion on Home Education with various stakeholders. Initially only curriculum providers were invited, but after the Pestalozzi Trust and Association got to know about the Roundtable and requested invites, they were also invited.

Nomad farmers bordering the north east of the Cape Colony in the eighteen hundreds had no schools, teachers or religious ministers, and yet literacy was a universal occurrence.<ref>Email from Leendert van Oostrum on Tuisondwerwys mailing list</ref>\n\n== 1900-1991 ==\nGovernment schools increased in implementation and the freedom of home schooling was increasingly limited. By the 1990s only a few families were allowed to homeschool under severe restrictions, if they could have their children exempted from compulsory school attendance. That was only granted up to Grade 3, if the family lived more than 80&nbsp;km from the nearest school and if the child(ren) were taught by a teacher qualified to teach the junior primary phase.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\">http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/</ref>\n\n== 1992 ==\nThe Association for Homeschooling is established.<ref>http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet</ref>\n\n== 1993 (Homeschoolers jailed) ==\nOn 14 December 1993 Andre and Bokkie Meintjies were sentenced to prison because their children did not attend formal school. In a court case that lasted for almost five years, Andre was sentenced to two years and Bokkie one year in separate jails in Johannesburg, and this while their three children were placed in an [[orphanage]] in the Eastern Cape to prevent contact between the parents and children. Several other parents were given suspended sentences on condition they put their children in schools. All of those parents still have criminal records.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\"/>\n\n== 1994 ==\nA group action was launched by the Association for Homeschooling and the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) from the USA that led to release of both Bokkie and Andre.

Within three minutes The Pestalozzi Trust had an attorney on the line to the senior police officer on the scene. The attorney made it clear to the policeman that the whole issue was not arrest worthy, and that it was completely sufficient to warn her that a case was being investigated against her. This they did. And Beeld newspaper carried a front-page article about the issue. The posters against lampposts led with \u201c''Government vs Mother''\u201d. Due to great pressure from the office of the minister of education, the case was never closed but also never prosecuted. Till her death the cloud of prosecution hung over Doddie.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\"/>\n* '''Oct''' : The Constitutional Court rules that the case of Harris that policies such as the registration of home schoolers may not be enforced on them.<ref>http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2001/25.html</ref>\n*'''Jun - Nov''': The draft NCS was released on 30 July 2001 for public comment and the closing date for comment was on 12 October.\n\nThe National Curriculum statement claims that it is based on the Manifesto, although the final publication of the Manifesto was only released after the National Curriculum Statement (NCS). It is put this way in the policy document in the NCS (pg.7). \u201cThe Manifesto on Values, Education and Democracy (Department of Education, 2001) identifies ten fundamental values of the Constitution\u2026The Manifesto further identifies sixteen strategies to acquaint young South Africans with the values of the Constitution. This strategy is articulated in the Revised National Curriculum Statement and includes the following:\u2026\u201d This time delay indicates that the values upon which the NCS is based, were established long beforehand, and that the process used to compose the manifesto is deceptive. Many groups have objections against this Curriculum statement. The most important points of criticism against the National curriculum are the following:<blockquote>a) It attempts to transfer the values of the Inter-faith religion to pupils. For those who wish to find out more about this aspect of the curriculum, the video \u201c''Die Intergeloofs \u2013 en New Age infiltrasie in die onderwys''\u201d by Sarel van der Merwe is strongly recommended. In Gr. 1 the following is expected: \u201c''Matches symbols associated with a range of religions in South Africa''\u201d From Gr. 4 pupils the following is expected: \u201c''demonstrate planning and skillful use of design elements in creating masks based on various nature gods of different cultures'';\u201d Gr. 6 pupils must \u201cFinds out about, tries out and explains a song-dance ritual (e.g. snake dance, rain dance, wedding dance circle dance, reed dance, stick dance), referring to its purpose and structure - patterns, repetition and sequence.\u201d\n\nb) Sex education from a secular perspective forms an integral part of the NCS. In Gr. 1 a pupil is expected to do the following: \u201c''Recognises situations that may be, or may lead to, sexual abuse,''...\u201d In Gr. 6 the following is expected: \u201c''Explains causes of communicable diseases (including HIV/AIDS) and available cures, and evaluates prevention strategies, in relation to community norms and personal values''.\u201d\n\nc) ) It attempts to break down cultural diversity and to transfer the culture of the regime\u2019s fabricated \u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019. In the learning area of Social Science, the French Huguenots, the British settlers and the Great Trek are not addressed. Western History is overwhelmingly portrayed in a negative light. Instead of his own history, for example the Afrikaans child is instructed in African civilizations in South Africa prior to 1600; inequality in existence, slavery etc. For instance, in Gr. 7 the following is expected of pupils: : \u201cComposes music, songs or jingles about human rights issues or to accompany a performance or presentation about human rights.\u201dThe summary of the NCS puts it this way: \u201cThe promotion of values is important not only for personal development, but also to ensure that a national South African identity is built on values that differ from those which undergirded apartheid education</blockquote>The following facts indicate that the aim of the department of education was to get this document approved without parents, teachers and school governing bodies noticing it and having enough time to react meaningfully.<blockquote>a) The document consists of 1 400 pages, available only in English, and makes liberal use of terms with which the average parent is not familiar. An example is the sentence, \u201cAn outcomes-based framework uses assessment methods that are able to accommodate divergent contextual factors.\u201d It would be quite justifiable to ask whether it is fair to expect average parents to be able to react meaningfully to such a document while they are busy at the same time with their normal daily routine.\n\nb) Although there are 29 000 schools in South Africa, excluding University Departments and Teacher training colleges, only 11 000 copies of the NCS were printed. Seeing as it is unlikely that the education department does not know how many schools there are in the country, this indicates that the intention of the education department was that the document would not be distributed to all schools, let alone to all teachers and parents. Some regional offices only notified schools on 4 October that they could view the NCS at the offices of specific officials. Given that it is an almost impossible task to adequately study and evaluate a document of 1 400 pages in somebody else\u2019s office within a period of 8 days, it indicates that it was not the intention of the education department to give teachers time to study the document and react meaningfully to it.\n\nd) In general, the education department reacted badly to requests from the public for the NCS to be posted to them.\n\ne) On the web page of the education department there was a hyperlink to the NCS from the main page. The hyperlink was removed two weeks before the closing date for comment.\n\nf) The education department did not take the trouble to make schools aware of the release of the NCS. In a survey of 100 schools in Gauteng in the last week of September, only 3 schools were aware of the NCS and only 2 had seen copies of it.</blockquote>Notwithstanding these obstacles, there was overwhelming reaction from the public against the NCS. The reaction consisted of thousands of letters to the press, letters to the education department and calls to parliamentarians. All of the large denominations in South Africa strongly criticised the curriculum.\n\nAfter the closing date, on 13 November 2001, public hearings were held, during which organisations could give oral input on the NCS. Although everybody could apply to make representation, the minister was able to choose whom he would allow to make representation. Although the minister said on radio the previous day that everybody would be heard, he only asked 19 organisations for input. The larger Afrikaans churches and Christian private schools were among those not permitted an opportunity to give input. During the public hearing there were demonstrations against the NCS in Cape Town and Pretoria.\n\nIn spite of the public reaction, the final NCS was promulgated on 31 May 2002, with no important changes. Some of the most repulsive sections were take out of the learning area Life Skills and hidden away in the learning area Art and Culture.\n\nAnyone who did not go through the whole curriculum diligently would not have noticed this subtle shift.

Representatives of the Pestalozzi Trust and the Association for Homeschooling attended all the meetings. The officials only wanted to discuss the registration process, and interactive discussion with homeschooling parents was strongly discouraged.<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/reports-by-association-for-homeschooling.html</ref>\n\n== 2005 (Department performs internal research) ==\nIn 2005 the Department of Basic Education (DBE) advertised for tenders for research on home education in South Africa. The budget was small and the terms of reference very restrictive. A tender by Wits Education Policy Unit was accepted, and they submitted their report in 2008.<ref name=\"pestalozzi.org\"/> The research report recommends that ''The only option for parents who do not want their children to be taught the national curriculum is to leave the country or send their children for education abroad.''<ref>\"Home Education in South Africa\" by the Wits Education Policy Unit\" - 17 March 2008</ref>\n\n== 2007 (Home education banned in Germany) ==\nIn opposition of the prosecution of home schoolers in Germany, the Association for Homeschooling holds a protest at the Deutsche Schule in Pretoria to bring this to the attention of the German community.<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents/80-2007-letter-to-the-german-embassy.html</ref>\n\n== 2008 (New regulations for NSC) ==\nNew regulations on the administration of matric were promulgated. These regulations require that learners must complete Gr. 10 and Gr. 11 in order to be admitted to write the Gr. 12 exam. Whereas it was possible for homelearners to obtain a matric in less than a year at a cost of about R1000, it will now take 3 years at a cost of about R30 000. Due to this increase in duration and cost of the National Senior Certificate, international matric qualifications such as Cambridge (UK) and General Educational Development (USA) became increasingly popular under homeschoolers.<ref>https://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ZlgknpSYL3g%3d&tabid=390&portalid=0&mid=1127</ref>\n\n== 2009 (Policy revision process starts) ==\nIn 2009 the Department of Education started the process of revising to Home Education Policy, when Ms. Mapaseka Letho from Department of Education requested Mr. Leendert van Oostrum to provide comments on the current policy and recommendations for revision. This initiative picked up momentum when the 2011 census reported that there were 56 000 home learners.\n\n== 2010 (Western Cape intimidates homeschoolers & CAPS introduced) ==\nThe Association for Homeschooling launches an initiative for an independent website on home education.

It infringes on the right to freedom of religion, because it does not make provision for teaching religions from a chosen religious perspective. It infringes on the rights of schools and parents the choose the education in the best interest of their learners. It infringes on political freedom, because it promotes a specific political agenda.

Three homeschooling individuals were invited to join these meeting. The first meeting was attended by Leendert van Oostrum and Joy Leavesley. Bouwe van der Eems, the third invitee, was unable to travel from Cape Town at short notice. From the start of the first working group meeting, it was made abundantly clear that a different dynamic was at work. During his opening remarks, for example, the chairman (the same Dr Simelane) claimed that \u201c''children belong to the state''\u201d. He proceeded to make it clear that those present were not there to represent their own stakeholder groups \u2013 they represented no-one except the Department of Basic Education. Very soon, it became obvious that the policy to be written would not represent anything that was presented by homeschool organisations during the consultation sessions. Instead, the discussions were aimed at implementing the original objective of the education minister \u2013 to bring home education in conformance with \u201c''the formal education system''\u201d. It became apparent to the two homeschoolers present that they were there only so that their names could be listed in the final policy proposal as \u201cmembers of the working group\u201d, giving the impression that homeschoolers were in support of the final proposals. During the second day, Leendert and Joy withdrew as members of the working group, but stated that they remained willing as resources to assist when needed. Only one of the three homeschoolers who had been invited on the working groups had not withdrawn \u2013 Bouwe van der Eems from Cape Town, who did not attend the first work group meeting. He was also unable to travel to Pretoria for the second meeting in November. Karin van Oostrum, another trustee of the Pestalozzi Trust, represented Bouwe at the November meeting. Karin's impressions of the second meeting were the same as those of the two who had withdrawn during the first meeting. Before the third meeting Karin also withdrew.\n* '''Sep - Dec''' : In April the children of the Doe (real name withheld) family of KwaZulu-Natal have been removed from their parents by social workers for \u201c''not attending school''\u201d. The only reasons given to the court were that the children were not attending schools and that their parents were allegedly \"''indoctrinating''\" the children with their religious beliefs. After this, the Pestalozzi Trust became involved. In December their three eldest children (of whom the youngest is only three years old) were permanently returned to the care of their parents by the children's court, and set aside all the previous court orders. The court also refused to accept the recommendations of the social worker and other \"''interested parties''\" that the court orders the social worker to supervise the family's homeschooling for a year. He commented that there is nothing wrong when parents bring up their children in their own beliefs, and that such an upbringing makes the children better people. He also made it very clear that, in his view, these children should never have been before the court in the first place - the matter should have been dealt with by other means.\n\n== 2016 (Home Education goes Global) ==\n\n* In '''March 2016''' the <u>Global Home Education Conference</u> (GHEC) 2016 took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Pestalozzi Trust Board of Trustees sent three of the trustees to the conference in Brazil, namely Leendert van Oostrum, Karin van Oostrum and Bouwe van der Eems.\n* In '''October 2016''' the Pestalozzi Trust announced that its founder and chairman, <u>Leendert van Oostrum passed away.</u> [http://www.tuisskolers.org/entry/in-memoriam-leendert-van-oostrum.html Click here] for an overview of his life. This was a great loss for the Pestalozzi trust. However, since the Pestalozzi Trust is essential for the continued existence of home education in South Africa, the trustees were determined to ensure that the trust continues to operate and grow its influence. After the passing away of Leendert van Oostrum, the previous Chairman and Manager of the Pestalozzi Trust, the Trustees resolved that the following three Trustees will fill the void left by Leendert's demise. Mr Bouwe van der Eems was appointed as Chairman. Mrs Karin van Oostrum was appointed as Manager and Advocate Andr\u00e9 Williams supports the Executive as a legal consultant.\n\n== 2017 (BELA Bill and draft policy on home education) ==\n\n* '''13 Oct''': The DBE invited public comment on the draft Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA Bill)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.za/Newsroom/MediaReleases/tabid/347/ctl/Details/mid/5986/ItemID/5500/Default.aspx|title=Basic Education Minister's messsage to the public in regard to comments received on the draft Basic Education Laws Ammendent bill, 13 November 2017|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> gazetted in Government Gazette no. 41178 and released via www.gpwonline.co.za. The Pestalozzi Trust, other associations of home educators and individual home educators only became aware of this in the course of the week-end of the 14th and 15 October. If a vigilant home educator did not notice this in a press article and alert organisations of home educators, the deadline for comment could easily have passed by without any comment or input from the home education community. The closing date for submissions was 10 November. The most important changes that the bill introduces are the following:\n*# The content and skills of the curriculum to be used by home learners must be at least comparable to the national curriculum.\n*# Home learners must be assessed annually by registered assessors.\n*# Home learners are not allowed to enrol for alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED.\n*# The penalty for not registering for home education is increased from 6 months to 6 years.\n* '''18 Oct''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and associations and individual parents requested that the closing date is extended. Reasons for an extension include: home educators have been procedurally prejudiced by lack of prior notice; the prescribed comment period (October\u2013November) is a period of preparation for and taking of exams for home educating families; the need for detailed consultation with members before responding; the impacts of the proposed changes are not merely technical, but may have multiple complex substantive financial, curricular, time, and legal impacts on home educating families and their supporting and representative organisations; the changes do not merely edit elements of the previous law but include entirely new provisions; many consequences thereof that may be unintended by the authors of the proposal bill and if not remedied may lead to unnecessary litigation which is neither in the interests of the Department of Basic Education, home educators nor any other party; homeschool organisations will need to take legal counsel on constitutional and other issues after consulting our members.\n* '''10 Nov''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the BELA Bell to the Department of Basic Education (DBE). Parents were also encouraged to send their comments in their own words. A total of about <u>1000 letters from homeschoolers</u> were sent to the DBE. Some of these letters were sent as anonymous submissions to the Pestalozzi Trust. The main objections to the BELA Bill were the following:\n*# The provision that home learners must register with the state is unreasonable and negatively affects the interests of children. It is untenable that parents, who are primarily responsible for the education of their children, require permission from the state to choose home education.\n*# The requirement that the proposed home education programme must cover contents and skills comparable to the national curriculum prohibits parents from choosing a curriculum or educational approach that would be in the best interests of the child, and which would not necessarily cover comparable skills and contents.\n*# The requirement for annual assessments by external assessors serves no educational purpose, covertly enforces the National Curriculum and will be costly to homeschooling parents and the taxpayer.\n*# The provision to outlaw alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED would give rise to the creation of a class of persons so disadvantaged that this would be in violation of the fundamental principle of equality which underlies the provisions of the Constitution. Secondly, the requirement that any person wishing to gain the National Senior Certificate should have to follow a three-year programme in order to do so significantly limits the rights of such a person to education.\n*# The provision to outlaw alternative curriculums and matric qualification would give an unfair financial advantage to CAPS compliant curriculum providers.\nTo ensure that statements on the negative consequences of the proposed bill can be proven empirically, homeschooling parents were requested to complete a survey. A total of <u>2750 parents completed the survey</u>.\n*'''14 Nov''' : The Western Cape Education Department submits objections to BELA Bill. Except for a question on foreign qualifications, WCED does not have any objections on the home education provisions.[https://www.westerncape.gov.za/sites/www.westerncape.gov.za/files/bela-bill-wcg-comments.pdf]\n*'''17 Nov'''. : The Department of Basic Education released a draft policy on home education with 21 days to provide comments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.za/Newsroom/MediaReleases/tabid/347/ctl/Details/mid/5986/ItemID/5502/Default.aspx|title=Department of Basic Education invites members of the public to submit inputs on draft Policy on Home Education, 20 November 2017|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n* '''22 Nov'''. : The Pestalozzi Trust sent a letter to the Department of Basic Education requesting and extension of the closing date for comments to the draft policy on home education. The reasons are similar to the reasons given to request and extension of the BELA Bill.\n* '''28 Nov''' : Parliament's oversight education committee has taken the exceptional step of calling a hearing \u2013 before the legislation is even tabled. In their presentation, DBE Director General Mathanzima Mweli said \u2018''the word avalanche would not describe''\u2019 the submissions they had received ''\u2018and that he had never seen it in his career in public service''\u2019. Democratic Alliance (DA) Shadow Minister of Basic Education Ian Ollis said \u201c''the reason you are getting such an avalanche is because you are tampering with the democratic rights of parents with this bill''\u201c. Ollis objected to the Director General saying they would be \u201c''processing inputs''\u201d without saying \u201c''they would be considering amendments''\u201d. He objected to the Director General's proposal to hold hearings in which to \u2018''educate the public about the bill''\u2019, which wrongly assumed they were uninformed and needed education until they agreed. He said they \u201c''needed to listen to the public''\u201c. The public participation process was also criticized by the ACDP and even ANC members of parliament. The meeting was extraordinary in a number of respects: First, a bill is normally only discussed in parliament after it is finalised and referred by cabinet. Second, the DBE sent their top officials to the meeting instead of a cabinet meeting discussing on education held at the same time. Third, they deferred to next year another scheduled parliamentary education briefing because after all the questions from parliamentarians, there was no time left for further discussion. Fourth, normally restrained ruling party parliamentarians showed strong independence, asking tough questions and making strong comments. Fifth, because a parliamentary committee requested the education department to extend the time for comment and received agreement. Sixth, strong feelings led the chair to calm the meeting. Seventh, a concerned mom brought her few month old baby, likely the youngest attendee of a parliamentary briefing, much to the delight of female parliamentarians. At the end of the session, Deputy Minister of Basic Education Enver Surty, granted an extension of time for public comment on the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA) till 10 January 2018.\n[[File:BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg|thumb|Homeschoolers at briefing on BELA Bill]]\n* '''5 Dec''' : The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) measured literacy levels between 2011 & 2016 and has found 78% of the Gr. 4 pupils who took part are functionally illiterate and South Africa scored the lowest out of 50 countries globally.\n* '''8 Dec''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the Draft Policy on Home Education to the Department of education. Parents were also encouraged to send their comments in their own words. A total of about 750 letters were sent to the Department of Basic Education, including letters requesting an extension of the closing as well as comments on the policy. Some of these letters were sent as anonymous submissions to the Pestalozzi Trust. The main objections to the policy are as follows:<ref>https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents.html</ref>\n*# A flawed consultation process means that there has not been the required meaningful consultation, and because home educators have not had sufficient input into the policy provisions, the Draft policy itself betrays a number of flaws.\n*# In general terms, the Draft Policy is flawed: while it asserts a very powerful set of constitutional and home education principles, it fails to translate those into a workable policy. In fact, it could be said that the practical provisions of the Draft Policy are diametrically opposed to the principles on which the Draft Policy is based.\n*# To further compound this problem, the Draft Policy is based on both the South African Schools Act (No. 84 of 1996) and the BELA Bill. It is highly problematic that a draft policy is being based on the provisions of a proposed bill that is still subject to the public comment process and parliamentary review.\n*# Underlying the above is the fact that the Draft Policy conflates home education and public education. These underlying flaws have led to a policy that is unworkable in practice, and will merely contribute to increased non-compliance by parents, and increased conflict between parents and education officials.\n*# The Draft Policy does not treat parents and children with dignity, as required by the founding provisions of the South African constitution.\n* '''11 Dec''' : Ms Phindile Ngcobo from the Department of Basic Education informed the Pestalozzi Trust that the Minister has granted extension till the 31st of January, 2018 for comments to the draft policy on home education.\n* '''14 Dec''' : The Pestalozzi Trust delivers 430 anonymous comments to the BELA Bill at the offices of the Department of Basic Education.\\\n\n== 2018 (Home Education Policy published) ==\n*'''16 July''' : In the week of 16 July 2018 the Pestalozzi Trust was tipped off that the Department of Basic Education (DBE) planned to approve the new policy, regardless of the flawed public participation process that was followed. When the Pestalozzi Trust was informed that the Council of Education Ministers (CEM) would discuss the policy on 16 July (the week of Mandela day), there was no option but to raise a red alert to homeschooling families. Parents were requested to contact the DBE and request a copy of the policy and an opportunity to engage with the CEM. The reaction of homeschoolers was amazing. In the week of 16 July the DBE was flooded with an estimated 600 - 1000 letters and telephone calls.\n*'''30 July''' : The DBE issued a media release in which it was confirmed that the CEM approved the policy on home education. The DBE described the concerned parents that contacted the DBE as \"''spammers''\". Although a campaign of a similar magnitude caused the City of Cape Town to stop the implementation of a water tariff, the DBE justified its decision to ignore parents by describing them as a \"small group\", as if there is a large group of parents that supports the policy.\n*'''16 Aug''' : ACDP MP Cheryllyn Dudley said in parliament that \u201c''DBE will be wasting money if the Minister promulgates the Policy on Home Education prematurely. There has been a fundamental misunderstanding between DBE and home education stakeholders resulting in a situation where the Minister of Basic Education is about to promulgate a Policy that is the result of a failed consultation process''.\u201d \"''The ACDP also calls on the Basic Education Portfolio Committee to address this issue with the department and seriously interrogate the department\u2019s handling of such an obviously important section of society during this review process.''\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pestalozzi.org/web2/af/2018/08/16/acdp-says-dbe-wasting-money-promulgating-home-education-policy-prematurely-2/|title=ACDP says DBE wasting money promulgating Home Education Policy prematurely|last=Karin|date=2018-08-16|website=Pestalozzi Trust|language=af|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>\n*'''2 Nov''' : Representatives of the Cape Home Educators and Pestalozzi Trust had meeting with MEC for Education in the Western Cape, me.

Delegates from Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, South Africa, USA, Canada and Russia gathered to confirm their solidarity as a global homeschooling movement. Policy-makers and government officials who attended the Indaba received solid researched information on all aspects of homeschooling. International researchers who attended the Indaba were Dr. Debra Bell, author and researcher from the US, and Dr. Brian Ray, from the National Home Education Research Institute in the USA. Research confirms that the amount and intensity of regulation of homeschooling does not contribute to the success of homeschoolers.\n\n== 2020 (Roundtable and Parliament) ==\n\n* '''28 Feb''' : On 28 February 2020, the Minister of Education held a Roundtable discussion on Home Education with various stakeholders. Initially only curriculum providers were invited, but after the Pestalozzi Trust and Association got to know about the Roundtable and requested invites, they were also invited.

Compared to Piledriver-powered FX chips, Zen-powered Ryzen chips ran cooler, much faster, and used less power. IPC uplift was eventually gauged to be 52% higher than Excavator, which was two full generations ahead of the architecture still being used in AMD's FX-series desktop predecessors like the FX-8350 and FX-8370.<ref name=\"Anand_Ryzen_announcement\"/> Though Zen fell short of Intel's [[Kaby Lake]] in terms of IPC, and therefore single-threaded throughput, it compensated by offering more cores to applications that can use them.

affected processors with newer ones that are not affected by the problem.<ref name=\"extremetech-segfault\"/>\n\n=== Alleged issues by CTS Labs ===\n\nIn early 2018, an Israeli [[Computer security|cyber-security]] consultancy firm called CTS Labs stated that they had discovered several major flaws in the Ryzen components ecosystem,<ref name=\"bleeping-cts-vuln\"/> publicly disclosing them after giving AMD 24 hours to respond and raising concerns and questions regarding their legitimacy,<ref name=\"toms-CTS\"/><ref name=\"anand-cts1\"/> though they were later confirmed by two separate security firms.<ref name=\"pcw-cts\"/> AMD has since stated that while the flaws are real and would be fixed via microcode updates, they were severely overplayed as physical access to the hardware is required to exploit them.<ref name=\"yahoo-cts-vuln\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Epyc]]\n* [[AMD Accelerated Processing Unit]]\n* [[List of AMD microprocessors]]\n* [[List of AMD Athlon

Ryzen is especially significant for AMD, since it is a completely new design, and since it marks the corporation's return to the high end desktop CPU market. AMD's competitor [[Intel]] has controlled this section of the market for almost ten years, back when Intel released the [[Conroe (microprocessor)|Conroe/Core microarchitecture]], which overtook AMD's [[Athlon 64]] as the cutting edge of performance in the market.\n\nAMD officially announced the first [[14nm]] Ryzen products during its New Horizon summit on December 13, 2016 and introduced them the following February with the first processors being 8-core, 16 thread CPUs released in March 2 2017 to public market availability.<ref name=\"amd.com-newhorizon\"/> The second generation of Ryzen CPUs featuring the [[Zen+]] microarchitecture, an incremental improvement built on a [[12 nanometer|12nm]] process technology, was released in April 2018 and featured a 3% IPC and 6%<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/12625/amd-second-generation-ryzen-7-2700x-2700-ryzen-5-2600x-2600|title=The AMD 2nd Gen Ryzen Deep Dive: The 2700X, 2700, 2600X, and 2600 Tested|last=Cutress|first=Ian|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> uplift in clockspeed respectively with up to 10% aggregate performance increase over the original Ryzen that first released in 2017.<ref name=\"anand-gen2-prelaunch\"/> The third generation, based on [[Zen 2]] and featuring more significant design improvements and a further shrink to [[TSMC]]'s [[7 nanometer|7nm]] process, launched on July 7, 2019 and featured a self-reported 15% IPC increase, though real-world benchmarks mark 13% in most cases according to MSI<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/amd-msi-claim-different-ipc-increase-numbers-ryzen-3000-cpus/|title=AMD Claims 15% While MSI Claims 13% IPC Jump For Ryzen 3000 CPUs|last=May|first=Keith|date=2019-05-30|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> and userbenchmark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-Ryzen-5-3600X-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-2600X/4041vs3956|title=UserBenchmark: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X vs 3600X|website=cpu.userbenchmark.com|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> In late 2019, the Zen3 core has been revealed to be an entirely new architecture being built on TSMC's 7nm+ node, with EUV finished and is currently undergoing engineering sampling as of Q4 2019 with production yields exceeding expectations.\n\nWhile the majority of Ryzen-branded products are for use with the [[Socket AM4]] platform, in August 2017 AMD added a line of high core count desktop processors aimed at the workstation market with the Ryzen Threadripper branding.

Compared to Piledriver-powered FX chips, Zen-powered Ryzen chips ran cooler, much faster, and used less power. IPC uplift was eventually gauged to be 52% higher than Excavator, which was two full generations ahead of the architecture still being used in AMD's FX-series desktop predecessors like the FX-8350 and FX-8370.<ref name=\"Anand_Ryzen_announcement\"/> Though Zen fell short of Intel's [[Kaby Lake]] in terms of IPC, and therefore single-threaded throughput, it compensated by offering more cores to applications that can use them. Power consumption and heat were found to be highly competitive with Intel, and the included Wraith coolers were generally competitive with higher-priced aftermarket solutions.\n\nRyzen 1800X's multi-threaded performance, in some cases while using [[Blender (software)|Blender]] or other open-source software, was around four times the performance of the FX-8370, or nearly double that of the i7 7700K.<ref name=\"pcworld-ryzen-review\"/> One reviewer found that Ryzen chips would typically outperform competing Intel i7 processors for a fraction of the price when all eight cores were utilized.<ref name=\"pcworld-ryzen-review\"/>\n\nOne complaint among a subset of reviewers, however, was that Ryzen processors fell behind their Intel counterparts when running older games, or running certain newer games at mainstream resolutions such as 720p or 1080p.<ref name=\"extremetech-1800x-review\"/> AMD acknowledged the gaming performance deficit at low resolutions during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" thread, where it explained that updates and patches were being developed.<ref name=\"custompcreview-redditama\"/> Subsequent updates to ''[[Ashes of the Singularity|Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]]'' increased frame rates by 17 to 31% on Ryzen systems.<ref name=\"pcper-ashes-update\"/><ref name=\"pcper-tombraider-update\"/> Publisher [[id Software]] announced in April 2017 it would optimize its future games to make use of the greater parallelism available on Ryzen CPUs.<ref name=\"techreport-id-ryzen\"/>\n\nIt has been suggested that low threaded applications often result in Ryzen processors being underutilized, producing lower than expected benchmark scores, due to the fact that Zen relies on its core count to make up for its lower [[Instructions per cycle|IPC]] rating than that of Kaby Lake.<ref name=\"techpowerup-linuxkernel\"/><ref name=\"yahoo-ryzen-optim\"/><ref name=\"wccftech-schedulerbug\"/> However, AMD and others have argued thread scheduling is not the fundamental issue to Windows 10 performance.<ref name=\"amdblog-community-update\"/><ref name=\"pcper-scheduler\"/> Early AM4 motherboards were also hindered by BIOS bugs and poor DDR4 memory support.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Operating system support==\n===Windows===\nAMD verified that computers with Ryzen CPUs can boot [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows 8]] but on newer hardware, including AMD Ryzen and Intel Kaby Lake and later, [[Microsoft]] only officially supports the use of [[Windows 10]].

them after giving AMD 24 hours to respond and raising concerns and questions regarding their legitimacy,<ref name=\"toms-CTS\"/><ref name=\"anand-cts1\"/> though they were later confirmed by two

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions and would be used as a postal sorting centre up until the 1990s. \n\n====Postal Building Sculptures==== \nThe structures most notable feature (which has been retained) are the exterior 13-part series of limestone [[bas relief]] carvings by [[Louis Temporale]] Sr. [[Order of Canada|CM]] which depicts the history of transportation and communication in Canada. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tayloronhistory.com/2013/02/12/torontos-architectural-gemsthe-postal-delivery-building-now-the-acc/|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>.

The sculptors son Louis Temporale jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger cuts made to the Crown Corporation), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s  on Eastern Avenue. Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

The Toronto Raptors purchased the building from Canada Post the next year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern wall of the original postal structure built in 1941, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|left|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

There is also an east\u2013west covered, climate controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects Scotiabank Arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay Street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger cuts made to the Crown Corporation), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s  on Eastern Avenue. Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

The Toronto Raptors purchased the building from Canada Post the next year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern wall of the original postal structure built in 1941, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The example is ''suvarna'' (lit:\"good color\") used to describe gold. ''Sunda'' is also another name for Hindu God [[Vishnu]]. In Sanskrit, the term ''Sundara'' (masculine) or ''Sundari'' (feminine) means \"beautiful\" or \"excellence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=ia&tran_input=Sunda&direct=au|title=Sunda, Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url         = http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=sunda&lang=sans&action=Search\n| title       = Sunda in Sanskrit Dictionary\n| accessdate  = 20 November 2014\n| publisher   = Sanskrit Dictionary\n}}\n</ref> The term ''Sunda'' also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |title       = Watak Budaya Sunda\n |access-date  = 24 October 2011\n |last        = Kurnia\n |first       = Iwan\n |date        = 14 August 2007\n |publisher   = Kasundaan.org\n |language    = Indonesian\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831145939/http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |archive-date = 31 August 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe name ''Sunda'' is also known in Hindu mythology of [[Sunda and Upasunda]], as one of the powerful [[Asura]] brothers that received the boon of invulnerability from [[Brahma]]. The powerful Asura brothers then set out to conquering the world, and menacing the Gods. In the  end they fought each other over [[Tilottama]], a beautiful [[Apsara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sunda|title=Sunda, \u015aunda, Shunda: 6 definitions|last=www.wisdomlib.org|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=2018-06-04|date=29 June 2012}}</ref> The story of Sunda and Upasunda is found in the [[Mahabharata]], Book I: Adi Parva. It is not clear however, whether the [[eponym]]ous ''Sunda'' was derived from this Hindu myth.\n\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name ''Sunda'' was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, also Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people. Thus subsequently gave birth, name and identity to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sundanese people]].\n\n==Historiography==\n{{History of Indonesia}}\nKnowledge of the kingdom among [[Sundanese people]] has been kept alive through Sundanese ''[[Pantun Sunda|Pantun]]'' oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of [[Prabu Siliwangi]], the most popular king of Sunda.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFvsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi#v=onepage&q=Pantun%20Sunda%20Siliwangi&f=false|title=Java Essay: The History and Culture of a Southern Country|last=Iguchi|first=Masatoshi|date=2017-01-25|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784628857|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=chJvAAAAMAAJ&q=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi|title=Kebudayaan Sunda: Zaman Pajajaran|last=Ekajati|first=Edi Suhardi|date=2005|publisher=Pustaka Jaya|isbn=9789794193341|language=id}}</ref>\n\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat]], [[Jayabupati inscription|Jayabupati]], [[Kawali inscription|Kawali]], and [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]].

However, currently the Wangsakerta manuscripts are generally discounted as a valid historical source among historians, since this controversial manuscript is suspected as a fraud containing [[pseudohistory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lubis|first=Nina H.|date=2012-08-03|title=Kontroversi Tentang Naskah Wangsakerta|url=https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jurnal-humaniora/article/view/741|journal=Humaniora|language=id|volume=14|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.22146/jh.v14i1.741|issn=2302-9269|doi-broken-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radarcirebon.com/mengungkap-kontroversi-naskah-wangsakerta-2.html|title=Mengungkap Kontroversi Naskah Wangsakerta - Radar Cirebon|date=2013-12-14|work=Radar Cirebon|access-date=2018-06-03|language=id-ID}}</ref>\n\n===Local account===\n[[File:KITLV 87649 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Batoetoelis at Buitenzorg - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] (dated 1533), in [[Bogor]], commemorate the great King of Sunda [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (rule 1482-1521).]]\nThe earliest reference to the name \"Sunda\" being used to identify a kingdom is the [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]] dated 854 Saka (932 AD). The inscription was in old [[Javanese script]], but the language used was [[Old Malay]]. It translates as follows:\n\n{{quotation|This memorial stone is to remark the saying of Rakryan Juru Pangambat (Royal Hunter), in 854 Saka, that the order of government is returned to the power of king of Sunda.}}\n\nThe inscription chandrasengkala ([[chronogram]]) written 458 Saka, however some historians suggested that the year of the inscription must be read backward as 854 Saka (932 AD) because the Sunda kingdom could not have existed in 536 AD, in the era of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara (358-669 AD).\n\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the [[Jayabupati inscription]] which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]]. The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98. The contents of the inscriptions (according to Pleyte):\n\n{{quotation|Peace and well-being.

O being known by thee.., all the spirits.}}\n\nThe date of the Jayabupati inscription may be 11 October 1030. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]].

It was built on poles and having thatched roof, as described in a [[Chu-fan-chi|12th century Chinese source]].]]\n\nAccording to F. Hirt and W. W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, [[Chau Ju-kua]], collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling.

The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island.

[[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\".

It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nOne of the few remnant is the 7th century [[Bojongmenje]] Hindu temple near [[Bandung]] that was discovered in 2002. It was one of the earliest temple structure in Java, older than [[Dieng temples|temples of Dieng]] in Central Java, and possibly linked to the Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King [[Purnawarman]], who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jyesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|right|The valiant hero [[Sri Sanjaya]] was described in Sundanese manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] as the king of Sunda. However, he is also mentioned in Central Javanese [[Canggal inscription]] dated 732 as the king of [[Medang Kingdom|Mataram]].]]\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\n[[File:023 Close Up, Wringin Lawang (40429713221).jpg|thumb|right|Wringin Lawang [[Candi bentar|split gate]] in [[Trowulan]], According to [[Nagarakretagama]], Bubat square is located on northern parts of Trowulan, Majapahit capital city, probably somewhere near this gate or Brahu temple. Bubat square was the location of [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat incident]] where the Sundanese royal party perished.]]\n\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[File:Building in Keraton Kasepuhan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Keraton Kasepuhan]] of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]]. By 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost its important eastern port of [[Cirebon]].]]\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\n[[File:Sunda Kelapa Februari 2020.jpg|thumb|right|The port of [[Sunda Kelapa]] (lit. \"coconut of Sunda\"), the cradle of [[Jakarta]]. For centuries it was the royal port of Sunda Kingdom serving the capital [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran]] 60 kilometres inland to the south, until it fell to Demak and Cirebon forces in 1527.]]\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, in 1527 [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\n[[File:Bird\u2019s-eye View of the City of Bantam de Bry.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Banten (town)|Port of Banten]] in the 16th century. The Islamic [[Banten Sultanate|Sultanate of Banten]] was responsible for the demise of Hindu Sunda Kingdom, and supplant it as the dominant polity in western parts of Java on the following centuries.]]\nSeries of last Sunda kings were notoriously known as incompetent rulers. The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfill his duty as a king, he renovate and beautify the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations. ''Dayeuh'' Pakuan Pajajaran served as the capital of Sunda Kingdom approximately for almost a hundred years (1482 \u2013 1579), until it was razed and destroyed by the [[Sultanate of Banten]] in 1579.\n\nBecause Pakuan, the capital city of the Sunda kingdom laid between two parallel rivers, Ciliwung and Cisadane, it was called ''Pajajaran'' (lit. place laid between two parallel things) or [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom. The later name \u2013 Pajajaran \u2013 is more familiar for people residing in West Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] of [[Sultanate of Mataram|Mataram]] region (current [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Solo, Central Java|Solo]]).\n\n==Government and economy==\n===Administration===\n[[File:Makuta Binokasih.jpg|thumb|upright|''Makuta Binokasih Sanghyang Pak\u00e9'', the royal crown of Sunda kingdom.

On the other hand, the term \"Pakuan\" and \"Pajajaran\" or \"Dayeuh\" refer to its capital which corresponds to the modern city of Bogor. The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago. The ports of Sunda participated in international trades in the region.\n\nIn [[Suma Oriental]], written in 1512-1515, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], a Portuguese explorer report about the ports of Sunda:\n{{quotation|First the king of ''\u00c7umda'' (Sunda) with his great city of ''Dayo'', the town and lands and port of ''Bantam'', the port of ''Pomdam'' (Pontang), the port of ''Cheguide'' (Cigede), the port of ''Tamgaram'' (Tangerang), the port of ''Calapa'' ([[Sunda Kalapa|Kelapa]]), and the port of ''Chemano'' (Chi Manuk or Cimanuk), this is Sunda, because the river of Chi Manuk is the limit of both kingdoms.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |p = 166 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the  [[Sunda Strait]]. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.

A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\n\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand ''bahars'', which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg<!--unless some unit other than 100 kg was called a quintal here, was \"thirty thousand quintals--> of pepper the kingdom produced.\n\nBantam is situated at 6\u00b0 south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms{{vague|English fathoms, or something else?|date=January 2010}} in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\n\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick{{vague|human palms or palm trees?|date=July 2012}}, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery.

In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality.

[[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich.

They, with great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n[[File:Padrao sunda kelapa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luso Sundanese padr\u00e3o|''Padr\u00e3o'' of Sunda Kalapa]] (1522), a stone pillar with a [[cross]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] commemorating a treaty between [[Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought as the successor of [[Tarumanagara]] which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE). However, according to the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'',<ref>[[Friedrich Hirth]] and [[W.W. Rockhill]] ''[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31403797/ Chao Jukua, His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu-fan-chi]'' St Petersburg, 1911.</ref> written around 1225 by [[Zhao Rugua]], ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), was still part of ''San-fo-tsi '' (Srivijaya) 15 tributaries.\n\nKingdom of Sunda has established relations with its eastern neighbour; the kaleidoscope of Javanese kingdoms, from the era of Medang Mataram back in the 8th century, all the way to Majapahit in 14th century and Demak in 16th century. The popular hero, King [[Sanjaya of Mataram]] known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Medang court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese [[Horren inscription]], mentioned ''\u00e7atru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat square in Majapahit]] in 1357, killing all of Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]].

The example is ''suvarna'' (lit:\"good color\") used to describe gold. ''Sunda'' is also another name for Hindu God [[Vishnu]]. In Sanskrit, the term ''Sundara'' (masculine) or ''Sundari'' (feminine) means \"beautiful\" or \"excellence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=ia&tran_input=Sunda&direct=au|title=Sunda, Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url         = http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=sunda&lang=sans&action=Search\n| title       = Sunda in Sanskrit Dictionary\n| accessdate  = 20 November 2014\n| publisher   = Sanskrit Dictionary\n}}\n</ref> The term ''Sunda'' also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |title       = Watak Budaya Sunda\n |access-date  = 24 October 2011\n |last        = Kurnia\n |first       = Iwan\n |date        = 14 August 2007\n |publisher   = Kasundaan.org\n |language    = Indonesian\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831145939/http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |archive-date = 31 August 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe name ''Sunda'' is also known in Hindu mythology of [[Sunda and Upasunda]], as one of the powerful [[Asura]] brothers that received the boon of invulnerability from [[Brahma]]. The powerful Asura brothers then set out to conquering the world, and menacing the Gods. In the  end they fought each other over [[Tilottama]], a beautiful [[Apsara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sunda|title=Sunda, \u015aunda, Shunda: 6 definitions|last=www.wisdomlib.org|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=2018-06-04|date=29 June 2012}}</ref> The story of Sunda and Upasunda is found in the [[Mahabharata]], Book I: Adi Parva. It is not clear however, whether the [[eponym]]ous ''Sunda'' was derived from this Hindu myth.\n\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name ''Sunda'' was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, also Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people. Thus subsequently gave birth, name and identity to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sundanese people]].\n\n==Historiography==\n{{History of Indonesia}}\nKnowledge of the kingdom among [[Sundanese people]] has been kept alive through Sundanese ''[[Pantun Sunda|Pantun]]'' oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of [[Prabu Siliwangi]], the most popular king of Sunda.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFvsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi#v=onepage&q=Pantun%20Sunda%20Siliwangi&f=false|title=Java Essay: The History and Culture of a Southern Country|last=Iguchi|first=Masatoshi|date=2017-01-25|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784628857|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=chJvAAAAMAAJ&q=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi|title=Kebudayaan Sunda: Zaman Pajajaran|last=Ekajati|first=Edi Suhardi|date=2005|publisher=Pustaka Jaya|isbn=9789794193341|language=id}}</ref>\n\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat]], [[Jayabupati inscription|Jayabupati]], [[Kawali inscription|Kawali]], and [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]].

However, currently the Wangsakerta manuscripts are generally discounted as a valid historical source among historians, since this controversial manuscript is suspected as a fraud containing [[pseudohistory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lubis|first=Nina H.|date=2012-08-03|title=Kontroversi Tentang Naskah Wangsakerta|url=https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jurnal-humaniora/article/view/741|journal=Humaniora|language=id|volume=14|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.22146/jh.v14i1.741|issn=2302-9269|doi-broken-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radarcirebon.com/mengungkap-kontroversi-naskah-wangsakerta-2.html|title=Mengungkap Kontroversi Naskah Wangsakerta - Radar Cirebon|date=2013-12-14|work=Radar Cirebon|access-date=2018-06-03|language=id-ID}}</ref>\n\n===Local account===\n[[File:KITLV 87649 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Batoetoelis at Buitenzorg - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] (dated 1533), in [[Bogor]], commemorate the great King of Sunda [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (rule 1482-1521).]]\nThe earliest reference to the name \"Sunda\" being used to identify a kingdom is the [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]] dated 854 Saka (932 AD). The inscription was in old [[Javanese script]], but the language used was [[Old Malay]]. It translates as follows:\n\n{{quotation|This memorial stone is to remark the saying of Rakryan Juru Pangambat (Royal Hunter), in 854 Saka, that the order of government is returned to the power of king of Sunda.}}\n\nThe inscription chandrasengkala ([[chronogram]]) written 458 Saka, however some historians suggested that the year of the inscription must be read backward as 854 Saka (932 AD) because the Sunda kingdom could not have existed in 536 AD, in the era of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara (358-669 AD).\n\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the [[Jayabupati inscription]] which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]]. The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98. The contents of the inscriptions (according to Pleyte):\n\n{{quotation|Peace and well-being.

O being known by thee.., all the spirits.}}\n\nThe date of the Jayabupati inscription may be 11 October 1030. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]]. After his return he practised asceticism on a mountain in western Java, where his bodily existence came to an end.<ref name=\"Noorduyn 2006 437\">{{cite book | last =Noorduyn | first =J. | publisher= KITLV Press | title = Three Old Sundanese poems | year =2006| page =437\n}}</ref>  The manuscript dated from pre-Islamic Sunda.

It was built on poles and having thatched roof, as described in a [[Chu-fan-chi|12th century Chinese source]].]]\n\nAccording to F. Hirt and W. W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, [[Chau Ju-kua]], collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling.

The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island.

[[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\".

It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nOne of the few remnant is the 7th century [[Bojongmenje]] Hindu temple near [[Bandung]] that was discovered in 2002. It was one of the earliest temple structure in Java, older than [[Dieng temples|temples of Dieng]] in Central Java, and possibly linked to the Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King Purnawarman, who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|right|The valiant hero [[Sri Sanjaya]] was described in Sundanese manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] as the king of Sunda. However, he is also mentioned in Central Javanese [[Canggal inscription]] dated 732 as the king of [[Medang Kingdom|Mataram]].]]\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\n[[File:023 Close Up, Wringin Lawang (40429713221).jpg|thumb|right|Wringin Lawang [[Candi bentar|split gate]] in [[Trowulan]], According to [[Nagarakretagama]], Bubat square is located on northern parts of Trowulan, Majapahit capital city, probably somewhere near this gate or Brahu temple. Bubat square was the location of [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat incident]] where the Sundanese royal party perished.]]\n\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[File:Building in Keraton Kasepuhan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Keraton Kasepuhan]] of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]]. By 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost its important eastern port of [[Cirebon]].]]\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\n[[File:Sunda Kelapa Februari 2020.jpg|thumb|right|The port of [[Sunda Kelapa]] (lit. \"coconut of Sunda\"), the cradle of [[Jakarta]]. For centuries it was the royal port of Sunda Kingdom serving the capital [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran]] 60 kilometres inland to the south, until it fell to Demak and Cirebon forces in 1527.]]\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, in 1527 [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\n[[File:Bird\u2019s-eye View of the City of Bantam de Bry.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Banten (town)|Port of Banten]] in the 16th century.

The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler.

Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations. ''Dayeuh'' Pakuan Pajajaran served as the capital of Sunda Kingdom approximately for almost a hundred years (1482 \u2013 1579), until it was razed and destroyed by the [[Sultanate of Banten]] in 1579.\n\nBecause Pakuan, the capital city of the Sunda kingdom laid between two parallel rivers, Ciliwung and Cisadane, it was called ''Pajajaran'' (lit. place laid between two parallel things) or [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom. The later name \u2013 Pajajaran \u2013 is more familiar for people residing in West Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] of [[Sultanate of Mataram|Mataram]] region (current [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Solo, Central Java|Solo]]).\n\n==Government and economy==\n===Administration===\n[[File:Makuta Binokasih.jpg|thumb|upright|''Makuta Binokasih Sanghyang Pak\u00e9'', the royal crown of Sunda kingdom.

On the other hand, the term \"Pakuan\" and \"Pajajaran\" or \"Dayeuh\" refer to its capital which corresponds to the modern city of Bogor. The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

As mentioned in some fragments of this manuscript:<br/> \n''\"..., ti Kandangwesi pamwat siya ka Pakwan...\"'' (\"... from Kandangwesi the tribute was sent to Pakuan\"), <br/> \n''\"..., anaking sang Prebu Rama, Resi samadaya sarerea siya marek ka Pakwan unggal tahun...\"'' (\"... my son the chief of the village, the ''[[rishi]]s'' together all paid a visit to Pakuan every years\").<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|405}}\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Leuit os 080815-2283 srna.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sundanese woman retrieving rice from a [[leuit]], Sundanese economy mainly rely on rice agriculture]]\nThe economy of Sunda kingdom relied on [[agriculture]], especially [[rice]] cultivation; this is reflected in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] culture and the annual ceremonies of crop seeding and ''Seren Taun'' rice harvest festival. The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago. The ports of Sunda participated in international trades in the region.\n\nIn [[Suma Oriental]], written in 1512-1515, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], a Portuguese explorer report about the ports of Sunda:\n{{quotation|First the king of ''\u00c7umda'' (Sunda) with his great city of ''Dayo'', the town and lands and port of ''Bantam'', the port of ''Pomdam'' (Pontang), the port of ''Cheguide'' (Cigede), the port of ''Tamgaram'' (Tangerang), the port of ''Calapa'' ([[Sunda Kalapa|Kelapa]]), and the port of ''Chemano'' (Chi Manuk or Cimanuk), this is Sunda, because the river of Chi Manuk is the limit of both kingdoms.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |p = 166 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the  [[Sunda Strait]]. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}}; the strait's widest point is about twenty-five and narrowest point only twelve leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}} broad. Bantam is about the midpoint. All the islands are well timbered, but have little water. A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\n\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand ''bahars'', which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg<!--unless some unit other than 100 kg was called a quintal here, was \"thirty thousand quintals--> of pepper the kingdom produced.\n\nBantam is situated at 6\u00b0 south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms{{vague|English fathoms, or something else?|date=January 2010}} in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\n\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick{{vague|human palms or palm trees?|date=July 2012}}, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is good, with a muddy or sandy bottom and a depth from two to six fathoms.\n\n==Culture and society==\n===Religion===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=320|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=KITLV 87602 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|image2=KITLV 87603 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga near Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|footer=Hindu ritual objects; bells, small statue, [[trishula]] and ornament of ritual staff made of bronze, from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java.

In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality.

[[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich.

The city has well-built houses of the palm leaf and wood. They say that the king\u2019s house has three hundred and thirty wooden pillars as thick as a wine cask, and five fathoms (8 m) high, and beautiful timber work on the top of the pillars, and a very well-built house. The city is two days journey from the chief port, which is called [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]].\n\nThe people of the sea coast get along well with the merchants in the land. They are accustomed to trade. These people of Sunda very often come to Malacca to trade. They bring cargo lancharas, ships of a hundred and fifty tons.

The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work.

It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE).
