Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee. Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F. Byrnes]] reported it back on March 3, 1936, recommending a number of minor amendments which stressed that the anniversary commemorated was not the founding of the city, but of it being the capital of South Carolina. The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G.

Harding]] charged the CFA with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion. She recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design,{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} and said that \"his models were 'unsatisfactory' and 'lack artistic merit'.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/ |title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar |website=earlycommemorativecoins.com |url-status=live |access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced [[medalist]].{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia's and Clemson's talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, saying she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014D or S. At the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]], was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

[[Bertrand H. Snell]] of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee. Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. [[Jesse P. Wolcott]] of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. [[Thomas J. O'Brien (Illinois politician)|Thomas J.

South Carolina's [[James F. Byrnes]] reported it back on March 3, 1936, recommending a number of minor amendments which stressed that the anniversary commemorated was not the founding of the city, but of it being the capital of South Carolina. The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3100|date=March 3, 1936}}</ref> As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did.<ref>{{USCongRec|1936|3337|date=March 5, 1936}}</ref> The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n==Preparation==\nThe Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of [[Clemson University|Clemson College]] to design the coin.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early>{{cite web|url=http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/|title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar|website=Early Commemorative Coins|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}</ref> Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, [[Thomas G. Clemson]], in exchange for room, board and tuition.{{sfn|Brothers}} His completed plaster models of the coin were sent to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) by the [[Director of the United States Mint]], [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], on May 25, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=179}}  A 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] charged the CFA with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins,{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v\u2013vi}} and Ross wanted the CFA\"s opinion. She recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design,{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} and said that \"his models were 'unsatisfactory' and 'lack artistic merit'.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1936-columbia-sesquicentennial-half-dollar/ |title=1936 Columbia Sesquicentennial Half Dollar |website=earlycommemorativecoins.com |url-status=live |access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> CFA chair, [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts|Charles Moore]] agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced [[medalist]].{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for ''[[The Numismatist]]'': \"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia's and Clemson's talented, adopted son.\"{{sfn|Brothers}}\n\nOn June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui-Centennial Commission, saying she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=268\u2013269}} Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S.

{"title_page": "Sir John Major, 1st Baronet", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=February 2013}}\n'''Sir John Major, 1st Baronet''' (17 May 1698 \u2013 22 February 1781) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] merchant and [[Member of Parliament]]. Major was born at [[Bridlington]] in [[Yorkshire]], and started in business there, commanding a ship in the [[Stockholm]] trade. He apparently abandoned the sea at the age of around 30, but subsequently developed a thriving iron trade becoming eventually the largest dealer in the country. He built up a considerable fortune, acquiring extensive estates in Suffolk and Sussex and other land elsewhere in England, to a value of around \u00a35,000 a year. Nevertheless, he put his shipping interests at the service of the nation when necessary, apparently at considerable cost to himself, providing ships to transport troops in time of war on more than one occasion.\n\nIn 1724 he married Elizabeth Dale, daughter of another Bridlington merchant, and they had two daughters - Anne, who married [[John Henniker, 1st Baron Henniker|John Henniker]] in 1747, and Elizabeth, who married [[Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos]] in 1767. At the age of 60 he decided to stand for Parliament, and in 1761 was elected unopposed as MP for [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]] (the nearest borough to Bridlington, where his business interests presumably gave him an influence); at the same election, his son-in-law Henniker was returned for [[Sudbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Sudbury]], and the two thereafter formed a close political and business partnership, seeking the government contracts that in those days were generally awarded to MPs ahead of their commercial rivals. They secured among others a contract for victualling the British troops in West [[Florida]], and grants of land - {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} each - in [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nAt the same time, Henniker lobbied the government to create Major a baronet. (Henniker's letter to the Prime Minister, [[George Grenville]], in which he put his case, quoted by Namier & Brooke, is the main source of information on Major's early life.) On 5 July 1765, Major was created a Baronet, of Worlingsworth Hall in the County of Suffolk, with a special remainder to Henniker. Just five days after the warrant was signed Grenville's administration, to which Henniker and Major had adhered, was dismissed; the opportunity might easily not have arisen again. At the next election in 1768, Major was opposed by a government candidate at Scarborough and defeated. He did not stand for Parliament again.\n\nMajor died February 1781, aged 82, and was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his son-in-law John Henniker, who was elevated to the [[Peerage of Ireland]] as [[Baron Henniker]] in 1800. He was also a [[Trinity House|Senior Elder Brother of Trinity House]] between 1741 and 1781, a director of the [[South Sea Company]] and was [[High Sheriff of Sussex]] for 1755\u201356.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes.

Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes.

Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

Originally published in 1986 as Allied Procedural Publication 6 (APP-6), '''NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems''', the standard has evolved over the years and is currently in its fourth version (APP-6C). The symbols are designed to enhance [[NATO]]'s [[joint interoperability]] by providing a standard set of common symbols. APP-6 constituted a single system of joint military symbology for land, air, space and sea-based formations and units, which can be displayed for either automated map display systems or for manual map marking. It covers all of the joint services and can be used by them.\n\n==History==\nThe first basic military map symbols began to be used by western armies in the decades following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During [[World War I]], there was a degree of harmonisation between the British and French systems, including the adoption of the colour red for enemy forces and blue for allies; the British had previously used red for friendly troops because of the traditional red coats of British soldiers. However, the system now in use is broadly based on that devised by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1917. The infantry symbol of a saltire in a rectangle was said to symbolise the crossed belts of an infantryman, while the single diagonal line for cavalry was said to represent the sabre belt. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the US Army system was standardized and adapted, with different shapes for friendly (blue rectangle), hostile (red diamond) and unknown (yellow [[quatrefoil]]) forces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hershey|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Not Just Lines on a Map: A History of Military Mapping|url=http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Strategy & Tactics|volume=274|pages=22\u201327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107184638/http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAPP-6A was promulgated in December 1999. The NATO standardization agreement that covers APP-6A is ''[[STANAG]] 2019'' (edition 4), promulgated in December 2000. APP-6A replaced ''APP-6'' (last version<!-- change 2 -->, July 1986), which had been promulgated in November 1984 (edition 3<!-- Also Edition 3 Amendment 1 (1990) --> of STANAG 2019 covered APP-6<!--\nNote:\nAPP-6 (1986) mentions that it \"replaces STANAG 2019 (Edition 2) ''Military Symbols'', which was designed for manual map marking.\"  Odds are that STANAG 2019 editions 1 or 2 promulgated [[Q-STAG]] 509 ''Military Symbols'', which dates back to the mid-1970s\n-->), and was replaced in turn by ''Joint Symbology APP-6(B)'' ([[APP-6B]]) in 2008 (STANAG 2019 edition 5, June 2008) and ''NATO Joint Military Symbology APP-6(C)'' ([[APP-6C]]) in 2011 (STANAG 2019 edition 6, May 2011).\n\nThe U.S. is the current custodian of APP-6A, which is equivalent to [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#MIL-STD-2525A|MIL-STD-2525A]].\n\n==Symbol sets==\nThe APP-6A standard provides common operational symbology along with details on their display and plotting to ensure the compatibility, and to the greatest extent possible, the interoperability of NATO land component ''command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence'' (C4I) systems, development, operations, and training. APP-6A addresses the efficient transmission of symbology information through the use of a standard methodology for symbol hierarchy, information taxonomy, and symbol identifiers.\n\nAPP-6A recognises five broad ''sets'' of symbols, each set using its own SIDC (Symbol identification coding) scheme:\n\n* Units, equipment, and installations\n* Military operations (tactical graphics)\n* METOC (meteorological and oceanographic)\n* Signals intelligence\n* MOOTW (military operations other than war)\n\n''Units, equipment, and installations'' consist of icons, generally framed, associated with a single point on the map. All sorts of graphical and textual modifiers may surround them, specifying categories, quantities, dates, direction of movement, etc.\n\n''Tactical graphics'' represent operational information that cannot be presented via icon-based symbols alone: unit boundaries, special area designations, and other unique markings related to battlespace geometry and necessary for battlefield planning and management. There are point, line and area symbols in this category.\n\n''Meteorological'' and ''oceanographic'' symbology is the only set not under the standard's control: rather, they are imported from the symbology established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].\n\nThe ''signals intelligence'' and ''military operations other than war'' symbology sets stand apart from Units, Equipment, and Installations although they obey the same conventions (i.e., they consist of framed symbols associated to points on the map). They do not appear in APP-6A proper, having been introduced by MIL-STD-2525B.\n\n==Symbol composition==\nMost of the symbols designate specific points, and consist of a ''frame'' (a geometric border), a ''fill'', a constituent ''icon'', and optional symbol ''modifiers''. The latter are optional text fields or graphic indicators that provide additional information.\n\nThe frame provides a visual indication of the affiliation, battle dimension, and status of an operational object. The use of shape and colour is redundant, allowing the symbology to be used under less-than-ideal conditions such as a monochrome red display to preserve the operator's night vision. Nearly all symbols are highly stylised and can be drawn by persons almost entirely lacking in artistic skill; this allows one to draw a symbolic representation (a GRAPHREP, Graphical report) using tools as rudimentary as plain paper and pencil.\n\nThe frame serves as the base to which other symbol components and modifiers are added. In most cases a frame surrounds an icon. One major exception is equipment, which may be represented by icons alone (in which case the icons are coloured as the frame would be).\n\nThe fill is the area within a symbol. If the fill is assigned a colour, it provides an enhanced (redundant) presentation of information about the affiliation of the object. If colour is not used, the fill is transparent. A very few icons have fills of their own, which are not affected by affiliation.\n\nThe icons themselves, finally, can be understood as combinations of elementary glyphs that use simple composition rules, in a manner reminiscent of some ideographic writing systems such as [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]]. The standard, however, still attempts to provide an \"exhaustive\" listing of possible icons instead of laying out a dictionary of component glyphs. This causes operational problems when the need for an unforeseen symbol arises (particularly in MOOTW), a problem exacerbated by the administratively centralised maintenance of the symbology sets.\n\nWhen rendering symbols with the fill on, APP-6A calls for the frame and icon to be black or white (as appropriate for the display). When rendering symbols with the fill off, APP-6A calls for a monochrome frame and icon (usually black or in accordance with the affiliation colour). NATO symbols can also be rendered with fill off using a frame coloured according to affiliation and a black icon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/wiki/images/8/80/NATO_Map_Symbol_(Canadian)_Programmed_Instruction_Package_Jan_2000.pdf|title=NATO Map Symbol Programmed Instruction Package|date=Jan 2000|publisher=Canadian Forces School of Military Intelligence|page=6|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref> though this is not defined in any APP-6 standard.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Fill On.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill on\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome Colour.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome colour frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome B&W.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and bichrome frame and icon\n</gallery>\n\n==Affiliation==\n''Affiliation'' refers to the relationship of the tracker to the operational object being represented. The basic affiliation categories are ''unknown'', ''friend'', [[Neutral country|''neutral'']], and ''hostile''. In the ground unit domain, a yellow [[quatrefoil]] frame is used to denote unknown affiliation, a blue rectangle frame to denote friendly affiliation, a green square frame to denote neutral affiliation, and a red diamond frame to denote hostile affiliation.<ref name=\"APP1986\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf|title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols|last=Korkolis|first=M.|date=July 1986|website=alternatewars.com|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref>{{rp|11}} In the other domains (air and space, sea surface and subsurface, etc.), the same color scheme is used.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

An object can have a mission area above the Earth's surface (i.e., in the air or outer space), on it, or below it. If the mission area of an object is on the surface, it can be either on land or sea. The subsurface dimension concerns those objects whose mission area is below the sea surface (e.g., submarines and sea mines). Some cases require adjudication; for example, an Army or Marine helicopter unit is a manoeuvring unit (i.e., a unit whose ground support assets are included) and is thus represented in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore is a maritime unit and is represented in the sea surface dimension. A landing craft whose primary mission is to fight on land, on the other hand, is a ground asset and is represented in the\nland dimension.\n\nClosed frames are used to denote the land and sea surface dimensions, frames open at the bottom denote the air/space dimension, and frames open at the top denote the subsurface dimension.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Special Forces may operate in any dimension.\n\nThe full set of battle dimensions is, in ascending order of distance from Earth center:\n* SOF (F)\n* Sea subsurface (U)\n* Sea surface (S)\n* Ground (G)\n* Air (A)\n* Space (P)\n* Other (X)\n* Unknown (Z)\nThe mnemonic for this ordering is \"Fuss-Gap\".\n\nThe letter in parentheses is used by the symbol identification coding (SIDC) scheme \u2014 strings of 15 characters used to transmit symbols.\n\nThe space and air battle dimensions share a single frame shape. In the ground battle dimension, two different frames are used for the friendly (and assumed friendly) affiliations in order to distinguish between units and equipment. The SOF (special operations forces) are assigned their own battle dimension because they typically can operate across several domains (air, ground, sea surface and subsurface) in the course of a single mission; the frames are the same as for the ground (unit) battle dimension.<ref name=\"APP2005\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsymbs.com/APP-6ADRDCValcartierEdition121(Mod).pdf|title=Commented APP-6A - Military symbols for land based systems|last=Thibault|first=D.

This octagon is not actually shown when symbols are drawn or rendered but, with a few defined exceptions, all icons inside the frame would also fit inside these octagons. APP-6C modified some symbol frames from previous editions of the standard. From top to bottom, here is the symbol boundary shown inside the APP-6C frames of space elements, air elements, land units, land equipment and surface sea elements, and sub-surface sea elements.\n \n[[Image:NATO Map Symbol - Symbol Size boundary (APP-6C).svg|500px]]\n\n==Unit icons==\nThe icon is the innermost part of a symbol which, when displayed, provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation of an operational object. The icon portrays the role or mission performed by the object. APP-6A distinguishes between icons that must be framed or unframed and icons where framing is optional.<ref name=APP1986/>{{rp|39\u201343}}\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!Friendly unit symbol  || Hostile unit symbol  || Neutral unit symbol  || Unknown unit symbol  || Unit type\n|-\n|<div style=\"position:relative;

Neither the actual rank designated for a particular unit's commander, nor the rank held by the incumbent commander alters the appropriate symbol. For example, units are periodically commanded by an officer junior to the authorised commander grade, yet a company under the command of a Lieutenant (U.S.) or Captain (Commonwealth) is still indicated with two vertical ticks. Likewise, some peculiar types of companies and detachments are authorised a Major, Lieutenant Colonel (personnel services companies) or Colonel (some types of judge advocate detachments); the company or detachment is nevertheless indicated with, respectively, one vertical tick or three dots.\n\nWhile in Commonwealth armies, the regiment as a tactical formation does not normally exist, in some cases a regimental sized (i.e. larger than battalion and smaller than brigade) Task Force may exist where the operational requirement exists. These formations may be commanded by Colonels.\n\nNote that, for brigades and higher, the number of Xs corresponds to the number of stars in the United States military's insignia for the typical general officer grade commanding that size unit. For example, a division is capped with XX and is usually commanded by a major general the American insignia for which is two stars.\n\n==Status==\nThe ''status'' of a symbol refers to whether a warfighting object exists at the location identified (i.e., status is \"present\") or will in the future reside at that location (i.e., status is \"planned, anticipated, suspected,\" or \"on order\"). Regardless of affiliation, present status is indicated by a solid line and planned status by a dashed line. The frame is solid or dashed, unless the symbol icon is unframed, in which case the icon itself is drawn dashed. Planned status cannot be shown if the symbol is an unframed filled icon.\n\n==Symbol modifiers==\nAPP-6A stops with field AB. MIL-STD-2525B and 2525B Change 1 add a number of other modifiers.\n\n[[Image:APP-6A Field positions.svg|thumb|200px|Positions of the various graphic modifiers around the symbol (itself field A). MIL-STD-2525B Change 1 fails to specify where to place fields AD, AE, and AF.]]\n\n===Graphic modifiers===\n*''Echelon'' (field B) Identifies command level (see [[#Unit sizes|Unit sizes]], above).\n*''Task force'' (field D) Identifies a unit as a task force. It may be used alone or in combination with Echelon, like so: [[Image:Brigade Task Force.svg|19px]]<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n*''Frame shape modifier'' (field E) A short textual modifier that completes the affiliation, battle dimension, or exercise description of an object (\"U\", \"?\", \"X\", \"XU\", \"X?\", \"J\" or \"K\"). It is treated as a graphic modifier, however.\n*''Direction of movement'' (field Q) A fixed-length arrow that identifies the direction of movement or intended movement of an object. It emanates from the symbol's centre except in the ground domain, where it is hooked to a short offset, straight down from the symbol's base centre (see diagram).\n*''Mobility indicator'' (field R) Depicts the mobility of an object (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Mobility]], below). It is used only with equipment.\n*''Headquarters staff'' or ''offset location'' (field S) Identifies a unit as a headquarters, or indicates the object's actual location on the map when it has been shifted away in order to declutter the display. It goes straight down from the symbol's centre left, then angles towards the actual location (see diagram).\n*''Feint/dummy'' (field AB) Identifies a unit intended to draw the enemy's attention away from the area of the main attack, or a decoy designed to fool enemy intelligence. It consists of a dashed chevron, placed above the frame, like the echelon graphic modifier (the standard is unclear as to how the two combine graphically). See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Feints/Dummies]], below.\n*''Installation'' (field AC) Identifies a particular symbol as an installation. It sits atop the frame. See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Installations]], below.\n*''Auxiliary equipment'' (field AG) Indicates the presence of a towed sonar array (used exclusively in the sea surface or subsurface battle dimensions). It sits below the frame, like field R (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Auxiliary equipment]], below).\n*''Area of uncertainty'' (field AH) Indicates the area where an object is most likely to be, based on the object's last report and the reporting accuracy of the sensor that detected it. This can take various forms, such as an ellipse, a bounding box, or lines indicating probable bearing and distance.\n*''Dead reckoning trailer'' (field AI) Identifies where an object should be located at present, given its last reported course and speed. This can take the form of a dotted line (extending from the symbol to the dead-reckoned position) or a dotted circle (bounding the zone the object may have reached since, when the direction of movement is unknown or uncertain).\n*''Speed leader'' (field AJ) Depicts the speed and direction of movement of an object. It is identical to the Direction of Movement indicator except that its length is variable (and there is no arrow head).\n*''Pairing line'' (field AK) Connects two objects.\n\n====Feints/dummies and installations====\n'''Source:'''<ref name=APP2005/>{{rp|288}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n|-\n!

MIL-STD 2525A was the American standard for military symbols. The custodian of APP-6 is the United States. APP-6(A) remained unchanged as work on harmonizing it with ADatP-3, ''NATO Message Text Formatting System'' was carried out. In 1999, APP-6 was moved from the Army Service Board to the Joint Service Board. With this move, APP-6 was placed under the Information Exchange Requirements Harmonization/Message Text Format Working Group. The IERH/MTFWG then formed the Joint Symbology Panel to provide configuration management of APP-6 with the US custodian as the chairman. With the ratification and promulgation of APP-6(B) in 2008, the named was changed to ''NATO Military Symbology'' to better reflect the nature of the publication. In 2011, with the introduction of APP-6(C), the named was changed to ''NATO Joint Military Symbology''. The US military required new symbols to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the pace of change between APP-6 and MIL-STD-2525 remained uneven until 2009. In 2009, a new chairman for DOD Symbology Standardization Management Committee was appointed, and the two configuration management organizations began to work together. The two organizations held joint meetings with full participation on both sides. The goal of both groups is to develop comprehensive joint military symbology that is common to both organizations to the greatest extent possible.

Originally published in 1986 as Allied Procedural Publication 6 (APP-6), '''NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems''', the standard has evolved over the years and is currently in its fourth version (APP-6C). The symbols are designed to enhance [[NATO]]'s [[joint interoperability]] by providing a standard set of common symbols. APP-6 constituted a single system of joint military symbology for land, air, space and sea-based formations and units, which can be displayed for either automated map display systems or for manual map marking. It covers all of the joint services and can be used by them.\n\n==History==\nThe first basic military map symbols began to be used by western armies in the decades following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During [[World War I]], there was a degree of harmonisation between the British and French systems, including the adoption of the colour red for enemy forces and blue for allies; the British had previously used red for friendly troops because of the traditional red coats of British soldiers. However, the system now in use is broadly based on that devised by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1917. The infantry symbol of a saltire in a rectangle was said to symbolise the crossed belts of an infantryman, while the single diagonal line for cavalry was said to represent the sabre belt. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the US Army system was standardized and adapted, with different shapes for friendly (blue rectangle), hostile (red diamond) and unknown (yellow [[quatrefoil]]) forces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hershey|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Not Just Lines on a Map: A History of Military Mapping|url=http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Strategy & Tactics|volume=274|pages=22\u201327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107184638/http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAPP-6A was promulgated in December 1999. The NATO standardization agreement that covers APP-6A is ''[[STANAG]] 2019'' (edition 4), promulgated in December 2000. APP-6A replaced ''APP-6'' (last version<!-- change 2 -->, July 1986), which had been promulgated in November 1984 (edition 3<!-- Also Edition 3 Amendment 1 (1990) --> of STANAG 2019 covered APP-6<!--\nNote:\nAPP-6 (1986) mentions that it \"replaces STANAG 2019 (Edition 2) ''Military Symbols'', which was designed for manual map marking.\"  Odds are that STANAG 2019 editions 1 or 2 promulgated [[Q-STAG]] 509 ''Military Symbols'', which dates back to the mid-1970s\n-->), and was replaced in turn by ''Joint Symbology APP-6(B)'' ([[APP-6B]]) in 2008 (STANAG 2019 edition 5, June 2008) and ''NATO Joint Military Symbology APP-6(C)'' ([[APP-6C]]) in 2011 (STANAG 2019 edition 6, May 2011).\n\nThe U.S. is the current custodian of APP-6A, which is equivalent to [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#MIL-STD-2525A|MIL-STD-2525A]].\n\n==Symbol sets==\nThe APP-6A standard provides common operational symbology along with details on their display and plotting to ensure the compatibility, and to the greatest extent possible, the interoperability of NATO land component ''command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence'' (C4I) systems, development, operations, and training. APP-6A addresses the efficient transmission of symbology information through the use of a standard methodology for symbol hierarchy, information taxonomy, and symbol identifiers.\n\nAPP-6A recognises five broad ''sets'' of symbols, each set using its own SIDC (Symbol identification coding) scheme:\n\n* Units, equipment, and installations\n* Military operations (tactical graphics)\n* METOC (meteorological and oceanographic)\n* Signals intelligence\n* MOOTW (military operations other than war)\n\n''Units, equipment, and installations'' consist of icons, generally framed, associated with a single point on the map. All sorts of graphical and textual modifiers may surround them, specifying categories, quantities, dates, direction of movement, etc.\n\n''Tactical graphics'' represent operational information that cannot be presented via icon-based symbols alone: unit boundaries, special area designations, and other unique markings related to battlespace geometry and necessary for battlefield planning and management. There are point, line and area symbols in this category.\n\n''Meteorological'' and ''oceanographic'' symbology is the only set not under the standard's control: rather, they are imported from the symbology established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].\n\nThe ''signals intelligence'' and ''military operations other than war'' symbology sets stand apart from Units, Equipment, and Installations although they obey the same conventions (i.e., they consist of framed symbols associated to points on the map). They do not appear in APP-6A proper, having been introduced by MIL-STD-2525B.\n\n==Symbol composition==\nMost of the symbols designate specific points, and consist of a ''frame'' (a geometric border), a ''fill'', a constituent ''icon'', and optional symbol ''modifiers''. The latter are optional text fields or graphic indicators that provide additional information.\n\nThe frame provides a visual indication of the affiliation, battle dimension, and status of an operational object. The use of shape and colour is redundant, allowing the symbology to be used under less-than-ideal conditions such as a monochrome red display to preserve the operator's night vision. Nearly all symbols are highly stylised and can be drawn by persons almost entirely lacking in artistic skill; this allows one to draw a symbolic representation (a GRAPHREP, Graphical report) using tools as rudimentary as plain paper and pencil.\n\nThe frame serves as the base to which other symbol components and modifiers are added. In most cases a frame surrounds an icon. One major exception is equipment, which may be represented by icons alone (in which case the icons are coloured as the frame would be).\n\nThe fill is the area within a symbol. If the fill is assigned a colour, it provides an enhanced (redundant) presentation of information about the affiliation of the object. If colour is not used, the fill is transparent. A very few icons have fills of their own, which are not affected by affiliation.\n\nThe icons themselves, finally, can be understood as combinations of elementary glyphs that use simple composition rules, in a manner reminiscent of some ideographic writing systems such as [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]]. The standard, however, still attempts to provide an \"exhaustive\" listing of possible icons instead of laying out a dictionary of component glyphs. This causes operational problems when the need for an unforeseen symbol arises (particularly in MOOTW), a problem exacerbated by the administratively centralised maintenance of the symbology sets.\n\nWhen rendering symbols with the fill on, APP-6A calls for the frame and icon to be black or white (as appropriate for the display). When rendering symbols with the fill off, APP-6A calls for a monochrome frame and icon (usually black or in accordance with the affiliation colour). NATO symbols can also be rendered with fill off using a frame coloured according to affiliation and a black icon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/wiki/images/8/80/NATO_Map_Symbol_(Canadian)_Programmed_Instruction_Package_Jan_2000.pdf|title=NATO Map Symbol Programmed Instruction Package|date=Jan 2000|publisher=Canadian Forces School of Military Intelligence|page=6|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref> though this is not defined in any APP-6 standard.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Fill On.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill on\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome Colour.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome colour frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome B&W.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and bichrome frame and icon\n</gallery>\n\n==Affiliation==\n''Affiliation'' refers to the relationship of the tracker to the operational object being represented. The basic affiliation categories are ''unknown'', ''friend'', [[Neutral country|''neutral'']], and ''hostile''. In the ground unit domain, a yellow [[quatrefoil]] frame is used to denote unknown affiliation, a blue rectangle frame to denote friendly affiliation, a green square frame to denote neutral affiliation, and a red diamond frame to denote hostile affiliation.<ref name=\"APP1986\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf|title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols|last=Korkolis|first=M.|date=July 1986|website=alternatewars.com|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref>{{rp|11}} In the other domains (air and space, sea surface and subsurface, etc.), the same color scheme is used.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Instead, the original APP-6 described a series of \"colour representations\" with the purpose of distinguishing friendly and enemy elements.\n\n*Multi-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy)\n**Yellow for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n**Other colours to be established in a map legend\n*tri-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green or yellow for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy) and for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n*two colour representation: \n**Blue, Green, or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n*One colour representation:\n**Single line border for friendly icons\n**double line border for enemy icons, and unbordered icons were labeled with \"EN\" to the lower right corner\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit - B&W.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (B&W)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit - B&W (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (B&W)\n</gallery>\n\n==Battle dimension==\n''Battle dimension'' defines the primary mission area for the operational object within the battlespace. An object can have a mission area above the Earth's surface (i.e., in the air or outer space), on it, or below it. If the mission area of an object is on the surface, it can be either on land or sea. The subsurface dimension concerns those objects whose mission area is below the sea surface (e.g., submarines and sea mines). Some cases require adjudication; for example, an Army or Marine helicopter unit is a manoeuvring unit (i.e., a unit whose ground support assets are included) and is thus represented in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore is a maritime unit and is represented in the sea surface dimension. A landing craft whose primary mission is to fight on land, on the other hand, is a ground asset and is represented in the\nland dimension.\n\nClosed frames are used to denote the land and sea surface dimensions, frames open at the bottom denote the air/space dimension, and frames open at the top denote the subsurface dimension.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Special Forces may operate in any dimension.\n\nThe full set of battle dimensions is, in ascending order of distance from Earth center:\n* SOF (F)\n* Sea subsurface (U)\n* Sea surface (S)\n* Ground (G)\n* Air (A)\n* Space (P)\n* Other (X)\n* Unknown (Z)\nThe mnemonic for this ordering is \"Fuss-Gap\".\n\nThe letter in parentheses is used by the symbol identification coding (SIDC) scheme \u2014 strings of 15 characters used to transmit symbols.\n\nThe space and air battle dimensions share a single frame shape. In the ground battle dimension, two different frames are used for the friendly (and assumed friendly) affiliations in order to distinguish between units and equipment. The SOF (special operations forces) are assigned their own battle dimension because they typically can operate across several domains (air, ground, sea surface and subsurface) in the course of a single mission; the frames are the same as for the ground (unit) battle dimension.<ref name=\"APP2005\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsymbs.com/APP-6ADRDCValcartierEdition121(Mod).pdf|title=Commented APP-6A - Military symbols for land based systems|last=Thibault|first=D.

This octagon is not actually shown when symbols are drawn or rendered but, with a few defined exceptions, all icons inside the frame would also fit inside these octagons. APP-6C modified some symbol frames from previous editions of the standard. From top to bottom, here is the symbol boundary shown inside the APP-6C frames of space elements, air elements, land units, land equipment and surface sea elements, and sub-surface sea elements.\n \n[[Image:NATO Map Symbol - Symbol Size boundary (APP-6C).svg|500px]]\n\n==Unit icons==\nThe icon is the innermost part of a symbol which, when displayed, provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation of an operational object. The icon portrays the role or mission performed by the object. APP-6A distinguishes between icons that must be framed or unframed and icons where framing is optional.<ref name=APP1986/>{{rp|39\u201343}}\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!Friendly unit symbol  || Hostile unit symbol  || Neutral unit symbol  || Unknown unit symbol  || Unit type\n|-\n|<div style=\"position:relative;

Neither the actual rank designated for a particular unit's commander, nor the rank held by the incumbent commander alters the appropriate symbol. For example, units are periodically commanded by an officer junior to the authorised commander grade, yet a company under the command of a Lieutenant (U.S.) or Captain (Commonwealth) is still indicated with two vertical ticks. Likewise, some peculiar types of companies and detachments are authorised a Major, Lieutenant Colonel (personnel services companies) or Colonel (some types of judge advocate detachments); the company or detachment is nevertheless indicated with, respectively, one vertical tick or three dots.\n\nWhile in Commonwealth armies, the regiment as a tactical formation does not normally exist, in some cases a regimental sized (i.e. larger than battalion and smaller than brigade) Task Force may exist where the operational requirement exists. These formations may be commanded by Colonels.\n\nNote that, for brigades and higher, the number of Xs corresponds to the number of stars in the United States military's insignia for the typical general officer grade commanding that size unit. For example, a division is capped with XX and is usually commanded by a major general the American insignia for which is two stars.\n\n==Status==\nThe ''status'' of a symbol refers to whether a warfighting object exists at the location identified (i.e., status is \"present\") or will in the future reside at that location (i.e., status is \"planned, anticipated, suspected,\" or \"on order\"). Regardless of affiliation, present status is indicated by a solid line and planned status by a dashed line. The frame is solid or dashed, unless the symbol icon is unframed, in which case the icon itself is drawn dashed. Planned status cannot be shown if the symbol is an unframed filled icon.\n\n==Symbol modifiers==\nAPP-6A stops with field AB. MIL-STD-2525B and 2525B Change 1 add a number of other modifiers.\n\n[[Image:APP-6A Field positions.svg|thumb|200px|Positions of the various graphic modifiers around the symbol (itself field A). MIL-STD-2525B Change 1 fails to specify where to place fields AD, AE, and AF.]]\n\n===Graphic modifiers===\n*''Echelon'' (field B) Identifies command level (see [[#Unit sizes|Unit sizes]], above).\n*''Task force'' (field D) Identifies a unit as a task force. It may be used alone or in combination with Echelon, like so: [[Image:Brigade Task Force.svg|19px]]<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n*''Frame shape modifier'' (field E) A short textual modifier that completes the affiliation, battle dimension, or exercise description of an object (\"U\", \"?\", \"X\", \"XU\", \"X?\", \"J\" or \"K\"). It is treated as a graphic modifier, however.\n*''Direction of movement'' (field Q) A fixed-length arrow that identifies the direction of movement or intended movement of an object. It emanates from the symbol's centre except in the ground domain, where it is hooked to a short offset, straight down from the symbol's base centre (see diagram).\n*''Mobility indicator'' (field R) Depicts the mobility of an object (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Mobility]], below). It is used only with equipment.\n*''Headquarters staff'' or ''offset location'' (field S) Identifies a unit as a headquarters, or indicates the object's actual location on the map when it has been shifted away in order to declutter the display. It goes straight down from the symbol's centre left, then angles towards the actual location (see diagram).\n*''Feint/dummy'' (field AB) Identifies a unit intended to draw the enemy's attention away from the area of the main attack, or a decoy designed to fool enemy intelligence. It consists of a dashed chevron, placed above the frame, like the echelon graphic modifier (the standard is unclear as to how the two combine graphically). See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Feints/Dummies]], below.\n*''Installation'' (field AC) Identifies a particular symbol as an installation. It sits atop the frame. See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Installations]], below.\n*''Auxiliary equipment'' (field AG) Indicates the presence of a towed sonar array (used exclusively in the sea surface or subsurface battle dimensions). It sits below the frame, like field R (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Auxiliary equipment]], below).\n*''Area of uncertainty'' (field AH) Indicates the area where an object is most likely to be, based on the object's last report and the reporting accuracy of the sensor that detected it. This can take various forms, such as an ellipse, a bounding box, or lines indicating probable bearing and distance.\n*''Dead reckoning trailer'' (field AI) Identifies where an object should be located at present, given its last reported course and speed. This can take the form of a dotted line (extending from the symbol to the dead-reckoned position) or a dotted circle (bounding the zone the object may have reached since, when the direction of movement is unknown or uncertain).\n*''Speed leader'' (field AJ) Depicts the speed and direction of movement of an object. It is identical to the Direction of Movement indicator except that its length is variable (and there is no arrow head).\n*''Pairing line'' (field AK) Connects two objects.\n\n====Feints/dummies and installations====\n'''Source:'''<ref name=APP2005/>{{rp|288}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n|-\n!

MIL-STD 2525A was the American standard for military symbols. The custodian of APP-6 is the United States. APP-6(A) remained unchanged as work on harmonizing it with ADatP-3, ''NATO Message Text Formatting System'' was carried out. In 1999, APP-6 was moved from the Army Service Board to the Joint Service Board. With this move, APP-6 was placed under the Information Exchange Requirements Harmonization/Message Text Format Working Group. The IERH/MTFWG then formed the Joint Symbology Panel to provide configuration management of APP-6 with the US custodian as the chairman. With the ratification and promulgation of APP-6(B) in 2008, the named was changed to ''NATO Military Symbology'' to better reflect the nature of the publication. In 2011, with the introduction of APP-6(C), the named was changed to ''NATO Joint Military Symbology''. The US military required new symbols to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the pace of change between APP-6 and MIL-STD-2525 remained uneven until 2009. In 2009, a new chairman for DOD Symbology Standardization Management Committee was appointed, and the two configuration management organizations began to work together. The two organizations held joint meetings with full participation on both sides. The goal of both groups is to develop comprehensive joint military symbology that is common to both organizations to the greatest extent possible. APP-6(C) began the process of changing the format of the publications and introduced new symbol identification codes.

He continued his studies to obtain a post-graduate Diploma in Advertising and Marketing from AAA School of Advertising.\n\nPost studies, he commenced work for [http://www.thejupiterdrawingroom.com The Jupiter Drawing Room], an award-winning South African advertising agency, handling brands such as Coca-Cola and [[5FM]]. In 1996, he was employed by [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] to launch the [[Powerade]] sports drink in South Africa. In 1998 he joined [[Microsoft]] South Africa as a marketing manager, initially only covering consumer products, but later promoted to include all desktop applications (including Microsoft Office and Windows) for both the consumer and business sectors.\n\nIn 2001, he relocated to the Eastern Cape, where he founded his own marketing and management consultancy business, Forward Momentum, focusing on the development of non-governmental organizations and small, medium and micro-enterprises.\n\nMileham has two children from his first marriage to Laura Guest.  He married fellow Democratic Alliance Member of Parliament, [[Natasha Mazzone]] in July 2017.\n\n==Politics==\n\nMileham was actively involved in party politics for the former Democratic Party as a party agent and activist during the 1994 and 1999 elections. In 2003, he became actively involved in local politics as a result of the failure of the local municipality to provide services to disadvantaged communities. He joined the Democratic Alliance in Port Alfred ([[Ndlambe Local Municipality]]) where he was soon appointed constituency chairperson. In 2006, he was elected to the Ndlambe municipal council, and appointed as the party's Chief Whip and finance spokesperson.\n\nIn 2007, Mileham was selected to be part of the first class of Democratic Alliance's Young Leaders Programme, a year-long political and leadership development course.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/05/21/crop-of-young-da-mps-product-of-internal-development-plan|title=Redirecting...|website=www.bdlive.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-01-27-da-young-leaders-programme-comes-of-age|title=DA crop of young leaders come of age|last=Pillay|first=Verashni|work=The M&G Online|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en}}</ref> In 2009, he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament. In 2011, he was elected as a municipal councillor to the [[Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality]], and was appointed as the DA's Chief Whip.\n\nIn 2013, following the death of Pine Pienaar, a member of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature, the DA's provincial leader [[Athol Trollip]] elected to return to the province following his reelection defeat to [[Lindiwe Mazibuko]] for the position of DA Parliamentary Leader, paving the way for Mileham to take up Trollip's seat in parliament.<ref>http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/8503f2004fe5136d959cf70b5d39e4bb/Trollip-back-in-Eastern-Cape-vows-to-fight-for-rural-development-20130606</ref> His appointment as Shadow Deputy Minister for Land Reform and Rural Development<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=381493&sn=Detail|title=Shadow Cabinet tweaked - DA - PARTY {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref> came at a time (just before the 2014 National and Provincial Elections) when land restitution was in the national spotlight, and Mileham was soon in the thick of it<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=402916&sn=Detail|title=8 million hectares of land unaccounted for - Kevin Mileham - PARTY {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=434299&sn=Detail|title=397 000 new land claims need to be processed - Kevin Mileham - PARTY {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=554547&sn=Detail|title=Only R8.7bn budgeted for land restitution over next 3 years - Kevin Mileham - PARTY {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=560434&sn=Detail|title=Why the DA opposes the Property Valuation Bill - Kevin Mileham - PARTY {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=553127&sn=Detail|title=We can't pick and choose which sections of the Constitution we want to uphold - Kevin Mileham - PARTY {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter his re-election in 2014, Mileham was appointed the Shadow Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs by the new Leader of the Opposition, [[Mmusi Maimane]]. In February 2019, he was appointed as Shadow Minister of Energy. He held this position until June 2019, when Maimane appointed him as Shadow Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy.\n\n==VBS Mutual Bank Scandal==\n\nIn mid-2016, Mileham began asking parliamentary questions about municipal deposits with [[VBS Mutual Bank]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dispatchlive.co.za/news/mileham-to-fill-trollips-shoes-in-parliament-soon/ |title = Mileham to fill Trollip's shoes in Parliament soon}}</ref> In terms of the South African Municipal Finance Management Act (No. 56 of 2003), municipalities may only open bank accounts with financial institutions registered in terms of the Banks Act (No. 94 of 1990, as amended by Act 3 of 2015). Mutual banks, like VBS, are registered in terms of the Mutual Banks Act (No. 124 of 1993), and are therefore ineligible to accept municipal deposits.\n\nMileham continued to drive the issue in parliament, and the [[National Treasury (South Africa)|National Treasury]] eventually issued a warning to municipalities in August 2017 that this practice was unacceptable. The Treasury has admitted that they caught on too late to the illegality of the municipal deposits.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Financial-Services/sarb-treasury-caught-on-late-to-illegal-vbs-deposits-nene-20181102 | title=SARB, Treasury caught on late to illegal VBS deposits - Nene| date=2 November 2018}}</ref> Despite the advice of the National Treasury, it appears that municipalities continued to deposit funds with the bank. The issue only garnered national attention in January 2018, when liquidity problems caused by some municipalities attempting to withdraw their funds, forced the [[South African Reserve Bank]], which regulates all banking activities in the country, to place VBS under curatorship.<ref>{{Cite web |

2018}}</ref>\n\nIt soon became clear that municipalities were unlikely to recover the funds deposited with VBS, prompting Mileham to lay criminal charges against municipal officials and politicians who had influenced the illegal deposits.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/business/2018-05-30-fraud-charges-against-15-municipalities-after-banking-with-vbs/ |title =

Mutual banks, like VBS, are registered in terms of the Mutual Banks Act (No. 124 of 1993), and are therefore ineligible to accept municipal deposits.\n\nMileham continued to drive the issue in parliament, and the [[National Treasury (South Africa)|National Treasury]] eventually issued a warning to municipalities in August 2017 that this practice was unacceptable.

[[Wellington Region]] of New Zealand and the seat of the '''Masterton District''' (a territorial authority or local government district).  It is the largest town in the [[Wairarapa]], a region separated from Wellington by the [[Rimutaka]] ranges. It is 100 kilometres north-east of [[Wellington]], 39.4 kilometres south of [[Eketahuna]], on the [[Ruamahanga River]].\n\nMasterton has an urban population of {{NZ population data 2018||y}}, and district population of {{NZ population data 2018|Masterton district|y|y|y|(|).}}\n\nMasterton businesses include services for surrounding farmers. Three new industrial parks are being developed in Waingawa, Solway and Upper Plain.

The association was led by [[Joseph Masters]] \u2013 after whom the town was named \u2013 and aimed to settle working people in villages and on the land. At first Masterton grew slowly, but as its farming hinterland became more productive it began to prosper.\n\nIn the 1870s it overtook Greytown as Wairarapa's major town. It became a borough in 1877 and was reached by the railway line from Wellington in 1880. The railway became for a time the main line from Wellington to the north of New Zealand and its arrival cemented the town's position as the Wairarapa region's main market and distribution centre.\n\n===Modern history===\n\nIn essence providing support services for rural industry - living off the sheep's back - Masterton's real growth ended with that sector's retrenchment after the 1974 British entry to the trade and political grouping now the [[European Union]]. Efforts to decentralise industry to New Zealand's provinces gave Masterton a print works and some other industries but the lost economic activity was not restored.\n\nFrom the 1970s, people and businesses left for opportunities elsewhere. In the 1980s, with government deregulation and protective tariffs lifted, more businesses closed and the town declined further.<ref name=\"DNZB Masterton\">DNZB \"Wairarapa places\" - Masterton by Ben Schrader Retrieved 12 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn April 1965 one of the country's worst industrial accidents occurred at the General Plastics Factory on 170 Dixon Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.rangitane.iwi.nz/index.php/history/pathways/1960s-1980s |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114031750/http://education.rangitane.iwi.nz/index.php/history/pathways/1960s-1980s |archivedate=14 January 2015  }}</ref>\n\nIt did not quite qualify to be a city by 1989 when the minimum population requirement for that status was lifted from 20,000 to 50,000.\n\n===Marae===\n\nThe local Te Oreore marae and Ng\u0101 Tau e Waru meeting house are affiliated with the iwi of [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]] and its hap\u016b of [[Kahukuraawhitia]], [[Kahukuranui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Te Hina (Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu)|Ng\u0101ti Te Hina]], [[Tahu o Kahungunu]], [[Tamahau]] and [[Whiunga]], and with the iwi of [[Rangit\u0101ne]], and its hap\u016b of [[Hinetearorangi]], [[Ng\u0101i Tamahau]], [[Ng\u0101ti H\u0101mua (Rangit\u0101ne)|Ng\u0101ti H\u0101mua]], [[Ng\u0101ti Taimahu]], [[Ng\u0101ti Tangatakau]], [[Ng\u0101ti Te Noti]], [[Ng\u0101ti Te Raetea]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Te Wh\u0101tui]].\n\nAnother local marae, Akura Marae, is affiliated with the [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Te Ahuahu]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Te Hina (Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu)|Ng\u0101ti Te Hina]]. and with the [[Rangit\u0101ne]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti M\u0101tangiuru]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Te Hina (Rangit\u0101ne)|Ng\u0101ti Te Hina]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\">{{cite web|title=Te K\u0101hui M\u0101ngai directory|url= http://www.tkm.govt.nz/ |website=tkm.govt.nz|publisher=[[Te Puni K\u014dkiri]]}}</ref><ref name=\"maorimaps\">{{cite web |title=M\u0101ori Maps |url=https://maorimaps.com/map |website=maorimaps.com |publisher=Te Potiki National Trust}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Natusch.jpg|thumb|House for his family by architect [[Charles Natusch]] builders C E Daniell]]\nAt the 2013 census, Masterton District had a population of 23,352, an increase of 729 people, 3.2 percent, since the 2006 census.

large town in the [[Wellington Region]] of New Zealand and the seat of the '''Masterton District''' (a territorial authority or local government district).  It is the largest town in the [[Wairarapa]], a region separated from Wellington by the [[Rimutaka]] ranges. It is 100 kilometres north-east of [[Wellington]], 39.4 kilometres south of [[Eketahuna]], on the [[Ruamahanga River]].\n\nMasterton has an urban population of {{NZ population data 2018||y}}, and district population of {{NZ population data 2018|Masterton district|y|y|y|(|).}}\n\nMasterton businesses include services for surrounding farmers. Three new industrial parks are being developed in Waingawa, Solway and Upper Plain. The town is the headquarters of the annual [[Golden Shears]] [[sheep-shearing]] competition.\n\n==Suburbs==\nMasterton suburbs include:\n* Opaki, [[Lansdowne, Masterton|Lansdowne]], Te Ore Ore on the northern side\n* Eastside and Homebush on the eastern side\n* Upper Plain and Akura on the western side\n* Kuripuni and [[Solway, New Zealand|Solway]] on the southern side\n\n==History and culture==\n\n===Early history===\n\n[[File:General_Plastics_(N.Z.)_Ltd._Explosion_and_Fire_(1965)_(26271497746).jpg|thumb|General Plastics (N.Z.)

The association was led by [[Joseph Masters]] \u2013 after whom the town was named \u2013 and aimed to settle working people in villages and on the land. At first Masterton grew slowly, but as its farming hinterland became more productive it began to prosper.\n\nIn the 1870s it overtook Greytown as Wairarapa's major town. It became a borough in 1877 and was reached by the railway line from Wellington in 1880. The railway became for a time the main line from Wellington to the north of New Zealand and its arrival cemented the town's position as the Wairarapa region's main market and distribution centre.\n\n===Modern history===\n\nIn essence providing support services for rural industry - living off the sheep's back - Masterton's real growth ended with that sector's retrenchment after the 1974 British entry to the trade and political grouping now the [[European Union]]. Efforts to decentralise industry to New Zealand's provinces gave Masterton a print works and some other industries but the lost economic activity was not restored.\n\nFrom the 1970s, people and businesses left for opportunities elsewhere. In the 1980s, with government deregulation and protective tariffs lifted, more businesses closed and the town declined further.<ref name=\"DNZB Masterton\">DNZB \"Wairarapa places\" - Masterton by Ben Schrader Retrieved 12 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn April 1965 one of the country's worst industrial accidents occurred at the General Plastics Factory on 170 Dixon Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.rangitane.iwi.nz/index.php/history/pathways/1960s-1980s |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114031750/http://education.rangitane.iwi.nz/index.php/history/pathways/1960s-1980s |archivedate=14 January 2015  }}</ref>\n\nIt did not quite qualify to be a city by 1989 when the minimum population requirement for that status was lifted from 20,000 to 50,000.\n\n===Marae===\n\nThe local Te Oreore marae and Ng\u0101 Tau e Waru meeting house are affiliated with the iwi of [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]] and its hap\u016b of [[Kahukuraawhitia]], [[Kahukuranui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Te Hina (Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu)|Ng\u0101ti Te Hina]], [[Tahu o Kahungunu]], [[Tamahau]] and [[Whiunga]], and with the iwi of [[Rangit\u0101ne]], and its hap\u016b of [[Hinetearorangi]], [[Ng\u0101i Tamahau]], [[Ng\u0101ti H\u0101mua (Rangit\u0101ne)|Ng\u0101ti H\u0101mua]], [[Ng\u0101ti Taimahu]], [[Ng\u0101ti Tangatakau]], [[Ng\u0101ti Te Noti]], [[Ng\u0101ti Te Raetea]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Te Wh\u0101tui]].\n\nAnother local marae, Akura Marae, is affiliated with the [[Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Te Ahuahu]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Te Hina (Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu)|Ng\u0101ti Te Hina]]. and with the [[Rangit\u0101ne]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti M\u0101tangiuru]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Te Hina (Rangit\u0101ne)|Ng\u0101ti Te Hina]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\">{{cite web|title=Te K\u0101hui M\u0101ngai directory|url= http://www.tkm.govt.nz/ |website=tkm.govt.nz|publisher=[[Te Puni K\u014dkiri]]}}</ref><ref name=\"maorimaps\">{{cite web |title=M\u0101ori Maps |url=https://maorimaps.com/map |website=maorimaps.com |publisher=Te Potiki National Trust}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Natusch.jpg|thumb|House for his family by architect [[Charles Natusch]] builders C E Daniell]]\nAt the 2013 census, Masterton District had a population of 23,352, an increase of 729 people, 3.2 percent, since the 2006 census.
