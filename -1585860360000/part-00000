Along with Chris's secretary, Susan, and his assistant, Tim, Barbara is waiting for the arrival of Leonora Vail. Sir Reginald French, a surgeon, enters from a bedroom, asking if Leonora has come yet. Barbara asks, \"There isn't much time, is there?\" The doctor replies that he fears not, and that his patient is asking for Leonora in his moments of consciousness. The doorbell rings. Barbara comments \"It's the same \u2013 exactly the same as a year ago ... the first time she ever came into this room\". Ernest, the butler announces Mrs Vail; the lights fade and come up again on the second scene, which is a flashback to November 1934.\n\nBarbara, Tim, Susan and Ernest are all in the same positions, though with minor changes of costume. Leonora, an old school friend of Barbara, enters. When Chris looks in for a few moments, his manner to Leonora is vague and uninterested. Leonora tells Barbara that she much prefers his nice assistant, Tim. She leaves, after inviting Barbara, Tim and Chris (\"if he'll come\") to lunch. Tim comes in, looking for a Bible: Chris wants a quotation for his next lecture on psychopathology. They borrow the cook's Bible and find the passage he wants: \"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of the heart.\"\n\nIn the third scene, two months later, Chris and Leonora have become considerably more intimate: they are kissing each other passionately. Leonora confesses that she has deliberately tried to make him fall in love, in revenge for his dismissive manner at their first meeting. He admits that he was deliberately rude to her at first because \"You irritated me, you were so conscious of how beautiful you looked\". He adds that despite his affair with Leonora he loves Barbara \"deeply and truly and for ever\". The scene ends with another passionate clinch.\n\nThree months later, scene four takes place on an early April morning. Barbara has been sitting up all night, waiting for Chris to come home. She greets him calmly but insists on some straight talking. She tells him that his increasingly unhinged mental state, brought on by the strain of his affair, is affecting his work and his life. She says he should go away with Leonora for two or three months, leaving Tim to run the practice. In the fifth scene, in November, Chris and Leonora quarrel bitterly. She says she is leaving him. He throws her to the floor. After she picks herself up and leaves, he drinks two glasses of whisky, goes to the window and jumps out.\n\nThe final scene is a continuation of the first. Ernest announces: \"Mrs Vail.\" Barbara gives her a quick drink and sends her straight into the bedroom. The others wait, talking distractedly, until she comes back. Barbara asks, \"Is he \u2013 ?\" Leonora replies, \"Yes. ... He didn't know me; he thought I was you; he said \u2013 'Baba, I'm not submerged any more' \u2013 and then he said 'Baba' again \u2013 and then \u2013 then he died.\" She leaves the room as the curtain falls.\n:Source: Play text and Mander and Mitchenson.<ref>Coward, pp. 7\u201311 (Scene 1); 11\u201322 (Scene 2); 22\u201327 (Scene 3); 28\u201335 (Scene 4); 36\u201341 (Scene 5) and 41\u201343 (Scene 6); and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 291\u2013293</ref>\n\n==Subsequent productions==\nIn 1937 a company headed by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

Along with Chris's secretary, Susan, and his assistant, Tim, Barbara is waiting for the arrival of Leonora Vail. Sir Reginald French, a surgeon, enters from a bedroom, asking if Leonora has come yet. Barbara asks, \"There isn't much time, is there?\" The doctor replies that he fears not, and that his patient is asking for Leonora in his moments of consciousness. The doorbell rings. Barbara comments \"It's the same \u2013 exactly the same as a year ago ... the first time she ever came into this room\". Ernest, the butler announces Mrs Vail; the lights fade and come up again on the second scene, which is a flashback to November 1934.\n\nBarbara, Tim, Susan and Ernest are all in the same positions, though with minor changes of costume. Leonora, an old school friend of Barbara, enters. When Chris looks in for a few moments, his manner to Leonora is vague and uninterested. Leonora tells Barbara that she much prefers his nice assistant, Tim. She leaves, after inviting Barbara, Tim and Chris (\"if he'll come\") to lunch. Tim comes in, looking for a Bible: Chris wants a quotation for his next lecture on psychopathology. They borrow the cook's Bible and find the passage he wants: \"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of the heart.\"\n\nIn the third scene, two months later, Chris and Leonora have become considerably more intimate: they are kissing each other passionately. Leonora confesses that she has deliberately tried to make him fall in love, in revenge for his dismissive manner at their first meeting. He admits that he was deliberately rude to her at first because \"You irritated me, you were so conscious of how beautiful you looked\". He adds that despite his affair with Leonora he loves Barbara \"deeply and truly and for ever\". The scene ends with another passionate clinch.\n\nThree months later, scene four takes place on an early April morning. Barbara has been sitting up all night, waiting for Chris to come home. She greets him calmly but insists on some straight talking. She tells him that his increasingly unhinged mental state, brought on by the strain of his affair, is affecting his work and his life. She says he should go away with Leonora for two or three months, leaving Tim to run the practice. In the fifth scene, in November, Chris and Leonora quarrel bitterly. She says she is leaving him. He throws her to the floor. After she picks herself up and leaves, he drinks two glasses of whisky, goes to the window and jumps out.\n\nThe final scene is a continuation of the first. Ernest announces: \"Mrs Vail.\" Barbara gives her a quick drink and sends her straight into the bedroom. The others wait, talking distractedly, until she comes back. Barbara asks, \"Is he \u2013 ?\" Leonora replies, \"Yes. ... He didn't know me; he thought I was you; he said \u2013 'Baba, I'm not submerged any more' \u2013 and then he said 'Baba' again \u2013 and then \u2013 then he died.\" She leaves the room as the curtain falls.\n:Source: Play text and Mander and Mitchenson.<ref>Coward, pp. 7\u201311 (Scene 1); 11\u201322 (Scene 2); 22\u201327 (Scene 3); 28\u201335 (Scene 4); 36\u201341 (Scene 5) and 41\u201343 (Scene 6); and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 291\u2013293</ref>\n\n==Subsequent productions==\nIn 1937 a company headed by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.
