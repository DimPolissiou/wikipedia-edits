She campaigned for [[women's suffrage]], the right of women to better education, the end of [[coverture]] in British law, the abolition of [[child prostitution]], and an end to [[human trafficking]] of young women and children into European [[prostitution]].\n\nGrey grew up in a well-to-do and politically connected [[progressivism|progressive]] family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married [[George Butler (1819\u20131890)|George Butler]], an [[Anglican divine]] and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a banister. The death was a turning point for Butler, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local [[workhouse]]. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases\u2014particularly in the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]]\u2014through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Butler also formed the [[International Abolitionist Federation]], a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.\n\nWhile investigating the effect of the Acts, Butler had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a [[Human trafficking|slave trade]] of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian ''{{lang|be|Police des M\u0153urs}}'', and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Butler fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', [[William Thomas Stead]], who [[Eliza Armstrong case|purchased a 13-year-old girl]] from her mother for \u00a35. The subsequent outcry led to the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the [[British Raj]].\n\nButler [[Josephine Butler bibliography|wrote more than 90 books and pamphlets]] over the course of her career, most of which were in support of her campaigning, although she also produced biographies of [[John Grey (land agent)|her father]], her husband and [[Catherine of Siena]]. Butler's [[Christian feminism]] is celebrated by the [[Church of England]] with a [[Lesser Festival]], and by representations of her in the [[stained glass]] windows of [[Liverpool Cathedral|Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral]] and [[St Olave Hart Street|St Olave's Church]] in the [[City of London]]. Her name appears on the Reformers Memorial in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London, and [[Durham University]] named [[Josephine Butler College, Durham|one of their colleges]] after her. Her campaign strategies changed the way feminist and suffragists  conducted future struggles, and her work brought into the political milieu groups of people that had never been active before. After her death in 1906 the feminist leader [[Millicent Fawcett]] hailed her as \"the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century\".{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=1}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life; 1828\u20131850===\n[[File:John Grey of Dilston Patten.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of a man, part turned toward the viewer|[[John Grey (land agent)|John Grey]], Butler's father, portrait by [[George Patten]]]]\nJosephine Grey was born on 13 April 1828 at [[Milfield]], [[Northumberland]].

It was at the height of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and the first time she had come into contact with widespread suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=20}} and later recalled that \"As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around me, yet it printed itself upon my brain and memory.\"{{sfn|Butler|1887|p=44}}\n\n===Early married life; 1850\u20131864===\n[[File:George Butler.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=George Butler in profile, wearing a suit; his hair is receding and he has a large beard|[[George Butler (1819\u20131890)|George Butler]], Josephine's husband]]\n\nBy 1850 Grey had grown close to [[George Butler (1819\u20131890)|George Butler]], a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|Fellow]] of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], whom she had met at several of the [[Ball (dance party)|balls]] hosted around [[County Durham]].{{sfn|Matthew|2004}}{{efn|Although she wrote an autobiography and a biography of her husband, Josephine never clarified where or when they first met.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=27}}}} By October that year George was sending her self-penned poems; the couple were engaged in January 1851 and married in January 1852. The Butlers set up home at 124, [[High Street, Oxford]].{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=27\u201328, 198}} George was a scholar and cleric and shared with his wife a commitment to [[liberal reforms]] and a love of Italian culture.{{sfn|Matthew|2004}} The couple also both had a strong Christian belief and Josephine Butler later wrote of her husband that they often \"prayed together that a holy revolution might come about and that the Kingdom of God might be established on the earth\".{{sfn|Butler|1892|p=102}}\n\nIn November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, followed by a second, Arthur Stanley\u2014known as Stanley\u2014in May 1854.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=32, 39}} Butler's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and [[Misogyny|misogynist]] community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as \"the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university\".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Butler was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s novel ''[[Ruth (novel)|Ruth]]'' in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Butler saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a \"moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man\";{{sfn|Butler|1892|pp=95\u201396}} she decided not to voice her feelings on the point but \"to speak little with men, but much with God\".{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=16}} As a more practical measure she\u2014and George\u2014began to help many of the [[fallen woman]] of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case in which they were involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at [[Newgate Prison]]. She had been seduced by a [[university don]] who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house at the end of her sentence.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=36}}\n\n[[File:Munro bust of Josephine Butler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Butler in 1865, aged 36, by [[Alexander Munro (sculptor)|Alexander Munro]]]]\nIn 1856 Butler's health began to suffer from Oxford's damp atmosphere,{{efn|Extensive flooding of the local [[Thames Valley]] that year had been a contributory factor.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=47}}}} which exacerbated a long-standing lesion on her lung; her doctor informed her that to remain in Oxford could be fatal.

In August 1864 Eva fell {{convert|40|ft|m}} from the top-floor banister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=45\u201346}} Butler was distraught at the loss and had disturbed sleep for several years; she was unable to write about the circumstances until 30 years later.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=55}}{{sfn|Garner|2009|p=6}} The subsequent inquest gave a verdict of [[accidental death]].{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=57}}\n\nIn October 1864 Stanley contracted [[diphtheria]] while Butler was still grieving for Eva. She was suffering from depression and was in poor health. After the worst of Stanley's ailment passed, Butler decided to take him to [[Naples]] for them both to rest and recuperate. The ship in which they travelled down the west coast of Italy faced rough weather, and Butler had a physical breakdown on board from which she nearly died.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=47}}{{efn|Jordan considers that Butler was suffering a hysterical paralysis,{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=62}} while her biographer, Helen Mathers, describes it as a \"psychogenic paralysis, which produces&nbsp;...

It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool.\"{{sfn|Butler|1892|p=183}} She made regular visits to the [[workhouse]] at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals.{{efn|The workhouse system\u2014brought about by the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]]\u2014was a method of providing accommodation and employment to those unable to find work or support themselves. The employment provided was of a menial nature, including digging ditches, grinding corn or breaking stones.{{sfn|Williams|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Snell|1987|p=122}}}} She would sit with the women in the cellars\u2014many of whom were prisoners\u2014and pick [[oakum]] with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=18}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=53}}\n\n[[File:Josephine Butler Building.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Large, three-floor building in a state is disrepair|Butler's hostel for women, Liverpool in a derelict condition in 2009 before its demolition]]\n\nJust as they had done in Cheltenham, the Butlers began providing shelter in their own home for some of the women, often prostitutes in the terminal stages of [[venereal disease]]. It soon became clear that there were more women in need than they could provide for, so Butler set up a hostel, with funds from local men of means.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=60}} By Easter 1867 she had established a second, larger home, in which more appropriate work was provided, such as sewing and the manufacture of envelopes; the \"Industrial Home\", as she called it, was funded by the workhouse committee and local merchants.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd|1y=1982|1p=39|2a1=Mathers|2y=2014|2p=60|3a1=Walkowitz|3y=1982a|3p=116}}\n\nButler campaigned for women's rights, including [[Women's suffrage|the right to the vote]] and to have a better education.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Bill]] to widen the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to include women. The petition, which was supported by the [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] and philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], was ignored and the bill became law.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=61}}\n\nButler considered the Liverpool hostels a stop-gap; women would continue to struggle to find employment until they had been better educated.{{sfn|Boyd|1982|p=39}} In 1867, with the [[suffragist]] [[Anne Clough]], she established the [[North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women]], which aimed to raise the status of governesses and female teachers to that of a [[profession]];{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=86}} She served as its president until 1873.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} A series of lectures, initially in towns in the north of England, began under [[James Stuart (scientist)|James Stuart]], a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Although it was thought thirty students would sign up, three hundred joined.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=87\u201388}} In 1868 Butler published \"The Education and Employment of Women\", her first pamphlet, in which she argued for access to [[higher education]] for women, and more equal access to a wider range of jobs.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} It was the first of [[Josephine Butler bibliography|90 books and pamphlets]] she wrote.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} That May she petitioned the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|senate]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] to provide examinations for women; the Cambridge Higher Examination for women was introduced the following year. Jordan notes that \"much of the credit for this should go to Anne Clough, but&nbsp;... Butler played a very influential part&nbsp;... of the campaign.\"{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=96}}\n\nAt the time British law relating to marriage was based on the legal doctrine of [[coverture]], in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=70}} In April 1868 Butler and fellow suffragist [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy|Elizabeth Wolstenholme]] set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Butler remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walkowitz|1y=2004|2a1=Jordan|2y=2001|2p=88|3a1=Gordon|3a2=Doughan|3y=2014|3pp=91\u201392}}\n\n===First attempt to repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; 1869\u20131874===\n[[File:Josephine Butler, 1876.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A woman looks to the left of the camera; she has shoulder-length hair and a large skirted dress|Butler in 1876]]\n\nIn 1869 Butler became aware of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]]. They had been introduced in 1864, 1866 and 1869 to regulate  prostitution in an attempt to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]].{{sfn|Summers|1999|p=1}} The Acts authorised the police to detain women in specific areas{{efn|Those areas covered by the Acts were 18 military stations, garrisons and seaport towns, including an area of up to 15 miles from the military installation.{{sfn|Hamilton|1978|p=14}}}}{{efn|In 1869 the \"Association for the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts\" was formed to campaign to extend their operation over the whole of the UK.{{sfn|Gordon|Doughan|2014|p=16}}}} considered to be prostitutes\u2014no evidence was needed, other than the police officer's word. If a magistrate agreed, women were given genital examinations. If women were suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, they were held in a [[lock hospital]] until the condition was cured. If they refused to be examined or hospitalised they could be imprisoned, often with [[hard labour]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1978|p=14}}{{sfn|Walkowitz|1982|p=80}}\n\nUnits of plain-clothed policemen specialised in arresting suspected prostitutes; according to Jordan, the officers were \"hated for their surveillance and harassment of prostitutes and working-class women&nbsp;... who they treated with little regard for their legal rights\".{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=107}} Women who were subjected to the examination found their names and reputations affected and, according to the historian Hilary Cashman,  \"the Acts had the effect of turning them to prostitution by barring respectable ways of life to them\".{{sfn|Cashman|1990|p=27}}\n\nIn September 1869 Wolstenholme met Butler in Bristol to discuss what could be done about the Acts. The National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was founded that October, but excluded women from its membership. In response, Wolstenholme and Butler formed the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] (LNA) before the end of the year.{{sfn|D'Itri|1999|p=31}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=110}} The organisation published a ''Ladies Manifesto'', which stated that the Acts were discriminatory on grounds of both sex and class; the Acts, it was claimed:\n\n{{quote|not only deprived poor women of their constitutional rights and forced them to submit to a degrading internal examination, but they officially sanctioned a double standard of sexual morality, which justified male sexual access to a class of 'fallen' women and penalised women for engaging in the same vice as men.{{sfn|Walkowitz|1982|p=80}}}}\n\nOn 31 December 1869 the Ladies National Association published a statement in ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' that  it had \"been formed for the purposes of obtaining the repeal of these obnoxious Acts\". Among the 124 signatories  were the social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]] and the social reformer [[Florence Nightingale]].<ref name=\"DN: LNA statement\" />{{efn|In March 1870 the statement was reprinted in ''The Shield'', a weekly newspaper launched to support the repeal campaign.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=112}}}}\n\nButler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=81, 84}}{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=79}} Although she persuaded many members of her audiences,{{sfnm|1a1=Walkowitz|1y=2004|2a1=Jordan|2y=2001|2pp=113\u201315|3a1=Mathers|3y=2014|3pp=84\u201385}} she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimps]] threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=123}}<ref name=\"Guard: Heroine\" />\n\n[[File:Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare NPG.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A seated man looks to the right of the viewer; he wears a suit and sports a neckbeard|The [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Bruce]], who set up a [[Royal Commission]] in 1871 to examine the Contagious Diseases Acts]]\n\nAt the [[1870 Colchester by-election|1870 Colchester parliamentary by-election]] the LNA fielded a candidate against the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candidate [[Henry Knight Storks|Sir Henry Storks]], a supporter of the Acts, who had implemented a similar regime when he commanded the British army in Malta.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=86}} Butler held several local meetings during the campaign; during one, she was chased by a group of [[brothel]] owners.{{sfn|Butler|1910|pp=27\u201328}} The presence of the LNA candidate split the Liberal vote and allowed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate to win the seat;{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=86}} Butler considered that \"it proved to be somewhat of a turning-point in the history of our crusade\".{{sfn|Butler|1910|p=25}} Because of Stork's loss at the by-election the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Bruce]], announced a [[Royal Commission]] to examine the situation.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=127}}{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=64}} One [[Member of parliament|MP]] told Butler that\n\n{{quote|Your manifesto has shaken us very badly in the House of Commons; a leading man in the House remarked to me, \"We know how to manage any other opposition in the House or in the country, but this is very awkward for us\u2014this revolt of the women.

In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of \"steel rape\", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the [[age of consent]] should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=97}}\n\nIn February 1872 Bruce proposed a bill that took some of the commission's recommendations,{{efn|The bill raised the age of consent to 14 and gave police powers to suppress brothels, crack down on prostitutes under the age of 16.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=98}}}} but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to the whole of the UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses and try and change others, Butler rejected it in its entirety and published ''The New Era'', a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; the pamphlet was re-published in serial form in ''The Shield''.{{efn|In ''The New Era'', She pointed out that Bruce's Bill was based on legislation that governed the situation in Berlin, where nearly 30,000 women were being examined; cases of [[syphilis]] has risen since the legislation had been introduced.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=99}}}} It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance.

She campaigned for [[women's suffrage]], the right of women to better education, the end of [[coverture]] in British law, the abolition of [[child prostitution]], and an end to [[human trafficking]] of young women and children into European [[prostitution]].\n\nGrey grew up in a well-to-do and politically connected [[progressivism|progressive]] family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married [[George Butler (1819\u20131890)|George Butler]], an [[Anglican divine]] and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a banister. The death was a turning point for Butler, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local [[workhouse]]. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases\u2014particularly in the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]]\u2014through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Butler also formed the [[International Abolitionist Federation]], a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.\n\nWhile investigating the effect of the Acts, Butler had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a [[Human trafficking|slave trade]] of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian ''{{lang|be|Police des M\u0153urs}}'', and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Butler fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', [[William Thomas Stead]], who [[Eliza Armstrong case|purchased a 13-year-old girl]] from her mother for \u00a35. The subsequent outcry led to the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the [[British Raj]].\n\nButler [[Josephine Butler bibliography|wrote more than 90 books and pamphlets]] over the course of her career, most of which were in support of her campaigning, although she also produced biographies of [[John Grey (land agent)|her father]], her husband and [[Catherine of Siena]]. Butler's [[Christian feminism]] is celebrated by the [[Church of England]] with a [[Lesser Festival]], and by representations of her in the [[stained glass]] windows of [[Liverpool Cathedral|Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral]] and [[St Olave Hart Street|St Olave's Church]] in the [[City of London]]. Her name appears on the Reformers Memorial in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London, and [[Durham University]] named [[Josephine Butler College, Durham|one of their colleges]] after her. Her campaign strategies changed the way feminist and suffragists  conducted future struggles, and her work brought into the political milieu groups of people that had never been active before. After her death in 1906 the feminist leader [[Millicent Fawcett]] hailed her as \"the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century\".{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=1}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life; 1828\u20131850===\n[[File:John Grey of Dilston Patten.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of a man, part turned toward the viewer|[[John Grey (land agent)|John Grey]], Butler's father, portrait by [[George Patten]]]]\nJosephine Grey was born on 13 April 1828 at [[Milfield]], [[Northumberland]].

George accepted the appointment, and they moved into a [[grace and favour]] home near the cathedral.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=136\u201337}} Josephine Butler set up another hostel for women near their home.{{sfn|Williamson|1977|p=85}}\n\nPolitical pressure from Liberal [[backbencher]]s, particularly [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Charles Henry Hopwood|Charles Hopwood]], led to increasing opposition to the Acts. In February 1883 Hopwood tabled a resolution in parliament: \"That this House disapproves of the compulsory examination of women under the Contagious Diseases Acts\", which was debated in April. MPs voted by a majority of 72 to suspend the inspections; three years later the Acts were formally repealed.{{sfnm|1a1=Strachey|1y=1928|1pp=21\u201322|2a1=Jordan|2y=2001|2pp=213\u201315|3a1=Mathers|3y=2014|3pp=141\u201343}}\n\n===Child prostitution and Eliza Armstrong; 1885\u20131887===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header = Two of Butler's allies in the campaign against child prostitution\n| width     = 150\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Florence S.

The meeting led to Butler's involvement in the campaign to expose [[child prostitution]] in Britain and its associated trade.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=217}} Along with  Booth, [[Benjamin Scott]] the [[Chamberlain of London|City Chamberlain]] and several supporters from the LNA, she persuaded the campaigning editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', [[William Thomas Stead]], to help their cause.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=149\u201350}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=224\u201325}}\n\nStead considered the best way to prove that the purchase of young girls for prostitution took place in London, was to buy a girl himself.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|p=250}} Butler introduced him to a former prostitute and brothel owner who was staying in her hostel. In a slum in [[Marylebone]], Stead [[Eliza Armstrong case|purchased a 13-year-old girl]] from her mother for \u00a35, and took her to France.{{efn|The girl, Eliza Armstrong, was temporarily homed in France before being returned to Britain where she was educated at the Princess Louise Home, [[Essex]], where she was trained for a career in [[domestic service]]. Several years later she wrote to Stead thanking him for his actions. By that time she had married and had six children.{{sfn|Le Feuvre|2015|loc=3750\u201356}}}} In July 1885 Stead began the publication of a series of articles entitled \"[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]\", exposing the extent of child prostitution in London.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=225}} In the first article\u2014which covered six pages of the ''Gazette''\u2014Stead recounted an interview he had with [[Howard Vincent]], the head of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]:\n\n{{quote|\"But\", I said in amazement, \"then do you mean to tell me that in very truth actual rapes, in the legal sense of the word, are constantly being perpetrated in London on unwilling virgins, purveyed and procured to rich men at so much a head by keepers of brothels?\" \"Certainly\", said he, \"there is not a doubt of it.\" \"Why\", I exclaimed, \"the very thought is enough to raise hell.\" \"It is true\", he said; \"and although it ought to raise hell, it does not even raise the neighbours.\"<ref name=\"PMG: Babylon\" />{{sfn|Petrie|1971|pp=244\u201345}}}}\n\nOn 16 July\u2014ten days after the article was published\u2014Butler gave a speech at a meeting at London's [[Exeter Hall]] calling for increased protection for the young and the raising of the age of consent. The following day she and George left for a holiday in Switzerland and France.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=154}} While they were away, a moribund parliamentary bill from 1883  dealing with the age of consent   was re-debated by MPs; the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] was passed on 14 August 1885.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=154}}{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=229}} The Act raised the age of consent  from 13 to 16 years of age, while the procurement of girls for prostitution by administering drugs, intimidation or fraud was made a criminal offence, as was the abduction of a girl under 18 for purposes of carnal knowledge.{{sfn|Farmer|2016|p=276}}{{efn|A late amendment to the bill by [[Henry Labouch\u00e8re]]\u2014Section 11, known as the [[Labouchere Amendment]]\u2014created the crime of indecency between men, the first criminalisation on all acts aside from [[sodomy]], which was covered by earlier legislation. Sex between males was illegal in Britain until 1967.{{sfn|Selfe|Burke|2012|p=11}}<ref name=\"BL: CLAA\" />}} The police investigated Stead's purchase, and Butler was forced to cut her holiday short to return for questioning. Although she avoided all charges, Stead was imprisoned for three months.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=155}}\n\nThe passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act led to the formation of purity societies, such as the [[White Cross Army]], whose aims were to force the closure of brothels through prosecution. The societies widened their remit to suppress what they considered indecent literature\u2014including information on birth control\u2014and the entertainment provided by the [[music hall]]s.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=158}} Butler warned against the purity societies because of their \"fatuous belief that you can oblige human beings to be moral by force, and in so doing that you may in some way promote social purity\".{{sfn|Walkowitz|1982a|p=252}} Her warnings went unheeded by other suffragists, and some, such as [[Millicent Fawcett]]\u2014who was later Butler's biographer\u2014continued to combine their activities in the feminist movement with the work for the purity societies.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}\n\n===India, Empire and the final years; 1897\u20131906===\n[[File:Josephine Elizabeth Butler (n\u00e9e Grey) by George Frederic Watts.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An elderly lady sits; she is shown in profile, looking to the left|Butler in old age, by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1894]]\n\nAlthough the Contagious Diseases Acts had been repealed in the UK, the equivalent legislation was active in the [[British Raj]] in India, where prostitutes near the British [[cantonment]]s were subjected to regular forced examinations.{{sfn|Petrie|1971|pp=266\u201367}} The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General [[Edward Chapman (British Army officer)|Edward Chapman]], who issued [[General order|standing orders]] for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of \"a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses\".{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=127}}\n\nButler began a new campaign to have the legislation repealed, comparing the girls to slaves. After the campaign put pressure on MPs, the widespread publication of Chapman's orders led to what Mathers describes as \"outrage across Britain\".{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=165}} In June 1888 the House of Commons passed a unanimous resolution repealing the legislation, and the Indian government was ordered to cancel the Acts.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|p=243}} To circumvent the order, the [[India Office]] advised the [[Viceroy of India]] to instigate new legislation ensuring that prostitutes suspected of carrying contagious diseases had to undergo an examination or face expulsion from the cantonment.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=165}}\n\nTowards the end of the 1880s George's health began to decline, and Butler spent increasing time looking after him.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=162\u201363}} They holidayed in Naples in 1889, but George contracted [[influenza]] in the [[1889\u201390 flu pandemic|1889\u201390 pandemic]]. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890;{{sfn|Matthew|2004}} Butler suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in [[Wimbledon, London]], which she shared with her eldest son and his wife.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|p=199}}\n\nButler, at 62, felt she was too old to travel to India, but two American supporters visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes\u2014some as young as 11\u2014were all continuing to operate.{{sfn|Mathers|2014|pp=169\u201370}} The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Butler spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}{{sfn|Fawcett|Turner|1927|p=120}}\n\nAlthough many of Butler's friends and supporters of shared causes spoke out against [[British Empire|British Imperial Policy]], Butler did not. She wrote that because of the work Britain had undertaken in making [[slavery]] illegal, \"[w]ith all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the ''least'' guilty of the nations\".{{sfn|Butler|1954|p=196}} During the [[Second Boer War]] (1899\u20131902), Butler published ''Native Races and the War'' (1900), in which she supported British action and its imperialist policy. In the book she took a strong line against the casual [[racism]] inherent in her countrymen's dealings with foreigners, writing:\n\n{{quote|Great Britain will in future be judged, condemned or justified, according to her treatment of those innumerable, coloured races, heathen or partly Christianized, over whom her rule extends&nbsp;... Race prejudice is a poison which will have to be cast out if the world is ever to be Christianized, and if Great Britain is to maintain the high and responsible place among the nations which has been given to her.{{sfn|Butler|1900|pp=152\u201353}}}}\n\nFrom 1901 Butler began to withdraw from public life, resigning her positions in the campaign organisations and spending more time with her family.{{sfn|Jordan|2001|pp=284\u201385, 289}} In 1903 she moved to [[Wooler]] in Northumberland, to live near her eldest son.

A building in the Faculty of Business and Law at [[Liverpool John Moores University]] was named \"Josephine Butler House\".

According to the feminist historian [[Barbara Caine]], \"Liberalism provided the framework for Butler's whole social and political approach. It was an integral part of her feminism\", although it was in conflict with the liberal approach to sexuality and desire. Butler resolved the conflict through her religion.{{sfn|Caine|1993|pp=155\u201356}}\n\nAccording to Walkowitz, Butler \"pushed liberal feminism in new directions, developing theories and methods of political agitation that directly affected future campaigns for the emancipation of women\".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} She developed new approaches to campaigning and moved the debate beyond discussions in middle-class houses to the public forum, bringing into the political debate women who had never been involved before.{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}<ref name=\"Guard: Heroine\" /> Butler's campaigning, says Walkowitz, \"not only reshaped gender, class, and sexual subjectivities in late Victorian Britain but also informed national political history and state-building\".{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}}\n\nNumerous historians consider the success of the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts to be a milestone in the [[History of feminism|history of female emancipation]].{{sfn|Walkowitz|2004}} According to the political historian Margaret Hamilton, the campaign showed that \"attitudes toward women were changing\".{{sfn|Hamilton|1978|p=14}} The feminist scholar [[Sheila Jeffreys]] says that Butler is \"one of the bravest and most imaginative feminists in history\",<ref name=\"Guard: Heroine\" /> while Fawcett wrote that she was \"convinced that&nbsp;...

Following a few minor supporting parts, he rose to prominence with his  portrayal of [[Eliot Ness]] in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987). This was followed by a successful period in his career with starring roles in ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]'' (1987), ''[[Bull Durham]]'' (1988), ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), for which he won two [[Academy Awards]], ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' (1991), ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992), and ''[[A Perfect World]]'' (1993).

He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in marketing and finance from [[California State University, Fullerton]] (CSUF) in 1978.<ref name=tca/> While at CSUF, he became a brother in the [[Delta Chi]] fraternity.<ref name=\"autobiog\"/>\n\nCostner became interested in acting and dancing while in his last year of college,<ref name=tca/> and upon graduation, he married Cindy Silva, who worked at Disneyland as Cinderella. The couple honeymooned in [[Puerto Vallarta]]; on the return plane journey, they had a chance encounter with actor [[Richard Burton]], who had purchased all the seats around him for solitude. Burton agreed to speak to Costner after he finished reading his book. Costner, who had been taking acting classes but had not told his wife about his desire to be an actor, watched Burton closely and approached when Burton gestured. Costner told Burton that he would prefer to avoid the drama that followed Burton and asked if he would have to tolerate that if he became an actor. Burton replied, \"You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes. I think you'll be fine.\" After the plane landed, Burton's limousine pulled up to the curb where Costner and his wife were waiting for a taxi. Burton wished Costner good luck, and the two never met again. Costner credits Burton with partially contributing to his career.\nHaving agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive, Costner began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his wife. His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars' Hollywood homes to support the couple while he also attended auditions.\n\n==Career==\nCostner made his film debut in the film ''[[Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.]]'' (known originally as ''Hot Malibu Summer''). Filmed in the winter of 1978\u201379, the film was not released until 1981 and re-released in 1986. The release complications and lack of documentation lead many to believe that Costner's debut was in ''The Touch'' (also known as ''Stacy's Knights''), in 1983 with Eve Lilith and Andra Millian. Costner made a brief appearance in the [[Ron Howard]] film ''[[Night Shift (1982 film)|Night Shift]]'' (1982). He is listed in the credits as 'Frat Boy No.&nbsp;1' and appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler. Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden halt of celebration.\n\n[[File:Kevin Costner 2003.jpg|thumb|upright|Costner at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nCostner appeared in a commercial for the [[Apple Lisa]] and ''[[Table for Five]]'' in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the [[nuclear holocaust]] film ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. Later, he was cast in ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut.<ref name=tca/> His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together.  Costner was a friend of director [[Lawrence Kasdan]], who promised the actor a role in a future project.<ref name=tca/> That became ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'' (1985) and a breakout role for Costner.<ref name=tca/> He also starred that year in the smaller films ''Fandango'' and ''[[American Flyers]]'' and appeared alongside [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in an hour-long special episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nCostner achieved movie star status in 1987, when he starred as federal agent [[Eliot Ness]] in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' and in the leading role of the thriller ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]''.<ref name=tca/> He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films ''[[Bull Durham]]'' (1988) and ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989).<ref name=tca/> In 1990, he partnered with producer [[Jim Wilson (producer)|Jim Wilson]] to form the production company Tig Productions.<ref name=tca/><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://screen-space.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/7/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-of-kevin-costner.html | title = THE RISE AND FALL AND RISE OF KEVIN COSTNER | website = Screen-Space | access-date = January 7, 2014}}</ref> Tig's first film was the epic ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' which Costner directed and starred in. This film was nominated for 12 [[Academy Awards]] and won seven, including two for him personally ([[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]).<ref name=tca/> The same year saw the release of ''[[Revenge (1990 film)|Revenge]]'', in which he starred along with [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Madeleine Stowe]], directed by [[Tony Scott]]; Costner had wanted to direct it himself.\n\nCostner followed with ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' (1991); the [[Oliver Stone]]-directed ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991); ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992); and [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[A Perfect World]]'' (1993); all of which provided box office or critical acclaim.<ref name=tca/> He took the title role in the biopic ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]'' (1994), directed by Kasdan. ''[[The War (1994 film)|The War]]'', also made in 1994, seemed to gain little attention. The science fiction-[[post-apocalyptic]] epics ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures.<ref name=tca/> However, results for ''The Postman'' were worse than ''Waterworld'' and it ended up \"winning\" five [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1998 | title = 18th Annual Golden Raspeberry Awards | author = Internet Movie Database | access-date = November 2, 2010}}</ref> Costner starred in the golf comedy ''[[Tin Cup]]'' (1996) for [[Ron Shelton]], who had previously directed him in ''Bull Durham''.<ref name=tca/> He developed the film ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' instead. He personally offered the project to [[Harrison Ford]]. In 1999, he starred in ''[[Message in a Bottle (film)|Message in a Bottle]] '' with [[Robin Wright]], based on the [[Message in a Bottle (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Nicholas Sparks]].\n[[File:Kevin Costner DF-SD-05-08959 crop.jpg|thumb|Costner visiting [[Andrews Air Force Base]] in July 2003]]\n\nHis career revived somewhat in 2000 with ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'', in which he portrayed [[Kenneth O'Donnell]], a top adviser to [[John F. Kennedy]]. The western ''[[Open Range (2003 film)|Open Range]]'', which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially.

Hill City artist [[Peggy Detmers]] created 14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze [[Lakota people|Lakota]] riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 from Detmers.

Following a few minor supporting parts, he rose to prominence with his  portrayal of [[Eliot Ness]] in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987). This was followed by a successful period in his career with starring roles in ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]'' (1987), ''[[Bull Durham]]'' (1988), ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), for which he won two [[Academy Awards]], ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' (1991), ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992), and ''[[A Perfect World]]'' (1993).

He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in marketing and finance from [[California State University, Fullerton]] (CSUF) in 1978.<ref name=tca/> While at CSUF, he became a brother in the [[Delta Chi]] fraternity.<ref name=\"autobiog\"/>\n\nCostner became interested in acting and dancing while in his last year of college,<ref name=tca/> and upon graduation, he married Cindy Silva, who worked at Disneyland as Cinderella. The couple honeymooned in [[Puerto Vallarta]]; on the return plane journey, they had a chance encounter with actor [[Richard Burton]], who had purchased all the seats around him for solitude. Burton agreed to speak to Costner after he finished reading his book. Costner, who had been taking acting classes but had not told his wife about his desire to be an actor, watched Burton closely and approached when Burton gestured. Costner told Burton that he would prefer to avoid the drama that followed Burton and asked if he would have to tolerate that if he became an actor. Burton replied, \"You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes. I think you'll be fine.\" After the plane landed, Burton's limousine pulled up to the curb where Costner and his wife were waiting for a taxi. Burton wished Costner good luck, and the two never met again. Costner credits Burton with partially contributing to his career.\nHaving agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive, Costner began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his wife. His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars' Hollywood homes to support the couple while he also attended auditions.\n\n==Career==\nCostner made his film debut in the film ''[[Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.]]'' (known originally as ''Hot Malibu Summer''). Filmed in the winter of 1978\u201379, the film was not released until 1981 and re-released in 1986. The release complications and lack of documentation lead many to believe that Costner's debut was in ''The Touch'' (also known as ''Stacy's Knights''), in 1983 with Eve Lilith and Andra Millian. Costner made a brief appearance in the [[Ron Howard]] film ''[[Night Shift (1982 film)|Night Shift]]'' (1982). He is listed in the credits as 'Frat Boy No.&nbsp;1' and appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler. Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden halt of celebration.\n\n[[File:Kevin Costner 2003.jpg|thumb|upright|Costner at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nCostner appeared in a commercial for the [[Apple Lisa]] and ''[[Table for Five]]'' in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the [[nuclear holocaust]] film ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. Later, he was cast in ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut.<ref name=tca/> His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together.

This film was nominated for 12 [[Academy Awards]] and won seven, including two for him personally ([[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]).<ref name=tca/> The same year saw the release of ''[[Revenge (1990 film)|Revenge]]'', in which he starred along with [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Madeleine Stowe]], directed by [[Tony Scott]]; Costner had wanted to direct it himself.\n\nCostner followed with ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' (1991); the [[Oliver Stone]]-directed ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991); ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992); and [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[A Perfect World]]'' (1993); all of which provided box office or critical acclaim.<ref name=tca/> He took the title role in the biopic ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]'' (1994), directed by Kasdan. ''[[The War (1994 film)|The War]]'', also made in 1994, seemed to gain little attention. The science fiction-[[post-apocalyptic]] epics ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures.<ref name=tca/> However, results for ''The Postman'' were worse than ''Waterworld'' and it ended up \"winning\" five [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1998 | title = 18th Annual Golden Raspeberry Awards | author = Internet Movie Database | access-date = November 2, 2010}}</ref> Costner starred in the golf comedy ''[[Tin Cup]]'' (1996) for [[Ron Shelton]], who had previously directed him in ''Bull Durham''.<ref name=tca/> He developed the film ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' instead.

In 1999, he starred in ''[[Message in a Bottle (film)|Message in a Bottle]] '' with [[Robin Wright]], based on the [[Message in a Bottle (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Nicholas Sparks]].\n[[File:Kevin Costner DF-SD-05-08959 crop.jpg|thumb|Costner visiting [[Andrews Air Force Base]] in July 2003]]\n\nHis career revived somewhat in 2000 with ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'', in which he portrayed [[Kenneth O'Donnell]], a top adviser to [[John F. Kennedy]]. The western ''[[Open Range (2003 film)|Open Range]]'', which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired professional baseball player Denny Davies in ''[[The Upside of Anger]]'', for which he received a nomination from the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] and won the [[San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. After that, Costner starred in ''[[The Guardian (2006 film)|The Guardian]]'' and in ''[[Mr. Brooks]]'', in which he portrayed a [[serial killer]].

Promoters stated in a news release that the $5-million attraction had a new, 3,800-square-foot interactive center featuring exhibit, retail, and food and beverage areas, as well as offices and a small orientation theater. The visitor center features graphics, photographs, and text describing how bison came to North America and how Native American tribes used the animals for food, clothing, shelter, and other needs. The centerpiece is a bronze sculpture depicting a buffalo jump commonly used by Plains Indians to kill and process large numbers of animals on which they depended for survival. Hill City artist [[Peggy Detmers]] created 14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze [[Lakota people|Lakota]] riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 from Detmers. The five-fourths-scale bronzes, each weighing between 2,500 and 8,000 pounds, were cast at Eagle Bronze Foundry in [[Lander, Wyoming]].
