It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls (on NAV2 and NAV3 models, but only on certain NAV4 models).The TomTom Go models belong either to the NAV2, NAV3 or NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom Camper & Caravan / RV''' \u2013 an all-in-one GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls. In Europe, the Camper model is based on the TomTom Go&nbsp;1005, in North America the RV models are based on the NAV3 Start 60 model. The TomTom Camper & Caravan and RV models belong to the NAV3 range and their biggest difference compared to other NAV3 models is the map that is supplied with, which allows certain size and weight data to be entered and being considered in the route planning. Technically any NAV3 device can be made to a Camper/RV editing by purchasing the camper map from the TomTom webshop.\n* '''TomTom Truck''' \u2013 designed for professional truck drivers and include truck-specific software and maps. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls (on NAV3 models).The TomTom Pro/Truck models belong either to the NAV3 or NAV4 ranges. A few years ago truck maps were available to NAV2 models too.\n* '''TomTom Via''' \u2013 middle class GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls. All the TomTom Via models belong to the NAV3 range.\n* '''TomTom Start''' \u2013 an entry-level GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]], but usually a lower HW specification, compared to the Via and Go models. Some models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. The TomTom Start models belong either to the NAV2, NAV3 or NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom One and One XL''' \u2013 The TomTom One is the base model for [[automotive navigation system|automobile navigation]]. The difference between the TomTom One XL and the TomTom One is the size of the touch screen (4.3 vs 3.5&nbsp;in or 110 vs 89&nbsp;mm).  Neither model of the One contains the added functions included in the Go models, such as Bluetooth hands-free calling and MP3 Jukebox.  However, the One is able to receive traffic and weather updates using the TomTom Plus service when paired via Bluetooth with a mobile phone with a DUN data service.  The reduced software capability means less demand on the hardware, which allows the One to be sold at a significantly lower price than the Go. The ''XL'' is also available as a ''Live'' version with integrated Live Services.\n* '''TomTom Rider''' \u2013 Portable water-resistant models for [[motorcycle]] and [[motorscooter]] users. They differ from other devices in that the Rider is partly shielded and has a 'glove-friendly' screen and GUI. There are many different models in the NAV2 and NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom Navigator''' \u2013 a GPS navigation software product for [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[Palm (device)|Palm]] devices, [[Pocket PC]]s, and some smartphones. TomTom Navigator 6 replaced the earlier TomTom Mobile 5.2. It can use GPS receivers built into the device or external (e.g., Bluetooth-connected) receivers. Navigator 7 was the latest release of this software, released as a part of the software that came with the June 2008 HTC Touch Diamond. Frequently used functions can be added to the main screen of the program, and users can report map corrections and share them with other users. Navigator supports touch screens; devices without touch screens use a cursor to input data.  The software is available on SD card and DVD.

Turkey and Greece were not included in the larger ''Europe'' map pack; this is related to the AppStore's app size limitation of 2 GB. These maps are available separately. Iceland is not available in any map package sold by TomTom at the moment, but they are working on it (and a few other countries too). Also most likely there will be a new iOS app available, based on the NavKit, which might cure the issue with the size limit (also Apple increased the app size limit to 4GB).\n*'''TomTom Go Mobile''', GPS navigation software for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It replaced the old app, which had similar features to the iOS app. In March 2015, TomTom announced the new TomTom GO Mobile app for Android with a freemium subscription model for maps with the first 50 miles/75 kilometres per month being free, including all the maps that are available, TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. The previous app, which had promised \"free lifetime updates\", is not available for purchase on [[Play Store]] anymore and its maps are not updated since October 2015. TomTom claims their definition of lifetime map updates is \"the period of time that TomTom continues to support the app with updates\". Previous customers of TomTom's Android navigation app are offered a discount on the subscription in the new app for three years. There is no provision for users who want to keep using the old app under the conditions it was sold with lifetime map updates.\n*'''TomTom Speed Cameras''', a mobile software application released in 2015 free of charge.<ref>https://recombu.com/cars/article/tomtom-speed-cameras-app-to-keep-you-on-the-right-side-of-the-law</ref>\n\nNavigation software for several mobile phones discontinued after release 5.2; Navigator, which does not support all the phones that Mobile did, is the nearest equivalent. Mobile 5.2 cannot use maps later than v6.60 build 1223; this and earlier program versions are not compatible with all map versions, particularly other builds of version 6.\n\nIn September 2012, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] collaborated with TomTom to provide mapping data for its revamped iOS 6 updated [[Apple Maps]] app.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/tomtom-confirmed-as-official-partner-for-ios-6-maps-1084678|title=TomTom confirmed as official partner for iOS 6 Maps|work=TechRadar|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}</ref> The partnership was in part due to Apple's decision to wean itself off the products of its competitor, [[Google]]. As of 2018 TomTom continues to provide data for Apple Maps.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-tomtom/apple-rebuilds-mapping-app-but-will-still-tap-tomtom-idUSKBN1JP32S</ref>\n\n==TomTom Home and MyDrive Connect==\nTomTom Home (stylized as TomTom HOME) is a 32-bit PC application that allows synchronization/updates to be sent to the mobile device. The container states that it is compatible with Mac OS X v10.3 or greater and Windows ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 (see above reference). After installation, it has options to choose a device to be associated to and activate the software.  A caution is given that the software only allows one device to be associated to an email address and the associated device can be changed only after 14 days since the previous association. TomTom Home version 2.0 and above is implemented on the [[XULRunner]] platform. With version 2.2, TomTom Home added a content-sharing platform where users can download and upload content to personalize their device such as voices, start-up images, [[Point of Interest|POI]] sets, etc. At the moment TomTom Home is on version 2.9.\n\nDespite being based on the cross-platform XULRunner, TomTom Home lacks support for Linux (and most probably it won't ever support, as the NAV2 devices are mostly legacy models by now).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/home|title=TomTom HOME software downloads page|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724234645/http://www.tomtom.com/home/|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is, for instance, impossible to update the maps in these devices by connecting them to another machine running Linux, even when using a common web browser like Firefox that normally allowed such an update under Microsoft Windows. \nHowever, the devices can still be read in a Linux OS as a disk drive. There is even software made by the community to manage some functions of\nthe TomTom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pytomtom.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=En:Main_Page|title=pyTOMTOM}}</ref>\n\nThe NAV3 and NAV4 range of models use MyDrive Connect. MyDrive Connect is compatible with 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 preview and with most Mac OS X versions. The internal flash memory or the memory card content of the device cannot be accessed through USB for security reasons (modified applications would easily accept a map that wasn't sold by TomTom). The device can update itself by getting files through the HTTP protocol over USB. The support app is nothing more than a proxy on the PC buffering the download. So far the security achieved using this mechanism has not been broken yet. Also, the usage of the non-FAT/FAT32 file system brought stability improvements in device operations. On the downside, some users might experience compatibility issues between their PC, device and the MyDrive Connect support application. For those issues, TomTom Customer Services or members of the community forum are usually able to provide solutions.\n\n==TomTom built-in navigation==\nTomTom partners with several car manufacturers and offers built-in navigation solutions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Currently, the fees are only for European countries.\n\nTraffic data is also available to subscribers in many parts of Europe and the US via a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled cell phone with Internet service or an add-on aerial, which picks up [[Traffic Message Channel|RDS]] data (broadcast on [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio frequencies) offering traffic information without the requirement for a data connection.  The TomTom Plus service is not compatible with Apple's [[iPhone]].\n\n===TomTom Live Services===\nIn October 2008 the company released Live Services on the Go 940 Live. These allowed users to receive updates over the mobile telephone network using the SIM card in the device. These services included HD Traffic, Safety Alerts, Local Search with Google and Fuel Prices.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, TomTom announced that it was offering up its real-time traffic products to \"industry partners\" in the United States.<ref>Don Reisinger, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20062210-17.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 TomTom offering real-time traffic data to partners].\" 12 May 2011. Retrieved 12 May 2011.</ref>\n\nOn the latest NAV4 devices the service is not available anymore in the old form. The included services had been separated and now being called TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. On the x0/x00/x000 devices the traffic service is free of charge either via the built-in SIM (Always Connected models) or via a compatible smartphone (Smartphone Connected or BYOD \u2013 Bring Your Own Device). The speed camera service is free for three months on these models. However, there is a newer range, the x10/x100 models, which come now with free lifetime speed camera subscription too.\n\n===Map Share===\nMap Share is a proprietary map technology launched by TomTom in June 2007.  Map Share allows users to make changes to the maps on their navigation devices and share them with others. It allows drivers to make changes to their maps directly on their navigation devices. Drivers can block or unblock streets, change the direction of traffic, edit street names and add, edit or remove points of interest (POIs). Improvements can be shared with other users through TomTom HOME, TomTom's content management software.\n\nAn online version called Map Share Reporter is on the TomTom website.\n\n===TomTom Traffic (previously HD Traffic)===\nA traffic monitoring service that uses multiple sources to provide traffic information. The service does this by combining data from:\n* traditional sources: governmental/third-party data such as induction loops in the roads, cameras and traffic surveillance\n* new sources: traffic flow of millions of anonymous mobile phone users<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/services/service.php?id=2&tab=4|title=TomTom HD Traffic \u2013 How it works}}</ref>\n\nThe information is merged by TomTom and algorithms are used to improve the data and filter out anomalous readings. The system sends updates to all TomTom Traffic users every two minutes (and the data the users receive is never older than 30 seconds). Users can receive the service through the built-in SIM, via a smartphone connection or on older devices via a standard phone connection. Re-routing can be set to be transparent to the user with the only sign that the route has been changed due to a traffic jam being a sound indication from the device and a changed {{abbr|ETA|estimated time of arrival}}.\n\nThe system was first launched in the Netherlands in 2007 and expanded to the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Switzerland in 2008. By mid-2011, TomTom Live services including TomTom Traffic are available in the United States, South Africa, New Zealand and the following seventeen European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. {{Asof|2015}}, the service is vastly expanded and current coverage is available on the TomTom Traffic site (34 countries {{asof|2015|06|26|lc=on}} and the list expands every few months to new regions).\n\n'''TomTom Traffic improvements'''\n*''HD Traffic 6.0'' (August 2012): More accurate location of traffic jams, improved coverage of automatically detected road closures\n*''TomTom Traffic 7.0'' (September 2013): Increased accuracy of jam location now allows for 'Jam Ahead Warnings', warning drivers when approaching a jam-tail too fast. Improved coverage of automatic road closure detection started to include also major secondary roads. Automatic road works detection on highways. TomTom also added 'Predictive Flow Feed' for better predicting approaching traffic delays, with the goal of improving optimal route calculation and ETA.\n*''TomTom Traffic 8.0'' (November 2014): TomTom included real-time weather information in their routing algorithms, and warns users in areas of bad weather. Also, version 8.0 now incorporates in their real-time traffic information road closures that are reported via the online Map Share Reporter tool.\n\n===IQ Routes===\nIQ Routes, developed by TomTom and available since spring 2008 on the TomTom Go 730 and Go 930, uses anonymous travel time data accumulated by users of TomTom satnav devices. Newer TomTom devices use this data to take into account the time and day when determining the fastest route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloginfomanage.blogspot.com/2008/01/tomtom-collecting-data-from-gps-systems.html|title=Information Management: TomTom collecting data from GPS Systems}}</ref>\n\nTravel time data is stored in Historical Speed Profiles, one for each road segment, covering large motorways, main roads and also small local roads. Historic Speed Profiles are part of the digital map and are updated with every new map release. They give insight into real-world traffic patterns. This is a fact-based routing system based on measured travel times, compared to most other methods which use speed limits or \u2018assumed\u2019 speeds.\n\nIn September 2008, map upgrade v8.10 was released for x20 series models, extending the IQ Routes feature to those devices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |title=(click on \"show detailed map information\") |publisher=Tomtom.com |accessdate=2010-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126181249/http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with a free software update using TomTom Home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.support.tomtom.com/cgi-bin/tomtom_uk.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=9552|title=TomTom FAQs \u2013 IQ Routes|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref>\n\nOn the NAV3 and NAV4 models the IQ Routes feature is available by default on all map versions.\n\n===Enhanced Positioning Technology===\nOffers continuous navigation, even when a navigation device can't receive GPS satellite signals (e.g. in tunnels or amongst high buildings) using [[Accelerometer|movement and gravity sensors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.tomtom.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=318538|title=TomTom introduces New High-End Model: TomTom GO 920 (AMS:TOMTOM)|website=corporate.tomtom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref>\n\n===Mapping===\nTomTom products use [[Tele Atlas]] based maps. Map errors are reported using the Tele Atlas Map Insight and the TomTom Map Share Reporter Tool (preferred tool). Reports can be done via the devices too. These reports are processed and approved/rejected by TomTom staff members and the end products are synchronized via the TomTom support applications, such as TomTom Home for the NAV2 devices and MyDrive Connect for the NAV3 and NAV4 devices. These support applications are available for Windows or Mac OS X based computers.\n\nMaps are not universally compatible across TomTom devices; while most maps are available for most modern devices, a compatible version must be used. Version numbers have a three-digit number identifying the major version, a dot, then a four-digit build number. Major version v940, for example, is available for most regions and most devices, but different builds are available for different regions and devices and supporting different features. The support applications ensure that the correct map version is assigned for download. For NAV2 devices one has to purchase the map via the TomTom Home support application and for NAV3 and NAV4 devices, one has to obtain the updates via the TomTom webshop.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn April 2011, TomTom \"apologized for supplying driving data collected from customers to police to use in catching speeding motorists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/27/tomtom_customer_data_flap/|title=TomTom Sorry for Giving Customer Driving Data to Cops|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=The Register}}</ref> The company had collected data from its Dutch customers which Dutch police subsequently used to set targeted speed traps.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|title=TomTom Admits Police Used Data for Speed Traps|first=Toby|last=Sterling|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-10|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501003501/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|archivedate=2011-05-01}}</ref> As a result of this, TomTom was investigated by the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]], who found that TomTom had not contravened the {{ill|Dutch Data Protection Act|nl|Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens}}.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tomtom-idUSTRE80B0HN20120112</ref>\n\nIn 2011, TomTom improved the clarity of its explanation of how it uses the data it collects from its customers.<ref>http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/tomtom-cleared-in-dutch-data-privacy-investigation/</ref><ref>https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/news/following-report-dutch-dpa-tomtom-provides-user-better-information</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, the company announced that it was planning to sell aggregated customer information to the Australian [[Roads and Traffic Authority]], which could also potentially be used for targeted speed enforcement.<ref name=outrage>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/cartech/outrage-over-tomtom-speed-traps-for-motorists-20110506-1ebc2.html|title=Outrage Over TomTom Speed Traps for Motorists|first=Asher|last=Moses|date=2011-05-06|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\nThe privacy implications of this announcement were widely reported, particularly the lack of anonymity and the potential to associate the data with individuals. The company's practice of selling its user data has been criticised by [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]]. David Vaile of the University of New South Wales' Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre has called for an independent technical analysis of the company's data collection practices. TomTom navigation devices collect user data that includes point of origin, point of destination, journey times, speeds and routes taken. The [[Australian Privacy Foundation]] said it would be easy to trace the data back to individual customers, even if TomTom claimed it used only aggregated, anonymous data.<ref name=outrage /><ref name=peeping>{{cite web|url= http://www.afr.com/technology/peeping-tomtom-sells-your-every-move-20110505-ietht|title=Peeping TomTom sells your every move|publisher=Australian Financial Review|date=6 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nTomTom VP of Marketing Chris Kearney insisted the information was totally anonymous. In addition to this, he said TomTom never sold the information to Dutch authorities with speed cameras in mind, although Kearney would not rule out selling the user data for similar use in Australia.<ref name=peeping/>\n\nSuch data is being purchased from various mapping companies by governments on a fairly regular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/waze-unveils-government-data-exchange-program/|title=Waze Unveils Government Data Exchange Program|first=Charlie|last=Osborne|date=2014-10-02|accessdate=2015-12-07|publisher=[[ZDnet]]}}</ref> It is not known if governments use this data for purposes other than the placement of speed cameras, such as to improve the road network, introduce traffic lights or find accident hotspots.\n\n==Competition==\nTomTom's main retail car [[Satellite navigation|sat nav]] competitor is [[Garmin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halfords.com/technology/sat-nav/car-sat-nav|title=eg.

It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls (on NAV2 and NAV3 models, but only on certain NAV4 models).The TomTom Go models belong either to the NAV2, NAV3 or NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom Camper & Caravan / RV''' \u2013 an all-in-one GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls. In Europe, the Camper model is based on the TomTom Go&nbsp;1005, in North America the RV models are based on the NAV3 Start 60 model. The TomTom Camper & Caravan and RV models belong to the NAV3 range and their biggest difference compared to other NAV3 models is the map that is supplied with, which allows certain size and weight data to be entered and being considered in the route planning. Technically any NAV3 device can be made to a Camper/RV editing by purchasing the camper map from the TomTom webshop.\n* '''TomTom Truck''' \u2013 designed for professional truck drivers and include truck-specific software and maps. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls (on NAV3 models).The TomTom Pro/Truck models belong either to the NAV3 or NAV4 ranges. A few years ago truck maps were available to NAV2 models too.\n* '''TomTom Via''' \u2013 middle class GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]]. Most models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. This allows it to make and receive calls. All the TomTom Via models belong to the NAV3 range.\n* '''TomTom Start''' \u2013 an entry-level GPS navigation device. It has a [[touch screen]], speaker, [[USB]] port, internal [[Lithium ion battery]], but usually a lower HW specification, compared to the Via and Go models. Some models have Bluetooth transceivers that allow connection to a [[smartphone]]. The TomTom Start models belong either to the NAV2, NAV3 or NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom One and One XL''' \u2013 The TomTom One is the base model for [[automotive navigation system|automobile navigation]]. The difference between the TomTom One XL and the TomTom One is the size of the touch screen (4.3 vs 3.5&nbsp;in or 110 vs 89&nbsp;mm).  Neither model of the One contains the added functions included in the Go models, such as Bluetooth hands-free calling and MP3 Jukebox.  However, the One is able to receive traffic and weather updates using the TomTom Plus service when paired via Bluetooth with a mobile phone with a DUN data service.  The reduced software capability means less demand on the hardware, which allows the One to be sold at a significantly lower price than the Go. The ''XL'' is also available as a ''Live'' version with integrated Live Services.\n* '''TomTom Rider''' \u2013 Portable water-resistant models for [[motorcycle]] and [[motorscooter]] users. They differ from other devices in that the Rider is partly shielded and has a 'glove-friendly' screen and GUI. There are many different models in the NAV2 and NAV4 ranges.\n* '''TomTom Navigator''' \u2013 a GPS navigation software product for [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[Palm (device)|Palm]] devices, [[Pocket PC]]s, and some smartphones. TomTom Navigator 6 replaced the earlier TomTom Mobile 5.2. It can use GPS receivers built into the device or external (e.g., Bluetooth-connected) receivers. Navigator 7 was the latest release of this software, released as a part of the software that came with the June 2008 HTC Touch Diamond. Frequently used functions can be added to the main screen of the program, and users can report map corrections and share them with other users. Navigator supports touch screens; devices without touch screens use a cursor to input data.  The software is available on SD card and DVD. It runs on a number of devices listed on the TomTom website, but will run successfully on many unlisted devices using the [[Windows Mobile]] [[operating system]], discontinued in 2010. The DVD version includes a DVD, printed 15-character product code, Quick Start Guide, Licensing Agreement, a poster with a picture diagram for setup procedure of DVD version and SD card version, and an advertisement for associated TomTom Plus services.  The DVD contains installation software for [[TomTom Home]], software for mobile devices, licenses, manuals, maps, and voices.

Also most likely there will be a new iOS app available, based on the NavKit, which might cure the issue with the size limit (also Apple increased the app size limit to 4GB).\n*'''TomTom Go Mobile''', GPS navigation software for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. It replaced the old app, which had similar features to the iOS app. In March 2015, TomTom announced the new TomTom GO Mobile app for Android with a freemium subscription model for maps with the first 50 miles/75 kilometres per month being free, including all the maps that are available, TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. The previous app, which had promised \"free lifetime updates\", is not available for purchase on [[Play Store]] anymore and its maps are not updated since October 2015. TomTom claims their definition of lifetime map updates is \"the period of time that TomTom continues to support the app with updates\". Previous customers of TomTom's Android navigation app are offered a discount on the subscription in the new app for three years. There is no provision for users who want to keep using the old app under the conditions it was sold with lifetime map updates.\n*'''TomTom Speed Cameras''', a mobile software application released in 2015 free of charge.<ref>https://recombu.com/cars/article/tomtom-speed-cameras-app-to-keep-you-on-the-right-side-of-the-law</ref>\n\nNavigation software for several mobile phones discontinued after release 5.2; Navigator, which does not support all the phones that Mobile did, is the nearest equivalent. Mobile 5.2 cannot use maps later than v6.60 build 1223; this and earlier program versions are not compatible with all map versions, particularly other builds of version 6.\n\nIn September 2012, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] collaborated with TomTom to provide mapping data for its revamped iOS 6 updated [[Apple Maps]] app.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/tomtom-confirmed-as-official-partner-for-ios-6-maps-1084678|title=TomTom confirmed as official partner for iOS 6 Maps|work=TechRadar|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}</ref> The partnership was in part due to Apple's decision to wean itself off the products of its competitor, [[Google]]. As of 2018 TomTom continues to provide data for Apple Maps.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-tomtom/apple-rebuilds-mapping-app-but-will-still-tap-tomtom-idUSKBN1JP32S</ref>\n\n==TomTom Home and MyDrive Connect==\nTomTom Home (stylized as TomTom HOME) is a 32-bit PC application that allows synchronization/updates to be sent to the mobile device. The container states that it is compatible with Mac OS X v10.3 or greater and Windows ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 (see above reference). After installation, it has options to choose a device to be associated to and activate the software.  A caution is given that the software only allows one device to be associated to an email address and the associated device can be changed only after 14 days since the previous association. TomTom Home version 2.0 and above is implemented on the [[XULRunner]] platform. With version 2.2, TomTom Home added a content-sharing platform where users can download and upload content to personalize their device such as voices, start-up images, [[Point of Interest|POI]] sets, etc. At the moment TomTom Home is on version 2.9.\n\nDespite being based on the cross-platform XULRunner, TomTom Home lacks support for Linux (and most probably it won't ever support, as the NAV2 devices are mostly legacy models by now).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/home|title=TomTom HOME software downloads page|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724234645/http://www.tomtom.com/home/|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is, for instance, impossible to update the maps in these devices by connecting them to another machine running Linux, even when using a common web browser like Firefox that normally allowed such an update under Microsoft Windows. \nHowever, the devices can still be read in a Linux OS as a disk drive. There is even software made by the community to manage some functions of\nthe TomTom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pytomtom.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=En:Main_Page|title=pyTOMTOM}}</ref>\n\nThe NAV3 and NAV4 range of models use MyDrive Connect. MyDrive Connect is compatible with 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 preview and with most Mac OS X versions. The internal flash memory or the memory card content of the device cannot be accessed through USB for security reasons (modified applications would easily accept a map that wasn't sold by TomTom). The device can update itself by getting files through the HTTP protocol over USB. The support app is nothing more than a proxy on the PC buffering the download. So far the security achieved using this mechanism has not been broken yet. Also, the usage of the non-FAT/FAT32 file system brought stability improvements in device operations. On the downside, some users might experience compatibility issues between their PC, device and the MyDrive Connect support application. For those issues, TomTom Customer Services or members of the community forum are usually able to provide solutions.\n\n==TomTom built-in navigation==\nTomTom partners with several car manufacturers and offers built-in navigation solutions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Currently, the fees are only for European countries.\n\nTraffic data is also available to subscribers in many parts of Europe and the US via a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled cell phone with Internet service or an add-on aerial, which picks up [[Traffic Message Channel|RDS]] data (broadcast on [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio frequencies) offering traffic information without the requirement for a data connection.  The TomTom Plus service is not compatible with Apple's [[iPhone]].\n\n===TomTom Live Services===\nIn October 2008 the company released Live Services on the Go 940 Live. These allowed users to receive updates over the mobile telephone network using the SIM card in the device. These services included HD Traffic, Safety Alerts, Local Search with Google and Fuel Prices.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, TomTom announced that it was offering up its real-time traffic products to \"industry partners\" in the United States.<ref>Don Reisinger, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20062210-17.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 TomTom offering real-time traffic data to partners].\" 12 May 2011. Retrieved 12 May 2011.</ref>\n\nOn the latest NAV4 devices the service is not available anymore in the old form. The included services had been separated and now being called TomTom Traffic and Speed Cameras. On the x0/x00/x000 devices the traffic service is free of charge either via the built-in SIM (Always Connected models) or via a compatible smartphone (Smartphone Connected or BYOD \u2013 Bring Your Own Device). The speed camera service is free for three months on these models. However, there is a newer range, the x10/x100 models, which come now with free lifetime speed camera subscription too.\n\n===Map Share===\nMap Share is a proprietary map technology launched by TomTom in June 2007.  Map Share allows users to make changes to the maps on their navigation devices and share them with others. It allows drivers to make changes to their maps directly on their navigation devices. Drivers can block or unblock streets, change the direction of traffic, edit street names and add, edit or remove points of interest (POIs). Improvements can be shared with other users through TomTom HOME, TomTom's content management software.\n\nAn online version called Map Share Reporter is on the TomTom website.\n\n===TomTom Traffic (previously HD Traffic)===\nA traffic monitoring service that uses multiple sources to provide traffic information. The service does this by combining data from:\n* traditional sources: governmental/third-party data such as induction loops in the roads, cameras and traffic surveillance\n* new sources: traffic flow of millions of anonymous mobile phone users<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomtom.com/services/service.php?id=2&tab=4|title=TomTom HD Traffic \u2013 How it works}}</ref>\n\nThe information is merged by TomTom and algorithms are used to improve the data and filter out anomalous readings. The system sends updates to all TomTom Traffic users every two minutes (and the data the users receive is never older than 30 seconds). Users can receive the service through the built-in SIM, via a smartphone connection or on older devices via a standard phone connection. Re-routing can be set to be transparent to the user with the only sign that the route has been changed due to a traffic jam being a sound indication from the device and a changed {{abbr|ETA|estimated time of arrival}}.\n\nThe system was first launched in the Netherlands in 2007 and expanded to the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Switzerland in 2008. By mid-2011, TomTom Live services including TomTom Traffic are available in the United States, South Africa, New Zealand and the following seventeen European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. {{Asof|2015}}, the service is vastly expanded and current coverage is available on the TomTom Traffic site (34 countries {{asof|2015|06|26|lc=on}} and the list expands every few months to new regions).\n\n'''TomTom Traffic improvements'''\n*''HD Traffic 6.0'' (August 2012): More accurate location of traffic jams, improved coverage of automatically detected road closures\n*''TomTom Traffic 7.0'' (September 2013): Increased accuracy of jam location now allows for 'Jam Ahead Warnings', warning drivers when approaching a jam-tail too fast. Improved coverage of automatic road closure detection started to include also major secondary roads. Automatic road works detection on highways. TomTom also added 'Predictive Flow Feed' for better predicting approaching traffic delays, with the goal of improving optimal route calculation and ETA.\n*''TomTom Traffic 8.0'' (November 2014): TomTom included real-time weather information in their routing algorithms, and warns users in areas of bad weather. Also, version 8.0 now incorporates in their real-time traffic information road closures that are reported via the online Map Share Reporter tool.\n\n===IQ Routes===\nIQ Routes, developed by TomTom and available since spring 2008 on the TomTom Go 730 and Go 930, uses anonymous travel time data accumulated by users of TomTom satnav devices. Newer TomTom devices use this data to take into account the time and day when determining the fastest route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloginfomanage.blogspot.com/2008/01/tomtom-collecting-data-from-gps-systems.html|title=Information Management: TomTom collecting data from GPS Systems}}</ref>\n\nTravel time data is stored in Historical Speed Profiles, one for each road segment, covering large motorways, main roads and also small local roads. Historic Speed Profiles are part of the digital map and are updated with every new map release. They give insight into real-world traffic patterns. This is a fact-based routing system based on measured travel times, compared to most other methods which use speed limits or \u2018assumed\u2019 speeds.\n\nIn September 2008, map upgrade v8.10 was released for x20 series models, extending the IQ Routes feature to those devices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |title=(click on \"show detailed map information\") |publisher=Tomtom.com |accessdate=2010-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126181249/http://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/select.php?D=1005&Language=1&P=4476 |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with a free software update using TomTom Home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.support.tomtom.com/cgi-bin/tomtom_uk.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=9552|title=TomTom FAQs \u2013 IQ Routes|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref>\n\nOn the NAV3 and NAV4 models the IQ Routes feature is available by default on all map versions.\n\n===Enhanced Positioning Technology===\nOffers continuous navigation, even when a navigation device can't receive GPS satellite signals (e.g. in tunnels or amongst high buildings) using [[Accelerometer|movement and gravity sensors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.tomtom.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=318538|title=TomTom introduces New High-End Model: TomTom GO 920 (AMS:TOMTOM)|website=corporate.tomtom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref>\n\n===Mapping===\nTomTom products use [[Tele Atlas]] based maps. Map errors are reported using the Tele Atlas Map Insight and the TomTom Map Share Reporter Tool (preferred tool). Reports can be done via the devices too. These reports are processed and approved/rejected by TomTom staff members and the end products are synchronized via the TomTom support applications, such as TomTom Home for the NAV2 devices and MyDrive Connect for the NAV3 and NAV4 devices. These support applications are available for Windows or Mac OS X based computers.\n\nMaps are not universally compatible across TomTom devices; while most maps are available for most modern devices, a compatible version must be used. Version numbers have a three-digit number identifying the major version, a dot, then a four-digit build number. Major version v940, for example, is available for most regions and most devices, but different builds are available for different regions and devices and supporting different features. The support applications ensure that the correct map version is assigned for download. For NAV2 devices one has to purchase the map via the TomTom Home support application and for NAV3 and NAV4 devices, one has to obtain the updates via the TomTom webshop.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn April 2011, TomTom \"apologized for supplying driving data collected from customers to police to use in catching speeding motorists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/27/tomtom_customer_data_flap/|title=TomTom Sorry for Giving Customer Driving Data to Cops|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=The Register}}</ref> The company had collected data from its Dutch customers which Dutch police subsequently used to set targeted speed traps.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|title=TomTom Admits Police Used Data for Speed Traps|first=Toby|last=Sterling|date=2011-04-27|accessdate=2011-05-10|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501003501/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/27/business-telecommunications-equipment-eu-netherlands-earns-tomtom_8438128.html|archivedate=2011-05-01}}</ref> As a result of this, TomTom was investigated by the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]], who found that TomTom had not contravened the {{ill|Dutch Data Protection Act|nl|Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens}}.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tomtom-idUSTRE80B0HN20120112</ref>\n\nIn 2011, TomTom improved the clarity of its explanation of how it uses the data it collects from its customers.<ref>http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/tomtom-cleared-in-dutch-data-privacy-investigation/</ref><ref>https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/news/following-report-dutch-dpa-tomtom-provides-user-better-information</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, the company announced that it was planning to sell aggregated customer information to the Australian [[Roads and Traffic Authority]], which could also potentially be used for targeted speed enforcement.<ref name=outrage>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/cartech/outrage-over-tomtom-speed-traps-for-motorists-20110506-1ebc2.html|title=Outrage Over TomTom Speed Traps for Motorists|first=Asher|last=Moses|date=2011-05-06|accessdate=2011-05-07|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\n\nThe privacy implications of this announcement were widely reported, particularly the lack of anonymity and the potential to associate the data with individuals. The company's practice of selling its user data has been criticised by [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]]. David Vaile of the University of New South Wales' Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre has called for an independent technical analysis of the company's data collection practices. TomTom navigation devices collect user data that includes point of origin, point of destination, journey times, speeds and routes taken. The [[Australian Privacy Foundation]] said it would be easy to trace the data back to individual customers, even if TomTom claimed it used only aggregated, anonymous data.<ref name=outrage /><ref name=peeping>{{cite web|url= http://www.afr.com/technology/peeping-tomtom-sells-your-every-move-20110505-ietht|title=Peeping TomTom sells your every move|publisher=Australian Financial Review|date=6 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nTomTom VP of Marketing Chris Kearney insisted the information was totally anonymous. In addition to this, he said TomTom never sold the information to Dutch authorities with speed cameras in mind, although Kearney would not rule out selling the user data for similar use in Australia.<ref name=peeping/>\n\nSuch data is being purchased from various mapping companies by governments on a fairly regular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/waze-unveils-government-data-exchange-program/|title=Waze Unveils Government Data Exchange Program|first=Charlie|last=Osborne|date=2014-10-02|accessdate=2015-12-07|publisher=[[ZDnet]]}}</ref> It is not known if governments use this data for purposes other than the placement of speed cameras, such as to improve the road network, introduce traffic lights or find accident hotspots.\n\n==Competition==\nTomTom's main retail car [[Satellite navigation|sat nav]] competitor is [[Garmin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halfords.com/technology/sat-nav/car-sat-nav|title=eg.
