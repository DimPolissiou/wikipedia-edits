And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty.

According to the requirements of Beijing's overall planning, the height of the NCPA cannot exceed the height of the [[Great Hall of the People]](46 meters), but the functional requirements of the NCPA can not be load in the 46-meter space, so it can only develop underground. The underground depth of the NCPA is as tall as ten stories high, and 60% of the building area is underground. It is the most in-depth underground project of public buildings in Beijing. The deepest place is 32.5 meters, which is directly below the stage of the Opera hall. The 17 meters underground of the NCPA is the ancient river channel of the [[Yongding River]] in Beijing. The underground of the NCPA contains abundant [[groundwater]]. The [[buoyancy]] generated by this groundwater can support a giant aircraft carrier weighing 1 million tons. Such tremendous buoyancy is enough to hold up the entire theater. The traditional solution is to pump groundwater out continuously, but the result of pumping groundwater is that a 5-km-wide \"groundwater funnel\" will be formed underground near the theatre area, causing settlement of surrounding grounds, and even ground buildings may appear crack. To solve this problem, engineers and technicians have conducted a detailed investigation and used concrete to pour an underground wall from the highest water level of the groundwater to the 60-meter underground clay layer. This vast \"bucket\" formed by subterranean concrete walls can enclose the foundation of the NCPA. The water pump draws the water out of the \"bucket\" so that no matter how the water pumped in the foundation, the groundwater outside the \"bucket\" will not be affected, and the surrounding buildings will be safe.\n\nThe 6,750-ton steel beam frame made the largest dome. The structure of the NCPA is composed of a single curved steel beam. More than 18,000 pieces of titanium metal plate and more than 1,200 pieces of ultra-white transparent glass form a massive shell of 36,000 square meters. The world's largest dome is not supported by a pillar.

Therefore, at least 80 percent of the annual operational costs must be subsidized by the government for at least the first three years after the opening, and for the rest of its operational life, at least 60 percent of the annual operational cost must be subsidized by the government.\n\nThe director of the art committee of the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the standing committee member of the Standing Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], Mr Wu Zuqiang (\u5434\u7956\u5f3a) and the publicist / deputy director of the National Centre for the Performing Arts Mr Deng (\u9093\u4e00\u6c5f) have announced that 70 percent of the tickets would be sold at low price for ordinary citizens, while 10% of the tickets would be sold at relatively expensive prices for separate market segments, and the 60% of annual operating cost needed to be subsidized by the government would be divided between the central government and the [[Beijing]] municipal government.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:National Grand Theatre detail.jpg|Building detail: transition from glass to titanium.\nImage: Inside Beijing National Grand Theater.jpg|Inside the theater\nImage:DecorationBeijingNationalTheater.jpg|Inside decoration\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of concert halls]]\n*[[China National Center for the Performing Arts Orchestra]]\n*[[China National Opera]], the performing company\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.chncpa.org}}\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/sep/25/internationalnews2?picture=330811351 Slideshow] from the [[Guardian Unlimited]]\n* [http://www.constructalia.com/en_EN/gallery/galeria_detalle.jsp?idProyec=3003992 National Grand Theater of China: a steel architecture case study on Constructalia]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728053324/http://www.specifier.com.au/pastissues/32842/Left-of-the-Forbidden-City.html Robbie Moore, \"Left of the Forbidden City\", ''Specifier Magazine'' online, date unk.] Profile of the Centre retrieved 11 May 2008\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091005115327/http://turcanu.net/blog/2008/07/24/national-grand-theater-of-china-beijing/ National Grand Theater of China, Beijing]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120212125353/http://www.paul-andreu.com/pages/projets_recents_operapek_g.html \"National Grand Theater of China, Beijing\" at website of Paul Andreu]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100127025744/http://www.dorot.com/index.php?page_id=1158 The water control valves in National Grand Theater of China]\n{{coord|39|54|12|N|116|23|1|E|region:CN_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Xicheng District}}\n{{Buildings and Structures in Beijing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:National Centre For The Performing Arts (China)}}\n[[Category:Concert halls in China]]\n[[Category:Music venues completed in 2007]]\n[[Category:Theatres completed in 2007]]\n[[Category:High-tech architecture]]\n[[Category:Lattice shell structures]]\n[[Category:Opera houses in China]]\n[[Category:Performing arts venues in Beijing]]\n[[Category:Postmodern architecture in China]]\n[[Category:Theatres in Beijing]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts_(China)"}

He stated that a Military Intelligence officer in civilian clothes frequently delivered cash payments of typically {{currency|20000|EGP}} to the campaign office, and later on cheques, including one from the [[National Bank of Egypt]] for {{currency|150000|EGP}}. For each street march, {{currency|15000|EGP}} to {{currency|20000|EGP}} would be delivered, and young men organised by government agencies would be paid {{currency|100|EGP}} each to participate in the marches.<ref name=\"MasaMadr_GIS_2014_election\" /> Instead of being run by volunteers, the campaign office was staffed by civil servants. Campaigning for signatures for Sisi's presidential candidacy by Nation's Future Party included payments of {{currency|50|EGP}} to each person signing.<ref name=\"MasaMadr_GIS_2014_election\" /> Party leader [[Mohamed Badran]] took his instructions, according to the interviewee, from Major [[Ahmed Shaaban (Egyptian intelligence)|Ahmed Shaaban]] of Military Intelligence.<ref name=\"MasaMadr_GIS_2014_election\" />\n\nThe party attracted Egyptian youths who wanted to bring change to the political atmosphere from traditional policies of seniority according to age.

Throughout his time in PCW, he faced notable opponents including [[Paul London]], Jeromy Sage, and [[Ahmed Johnson]] and early in his tenure, he created a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] called \"The Dark Circle\".<ref name=\"wojickinterview\"/> Hoyt later left PCW upon signing with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) before later making his returned to the promotion in 2006 under his real name, while using his former Shadow ring name simply as a nickname. Soon after his return to PCW, Hoyt proceeded to win the Tag Team Championship with Wally Darkmon in 2006. Beginning in 2008, Hoyt reverted to his Shadow ring name and gimmick, while also adopting a [[Wrestling mask|mask]]. This was short-lived, however, as Hoyt unmasked and suddenly began using his [[The Rock 'n Rave Infection|Rock 'n Rave Infection]] gimmick from TNA a few months later. Following his release from TNA, PCW announced they had released Hoyt from his contract, which turned out to be a [[Kayfabe|storyline]], leading to Hoyt revealing he had a PCW \"legends contract\".

In TNA, he wrestled first as '''Dallas''', winning the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] twice with [[Kid Kash]]. After Diamond Dallas Page signed with TNA, he changed his name to Lance Hoyt and formed a rock band themed tag team with Jimmy Rave and Christy Hemme, the Rock N Rave Infection. After Hoyt left TNA, he signed with WWE, where he worked until 2010 as Vance Archer.<ref name=\"Going to WWE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifight365.com/2009/04/former-tna-star-heading-to-wwe/|title=Former TNA star heading to WWE|date=2009-04-27|last=Lowe|first=Phil|accessdate=2009-04-27|publisher=iFight365.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430131410/http://www.ifight365.com/2009/04/former-tna-star-heading-to-wwe/|archive-date=2009-04-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> After he left WWE, he signed a contract with Japanese promotion [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], where he works as Lance Archer. During his first years, he joined Minoru Suzuki's [[Suzuki-Gun]], winning the G1 Tag League 2011 with Suzuki. When [[Davey Boy Smith Jr.]] came to NJPW, they were paired as [[Killer Elite Squad]], winning between 2014 and 2019 the IWGP Tag Team Championship twice, NWA World Tag Team Championship twice and NOAH'S GHC Tag Team Championship twice.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> When Smith left the promotion in 2019, Archer became a singles wrestler, capturing the [[IWGP United States Championship]]. On February 26th, 2020, it was announced that Archer had signed to All Elite Wrestling.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n=== Independent circuit (2000\u20132009)===\nIn 2000, Hoyt began training as a wrestler under Solo Fiatala,<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> and debuted in July 2000, facing Tarzan Taylor in his first match. He spent the next four years working on the Texas [[independent circuit]], using the [[ring name]]s Lance Steel and Breakdown, the latter being a character created in the spur-of-the-moment by Hoyt in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] when he had forgotten his usual ring attire and was forced to wrestle in his street clothing.<ref name=\"wojickinterview\"/> Hoyt's most notable tenure within the Texas independent circuit was in Professional Championship Wrestling (PCW), where he debuted in 2000 as Shadow, a dark [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]]. Throughout his time in PCW, he faced notable opponents including [[Paul London]], Jeromy Sage, and [[Ahmed Johnson]] and early in his tenure, he created a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] called \"The Dark Circle\".<ref name=\"wojickinterview\"/> Hoyt later left PCW upon signing with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) before later making his returned to the promotion in 2006 under his real name, while using his former Shadow ring name simply as a nickname. Soon after his return to PCW, Hoyt proceeded to win the Tag Team Championship with Wally Darkmon in 2006. Beginning in 2008, Hoyt reverted to his Shadow ring name and gimmick, while also adopting a [[Wrestling mask|mask]]. This was short-lived, however, as Hoyt unmasked and suddenly began using his [[The Rock 'n Rave Infection|Rock 'n Rave Infection]] gimmick from TNA a few months later. Following his release from TNA, PCW announced they had released Hoyt from his contract, which turned out to be a [[Kayfabe|storyline]], leading to Hoyt revealing he had a PCW \"legends contract\". Hoyt would go on to briefly become the commissioner of PCW before it was announced that he had signed a contract with [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]].\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===\n====Debut and singles competition (2004\u20132007)====\nHoyt was hired by [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) in March 2004 and immediately teamed up with X Division mainstay [[Kid Kash]] as Dallas, Kash's bodyguard, tag team partner and [[kayfabe|on-screen]] relative.<ref name=\"wojickinterview\"/> He and Kash took part in a tournament for the vacant [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] and won the vacant titles by defeating [[Low Ki]] and [[Christopher Daniels]] in the finals on April 7.<ref name=\"Slam story\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/06/03/484623.html|title='Dallas' is again a Friday TV fixture; Texas wrestler is part of TNA's Impact|date=2004-06-03|last=Johnson|first=Steven|accessdate=2009-02-26|publisher=SLAM!

He was an officer in the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] army during the [[English Civil War]] and an active supporter of the republican cause during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]].\n\n==Life==\nFiennes was the second son of [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele]], by Elizabeth, daughter of John Temple, of [[Stowe House|Stowe in Buckinghamshire]]. He was born in 1607 or 1608, and educated at [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and at [[New College, Oxford]], where, as [[founder's kin]], he was admitted a perpetual fellow in 1624.<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=328}}</ref>\n\nAfter about five years residence he left Oxford without taking a degree, travelled abroad, and in [[Switzerland]] strengthened his hostility to the [[William Laud|Laudian church]] which would be the chief motive in his future political career. He returned to Scotland in 1639, and established communications with the [[Covenanter]]s and the Opposition in England. As Member of Parliament for [[Banbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Banbury]] in both the [[Short Parliament|Short]] and [[Long Parliament|Long]] Parliaments he took a prominent part in the attacks upon the church.<ref name=EB/>\n\nHe spoke against the illegal canons{{Clarification needed|reason=Language assumes prior knowledge|date=December 2018}} on 14 December 1640, and again on 9 February 1641 on the occasion of the reception of the London petition, when he argued against episcopacy as constituting a political as well as a religious danger and made an impression on the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], his name being added immediately to the committee appointed to deal with church affairs.<ref name=EB/>\n\nHe took a leading part in the examination into the army plot; was one of the commissioners appointed to attend the king to Scotland in August 1641; and was nominated one of the committee of safety{{Clarification needed|reason=Assumes prior knowledge|date=December 2018}} in July 1642. On the [[English Civil War|outbreak of hostilities]] he took arms immediately, commanded a troop of horse in the army of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Lord Essex]], was present at the relief of Coventry in August, and at the fight at [[Battle of Powick Bridge|Powick Bridge]], Worcester in September, where he distinguished himself, and subsequently at [[battle of Edgehill|Edgehill]]. Of the last two engagements he wrote accounts, viz. ''True and Exact Relation of both the Battles fought by ... Earl of Essex against the Bloudy Cavaliers'' (1642). (See also ''A Narrative of the Late Battle before Worcester taken by a Gentleman of the Inns of Court from the mouth of Master Fiennes'', 1642).<ref name=EB/>\n\nIn February 1643, Fiennes was sent down to [[Bristol]],{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911|pp=84\u20135}} arrested Colonel [[Thomas Essex]] the governor, executed the two leaders of a plot ([[Robert Yeamans]] and [[George Bouchier]]) to deliver up the city, and received a commission himself as governor on 1 May 1643. On the arrival, however, of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] on 22 July, although the place was in no condition to resist an attack, Fiennes held out until Rupert's troops had forced an entry into the City and further resistance was both hopeless and a waste of life. He addressed to Essex a letter in his defence (''Thomason Tracts'' E. 65, 26), drew up for the parliament a ''Relation concerning the Surrender ...'' (1643), answered by [[William Prynne]] and [[Clement Walker]] accusing him of treachery and cowardice, to which he opposed Col. Fiennes his ''Reply''{{Clarification needed|reason=Vague language|date=December 2018}} ''...''.<ref name=EB/>\n\nHe was tried at [[St Albans]] by the council of war in December, was pronounced guilty of having surrendered the place improperly, and sentenced to death. He was, however, pardoned,{{sfn|Salmon|1730|p=794}} and the facility with which Bristol subsequently capitulated to the parliamentary army induced Cromwell and the generals to exonerate him completely. His military career nevertheless came to an end. He went abroad, and it was some time before he reappeared on the political scene.<ref name=EB/>\n\nThere has been debate over the legitimacy of the indictments brought against him by Walker and Prynne. Both had lost considerable amounts of money and property in the fall of Bristol and both were politically opposed to Fiennes and his family.

He was, however, in favour of accepting the King's terms at Newport in December, and in consequence was excluded from the House by [[Pride's Purge]]. An opponent of church government in any form, he was opposed to the [[Presbyterianism]] of the day, and inclined to Independency and Cromwell's party. He was a member of the council of state in 1654, and in June 1655 he received the appointment of commissioner for the custody of the great seal, for which he was poorly suited.<ref name=EB/>\n\nIn the [[First Protectorate Parliament]] of 1654 he was returned for [[Oxfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxfordshire]] and in the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] of 1656 for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]]. In January 1658 he was included in Cromwell's [[Cromwell's Upper House|House of Lords]]. He was in favour of the Protector's assumption of the royal title and urged his acceptance of it on several occasions. His public career closes with addresses delivered in his capacity as chief commissioner of the great seal at the beginning of the sessions of 20 January 1658, and 2 January 1659, in which the religious basis of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s government is especially insisted upon, the feature to which Fiennes throughout his career had attached most value.<ref name=EB/> He lived at [[List of private residents of Covent Garden|No. 1 Great Piazza, Covent Garden]] from 1657 to 1659.\n\nOn the reassembling of the Long Parliament he was superseded; he took no part in the Restoration, and died at Newton Tony in Wiltshire on 16 December 1669.<ref name=EB/>\n\n==Family==\nFiennes married:\n#on 11 August 1636 at [[Haynes, Bedfordshire]], to '''Elizabeth Eliot''' (born 1616), daughter of the parliamentarian [[John Eliot (statesman)|Sir John Eliot]],<ref name=EB/> by whom he had four children, including two sons, William and Nathaniel, who reached maturity\n#about 1650 at [[Broughton Castle]], to '''Frances Whitehead''', daughter of Richard Whitehead of Tuderley, Hants,<ref name=EB/> by whom he had four daughters, Anne, Frances, Mary and [[Celia Fiennes|Celia]].\n\nHis son William succeeded to the title [[Viscount Saye and Sele|3rd Viscount Saye and Sele]] on the death of Fiennes' brother [[James Fiennes, 2nd Viscount Saye and Sele|James]].\n\nHis younger son Nathaniel was elected (for Banbury) to the [[Third Protectorate Parliament]].<ref>{{cite book|author-last=Beesley |author-first=Alfred |title=The History of Banbury |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofbanbury00bees |publisher=Nicholls and Son |place=London |date=1841 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofbanbury00bees/page/450 450]}}</ref> He married Elizabeth Williams in Lincolnshire in 1671, but is believed to have died shortly after.<ref>https://archive.org/details/londonmarriageli00fost/page/n637</ref>\n\n==Works==\nBesides the pamphlets already cited, a number of his speeches and other political tracts were published (see ''Gen.

The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n!

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ...

Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>.

He was the first member of the Air Force to serve as Chairman. Twining was a distinguished \"mustang\" officer, rising from private to four-star general and appointment to the highest post in the United States Armed Forces in the course of his 45-year career.\n\n==Early life and military career==\nNathan Twining came from a military background; his forebears had served in the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] since the [[French and Indian War]].

He served in the [[Oregon National Guard]] from 1915 to 1917.<ref name=lo/> In 1917, he received an appointment to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Because the program was shortened so as to produce more officers for combat, he spent only two years at the academy and graduated just a few days too late for service in [[World War I]].<ref name=twining>{{cite web|title=Gen.

Over the next 15 years he flew fighter aircraft in [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Hawaii]], while also attending the Air Corps Tactical School and the [[Command and General Staff College]]. When [[World War II]] broke out in Europe he was assigned to the operations division on the Air Staff; then in 1942 he was sent to the [[South Pacific Area|South Pacific]] where he became chief of staff of the Allied air forces in that area.\n\nIn January 1943, he was promoted to [[major general]] and assumed command of the [[Thirteenth Air Force]], and that same November he traveled across the world to take over the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] from [[Jimmy Doolittle]]. On 1 February 1943, the U.S. Navy rescued Brig. Gen. Twining, the 13th Air Force Commander, and 14 others near the [[New Hebrides]]. They had ditched their plane on the way from Guadalcanal to Espiritu Santo and spent six days in life rafts.<ref name=\"af.mil\">{{cite web|title=History Milestones: Monday, January 01, 1940 \u2013 Saturday, December 31, 1949|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1940&sd=01/01/1940&ed=12/31/1949|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020162322/http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1940&sd=01%2F01%2F1940&ed=12%2F31%2F1949|archivedate=2012-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> When [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] surrendered, Arnold sent Twining back to the Pacific to command the [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s of the [[Twentieth Air Force]] in the last push against Japan, but he was there only a short time when the [[atom bomb|atomic strikes]] ended the war. On 20 October 1945, Twining led three B-29s in developing a new route from Guam to Washington via India and Germany. They completed the 13,167-mile-trip in 59 hours, 30 minutes.<ref name=\"af.mil\"/> He returned to the States where he was named commander of the [[Air Materiel Command]], and in 1947 he took over [[Alaskan Air Command]].\n\nOn September 23, 1947, Lieutenant General Twining issued a memo to Brigadier General George Schulgen of the Army Air Forces. The subject line of the memo read \u201cAMC Opinion Concerning 'Flying Discs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wojciechowski|first=Eric|date=March\u2013April 2020|title=General Nathan F.

Twining wrote \u201cThe phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.\u201d \n\nAfter three years there Twining was set to retire as a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], but when [[Muir S.

He was shown by [[Zhukov]] at an air force base with Badger and Bison bombers flying overhead.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Kurt M. |title=The Soldiers' Summit |issue=75 |pages=76\u201391 |date=1989 |journal=Foreign Policy |edition=no.75 |jstor=1148865 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, [[Dwight D.

He was the first member of the Air Force to serve as Chairman. Twining was a distinguished \"mustang\" officer, rising from private to four-star general and appointment to the highest post in the United States Armed Forces in the course of his 45-year career.\n\n==Early life and military career==\nNathan Twining came from a military background; his forebears had served in the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] since the [[French and Indian War]].

He served in the [[Oregon National Guard]] from 1915 to 1917.<ref name=lo/> In 1917, he received an appointment to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Because the program was shortened so as to produce more officers for combat, he spent only two years at the academy and graduated just a few days too late for service in [[World War I]].<ref name=twining>{{cite web|title=Gen.

Over the next 15 years he flew fighter aircraft in [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Hawaii]], while also attending the Air Corps Tactical School and the [[Command and General Staff College]]. When [[World War II]] broke out in Europe he was assigned to the operations division on the Air Staff; then in 1942 he was sent to the [[South Pacific Area|South Pacific]] where he became chief of staff of the Allied air forces in that area.\n\nIn January 1943, he was promoted to [[major general]] and assumed command of the [[Thirteenth Air Force]], and that same November he traveled across the world to take over the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] from [[Jimmy Doolittle]]. On 1 February 1943, the U.S. Navy rescued Brig. Gen. Twining, the 13th Air Force Commander, and 14 others near the [[New Hebrides]]. They had ditched their plane on the way from Guadalcanal to Espiritu Santo and spent six days in life rafts.<ref name=\"af.mil\">{{cite web|title=History Milestones: Monday, January 01, 1940 \u2013 Saturday, December 31, 1949|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1940&sd=01/01/1940&ed=12/31/1949|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020162322/http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1940&sd=01%2F01%2F1940&ed=12%2F31%2F1949|archivedate=2012-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> When [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] surrendered, Arnold sent Twining back to the Pacific to command the [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s of the [[Twentieth Air Force]] in the last push against Japan, but he was there only a short time when the [[atom bomb|atomic strikes]] ended the war. On 20 October 1945, Twining led three B-29s in developing a new route from Guam to Washington via India and Germany. They completed the 13,167-mile-trip in 59 hours, 30 minutes.<ref name=\"af.mil\"/> He returned to the States where he was named commander of the [[Air Materiel Command]], and in 1947 he took over [[Alaskan Air Command]].\n\nOn September 23, 1947, Lieutenant General Twining issued a memo to Brigadier General George Schulgen of the Army Air Forces. The subject line of the memo read \u201cAMC Opinion Concerning 'Flying Discs<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wojciechowski|first=Eric|date=March\u2013April 2020|title=General Nathan F.

Twining wrote \u201cThe phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.\u201d \n\nAfter three years there Twining was set to retire as a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], but when [[Muir S. Fairchild|Muir Fairchild]], the [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], died unexpectedly of a heart attack, Twining was elevated to full general and named his successor.\n\nWhen General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] retired in mid-1953, Twining was selected as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]]; during his tenure, massive retaliation based on airpower became the national strategy.\n\nIn 1956, Twining was chosen by Eisenhower to head a delegation of senior officers to visit [[Soviet Union]], the first such exchange since World War II. He was shown by [[Zhukov]] at an air force base with Badger and Bison bombers flying overhead.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Kurt M. |title=The Soldiers' Summit |issue=75 |pages=76\u201391 |date=1989 |journal=Foreign Policy |edition=no.75 |jstor=1148865 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, [[Dwight D.
