Laodicea remained its capital for more than a century until the Arab conquest.\n\n==Bishops of Laodicea==\n\nThe same [[Saint Paul]] visited Laodicea and made the first Christians in the city. Slowly the bishops of Laodicea grew in importance but were always under the [[Patriarch of Antioch]]. The most important bishops were:\n\n* ''San'' [[Lucius of Cyrene]] \u2020\n* Telimidres \u2020 (in 250/260 AD)\n* Eliodorus \u2020\n* Socrates \u2020\n* Eusebius \u2020 (around 276 AD)\n* Anatolius \u2020 (in 280 AD)\n* Stefanus \u2020 (under [[Diocletianus]])\n** Teodotus \u2020 (325 - 335 AD) (bishop [[Arianism|arian]])\n** Giorgius \u2020 (335 - 363 AD) (bishop [[Arianism|arian]])\n* ''San'' Pelagius \u2020 (363 - 381 AD)\n* [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinarius]] (died 390 AD). He collaborated with his father [[Apollinaris (the Elder)|Apollinaris the Elder]] in reproducing the [[Old Testament]] in the form of [[Homer]]ic and [[Pindar]]ic poetry, and the [[New Testament]] after the fashion of [[Plato]]nic [[dialogue]]s, when the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] had forbidden Christians to teach the [[classics]].\n* Elpidius \u2020 (around 400 AD)\n* Macarius \u2020 (429-451 AD)\n* Maximus \u2020 (around 458 AD)\n* Nicia \u2020\n* Costantinus \u2020 (510 - 518 AD)\n* Stephanus \u2020 (553 AD)\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* Butcher, Kevin.

Rick and Morty travel to HeistCon intending to confront Miles, but they are prohibited from entering as professionals without a crew. Rick gathers three old friends, then abandons them once inside the convention. Rick and Morty proceed to the convention hall where Miles is presenting. Rick heckles and confronts Miles, who challenges Rick to heist the Crystal Skull of Horowitz. When Rick agrees, Miles claims to have already won by presenting his crew\u2014which now includes Rick's crew, whom he recruited immediately after Rick had abandoned them. When Miles opens the loot bag, however, the skull is missing. Rick draws the skull from Morty's bag \u2014 he divulges that he had built a robot, dubbed Heist-o-Tron, to calculate Miles's heist plan. Heist-o-Tron hypnotized Miles' crew as they returned from stealing the skull so that Rick could take it from them, then hypnotized everyone else at the conference into Rick's control. Rick orders the conference attendees to steal everything in the convention center, which leads to Miles's death.\n\nAs the two are about to leave, Heist-o-Tron refuses to comply with Rick's orders to shut down and goes rogue. Rick barely escapes with Morty, and recruits a new crew, including [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Associates of Rick|Mr. Poopybutthole]] (now a professor) and Elon Tusk (an alternate version of [[Elon Musk]] with [[tusk]]s for teeth), to fight Heist-o-Tron. During their assembly, Rick explains his plan of randomly taking orders from his robot Rand-o-Tron, Heist-o-Tron's [[antithesis]]. Rand-o-Tron orders the crew to perform various random tasks that ultimately lead to Heist-o-Tron's lair. Rick and Heist-o-Tron exchange revelations about double-crossing each other for two hours until Heist-o-Tron self-destructs, concluding that the perfect heist is one that will never be written. While the crew escapes the collapsing lair, Morty asks Rick to accompany him to [[Netflix]]'s offices for a meeting about his script for a heist film. At the meeting with Netflix executives, Morty becomes disillusioned with heists and abandons the pitch.
