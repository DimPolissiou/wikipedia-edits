It operates services to destinations in [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Air Malta Boeing 720B AP-AMG LHR 1978-8-24.png|thumb|Air Malta leased its first Boeing 720B's in 1974 and they were joined by another three a few years later.]]\n[[File:Boeing 737-2Y5-Adv, Air Malta AN1170418.jpg|thumb|right|Once a mainstay of the fleet, the Boeing 737-200 series has since been phased out, seen here at London Heathrow Airport in 1983.]]\n\n===Early years===\nShortly after the Second World War, several small private airlines were formed in Malta. Amongst these were The Malta Instone Airline, BAS (Malta) Ltd, and Malta Airlines. In 1947 the former two companies merged to form Air Malta Ltd in fierce competition with the latter. Eventually in 1951 Malta Airlines absorbed the operations of Air Malta Ltd and continued operating through an agreement with [[British European Airways|BEA]] until 1973. The owners of Air Malta Ltd used their real estate, staff, and equipment to set up a [[ground handling]] company called MAS, Malta Aviation Services.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Maltese government appointed Albert Mizzi as chairman of the airline and made a call for an international airline partner to help set up an airline. [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA), then regarded as Asia's best airline, was selected and a new carrier set up. The name chosen for the new airline was similar to that of its forerunner, Air Malta Co Ltd, and was established on 31 March 1973.  BEA was chartered to continue its Malta operations, this time for Air Malta, until Air Malta's first flight on 1 April 1974. Both Malta Airlines and Malta Aviation Services were taken over by the government and the private owners were given a shareholding in Air Malta Co. Ltd.\n\nAir Malta started operations, with 2 [[wet leased]] [[Boeing 720B]]s that served Rome, [[Tripoli]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Paris]] from Malta. It later bought 3 more Boeing 720Bs and bought the original two.\n\nIn 1981, 3 [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]]s were wet leased, which were so successful that in 1983, 3 new fully owned Boeing 737-200s were delivered. In 1986, Air Malta bought 3 new Boeing 737-200s, and in 1987 ordered its first [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]. In 1989, Air Malta exercised an option for one more A320, and in 1992, 3 more [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]s were ordered and 4 [[Avro RJ70]]s were ordered for routes to [[Catania]] and [[Palermo]], and to new destinations such as [[Tunis]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]].\n\nAfter the opening of [[Malta International Airport]] in 1992, Air Malta created ''CargoSystems'', which includes the transportation of cargo on Air Malta planes. In 1994, Air Malta inaugurated a cargo center at the airport. It was also during this time that a codesharing agreement with [[Trans World Airlines]] began.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\n[[File:air.malta.a320-200.9h-aep.arp.jpg|thumb|An Air Malta [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]] wearing the former livery in 2007]]\nBetween 2002 and 2007, Air Malta embarked upon a fleet replacement programme, opting to change all aircraft to Airbus A319s and A320s. The last aircraft in this order, an A320, was delivered on 22 March 2007, and the fleet has not been replaced since.\n\nAir Malta had around 190 interline ticketing agreements with other [[IATA]] airlines. According to the [[Association of European Airlines]] quarterly review of May 2006, Air Malta is the airline that lost the least amount of passenger baggage. The amount of baggage lost in the first quarter of 2006 was 4.1 bags missing per 1000 passengers.\n\nIn winter, the airline often leases out aircraft to maximise earnings during the low season. In September 2007, for instance, Air Malta made two agreements with Abu Dhabi-based [[Etihad Airways]] by which Air Malta wet-leased 2 Airbus aircraft to Etihad Airways for the winter period starting 1 September 2007, and provided operational support on another Airbus A320 aircraft leased by Etihad Airways. In January and February 2009 Air Malta wet-leased an A320 to [[Sky Airline]] of Chile. From 2011 to 2014 Air Malta wet-leased another A320 to [[Sky Airline]].\n\nIn 2012 Air Malta underwent a re-branding process, which caused some controversy as the titles on aircraft and signage only say Malta, omitting the word ''Air''. The airline insisted this was not a name change, and the full name of the airline remains Air Malta. Additionally, the titles on the engines still say ''airmalta.com''. The first plane to show off the new colours was the Airbus A320-200 ''9H-AEN'' at the Malta International Airshow 2012. On the second and last day of the show the A320 and a Spitfire performed a flypast as the closing act.\n\nAs a commemoration of the airline's 40 years of operation, the airline painted one of its aircraft, ''9H-AEI'', an A320-200, in retro colours, depicting the livery used on the Boeing 720Bs.<ref name=\"maltatoday\">[http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2010/01/03/interview.html Interview - Staff numbers]</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, the newly appointed Minister for Tourism announced the restructuring of Air Malta.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170609/local/watch-no-strategic-partner-before-air-malta-is-restructured-konrad.650316 Watch: No strategic partner before Air Malta is restructured - Konrad Mizzi]</ref> This was also confirmed by the newly appointed chairman.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170802/local/air-malta-shareholding-only-after-restructuring-mangion.654726 Air Malta shareholding only after restructuring - Mangion]</ref> Air Malta then opened a number of new routes, including Tunis, Malaga (reduced to seasonal in 2019), Comiso (terminated after summer 2018), Kiev, Lisbon, Casablanca, Southend (terminated in 2019) and Cagliari (subsequently reduced to June\u2013September only).<ref>[https://www.airmalta.com/information/about/news-overview/news-detail/038-2017 Air Malta connects Malta with North Africa again, new scheduled Services to Tunis start 26th of June]</ref> Manchester and Frankfurt were restarted after being briefly terminated.<ref>[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-07-21/local-news/Air-Malta-announces-Frankfurt-flight-schedule-as-from-end-October-6736176875 Air Malta announces Frankfurt flight schedule as from end October]</ref>\n\nIn March 2019, the airline announced that it had made a profit of \u20ac1.2 million in the fiscal year of 2018.

It operates services to destinations in [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Air Malta Boeing 720B AP-AMG LHR 1978-8-24.png|thumb|Air Malta leased its first Boeing 720B's in 1974 and they were joined by another three a few years later.]]\n[[File:Boeing 737-2Y5-Adv, Air Malta AN1170418.jpg|thumb|right|Once a mainstay of the fleet, the Boeing 737-200 series has since been phased out, seen here at London Heathrow Airport in 1983.]]\n\n===Early years===\nShortly after the Second World War, several small private airlines were formed in Malta. Amongst these were The Malta Instone Airline, BAS (Malta) Ltd, and Malta Airlines. In 1947 the former two companies merged to form Air Malta Ltd in fierce competition with the latter. Eventually in 1951 Malta Airlines absorbed the operations of Air Malta Ltd and continued operating through an agreement with [[British European Airways|BEA]] until 1973. The owners of Air Malta Ltd used their real estate, staff, and equipment to set up a [[ground handling]] company called MAS, Malta Aviation Services.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Maltese government appointed Albert Mizzi as chairman of the airline and made a call for an international airline partner to help set up an airline. [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA), then regarded as Asia's best airline, was selected and a new carrier set up. The name chosen for the new airline was similar to that of its forerunner, Air Malta Co Ltd, and was established on 31 March 1973.  BEA was chartered to continue its Malta operations, this time for Air Malta, until Air Malta's first flight on 1 April 1974. Both Malta Airlines and Malta Aviation Services were taken over by the government and the private owners were given a shareholding in Air Malta Co. Ltd.\n\nAir Malta started operations, with 2 [[wet leased]] [[Boeing 720B]]s that served Rome, [[Tripoli]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Paris]] from Malta. It later bought 3 more Boeing 720Bs and bought the original two.\n\nIn 1981, 3 [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]]s were wet leased, which were so successful that in 1983, 3 new fully owned Boeing 737-200s were delivered. In 1986, Air Malta bought 3 new Boeing 737-200s, and in 1987 ordered its first [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]. In 1989, Air Malta exercised an option for one more A320, and in 1992, 3 more [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]s were ordered and 4 [[Avro RJ70]]s were ordered for routes to [[Catania]] and [[Palermo]], and to new destinations such as [[Tunis]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]].\n\nAfter the opening of [[Malta International Airport]] in 1992, Air Malta created ''CargoSystems'', which includes the transportation of cargo on Air Malta planes. In 1994, Air Malta inaugurated a cargo center at the airport. It was also during this time that a codesharing agreement with [[Trans World Airlines]] began.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\n[[File:air.malta.a320-200.9h-aep.arp.jpg|thumb|An Air Malta [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]] wearing the former livery in 2007]]\nBetween 2002 and 2007, Air Malta embarked upon a fleet replacement programme, opting to change all aircraft to Airbus A319s and A320s. The last aircraft in this order, an A320, was delivered on 22 March 2007, and the fleet has not been replaced since.\n\nAir Malta had around 190 interline ticketing agreements with other [[IATA]] airlines. According to the [[Association of European Airlines]] quarterly review of May 2006, Air Malta is the airline that lost the least amount of passenger baggage. The amount of baggage lost in the first quarter of 2006 was 4.1 bags missing per 1000 passengers.\n\nIn winter, the airline often leases out aircraft to maximise earnings during the low season. In September 2007, for instance, Air Malta made two agreements with Abu Dhabi-based [[Etihad Airways]] by which Air Malta wet-leased 2 Airbus aircraft to Etihad Airways for the winter period starting 1 September 2007, and provided operational support on another Airbus A320 aircraft leased by Etihad Airways. In January and February 2009 Air Malta wet-leased an A320 to [[Sky Airline]] of Chile. From 2011 to 2014 Air Malta wet-leased another A320 to [[Sky Airline]].\n\nIn 2012 Air Malta underwent a re-branding process, which caused some controversy as the titles on aircraft and signage only say Malta, omitting the word ''Air''. The airline insisted this was not a name change, and the full name of the airline remains Air Malta. Additionally, the titles on the engines still say ''airmalta.com''. The first plane to show off the new colours was the Airbus A320-200 ''9H-AEN'' at the Malta International Airshow 2012. On the second and last day of the show the A320 and a Spitfire performed a flypast as the closing act.\n\nAs a commemoration of the airline's 40 years of operation, the airline painted one of its aircraft, ''9H-AEI'', an A320-200, in retro colours, depicting the livery used on the Boeing 720Bs.<ref name=\"maltatoday\">[http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2010/01/03/interview.html Interview - Staff numbers]</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, the newly appointed Minister for Tourism announced the restructuring of Air Malta.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170609/local/watch-no-strategic-partner-before-air-malta-is-restructured-konrad.650316 Watch: No strategic partner before Air Malta is restructured - Konrad Mizzi]</ref> This was also confirmed by the newly appointed chairman.<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170802/local/air-malta-shareholding-only-after-restructuring-mangion.654726 Air Malta shareholding only after restructuring - Mangion]</ref> Air Malta then opened a number of new routes, including Tunis, Malaga (reduced to seasonal in 2019), Comiso (terminated after summer 2018), Kiev, Lisbon, Casablanca, Southend (terminated in 2019) and Cagliari (subsequently reduced to June\u2013September only).<ref>[https://www.airmalta.com/information/about/news-overview/news-detail/038-2017 Air Malta connects Malta with North Africa again, new scheduled Services to Tunis start 26th of June]</ref> Manchester and Frankfurt were restarted after being briefly terminated.<ref>[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-07-21/local-news/Air-Malta-announces-Frankfurt-flight-schedule-as-from-end-October-6736176875 Air Malta announces Frankfurt flight schedule as from end October]</ref>\n\nIn March 2019, the airline announced that it had made a profit of \u20ac1.2 million in the fiscal year of 2018.

The storied tale of the game's development led to close press attention in the UK computer market.\n\nWhen ''Brataccas'' finally shipped, this attention resulted in considerable coverage in the computer press.

The oppressive government of the day desires this research to create a breed of [[supersoldier]], but Kyne refuses to assist.\n\nIn retaliation, the government frames him for treason, claiming that he is seeking to sell his work to the underworld. At the same time, the government secretly offers a reward to anyone in the underworld who turns Kyne over to them. With both the forces of law and lawlessness aligned against him, Kyne is forced to flee Earth.<ref>[http://www.brataccas.com/Page4.php The Story so Far] - ''Brataccas'' manual's short backstory</ref>\n\nDuring his escape, Kyne learns that evidence needed to clear his name can be found on the distant [[asteroid]] of Brataccas. Brataccas, first of the asteroids to be colonized, is a backwater mining colony with a \"wild west\" feel of lawlessness and corruption. Kyne has to find the evidence in order to win the game, obtaining it from the in-game characters. The manual gave no indication of who held the evidence, suggesting that everyone was equally corrupt and dangerous to talk to.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Brataccas screen.png|thumb|left|Screenshot from ''Brataccas''.

The computer character is saying, \"I will kill you.\"]]\n''Brataccas'' displays the game world in [[flip-screen]] format, with the map divided into rooms that are drawn into the display as the character moved through the habitat. The screens flipped when Kyne passed from room to room, typically through doors. Most movement was horizontal, with automatic elevators providing vertical movement between floors where required. Occasionally, labeled doors in the rear wall or [[teleportation]] booths with the appearance of cylindrical shower stalls led the player to different sets of rooms. The term \"rooms\" is slightly inaccurate, as there were also a small number of outdoor areas displayed using the same system. In order to preserve detail on the character animations, the characters had to be fairly large, making the rooms small in relative terms. They could get quite crowded with even a few characters in them.\n\nThe player had a limited amount of interaction with the game world, generally limited to movement, picking up or dropping objects, or talking to [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). These NPCs operated under computer control and pursued their own objectives, sometimes even engaging in combat with other NPCs. All the game's characters utilized swords in combat to maintain extended battle in the small rooms, justified in-game as a measure to avoid potential loss of atmosphere to space from stray ranged weapons fire.\n\nInteraction between characters was carried out through dialog bubbles similar to those in comic strips. The player could only respond to other statements, at which point a menu of possible responses appeared. The selections were fairly limited, and the outcomes often seemingly random. Additionally, a number of loudspeakers located in some rooms would announce events like fights breaking out. No attempt was made to \"declutter\" the balloons, so if more than two characters were talking the screen would often fill with them, rendering most of them unreadable.\n\nThe control system was an early example of a [[gesture-based interface]], or as many reviews pointed out, a poor attempt at one. To move, the mouse was moved in the direction the player wanted to walk, or faster if they wanted to run. However, the inaccuracy of the system combined with lag times in the interpretation of the movements often rendered the game almost uncontrollable.

He was considered by his colleagues one of the most brilliant Austrian economists of the interwar period. As a professor at the [[University of Vienna]] he had a decisive influence on [[F. A. Hayek]], [[Fritz Machlup]], [[Gottfried von Haberler]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]] and other fourth-generation Austrian economists.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on former [[Moravia]] (which is today a part of the [[Czech Republic]]). He studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and was admitted as a very young man to the famous private seminar of [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], which had produced a whole generation of promising economists, such as [[Otto Bauer]], [[Nicolai Bukharin]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[Joseph Schumpeter]].\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Strigl continued his research and wrote an important book on [[economic theory]] for which, in 1923, he received his [[Habilitation]] \u2013 the traditional professors' diploma of the universities of [[Central Europe]]. Five years later he acceded to the rank of titular extraordinary professor. However, like Mises, Machlup, Haberler, and other Viennese economists of the time, he had to earn his living outside of academia eventually becoming a high official at the Austrian Unemployment Insurance Board.\n\nStrigl was described as a modest, humane, cultured, and very bright man who impressed both his students and impartial colleagues. As one of his pupils, [[Josef Steindl]] stated after his death, \"There were few of his pupils or of the foreign economists who would visit Vienna and sojourn in his circle of those days who did not very much like him.\"\n\nHe had extraordinary gifts for systematic exposition and step-by-step argument, which made for great success in the classroom. Due to these personal and intellectual talents, Strigl had a considerable influence on the generation of young [[economist]]s graduating from the University of Vienna after World War I. More than any other teacher he shaped the minds of [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Gottfried Haberler]], [[Fritz Machlup]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]] and influenced other future great Viennese economists.\n\nStrigl convinced his students that economic theory could be studied in its own right, that is, without engaging in previous empirical field studies. And this theory could be used to both explain economic phenomena and to direct political action.\n\nDespite the rise of the Austrian economics in the 1920s and 1930s, the dominating intellectual force in the economics departments of Germany and Austria was the so-called [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]]. The representatives of this school of thought despised economic theory for its advocacy of universally valid economic laws. They argued that laws could only be as universal as the conditions to which they referred. Since history was a process of constant transformation of the conditions of human existence, there could be no such thing as general [[economic law]]. At best, there could only be \"laws\" describing the economy of a more or less unique period and, at any rate, all insights about this economy had to be derived from studies of concrete households, firms, administrations, towns, etc.\n\nMoreover, Strigl's department at the [[University of Vienna]] was a stronghold of antirationalist \"organic\" economics. This contrasted sharply with the approach of the Austrian economists who sought to explain economic phenomena as resulting from individual action and from the [[social interaction]] of individuals (the principle of methodological individualist). Single-handedly, Strigl made an effective case for economic theory and [[methodological individualism]] in this intellectually hostile environment. Strigl was primarily interested in the scientific foundation of policy proposals, an interest he shared with Ludwig von Mises. This concern for practical questions incited him to take particular care of methodological problems, and he was very effective in integrating methodological studies into his research. All in all, Bohm-Bawerk had the most lasting impact on Strigl, but the ideas of Walras, Wieser, Schumpeter, and Mises also found their way into his writings.\n\n==Work==\nStrigl was the author of pioneering studies on [[economic theory]], [[applied economics]], [[Capital (economics)|capital theory]], and the relationship between theoretical and historical research. His work [[Capital and Production]] was as a key contribution to technical economic theory. It was first published in 1934 by the former [[Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research]] in its series \"Contributions to Business Cycle Research.\" In his book '''Capital and production''', he links [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]] production theory and [[Ludwig von Mises]] business cycle theory, and gives a pathbreaking account of the role of [[consumer goods]] within the structure of production.\n\nStrigl seeks to come to grips with the causes and possible cures for the [[Great Depression]] that Plagued the Western world in the aftermath of 1929. Although many other Austrian economists of the time were engaged in similar projects, Strigl's work stands out for its analysis of time-consuming roundabout production processes and their relevance for the Great Depression.\n\nStrigl combined [[William Stanley Jevons]] and [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]] theory of capital into genuinely Austrian theory of the [[economy]] as a whole; and he carefully analyzed the impact of credit expansion on the workings of this [[macroeconomy]]. His treatment of these issues in even more systematic, rigorous, and clear than the well-known works by Hayek which covered the same ground. In fact, Hayek hailed Strigl's work \"for the simplicity and clarity of exposition of a notoriously difficult subject.\"\n\n==Later years==\nStrigl's works later fell into obscurity. Mises left for Switzerland where he found a prestigious position that would allow him to write his magnum opus. Hayek, Machlup, and Haberler departed for the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]], where they could obtain academic positions foreclosed to them back home. And after the 1939 [[Anschluss|Anschlu\u00df]], many others left because Nazi Austria made life unbearable for Jews like Morgenstern and for all non-Jews who could not find or accept any modus vivendi with the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]].\n\nAlthough Strigl had remained as the last member of this group at the original home of the School, for him too, life and work had become unbearable. His health was gravely affected and he was disgusted by the [[Opportunism|opportunistic]] behavior of many of his countrymen. [[Josef Steindl]] wrote at the time: \"Since the invasion of Austria he has been silent; we have not heard of any further publication of his. This is not surprising to those who knew him, and it is probably not only due to an illness which befell him in 1930. The spectacle of the conversion overnight of so many to a new creed was not congenial to him who had so conspicuously lacked the talents of a careerist in all his professional life.\"\n\n==Works==\n* {{cite book |last1=von Strigl |first1=Richard |title=Die Okonomifschen Kategorien und die Organisation der Wirtschaft |date=1923 |publisher=Verlag von Gustav Fischer |location=Jena |url=https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Die%20Okonomifschen%20Kategorien%20und%20die%20Organisation%20der%20Wirtschaft_2.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=German |format=EBook}}\n* {{cite book |last1=von Strigl |first1=Richard |editor1-last=H\u00fclsmann |editor1-first=J\u00f6rg Guido |title=Capital & Production |date=2000 |publisher=The Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=0945466315 |url=https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Capital%20and%20Production_2.pdf?file=1&type=document |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=English |format=EBook}}\n\n----\n{{CCBYSASource|sourcepath=https://mises.org/resources/3243|sourcearticle=Biography of Richard von Strigl (1891\u20131942)|revision=405471563}} by [[J\u00f6rg Guido H\u00fclsmann]], senior fellow of the Mises Institute.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strigl, Richard Ritter von}}\n[[Category:1891 births]]\n[[Category:1942 deaths]]\n[[Category:Austrian economists]]\n[[Category:Austrian knights]]\n[[Category:Austrian School economists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=January 2011}}\n{{cleanup|date=April 2011}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox economist\n| name = Richard Ritter von Strigl\n| school_tradition = [[Austrian School]]\n\n| image = File:Richard von Strigl.jpg\n| image_size = 200px\n| caption =\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1891|2|7|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Moravia]]\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|1942|11|11|1891|5|3|df=y}}\n| death_place = [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]\n| nationality = [[Austria]]n\n| institution =\n| field = [[Economics]], [[political science]], [[law]], [[philosophy]]\n| alma_mater = [[University of Vienna]]\n| influences = Bohm-Bawerk, Walras, Wieser, Schumpeter, Mises\n| influenced = Hayek, Machlup, Haberler, Morgenstern\n| contributions = Capital and Production, Austrian macroeconomics\n}}\n'''Richard von Strigl''' (1891\u20131942) was an Austrian economist.

Videos were published through Vine's [[Social networking service|social network]], and could be shared on other platforms such as [[Facebook]] and Twitter. The Vine app could be used to browse videos, along with groups of videos by theme, and \"trending\" videos. Vine competed with other social-media services such as [[Instagram]] and [[Mobli]].\n\nBy December 2015, Vine had 200 million active users.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/vine-statistics/ |title=25 Amazing Vine Statistics |author=Craig Smith |work=DMR |accessdate=2017-02-19}}</ref> On October 27, 2016, Twitter announced it would disable [[File hosting service|uploads]], but viewing and [[download]] would continue to work.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37788052 |title=Twitter axes Vine video service |author= |work=BBC News |first=Chris |last=Foxx |date=October 27, 2016 |accessdate=October 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Important News About Vine\">{{cite web |title= Important News About Vine |url=http://www.medium.com/@vine/important-news-about-vine-909c5f4ae7a7#.iahhb5sa4/ |publisher=Medium.com |accessdate=October 27, 2016}}</ref> On January 20, 2017, Twitter launched an Internet archive of all Vine videos, allowing people to watch previously uploaded videos.\n\nIn December 2017, co-founder [[Dom Hofmann]] announced that he had begun working on Vine's successor, V2, which he has said is not affiliated with Twitter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/12/06/ready-vine-2-0-co-founder-teases-new-app/928300001/ |title=Ready for Vine 2.0?

Every video posted to the app was carefully curated by Vine employees themselves to ensure a platform of purely G-rated videos was achieved.\n\nVine's Head of Communication and Marketing, Carolyn Penner, told CNN that \"children can swipe back and forth on the screen to find new videos, and also tap the screen to produce sound effects\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2015/02/03/vine-kids-family-friendly-video-app/ |title=Vine Debuts A Version Of Its Six-Second Video App Just For Kids |date=2015-02-03 |work=Tubefilter |access-date=2018-11-12 |language=en-US}}</ref> While only being available to consumers with access to iOS devices, and there being an inability for users to upload their own videos, the new app still addressed a demand from the increasing number of families that wanted to be involved in the growing digital space in a manner that was safe for their children.\n\n=== Discontinuation of Vine service ===\nOn October 27, 2016, Vine announced that Twitter would be discontinuing the Vine mobile app.  Vine said users of the service will be notified before any changes to the app or website are made.

Platforms such as Instagram began to introduce their own takes on the short video angle, such as Instagram Video, where users were able to upload 15-second videos to their profiles. \"Instagram video was the beginning of the end\", said a former Vine executive during an interview with online tech news site [[The Verge]]. \n\nMarketers leaving the platform were also an enormous part of the decision by Twitter to discontinue Vine.
