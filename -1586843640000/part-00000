Cruella and Hunter proceed to perform many tactics to weaken the dalmatians' defenses and starve them out. At Dylan's indirect suggestion, Diesel ends up digging a tunnel all the way to the park. However, the De Vils catch onto their scheme by accident and attack them from both fronts using Dizzy and Dee Dee's childlike innocence. The dalmatians escape to the park, only to be captured by Cruella's hired goons and entrapped in a shipping container to be flown away by helicopter.

At the park, the Canal Crew hop onto the shipping container as it is being carried away.

Hunter realizes that Cruella plans to kill the puppies for their fur and is locked up with the rest of the dalmatians. Pearl tosses Dylan and Dolly onto the boat and together with the Canal Crew fight off Cruella and her goons to free their family before they are skinned in an elaborate machine. During this, Hunter finally stands up for himself and defeats Cruella by having her fall into the machine. The dalmatians pull her out just in time for the police to arrive after being notified by a citizen. As Cruella is taken away Hunter is forgiven and the dalmatians head home.<hr>'''Note'': This is a part of a one-hour special.

Marrickville is located {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=off|lk=out}} south-west of the [[Sydney central business district]] and is the largest suburb in the [[Inner West Council]] [[Local government in Australia|local government area]].\n\nMarrickville sits on the northern bank of the [[Cooks River]], opposite  [[Earlwood, New South Wales|Earlwood]] and shares borders with [[Stanmore, New South Wales|Stanmore]], [[Enmore, New South Wales|Enmore]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], [[St Peters, New South Wales|St Peters]], [[Sydenham, New South Wales|Sydenham]], [[Tempe, New South Wales|Tempe]], [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]], [[Hurlstone Park, New South Wales|Hurlstone Park]] and [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]]. The southern part of the suburb, near the river, is known as Marrickville South and includes the historical locality called ''The Warren''.\n\nMarrickville is a culturally diverse suburb consisting of both low and high density residential, commercial and light industrial areas.\n\nThe area's original name is Bulanaming and the traditional owners of the land are the [[Gadigal]] people of the Eora Nation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Irish |first1=Paul |title=First people of the Cooks River |url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/first_people_of_the_cooks_river |website=dictionaryofsydney.org |accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe name Marrickville comes from the 24.3 [[hectare|ha]] (60 acres) 'Marrick' estate of Thomas Chalder, which was subdivided on 24 February 1855. He named it after his native village [[Marrick]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The estate centred on the intersection of Victoria Road and Chapel Street. William Dean, the publican of the Marrick Hotel, in Illawarra Road (now the site of the Henson Park Hotel) is credited with adding the \"ville\" to Marrick when it was gazetted in 1861.\n\nThe first land grant in the area was {{convert|100|acre|km2|1}} to William Beckwith in 1794. Thomas Moore received {{convert|470|acre|km2|1}} in 1799 and another {{convert|700|acre|km2|1}} in 1803. Dr Robert Wardell purchased most of this land for his estate that stretched from [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] to the Cooks River. His estate was broken up after he was murdered by escaped convicts in September 1834.\n[[File:Marrickville6.JPG|thumb|left|Old Police Station, Gladstone Street]]\n[[Thomas Holt (Australian politician)|Thomas Holt]] (1811\u20131888) was a Sydney business tycoon who built a castellated Victorian Gothic mansion named \u2018The Warren\u2019 in 1857 in Marrickville South. It was  designed by architect George Mansfield, and contained an impressive art gallery filled with paintings and sculptures from Europe. It had elaborate stables built into imposing stone walls, and large landscaped gardens filled with urns overlooking the Cooks River. Holt gave it that name because he bred rabbits on the estate for hunting, as well as the grounds being stocked with  alpacas and other exotics. The Warren was a landmark in the district for some decades; the still-operating Warren View Hotel in Enmore as evidence of this.\n\nRenovations were undertaken in 1866. There were also  bathing sheds and a Turkish Bath built on the river. The {{convert|100|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} property was south of Wardell\u2019s and covered the area from today\u2019s Unwins Bridge Road to Illawarra Road and Warren Road. Thomas Holt was a large land holder in Sydney with another mansion at the edge of Gwawley Bay, Sylvania Waters, New South Wales in 1881,(his last and greatest residence, the monumental forty room Sutherland House mansion which was destroyed by fire in 1918) and vast property holdings from [[Sutherland, New South Wales|Sutherland]] to [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]].\n\nAs Holt's health began to be an issue, the Warren was subdivided in 1884 with the land around the immediate building's grounds being sold off - and the family returning to Britain for the remaining years of his life. He died in 1888.\n \nThe estate stables were demolished some time between 1884 and 1886, with the nearby [http://www.ferncourt-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/ Ferncourt Public School] being originally built as a house \"Prosna\" by Polish born artist, Gracius Joseph Broinowski, from sandstone blocks of the stable, and a cedar staircase and marble mantelpiece purchased from Holt's estate installed in it.\n\nIt is obvious today the last block remaining where the mansion stood as it is indicated by the newer houses of the 1920s-1930s as well as, obviously the name of the road, driven down the western side of the block -  \"Mansion Street\" - and \"Holt St\" adjacent to it forming the lower side of the square perimeter).\n\nThe Warren became a nunnery when the mansion and {{convert|12|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land were purchased by a French order of Carmelite nuns. The Carmelites were evicted from The Warren in 1903 for outstanding debts. By this stage the grounds appear to be bare with a high wood fence installed on the western side of the building about this time. It then was used during WWI for an artillery training range and this fenced area also appears in photos along with smaller buildings on the grounds nearby. It was resumed in 1919 by the New South Wales government was finally demolished in around 1922 - the land subdivided to build a housing estate for returned soldiers.  Sir John Sulman was engaged to build this.\n\nNot much remains of the once imposing castle-like building except for two stone turrets from the building indicating what was once on the general spot (this was recently vandalised and the commemorative plaque stolen; noted 2010. Originally piers from the back entrance of the building, which had been stored by the council for many years - they were placed on the headland with a memorial fountain in 1967 at Richardson's Lookout in Holt Street. Other remains are garden paths with flags and liners, one or two of the original stone blocks from the walls, and the base of what was probably a garden feature such as an urn or fountain. An area with a few cobblestones in the grass, remains under some native fig trees, and was probably a drive that led to the back of the stables.  Also on the bank of the river below are the crypts that Thomas Holt built into a sandstone overhang for his family. No bodies were subsequently laid to rest except for the Mother Superior of the Carmelite order who was interred for a short time.\n\n\"Ferndale\" in Kent Lane, Newtown, is the earliest of his four houses and the last surviving residence connected with Thomas Holt. It is heritage-listed.<ref>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2030210 State Heritage Register]</ref>\n\nMarrickville became a [[municipality]] on 6 November 1861. In 1948, it merged with neighbouring municipalities of [[St Peters, New South Wales|St Peters]] and [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] to form Marrickville Municipal Council.\n\nThe first school opened in August 1864 and the post office opened in 1865. The railway line to Bankstown opened in 1895. The station was known as Illawarra Road during construction. Later, when it was decided that Marrickville was a more appropriate name, the original Marrickville station was renamed [[Sydenham, New South Wales|Sydenham]].<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 165</ref>\n\n[[File:Marrickville Post Office.jpg|thumb|View of the Marrickville Post Office from Marrickville Road.

The southern part of the suburb, near the river, is known as Marrickville South and includes the historical locality called ''The Warren''.\n\nMarrickville is a culturally diverse suburb consisting of both low and high density residential, commercial and light industrial areas.\n\nThe area's original name is Bulanaming and the traditional owners of the land are the [[Gadigal]] people of the Eora Nation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Irish |first1=Paul |title=First people of the Cooks River |url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/first_people_of_the_cooks_river |website=dictionaryofsydney.org |accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe name Marrickville comes from the 24.3 [[hectare|ha]] (60 acres) 'Marrick' estate of Thomas Chalder, which was subdivided on 24 February 1855. He named it after his native village [[Marrick]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The estate centred on the intersection of Victoria Road and Chapel Street. William Dean, the publican of the Marrick Hotel, in Illawarra Road (now the site of the Henson Park Hotel) is credited with adding the \"ville\" to Marrick when it was gazetted in 1861.\n\nThe first land grant in the area was {{convert|100|acre|km2|1}} to William Beckwith in 1794. Thomas Moore received {{convert|470|acre|km2|1}} in 1799 and another {{convert|700|acre|km2|1}} in 1803. Dr Robert Wardell purchased most of this land for his estate that stretched from [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] to the Cooks River. His estate was broken up after he was murdered by escaped convicts in September 1834.\n[[File:Marrickville6.JPG|thumb|left|Old Police Station, Gladstone Street]]\n[[Thomas Holt (Australian politician)|Thomas Holt]] (1811\u20131888) was a Sydney business tycoon who built a castellated Victorian Gothic mansion named \u2018The Warren\u2019 in 1857 in Marrickville South. It was  designed by architect George Mansfield, and contained an impressive art gallery filled with paintings and sculptures from Europe. It had elaborate stables built into imposing stone walls, and large landscaped gardens filled with urns overlooking the Cooks River. Holt gave it that name because he bred rabbits on the estate for hunting, as well as the grounds being stocked with  alpacas and other exotics. The Warren was a landmark in the district for some decades; the still-operating Warren View Hotel in Enmore as evidence of this.\n\nRenovations were undertaken in 1866. There were also  bathing sheds and a Turkish Bath built on the river. The {{convert|100|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} property was south of Wardell\u2019s and covered the area from today\u2019s Unwins Bridge Road to Illawarra Road and Warren Road. Thomas Holt was a large land holder in Sydney with another mansion at the edge of Gwawley Bay, Sylvania Waters, New South Wales in 1881,(his last and greatest residence, the monumental forty room Sutherland House mansion which was destroyed by fire in 1918) and vast property holdings from [[Sutherland, New South Wales|Sutherland]] to [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]].\n\nAs Holt's health began to be an issue, the Warren was subdivided in 1884 with the land around the immediate building's grounds being sold off - and the family returning to Britain for the remaining years of his life. He died in 1888.\n \nThe estate stables were demolished some time between 1884 and 1886, with the nearby [http://www.ferncourt-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/ Ferncourt Public School] being originally built as a house \"Prosna\" by Polish born artist, Gracius Joseph Broinowski, from sandstone blocks of the stable, and a cedar staircase and marble mantelpiece purchased from Holt's estate installed in it.\n\nIt is obvious today the last block remaining where the mansion stood as it is indicated by the newer houses of the 1920s-1930s as well as, obviously the name of the road, driven down the western side of the block -  \"Mansion Street\" - and \"Holt St\" adjacent to it forming the lower side of the square perimeter).\n\nThe Warren became a nunnery when the mansion and {{convert|12|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land were purchased by a French order of Carmelite nuns. The Carmelites were evicted from The Warren in 1903 for outstanding debts. By this stage the grounds appear to be bare with a high wood fence installed on the western side of the building about this time. It then was used during WWI for an artillery training range and this fenced area also appears in photos along with smaller buildings on the grounds nearby. It was resumed in 1919 by the New South Wales government was finally demolished in around 1922 - the land subdivided to build a housing estate for returned soldiers.  Sir John Sulman was engaged to build this.\n\nNot much remains of the once imposing castle-like building except for two stone turrets from the building indicating what was once on the general spot (this was recently vandalised and the commemorative plaque stolen; noted 2010. Originally piers from the back entrance of the building, which had been stored by the council for many years - they were placed on the headland with a memorial fountain in 1967 at Richardson's Lookout in Holt Street. Other remains are garden paths with flags and liners, one or two of the original stone blocks from the walls, and the base of what was probably a garden feature such as an urn or fountain. An area with a few cobblestones in the grass, remains under some native fig trees, and was probably a drive that led to the back of the stables.  Also on the bank of the river below are the crypts that Thomas Holt built into a sandstone overhang for his family. No bodies were subsequently laid to rest except for the Mother Superior of the Carmelite order who was interred for a short time.\n\n\"Ferndale\" in Kent Lane, Newtown, is the earliest of his four houses and the last surviving residence connected with Thomas Holt. It is heritage-listed.<ref>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2030210 State Heritage Register]</ref>\n\nMarrickville became a [[municipality]] on 6 November 1861. In 1948, it merged with neighbouring municipalities of [[St Peters, New South Wales|St Peters]] and [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] to form Marrickville Municipal Council.\n\nThe first school opened in August 1864 and the post office opened in 1865. The railway line to Bankstown opened in 1895. The station was known as Illawarra Road during construction.

In 1747, he married [[Margaret Fownes-Luttrell|Margaret Luttrell]], the heiress of Dunster Castle and added his wife's name to his own to comply with her late father's will. In accordance with the era's laws concerning the property rights of married women, on his marriage he became the legal owner of his wife's property, including not only Dunster Castle, but also the lordships of the manors of [[Dunster]], [[Heathfield, Somerset|Heathfield]], and [[Kilton, Somerset|Kilton]] amongst others. The newly named Fownes Luttrell altered the castle considerably, remodelling its interior and park and building the [[Conygar Tower]], a [[folly]] in the grounds. Following the death of his wife in 1766 he remarried in 1771.\n\nWhen Fownes Luttrell's candidate for the 1754 election was defeated, he realised that his estate bought him relatively little political power. Frustrated, he set about nursing his interest in the borough. Later, a compromise with a rival landowner placed one of the borough's two parliamentary seats [[Pocket borough|in his pocket]]. He stood for election in 1768 and was returned with the support of the Government. He was returned again in 1774 alongside his eldest son, [[John Fownes Luttrell (1752\u20131816)|John]]; the Prime Minister was disgruntled that he had not returned his own favoured candidate and Fownes Luttrell resigned on the condition that the [[Thomas Pownall|Government's candidate]] would not interfere in the future without his permission. Thenceforth until abolition by the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] of 1832 the borough's parliamentary seats were effectively controlled by his family.\n\nFownes Luttrell was an inactive politician, and is not known to have spoken or voted in Parliament during the six years he was a member. Instead, he led the life of a country squire, hunting and managing his estates.

In 1747, he married [[Margaret Fownes-Luttrell|Margaret Luttrell]], the heiress of Dunster Castle and added his wife's name to his own to comply with her late father's will. In accordance with the era's laws concerning the property rights of married women, on his marriage he became the legal owner of his wife's property, including not only Dunster Castle, but also the lordships of the manors of [[Dunster]], [[Heathfield, Somerset|Heathfield]], and [[Kilton, Somerset|Kilton]] amongst others. The newly named Fownes Luttrell altered the castle considerably, remodelling its interior and park and building the [[Conygar Tower]], a [[folly]] in the grounds. Following the death of his wife in 1766 he remarried in 1771.\n\nWhen Fownes Luttrell's candidate for the 1754 election was defeated, he realised that his estate bought him relatively little political power. Frustrated, he set about nursing his interest in the borough. Later, a compromise with a rival landowner placed one of the borough's two parliamentary seats [[Pocket borough|in his pocket]]. He stood for election in 1768 and was returned with the support of the Government. He was returned again in 1774 alongside his eldest son, [[John Fownes Luttrell (1752\u20131816)|John]]; the Prime Minister was disgruntled that he had not returned his own favoured candidate and Fownes Luttrell resigned on the condition that the [[Thomas Pownall|Government's candidate]] would not interfere in the future without his permission.

For example, the number 54349589 has a base-13 representation of <code>B34C128</code>.\n* If instead of {A,B,C}, we judiciously choose the symbols {+,-,\u00b7}, something interesting happens: some numbers in base 13 will have representations that ''look'' like well-formed decimals in base 10: for example, the number 54349589 has a base-13 representation of <code>-34.128</code>. Of course, most numbers won't be intelligible in this way; for example  the number 3629265 has the base-13 representation <code>9+0--7</code>.\n* Conway's base 13 function takes in a real number ''x'' and considers its base 13 representation as a sequence of symbols { {{nowrap|0, 1, ..., 9, +, -, \u00b7}} }.  If from some position onward,  the representation looks like a well-formed decimal number ''r'', then ''f(x)''=''r''. Otherwise, ''f(x)''=0.  (Well-formed means that it starts with a + or - symbol, contains exactly one decimal-dot symbol, and otherwise contains only the digits 0-9).  For example, if a number ''x'' has the representation <code>8++2.19+0--7+3.141592653</code>..., then ''f(x)'' = +3.141592653...  .\n\n==Definition==\nThe Conway base 13 function is a function <math>f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} </math> defined as follows. Write the argument <math>x</math> value as a tridecimal (a \"decimal\" in [[base 13]]) using 13 symbols as 'digits': {{nowrap|0, 1, ..., 9, A, B, C}}; there should be no trailing C recurring.  There may be a leading sign, and somewhere there will be a tridecimal point to separate the integer part from the fractional part; these should both be ignored in the sequel.  These \"digits\" can be thought of as having the values 0 to 12, respectively; Conway originally used the digits \"+\", \"-\" and \".\" instead of A, B, C, and underlined all of the base 13 'digits' to clearly distinguish them from the usual base 10 digits and symbols.\n* If from some point onwards, the tridecimal expansion of <math>x</math> is of the form <math>A x_1 x_2 \\dots x_n C y_1 y_2 \\dots</math> where all the digits <math>x_i</math> and <math>y_j</math> are in <math>\\{0,\\dots,9\\}</math>, then <math>f(x) = x_1 \\dots x_n . y_1 y_2 \\dots</math> in usual [[base 10]] notation.\n* Similarly, if the tridecimal expansion of <math>x</math> ends with <math>B x_1 x_2 \\dots x_n C y_1 y_2 \\dots</math>, then <math>f(x) = -  x_1 \\dots x_n . y_1 y_2 \\dots</math>.\n* Otherwise, <math>f(x) = 0</math>.\n\nFor example,\n* <math>f(12345A3C14.159\\dots_{13}) = f(A3.C14159\\dots_{13}) = 3.14159\\dots</math>,\n* <math>f(B1C234_{13}) = - 1.234</math>,\n* and <math>f(1C234A567_{13}) = 0</math>.\n\n==Properties==\n* According to the intermediate value theorem, every continuous real function <math>f</math> satisfies an intermediate-value property: on every interval ''(a,b)'', the function <math>f</math> passes through every point between <math>f(a)</math> and <math>f(b)</math>. The Conway base 13 function shows that the converse is false: it satisfies the intermediate-value property, but isn't continuous.\n* In fact, the Conway base 13 function satisfies a much stronger intermediate-value property&mdash;on every interval ''(a,b)'', the function <math>f</math> passes through ''every real number''. As a result it satisfies a much stronger discontinuity property&mdash; it is discontinuous everywhere. \n* To prove that the Conway base 13 function satisfies this stronger intermediate property, let ''(a,b)'' be an interval, let ''c'' be a point in that interval, and let ''r'' be any real number. Create a base-13 encoding of ''r'' as follows: starting with the base-10 representation of ''r'', replace the decimal point with C and indicate the sign of ''r'' by prepending either an A (if ''r'' is positive) or a B (if ''r'' is negative) to the beginning.  By definition of the Conway base 13 function, the resulting string <math>\\hat{r}</math> has the property that <math>f(\\hat{r}) = r</math>. Moreover, ''any'' base-13 string that ends in <math>\\hat{r}</math> will have this property. Thus, if you replace the tail end of ''c'' with <math>\\hat{r}</math>, the resulting number will have ''f(c') = r''. By introducing this modification sufficiently far along the tridecimal representation of <math>c</math>, you can ensure that the new number <math>c'</math> will still lie in the interval <math>(a,b)</math>.  This proves that for any number ''r'' you choose, in every interval you can find a point <math>c'</math> such that <math>f(c')=r</math>.\n* The Conway base 13 function is therefore discontinuous everywhere: a real function that is continuous at ''x'' must be locally bounded at ''x'', i.e. it must be bounded on some interval around ''x''. But as shown above, the Conway base 13 function is unbounded on every interval around every point; therefore it is not continuous anywhere.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Darboux function]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal| last = Oman| first = Greg| title = The Converse of the Intermediate Value Theorem: From Conway to Cantor to Cosets and Beyond| journal = Missouri J.

agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.\n\nAt the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his personal political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for \"a favor though\": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.<ref name=\"Intel-Report\" />{{Rp|8-9}}</blockquote>\n\n== Subsequent developments ==\n=== Involvement of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman ===\n\n{{main|Lev Parnas|Igor Fruman}}\n[[File:2019-10-09.eec engel schiff to parnas fruman re subpoena.pdf|thumb|150px|Subpoena issued to John M.

agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.\n\nAt the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his personal political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for \"a favor though\": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.<ref name=\"Intel-Report\" />{{Rp|8-9}}</blockquote>\n\n== Subsequent developments ==\n=== Involvement of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman ===\n\n{{main|Lev Parnas|Igor Fruman}}\n[[File:2019-10-09.eec engel schiff to parnas fruman re subpoena.pdf|thumb|150px|Subpoena issued to John M.
