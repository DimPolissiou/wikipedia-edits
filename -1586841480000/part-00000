It belongs to the [[right-wing]] political coalition [[Chile Vamos]], in conjunction with the [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI), the [[Independent Regionalist Party]] (PRI) and [[Political Evolution]] (Ev\u00f3poli). The party president is [[Mario Desbordes]], and its principal leaders are [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]], two times President of Chile and [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]], former minister of defense, former presidential candidate and Senator.\n\n==History==\nNational Renewal was formed on 29 April 1987 when three rightist organizations \u2013 the [[National Union Movement]] (''Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional'', MUN), the [[National Labour Front (Chile)|National Labour Front]] (''Frente Nacional del Trabajo'', FNT), and the Independent Democratic Union (''Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente'', UDI) \u2014 joined together in preparation for the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|1988 Plebiscite]] that would determine the continuity or not of rule of [[Augusto Pinochet]] who had been in power since the coup of 1973. The UDI soon broke away to run as a separate party due to its strong support for the plebiscite and a Pinochet candidacy, while the remaining National Renewal party indicated its preference for an open election or a candidate other than Pinochet. However, once Pinochet was proclaimed candidate, the overwhelming majority of National Renewal supported him.\n\nThe party was founded on 29 April with 351 founding members. In this way, National Renewal was the first political party to form in Chile after the lifting on the ban of political parties that had been established after the coup; by December of that year, 61,167 members, led by Andr\u00e9s Allamand, had joined. The principal idea that the party proclaimed was to generate an environment of calm during the return of democracy. The party supported UDI candidate [[Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn]] as the sole Alliance candidate in the [[1999\u20132000 Chilean presidential election|1999/2000]] presidential elections, who went on to obtain 47.5% of the votes in the first round, but was subsequently defeated in the second round by [[Ricardo Lagos]].\n\nDuring early 2005, the party initially supported Lav\u00edn to again run as the sole candidate of the Alliance in the [[2005\u201306 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] of that year. However, in face of Lav\u00edn's declining opinion poll numbers, [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]] announced his candidacy as the National Renewal candidate thus ensuring that the Alliance have two candidates for the election. In the first round on 11 December, Pi\u00f1era obtained 25.4% of the vote, which was enough to send him to the run-off on 15 January 2006 with [[Michelle Bachelet]]. With 46.5% of the vote, Pi\u00f1era was defeated by Bachelet.\n\nIn the [[legislative]] [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|elections]], also on 11 December 2005, the party won, as part of the [[Alliance for Chile]], 20 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and currently holds 7 out of 38 seats in the Senate.\n\nIn the [[2009 Chilean parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]], also on 13 December 2009, the party gains, as part of the [[Coalition for Change]], 18 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies of Chile and currently has 8 out of 38 seats in the Senate of Chile.\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 Chilean presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era was elected [[president of Chile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/especiales/2009/nacional/presidenciales2009/despliegue.asp?idnoticia=394236|title=\nMinuto a Minuto: Pi\u00f1era pide a la Concertaci\u00f3n \"que sea oposici\u00f3n fuerte, pero leal\" (finalizado)|accessdate=5 May 2013|author=emol.com|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]] was presidential precandidate for primary elections, the National Renewal party supported the presidential candidacy of [[Evelyn Matthei]] for the [[2013 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]], that lost in second round with the 37% of the votes.\n\nIn January 2014, three deputies (Karla Rubilar, Pedro Browne and Joaqu\u00edn Godoy)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-559643-9-karla-rubilar-joaquin-godoy-y-pedro-browne-confirman-renuncia-a-renovacion.shtml|title=Karla Rubilar, Joaqu\u00edn Godoy y Pedro Browne confirman renuncia a Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional|work=[[La Tercera]]|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=8 January 2014|author=Francisco Torrealba and Alberto Labra}}</ref> and one senator (Lily P\u00e9rez)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|title=Lily P\u00e9rez y renuncia a RN: \"Dej\u00f3 de ser el partido al que entr\u00e9\"|work=La Tercera|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116203913/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> resigned to membership in the party and launched a political movement called \"[[Amplitude (political party)|Amplitude]]\" (''Amplitud''), that aimed to be a new political party inside the Alliance.

The party supported UDI candidate [[Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn]] as the sole Alliance candidate in the [[1999\u20132000 Chilean presidential election|1999/2000]] presidential elections, who went on to obtain 47.5% of the votes in the first round, but was subsequently defeated in the second round by [[Ricardo Lagos]].\n\nDuring early 2005, the party initially supported Lav\u00edn to again run as the sole candidate of the Alliance in the [[2005\u201306 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] of that year. However, in face of Lav\u00edn's declining opinion poll numbers, [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]] announced his candidacy as the National Renewal candidate thus ensuring that the Alliance have two candidates for the election. In the first round on 11 December, Pi\u00f1era obtained 25.4% of the vote, which was enough to send him to the run-off on 15 January 2006 with [[Michelle Bachelet]]. With 46.5% of the vote, Pi\u00f1era was defeated by Bachelet.\n\nIn the [[legislative]] [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|elections]], also on 11 December 2005, the party won, as part of the [[Alliance for Chile]], 20 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and currently holds 7 out of 38 seats in the Senate.\n\nIn the [[2009 Chilean parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]], also on 13 December 2009, the party gains, as part of the [[Coalition for Change]], 18 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies of Chile and currently has 8 out of 38 seats in the Senate of Chile.\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 Chilean presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era was elected [[president of Chile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/especiales/2009/nacional/presidenciales2009/despliegue.asp?idnoticia=394236|title=\nMinuto a Minuto: Pi\u00f1era pide a la Concertaci\u00f3n \"que sea oposici\u00f3n fuerte, pero leal\" (finalizado)|accessdate=5 May 2013|author=emol.com|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]] was presidential precandidate for primary elections, the National Renewal party supported the presidential candidacy of [[Evelyn Matthei]] for the [[2013 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]], that lost in second round with the 37% of the votes.\n\nIn January 2014, three deputies (Karla Rubilar, Pedro Browne and Joaqu\u00edn Godoy)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-559643-9-karla-rubilar-joaquin-godoy-y-pedro-browne-confirman-renuncia-a-renovacion.shtml|title=Karla Rubilar, Joaqu\u00edn Godoy y Pedro Browne confirman renuncia a Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional|work=[[La Tercera]]|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=8 January 2014|author=Francisco Torrealba and Alberto Labra}}</ref> and one senator (Lily P\u00e9rez)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|title=Lily P\u00e9rez y renuncia a RN: \"Dej\u00f3 de ser el partido al que entr\u00e9\"|work=La Tercera|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116203913/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> resigned to membership in the party and launched a political movement called \"[[Amplitude (political party)|Amplitude]]\" (''Amplitud''), that aimed to be a new political party inside the Alliance.

Sometime in the 10th century, Sofala emerged as a small trading post and was incorporated into the greater global Somali trade network. In the 1180s, Sultan Suleiman Hassan of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (in present-day [[Tanzania]]) seized control of Sofala, and brought Sofala into the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] and the [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] cultural sphere.the man behind the conquest: Mogadishu merchants had long kept Sofala a secret from their Kilwan rivals, who up until then rarely sailed beyond Cape Delgado. One day, a fisherman caught a large bite off Kilwa and was dragged by the fish around Cape Delgado, through the Mozambique Channe, all the way down to the Sofala banks. The fisherman made his way back up to Kilwa to report to the Sultan Suleiman Hassan what he had seen. Hearing of the gold trade, the sultan loaded up a ship with cloth and immediately raced down there, guided by the fisherman. The Kilwan sultan offered a better deal to the Mwenemutapa, and was allowed to erect a Kilwan factory and colony on the island and nudge the Mogadishans permanently out.\n<ref>Portuguese chronicler [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] (Dec.

The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\",<ref name=\"Rose, p. 95\">[[#Rose|Rose]], p. 95.</ref> as one historian has put it. [[Gibraltar]]'s location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.\n\nGibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by [[Neanderthal]]s and may have been one of their [[Neanderthals of Gibraltar|last places of habitation]] before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's [[recorded history]] began around 950 BC with the [[Phoenicians]], who lived nearby. The [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later worshipped [[Hercules]] in shrines said to have been built on the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which they called ''Mons Calpe'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=K|last2=Finlayson|first2=C|last3=Vagelpohl|first3=U|last4=Jose Giles Guzman|first4=F|last5=Giles Pacheco|first5=F|title=Myths, Moors and Holy War: Reassessing the History and Archaeology of Gibraltar and the Straits, ad 711\u20131462|journal=Medieval Archaeology|date=2014|volume=58|issue=1|pages=136\u2013161}}</ref> the \"Hollow Mountain\", and which they regarded as one of the twin [[Pillars of Hercules]].\n\nGibraltar became part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of [[Hispania]] following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] rule in 711 AD. It was [[Moorish Gibraltar|permanently settled for the first time]] by the Moors and was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'' \u2013 the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into ''Gibraltar''. The Christian [[Crown of Castile]] annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]] and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by an [[Kingdom of England|Anglo]]-[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet in the name of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Austria]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.\n\nSpain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a [[Crown colony]], through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Gibraltar became a major base in the [[Peninsular War]]. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to [[India]] via the [[Suez Canal]]. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.\n\nBritish control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the [[Second World War]]. It was attacked on several occasions by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General [[Francisco Franco]] declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to [[self-determination]]. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.\n\nSince 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on [[Tourism in Gibraltar|tourism]], financial services, [[Shipping in Gibraltar|shipping]] and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with [[Parliament of Gibraltar|its own parliament]] and [[Government of Gibraltar|government]], though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success had made it one of the wealthiest areas of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Geographical background==\n\n[[File:Gibraltar World Wind view annotated.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar, with key locations marked|Annotated satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar]]\nThe history of Gibraltar has been driven by its strategic position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at the eastern side of the [[Bay of Gibraltar]], {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from the city of [[Algeciras]]. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only {{convert|15|mi|order=flip}} from the coast of [[Morocco]] in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/> As one writer has put it, \"whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar.\"<ref>[[#Krieger|Krieger]], p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe territory's area measures only {{convert|2.6|sqmi|order=flip}}. Most of the land area is occupied by the steeply sloping Rock of Gibraltar which reaches a height of {{convert|426|m}}. The town of Gibraltar lies at the base of the Rock on the west side of the peninsula. A narrow, low-lying isthmus connects the peninsula to the Spanish mainland. The North Face of the Rock is a nearly vertical cliff {{convert|396|m}} high overlooking the isthmus; the only land access to the town is via a coastal strip about {{convert|350|m}} wide, which was considerably narrower before the [[Land reclamation|reclamation of land]] from the sea during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dennis\">[[#Dennis|Dennis]], pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's geography has thus given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It is virtually impossible to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around [[Europa Point]] is surrounded by cliffs which are up to {{convert|30|m}} high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Prehistory and ancient history}} Prehistory and ancient history==\n<!-- DO NOT change anchor without updating incoming link at: Original inhabitants of Gibraltar -->\n\n[[File:Neanderthal skull from Forbes' Quarry.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Three\u2014quarter view of the mostly intact skull of a Neanderthal female|\"[[Gibraltar 1|Gibraltar Woman]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 a Neanderthal who lived in Gibraltar some 50,000 years ago]]\n{{History of Gibraltar}}\nGibraltar's appearance in prehistory was very different.

The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian [[Hispania]] and thus gained a new strategic significance.

This conflict ({{lang-es|link=no|la Cuesti\u00f3n del Estrecho}}) is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of [[Tarifa]] in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] would lay siege to [[Algeciras]] (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the [[rearguard]] of Algeciras and provided a fallback position if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.<ref>[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 35.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to the test for the first time in the [[First Siege of Gibraltar]].

To the east, Gibraltar was bounded by the [[Guadiaro River]], and its northern boundaries lay in the vicinity of [[Castellar de la Frontera]], [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[Alcal\u00e1 de los Gazules]], [[Medina-Sidonia]] and [[Tarifa, Spain|Tarifa]].

The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the southern ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value.

[[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa took advantage of the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Europe]] was sacked and all its valuables were stolen. Many of the captives were subsequently released when a Spanish fleet commanded by [[Bernardino de Mendoza (Captain General)|Bernardino de Mendoza]] intercepted the pirate ships near [[Battle of Albor\u00e1n|Albor\u00e1n]] as they were bringing ransomed hostages back to Gibraltar.

The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the [[Morisco]]s;\u2013 Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 78\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a fleet of ships showing one ship exploding in flames, with men and debris flying in the air and other men in the water, jumping overboard or taking to lifeboats |''The Explosion of the Spanish Flagship during the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]]'' by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]] ]]\nThe threat of the Barbary pirates was soon joined by that of Spain's enemies in northern Europe.

The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts.

However, [[James VI and I|James I]] successfully resisted [[Parliament of England|Parliamentary]] pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England.<ref name=\"Jackson-81\"/> After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to \"take or spoil a town\" on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that it was small, could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked [[C\u00e1diz]] in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but [[C\u00e1diz Expedition (1625)|the raid]] turned into a fiasco.

Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[Capture of Gibraltar|The attack]] was launched on 1 August 1704 as a combined operation between the naval force under Rooke's command and a force of Dutch and English marines under the command of [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and Captain [[Edward Whitaker]] of [[HMS Dorsetshire (1694)|HMS ''Dorsetshire'']].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 96.</ref> After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 97.</ref> Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. The Spanish position was untenable and on the morning of 4 August, the governor, [[Diego de Salinas]], agreed to surrender.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 98.</ref>\n\nThe [[s:Terms of surrender of the Spanish authorities of Gibraltar in 1704|terms of surrender]] made it clear that Gibraltar had been taken in the name of Charles III of Spain, described in the terms as \"legitimate Lord and King\". The inhabitants and garrison of Gibraltar were promised freedom of religion and the maintenance of existing rights if they wished to stay, on condition that they swore an oath of loyalty to Charles as King of Spain. As had happened two years previously in the raid on C\u00e1diz, the discipline of the landing forces soon broke down. There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned|Cathedral]]) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of [[Our Lady of Europe]] were damaged and destroyed. Angry Spanish inhabitants took violent reprisals against the occupiers. English and Dutch soldiers and sailors were attacked and killed, and their bodies were thrown into wells and cesspits.<ref name=Jackson-99>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 99.</ref>\n\nWhen the Spanish garrison marched out on 7 August almost all of the inhabitants, some 4,000 people in total, evacuated the town.

Many settled nearby in the ruins of Algeciras or around [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada Church|an old hermitage]] at the head of the bay in the expectation of a prompt return. They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the \"City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo\". A small population of around seventy (mainly neutral [[Genoa|Genoese]] people) stayed behind in Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 101.</ref>\n\nThe Grand Alliance's control of Gibraltar was challenged on 24 August when a French fleet entered the Straits.

The British commandant, Major General [[John Shrimpton]], was appointed by Charles as Gibraltar's governor in 1705 on the advice of Queen Anne.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113.</ref> The Queen subsequently declared Gibraltar a [[free port]] at the insistence of the Sultan of Morocco, though she had no formal authority to do so. Shrimpton was replaced in 1707 by Colonel [[Roger Elliott]], who was replaced in turn by Brigadier [[Thomas Stanwix]] in 1711; this time the appointments were made directly by London with no claim of authority from Charles. Stanwix was ordered to expel all foreign troops from Gibraltar to secure its status as an exclusively British possession but failed to evict the Dutch, apparently not considering them \"foreign\".<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession was finally settled in 1713 by a series of treaties and agreements. Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the [[Southern Netherlands]], [[Naples]], Milan, and [[Sardinia]] to Austria; [[Sicily]] and some Milanese lands to [[Savoy]]; and [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish [[history of slavery|slave trading]] in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called ''[[asiento]]''. With regard to Gibraltar ([[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]]), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain \"for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.\" The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113, 333\u2013334.</ref><ref name=\"Abulafia2011 497\">[[#Abulafia|Abulafia]], p. 47.</ref>\n\n==British rule (1713\u2013present)==\n\n===Consolidation and sieges===\nDespite its later importance to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by the British Government as more of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset.

Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across the upper end of the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as ''La L\u00ednea de Contravalaci\u00f3n'' (the Lines of [[Investment (military)|Contravallation]]), were later to give their name to the modern town of [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Jackson-139\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 139.</ref> Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.<ref name=\"Jackson-140\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 140.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's civilian population increased steadily through the century to form a disparate mixture of Britons, Genoese, Jews, Spaniards and Portuguese.

The driving force behind this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) [[William Green (general)|William Green]], who was to play a key role a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-147\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 147\u2013149.</ref> He was joined in 1776 by Lieutenant General [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Elliott]], a veteran of earlier wars against France and Spain who took over the governorship of Gibraltar at a key moment.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 150.</ref>\n\nBritain's successes in the [[Seven Years' War]] had left it with expensive commitments in the Americas that had to be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|started the Anglo-Spanish War]] and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest [[siege]]s endured by the [[British Armed Forces]], as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history.  A combined Spanish and French fleet [[blockade]]d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing [[fortification|forts]], [[redoubt]]s, [[trench warfare|entrenchments]], and [[artillery battery|batteries]] from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the [[Armada of 1779]].  The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral George Rodney]] captured a [[Action of 8 January 1780|Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre]] and defeated a Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies.\n\nThe British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low.  On 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral [[George Darby]]'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England laden for Gibraltar entered the bay. The Spanish fleet was unable to intercept Darby's relief. The Spanish, frustrated by this failure, began a barrage of the town, causing great panic and terror among the civilian population.<ref name=\"Bradford1972_gs\">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Ernle Dusgate Selby |date=1972 |title=Gibraltar: the history of a fortress |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-UjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=16 April 2011}} ''To the citizen of the 20th Century, accustomed or the civilian casualties in war, and dulled to the annihilation of whole cities (or even nations), the horrified reaction of Gibraltar's garrison to the shelling of the town and its inhabitants may seem a trifle na\u00efve. But it must be remembered that in those days there was still a code of conduct in warfare, and some elementary humanity in those who waged it.''.</ref> Deliberate targeting of civilians was unprecedented at the time and was to continue for 2 years, obliterating any architectural heritage from the Spanish period.  Unable to starve the garrison out, the French and Spanish attempted further attacks by land and sea. The night before the Grand Attack on 27 November 1781, the British garrison filed silently out of their defence works and made a surprise [[sortie]], routing the besieging infantry in their trenches and postponed the grand assault on The Rock for some time.\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138<ref>Monti, p. 140.</ref> heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels<ref name=\"Monti p138\">Monti, p. 138.</ref> with a total of 30,000 sailors and marines.

The British destroyed three of the floating batteries,<ref>Montero, pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish.

The following evening a gale blew up, scattering the Spanish and French fleet and allowing Howe to sail unopposed into Gibraltar. A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport ships which delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000<ref>Syrett, p. 104\u2013105.</ref><ref>Chartrand, p. 23.</ref> Howe then sailed out and fought [[Battle of Cape Spartel|an indecisive battle]] with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.\n\nThe siege was continued for some months longer, but in the spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted.  The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] warned that it would be the source \"of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity\" and expressed his wish \"if possible to be rid of Gibraltar&nbsp;... I shall not think peace complete if we do not get rid of Gibraltar.\" General Eliott and the garrison were lauded for their heroism, and the tenacity of their defence of Gibraltar acquired, as one writer puts it, \"a sort of cult status\".<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref> The British public acquired \"an emotional, albeit irrational, attachment to the place.\"<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 10.</ref> The reputed impregnability of Gibraltar gave rise to the expression, which is still current today, of something being as \"strong as the Rock of Gibraltar\".<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar as a colony===\nFollowing the Great Siege, the civilian population of Gibraltar&nbsp;\u2013 which had fallen to under a thousand&nbsp;\u2013 expanded rapidly as the territory became both a place of economic opportunity and a refuge from the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Britain's loss of North American colonies in 1776 led to much of her trade being redirected to new markets in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]]. The favoured route to the east was via [[Egypt]], even before the [[Suez Canal]] had been built, and Gibraltar was the first British port reached by ships heading there. The new maritime traffic gave Gibraltar a greatly increased role as a trading port. At the same time, it was a haven in the western Mediterranean from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. Many of the new immigrants were Genoese people who had fled Napoleon's annexation of the old [[Republic of Genoa]].<ref name=\"Jackson-181\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 181.</ref> By 1813 nearly a third of the population consisted of Genoese and Italians. Portuguese made up another 20 per cent, Spaniards 16.5 per cent, Jews 15.5 per cent, British 13 per cent and Menorcans 4 per cent.

A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding [[St Bernard's Hospital]] to serve the civilian population and initiating the construction of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar.

Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to [[Alexandria]] or [[Cape Horn]], the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until near the end of the century.<ref name=\"Jackson-242\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 242.</ref> The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La L\u00ednea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 381.</ref>\n[[File:Frederick Leeds Edridge 1833 Castle Street.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a street scene showing people and pack animals going up and down a steep street, with several women wearing the traditional red cloak of Gibraltar|Castle Street, Gibraltar, by [[Frederick Leeds Edridge]], 1833]]\nVisiting Gibraltar in the mid-19th century, the English writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]] wrote in his ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain|Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'' that \"the differences of nations and costumes are very curious: a motley masquerade is held in this halfway house between Europe, Asia, and Africa, where every man appears in his own dress and speaks his own language.

The problem arose after Spain imposed tariffs on foreign manufactured goods in a bid to protect Spain's own fledgling industrial enterprises. Tobacco was also heavily taxed, providing one of the government's principal sources of revenue. The inevitable result was that Gibraltar, where cheap tobacco and goods were readily available, became a centre of intensive smuggling activity.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 172.</ref> The depressed state of the economy caused smuggling to become a mainstay of Gibraltar's trade;<ref name=\"Jackson-242\"/> the mid-19th-century Irish traveller Martin Haverty described Gibraltar as \"the grand smuggling depot for Spain\".<ref name=\"Haverty-219\"/> General Sir [[Robert Gardiner (British Army officer)|Robert Gardiner]], who served as Governor between 1848 and 1855, described the daily scene in a letter to British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]:\n\n{{quote|From the first early opening of the gates there is to be seen a stream of Spanish men, women and children, horses and a few caleches, passing into the town where they remain moving about from shop to shop until about noon.

The emergence of the Gibraltarians as a distinct group owed much to the pressure on housing in the territory and the need to control the numbers of the civilian population, as Gibraltar was still first and foremost a military fortress. Two [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] of 1873 and 1885 stipulated that no child of alien parent could be born in Gibraltar, no foreigners could claim a right of residence and that only Gibraltar-born inhabitants were entitled to reside there; everyone else needed permits, unless they were employees of the British Crown. In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions.<ref name=\"Jackson-248\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 248.</ref> There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.<ref name=\"Jackson-249\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar at war and peace===\n[[File:Gibraltar Harbour scene, February 1909.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A fleet of warships lined up in a harbour with thick clouds of smoke coming out of their funnels|The United States' [[Great White Fleet]] visiting Gibraltar harbour in February 1909]]\nBy the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of [[torpedo]]es meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 255.</ref> The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.<ref name=\"Bradford-169\">[[#Bradford|Bradford]], p. 169.</ref>\n\nA Spanish proposal to swap Gibraltar for [[Ceuta]] on the other side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected.<ref name=\"Quiroga\">[[#Quiroga|Quiroga]], page 39</ref> It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side. From 1889, the [[Royal Navy]] was greatly expanded and both Gibraltar and Malta were equipped with new, torpedo-proof harbours and expanded, modernised dockyards.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\"/> The works at Gibraltar were carried out by some 2,200 men at the huge cost of \u00a35&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.005|1898|2013|r=1}}}}&nbsp;billion in 2013 prices).<ref name=\"Jackson-257\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 257.</ref> Under the reforming leadership of [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John \"Jacky\" Fisher]], Gibraltar became the base for the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 189.</ref> In the British public's imagination, Gibraltar was seen as \"a symbol of British naval power [and] a symbol of the empire which has been built and, more than the British lion or even [[John Bull]] himself, has come to represent Britain's power and prestige across the world.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Gibraltar \u2013 Vital Point in War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NIkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2378,24256&dq=windmill-hill+gibraltar&hl=en|work=The Vancouver Sun|page=4|date=1 August 1940}}</ref>\n\nThe value of the naval base was soon apparent when the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Only a few minutes after the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day.<ref name=\"Hills-398\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 398.</ref> Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war \u2013 Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested as it was in the Second World War&nbsp;\u2013 it played an important role in the Allied fight against the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]]. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait.<ref name=\"Jackson-264\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 264.</ref> Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, [[SM UB-50|SM ''UB-50'']] torpedoed and sank the British [[battleship]] [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']] off [[Cape Trafalgar]] to the west of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-265\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of peace inevitably meant a reduction in military expenditure, but this was more than offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from [[India]] and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.<ref name=\"Jackson-268\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially on the front lines of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General [[Francisco Franco]] broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the [[Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Spanish Republican]] government sought on several occasions to regain control of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]]-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding.<ref name=\"Stockey-93\">[[#Stockey|Stockey]], p. 93.</ref><ref name=\"Alexander206\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 206.</ref> A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain.

The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when [[Battle of France|Germany invaded France]], with [[Italian invasion of France|Italy joining the invasion]] in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and it was decided to [[evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar]] in May 1940.<ref name=\"Jackson-271\"/> Most went to the United Kingdom and others to [[Madeira]] and [[Jamaica]], while some made their own way to [[Tangier]] and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over {{convert|30|miles|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called [[Force H]] was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Jackson-276\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 276.</ref> The airfield, which was now designated [[RAF North Front]], was also extended using soil from the tunnelling works so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa.<ref name=\"Jackson-286\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 286.</ref> The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 293.</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar played a key role. The [[Convoy#World War II|Ocean Convoy System]] adopted by Britain after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 ran on two routes \u2013 an east\u2013west route between the UK and North America, and a north\u2013south route between the UK, Gibraltar and [[Freetown]] in British-ruled [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>[[#Grove|Grove]], p. 30.</ref> Even before the war, Gibraltar had been designated as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe.<ref>[[#Baptiste|Baptiste]], p. 7.</ref> From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region.<ref>[[#Offley|Offley]], p. 371.</ref> A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Morison|Morison]], p. 250.</ref>\n\nGibraltar was directly attacked, both overtly and covertly, on several occasions during the war. [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant.<ref name=\"Jackson-281\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 281.</ref> Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to \"non-belligerence\",<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 11.</ref> which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory.

The immediate problem after [[VJ Day]] was a lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to the southern end of the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.<ref name=\"Jackson-296\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 296.</ref>\n\nIn the war's aftermath, Gibraltar took decisive steps towards implementing civilian self-governance over most issues of public policy. The [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR), led by Gibraltarian lawyer [[Joshua Hassan]], won all of the seats in the first post-war City Council elections in 1945. Women were given the right to vote in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was established.<ref name=\"Alexander-235\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 235.</ref> A two-party system had emerged by 1955 with the creation of the [[Commonwealth Party (Gibraltar)|Commonwealth Party]] as a rival to the AACR. That same year Hassan became the first Mayor of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-236\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 236.</ref> The Governor still retained overall authority and could overrule the Legislative Council. This inevitably caused tension and controversy if the Governor and Legislative Council disagreed, but in 1964 the British Government agreed to confine the powers of the Governor to matters of defence, security and foreign relations.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 237.</ref> A new constitution was decided on in 1968 and promulgated in 1969, merging the City Council and Legislative Council into a single House of Assembly (known as the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] since 2006) with 15 elected members, two non-elected officials and a speaker. The old title of \"Colony of Gibraltar\" was dropped and the territory was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 241.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's post-war relationship with Spain was marred by an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted to use military force to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hills-375\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 375.</ref> The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about {{convert|1|km}} wide&nbsp;\u2013 the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control of most of the neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-250\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar border 1977.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two women standing at a closed line of gates, with the British and Spanish flags flying on separate poles on either side.|The closed gates at the border between Gibraltar and Spain, 1977]]\nSpain's push to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar was fuelled by the [[decolonization|decolonisation]] agenda of the United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other \"Overseas Dependent Territories\" in conjunction with the drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence.<ref name=\"Jackson-303\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 303.</ref> Franco's government calculated that Britain would be willing to give up an expensive possession that no longer had a great deal of military value,<ref name=\"Jackson-294\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 294.</ref> but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-295\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 295.</ref> The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|a referendum in September 1967]] in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain with just 44 supporting union with Spain, though a further 55 voting slips were blank or invalid.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\"/> Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants \"pseudo-Gibraltarians\"<ref name=\"Jackson-306\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 306.</ref> and stating that the \"real\" Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\"/>\n\nThe dispute initially took the form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-300\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 300.</ref> Further restrictions were imposed in 1964,<ref name=\"Jackson-308\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 308.</ref> and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles.  The following year, Spain closed its airspace to aircraft taking off or landing at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]. In 1969, after the passing of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969|Gibraltar Constitution Order]], to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.<ref name=\"Jackson-316\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 316.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish decision had major consequences not only for the political relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom, but\nfor the people of Gibraltar, many of whom had relatives or homes in Spain. As one of the Gibraltarians who suffered the closure of the frontier explains:\n\n{{quote|The saddest sight was seeing people behind the wire fences on both sides of the land frontier yelling at the top of their voices across the wide dividing space to enquire about the state of relatives, as telephone communications had been cut by the Spaniards.

The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\",<ref name=\"Rose, p. 95\">[[#Rose|Rose]], p. 95.</ref> as one historian has put it. [[Gibraltar]]'s location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.\n\nGibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by [[Neanderthal]]s and may have been one of their [[Neanderthals of Gibraltar|last places of habitation]] before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's [[recorded history]] began around 950 BC with the [[Phoenicians]], who lived nearby. The [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later worshipped [[Hercules]] in shrines said to have been built on the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which they called ''Mons Calpe'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=K|last2=Finlayson|first2=C|last3=Vagelpohl|first3=U|last4=Jose Giles Guzman|first4=F|last5=Giles Pacheco|first5=F|title=Myths, Moors and Holy War: Reassessing the History and Archaeology of Gibraltar and the Straits, ad 711\u20131462|journal=Medieval Archaeology|date=2014|volume=58|issue=1|pages=136\u2013161}}</ref> the \"Hollow Mountain\", and which they regarded as one of the twin [[Pillars of Hercules]].\n\nGibraltar became part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of [[Hispania]] following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] rule in 711 AD. It was [[Moorish Gibraltar|permanently settled for the first time]] by the Moors and was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'' \u2013 the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into ''Gibraltar''. The Christian [[Crown of Castile]] annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]] and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by an [[Kingdom of England|Anglo]]-[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet in the name of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Austria]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.\n\nSpain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a [[Crown colony]], through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Gibraltar became a major base in the [[Peninsular War]]. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to [[India]] via the [[Suez Canal]]. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.\n\nBritish control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the [[Second World War]]. It was attacked on several occasions by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General [[Francisco Franco]] declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to [[self-determination]]. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.\n\nSince 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on [[Tourism in Gibraltar|tourism]], financial services, [[Shipping in Gibraltar|shipping]] and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with [[Parliament of Gibraltar|its own parliament]] and [[Government of Gibraltar|government]], though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success had made it one of the wealthiest areas of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Geographical background==\n\n[[File:Gibraltar World Wind view annotated.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar, with key locations marked|Annotated satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar]]\nThe history of Gibraltar has been driven by its strategic position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at the eastern side of the [[Bay of Gibraltar]], {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from the city of [[Algeciras]]. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only {{convert|15|mi|order=flip}} from the coast of [[Morocco]] in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/> As one writer has put it, \"whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar.\"<ref>[[#Krieger|Krieger]], p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe territory's area measures only {{convert|2.6|sqmi|order=flip}}. Most of the land area is occupied by the steeply sloping Rock of Gibraltar which reaches a height of {{convert|426|m}}. The town of Gibraltar lies at the base of the Rock on the west side of the peninsula. A narrow, low-lying isthmus connects the peninsula to the Spanish mainland. The North Face of the Rock is a nearly vertical cliff {{convert|396|m}} high overlooking the isthmus; the only land access to the town is via a coastal strip about {{convert|350|m}} wide, which was considerably narrower before the [[Land reclamation|reclamation of land]] from the sea during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dennis\">[[#Dennis|Dennis]], pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's geography has thus given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It is virtually impossible to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around [[Europa Point]] is surrounded by cliffs which are up to {{convert|30|m}} high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Prehistory and ancient history}} Prehistory and ancient history==\n<!-- DO NOT change anchor without updating incoming link at: Original inhabitants of Gibraltar -->\n\n[[File:Neanderthal skull from Forbes' Quarry.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Three\u2014quarter view of the mostly intact skull of a Neanderthal female|\"[[Gibraltar 1|Gibraltar Woman]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 a Neanderthal who lived in Gibraltar some 50,000 years ago]]\n{{History of Gibraltar}}\nGibraltar's appearance in prehistory was very different.

It lacked easily accessible fresh water, fertile soil or a safe natural anchorage on the shoreline. Avienus cited the \"shallow draft and dense mud of the shore\" as reasons not to land there.

The [[Berbers]] of North Africa, called [[Moors]] by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian [[Hispania]] and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into civil war in the 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne.

Gibraltar was renamed ''Jebel al-Fath'' (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist,<ref name=Hills-13/> and a fortified town named ''Medinat al-Fath'' (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nIn the late thirteen and early fourteenth centuries the [[Crown of Castile]] fought with the [[Marinids]] of Morocco and the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] of [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] for control of the Strait of Gibraltar. This conflict ({{lang-es|link=no|la Cuesti\u00f3n del Estrecho}}) is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of [[Tarifa]] in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] would lay siege to [[Algeciras]] (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the [[rearguard]] of Algeciras and provided a fallback position if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.<ref>[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 35.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to the test for the first time in the [[First Siege of Gibraltar]].

The metaphor was represented on the royal arms by a golden key hanging from the front gate of a battlemented fortress.

[[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa took advantage of the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Europe]] was sacked and all its valuables were stolen.

The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the [[Morisco]]s;\u2013 Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 78\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a fleet of ships showing one ship exploding in flames, with men and debris flying in the air and other men in the water, jumping overboard or taking to lifeboats |''The Explosion of the Spanish Flagship during the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]]'' by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]] ]]\nThe threat of the Barbary pirates was soon joined by that of Spain's enemies in northern Europe.

The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts. Some in England had ambitions to turn the fleet against Spain rather than the Barbary coast. However, [[James VI and I|James I]] successfully resisted [[Parliament of England|Parliamentary]] pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England.<ref name=\"Jackson-81\"/> After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to \"take or spoil a town\" on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that it was small, could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked [[C\u00e1diz]] in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but [[C\u00e1diz Expedition (1625)|the raid]] turned into a fiasco. The landing force looted the town's wine stores and was evacuated after four days of mass drunkenness without anything useful having been achieved.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe presence of Spain's enemies in the Straits prompted the Spanish king [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] to order Gibraltar's defences to be strengthened. A new [[South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|mole]] and gun platforms were built, though the latter's usefulness was limited due to a lack of gunners. The town was an unsanitary, crowded place, which probably contributed to the outbreak in 1649 of an epidemic&nbsp;\u2013 reportedly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] but possibly [[typhoid fever|typhoid]]&nbsp;\u2013 which killed a quarter of the population.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 84.</ref> English fleets returned to Gibraltar in 1651\u201352 and again in 1654\u201355 as temporary allies of the Spanish against French and Dutch shipping in the Straits.<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 86\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar in 1654 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Gibraltar'', 1654 by [[Jan Peeters I]]]]\nIn 1654, [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to turn on Spain (which had been the first state to recognise the [[Commonwealth of England]]) and seize the island of [[Hispaniola]] to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over [[Jamaica]] instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off C\u00e1diz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u201360)|war on England]] until February 1656.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref> Shortly afterwards, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar. Although they lacked a viable landing force and took no action, Oliver Cromwell expressed interest in its capture: \"if possessed and made tenable by us, would it not be both an advantage to our trade, and an annoyance to the Spaniards, and enable us [to]&nbsp;... ease our own charge?\"<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 86\"/> In 1693, during the [[Nine Years' War]], in which Spain and England were allies, the remnants of an English-Dutch escort squadron under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Rooke]] took refuge at Gibraltar, pursued by the French, after losing the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)|Battle of Lagos Bay]].

The dispute over who should succeed him&nbsp;\u2013 the Bourbon Prince [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], grandson of [[Louis XIV of France]], or the Habsburg Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Austria]]&nbsp;\u2013 soon plunged Europe into a major war. Louis XIV supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, [[Portugal]], Savoy and some of the German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the [[barrier town]]s. In May 1702, England's [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] formally declared war on France.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 89\u201391.</ref>\n\nSpain thus became a target for the Anglo-Dutch-Austrian alliance.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 91.</ref> The confederates' campaign was pursued by land and by sea. The main land offensive was pursued in the [[Low Countries]] by the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], while naval forces under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke harassed French and Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces would launch a surprise attack against the French and their [[Bavaria]]n allies in the [[Danube]] basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 92.</ref> Rooke was instructed to attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 93.</ref>\n\nWhen Rooke arrived in the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the inhabitants of [[Barcelona]] to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at [[Toulon]] was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take [[Battle of C\u00e1diz (1702)|C\u00e1diz]] had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[Capture of Gibraltar|The attack]] was launched on 1 August 1704 as a combined operation between the naval force under Rooke's command and a force of Dutch and English marines under the command of [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and Captain [[Edward Whitaker]] of [[HMS Dorsetshire (1694)|HMS ''Dorsetshire'']].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 96.</ref> After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 97.</ref> Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned.

The inhabitants and garrison of Gibraltar were promised freedom of religion and the maintenance of existing rights if they wished to stay, on condition that they swore an oath of loyalty to Charles as King of Spain. As had happened two years previously in the raid on C\u00e1diz, the discipline of the landing forces soon broke down. There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned|Cathedral]]) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of [[Our Lady of Europe]] were damaged and destroyed. Angry Spanish inhabitants took violent reprisals against the occupiers. English and Dutch soldiers and sailors were attacked and killed, and their bodies were thrown into wells and cesspits.<ref name=Jackson-99>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 99.</ref>\n\nWhen the Spanish garrison marched out on 7 August almost all of the inhabitants, some 4,000 people in total, evacuated the town.

Many settled nearby in the ruins of Algeciras or around [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada Church|an old hermitage]] at the head of the bay in the expectation of a prompt return. They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the \"City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo\". A small population of around seventy (mainly neutral [[Genoa|Genoese]] people) stayed behind in Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 101.</ref>\n\nThe Grand Alliance's control of Gibraltar was challenged on 24 August when a French fleet entered the Straits.

The French withdrew to Toulon without attempting to assault Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 102.</ref> In early September a Franco-Spanish army arrived outside Gibraltar and prepared for [[Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar|a siege which they commenced on 9 October]].

The British commandant, Major General [[John Shrimpton]], was appointed by Charles as Gibraltar's governor in 1705 on the advice of Queen Anne.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113.</ref> The Queen subsequently declared Gibraltar a [[free port]] at the insistence of the Sultan of Morocco, though she had no formal authority to do so. Shrimpton was replaced in 1707 by Colonel [[Roger Elliott]], who was replaced in turn by Brigadier [[Thomas Stanwix]] in 1711; this time the appointments were made directly by London with no claim of authority from Charles. Stanwix was ordered to expel all foreign troops from Gibraltar to secure its status as an exclusively British possession but failed to evict the Dutch, apparently not considering them \"foreign\".<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession was finally settled in 1713 by a series of treaties and agreements. Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the [[Southern Netherlands]], [[Naples]], Milan, and [[Sardinia]] to Austria; [[Sicily]] and some Milanese lands to [[Savoy]]; and [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish [[history of slavery|slave trading]] in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called ''[[asiento]]''. With regard to Gibraltar ([[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]]), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain \"for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.\" The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113, 333\u2013334.</ref><ref name=\"Abulafia2011 497\">[[#Abulafia|Abulafia]], p. 47.</ref>\n\n==British rule (1713\u2013present)==\n\n===Consolidation and sieges===\nDespite its later importance to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by the British Government as more of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset.

Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across the upper end of the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as ''La L\u00ednea de Contravalaci\u00f3n'' (the Lines of [[Investment (military)|Contravallation]]), were later to give their name to the modern town of [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Jackson-139\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 139.</ref> Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.<ref name=\"Jackson-140\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 140.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's civilian population increased steadily through the century to form a disparate mixture of Britons, Genoese, Jews, Spaniards and Portuguese.

The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|started the Anglo-Spanish War]] and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest [[siege]]s endured by the [[British Armed Forces]], as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history.  A combined Spanish and French fleet [[blockade]]d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing [[fortification|forts]], [[redoubt]]s, [[trench warfare|entrenchments]], and [[artillery battery|batteries]] from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the [[Armada of 1779]].  The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral George Rodney]] captured a [[Action of 8 January 1780|Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre]] and defeated a Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies.\n\nThe British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low.  On 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral [[George Darby]]'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England laden for Gibraltar entered the bay. The Spanish fleet was unable to intercept Darby's relief. The Spanish, frustrated by this failure, began a barrage of the town, causing great panic and terror among the civilian population.<ref name=\"Bradford1972_gs\">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Ernle Dusgate Selby |date=1972 |title=Gibraltar: the history of a fortress |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-UjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=16 April 2011}} ''To the citizen of the 20th Century, accustomed or the civilian casualties in war, and dulled to the annihilation of whole cities (or even nations), the horrified reaction of Gibraltar's garrison to the shelling of the town and its inhabitants may seem a trifle na\u00efve.

Unable to starve the garrison out, the French and Spanish attempted further attacks by land and sea. The night before the Grand Attack on 27 November 1781, the British garrison filed silently out of their defence works and made a surprise [[sortie]], routing the besieging infantry in their trenches and postponed the grand assault on The Rock for some time.\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138<ref>Monti, p. 140.</ref> heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels<ref name=\"Monti p138\">Monti, p. 138.</ref> with a total of 30,000 sailors and marines.

A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport ships which delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000<ref>Syrett, p. 104\u2013105.</ref><ref>Chartrand, p. 23.</ref> Howe then sailed out and fought [[Battle of Cape Spartel|an indecisive battle]] with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.\n\nThe siege was continued for some months longer, but in the spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted.  The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] warned that it would be the source \"of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity\" and expressed his wish \"if possible to be rid of Gibraltar&nbsp;... I shall not think peace complete if we do not get rid of Gibraltar.\" General Eliott and the garrison were lauded for their heroism, and the tenacity of their defence of Gibraltar acquired, as one writer puts it, \"a sort of cult status\".<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref> The British public acquired \"an emotional, albeit irrational, attachment to the place.\"<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 10.</ref> The reputed impregnability of Gibraltar gave rise to the expression, which is still current today, of something being as \"strong as the Rock of Gibraltar\".<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar as a colony===\nFollowing the Great Siege, the civilian population of Gibraltar&nbsp;\u2013 which had fallen to under a thousand&nbsp;\u2013 expanded rapidly as the territory became both a place of economic opportunity and a refuge from the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Britain's loss of North American colonies in 1776 led to much of her trade being redirected to new markets in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]]. The favoured route to the east was via [[Egypt]], even before the [[Suez Canal]] had been built, and Gibraltar was the first British port reached by ships heading there. The new maritime traffic gave Gibraltar a greatly increased role as a trading port. At the same time, it was a haven in the western Mediterranean from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. Many of the new immigrants were Genoese people who had fled Napoleon's annexation of the old [[Republic of Genoa]].<ref name=\"Jackson-181\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 181.</ref> By 1813 nearly a third of the population consisted of Genoese and Italians. Portuguese made up another 20 per cent, Spaniards 16.5 per cent, Jews 15.5 per cent, British 13 per cent and Menorcans 4 per cent.

The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding [[St Bernard's Hospital]] to serve the civilian population and initiating the construction of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 162.</ref> A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a [[Crown colony]]. In the same year, the [[Gibraltar Police Force]] was established, modelled on London's pioneering [[Metropolitan Police Service]],<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 163.</ref> and [[Court system of Gibraltar|a Supreme Court]] was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.<ref name=\"Jackson-229\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 229.</ref>\n\nThe economic importance of Gibraltar changed following the invention of [[steamboat|steamships]]; the first one to reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 166.</ref> The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to [[Alexandria]] or [[Cape Horn]], the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until near the end of the century.<ref name=\"Jackson-242\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 242.</ref> The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La L\u00ednea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 381.</ref>\n[[File:Frederick Leeds Edridge 1833 Castle Street.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a street scene showing people and pack animals going up and down a steep street, with several women wearing the traditional red cloak of Gibraltar|Castle Street, Gibraltar, by [[Frederick Leeds Edridge]], 1833]]\nVisiting Gibraltar in the mid-19th century, the English writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]] wrote in his ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain|Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'' that \"the differences of nations and costumes are very curious: a motley masquerade is held in this halfway house between Europe, Asia, and Africa, where every man appears in his own dress and speaks his own language.

The problem arose after Spain imposed tariffs on foreign manufactured goods in a bid to protect Spain's own fledgling industrial enterprises. Tobacco was also heavily taxed, providing one of the government's principal sources of revenue. The inevitable result was that Gibraltar, where cheap tobacco and goods were readily available, became a centre of intensive smuggling activity.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 172.</ref> The depressed state of the economy caused smuggling to become a mainstay of Gibraltar's trade;<ref name=\"Jackson-242\"/> the mid-19th-century Irish traveller Martin Haverty described Gibraltar as \"the grand smuggling depot for Spain\".<ref name=\"Haverty-219\"/> General Sir [[Robert Gardiner (British Army officer)|Robert Gardiner]], who served as Governor between 1848 and 1855, described the daily scene in a letter to British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]:\n\n{{quote|From the first early opening of the gates there is to be seen a stream of Spanish men, women and children, horses and a few caleches, passing into the town where they remain moving about from shop to shop until about noon.

The emergence of the Gibraltarians as a distinct group owed much to the pressure on housing in the territory and the need to control the numbers of the civilian population, as Gibraltar was still first and foremost a military fortress. Two [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] of 1873 and 1885 stipulated that no child of alien parent could be born in Gibraltar, no foreigners could claim a right of residence and that only Gibraltar-born inhabitants were entitled to reside there; everyone else needed permits, unless they were employees of the British Crown. In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions.<ref name=\"Jackson-248\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 248.</ref> There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.<ref name=\"Jackson-249\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar at war and peace===\n[[File:Gibraltar Harbour scene, February 1909.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A fleet of warships lined up in a harbour with thick clouds of smoke coming out of their funnels|The United States' [[Great White Fleet]] visiting Gibraltar harbour in February 1909]]\nBy the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of [[torpedo]]es meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 255.</ref> The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.<ref name=\"Bradford-169\">[[#Bradford|Bradford]], p. 169.</ref>\n\nA Spanish proposal to swap Gibraltar for [[Ceuta]] on the other side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected.<ref name=\"Quiroga\">[[#Quiroga|Quiroga]], page 39</ref> It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side. From 1889, the [[Royal Navy]] was greatly expanded and both Gibraltar and Malta were equipped with new, torpedo-proof harbours and expanded, modernised dockyards.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\"/> The works at Gibraltar were carried out by some 2,200 men at the huge cost of \u00a35&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.005|1898|2013|r=1}}}}&nbsp;billion in 2013 prices).<ref name=\"Jackson-257\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 257.</ref> Under the reforming leadership of [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John \"Jacky\" Fisher]], Gibraltar became the base for the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 189.</ref> In the British public's imagination, Gibraltar was seen as \"a symbol of British naval power [and] a symbol of the empire which has been built and, more than the British lion or even [[John Bull]] himself, has come to represent Britain's power and prestige across the world.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Gibraltar \u2013 Vital Point in War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NIkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2378,24256&dq=windmill-hill+gibraltar&hl=en|work=The Vancouver Sun|page=4|date=1 August 1940}}</ref>\n\nThe value of the naval base was soon apparent when the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Only a few minutes after the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day.<ref name=\"Hills-398\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 398.</ref> Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war \u2013 Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested as it was in the Second World War&nbsp;\u2013 it played an important role in the Allied fight against the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]]. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait.<ref name=\"Jackson-264\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 264.</ref> Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, [[SM UB-50|SM ''UB-50'']] torpedoed and sank the British [[battleship]] [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']] off [[Cape Trafalgar]] to the west of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-265\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of peace inevitably meant a reduction in military expenditure, but this was more than offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from [[India]] and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.<ref name=\"Jackson-268\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially on the front lines of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General [[Francisco Franco]] broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the [[Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Spanish Republican]] government sought on several occasions to regain control of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]]-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding.<ref name=\"Stockey-93\">[[#Stockey|Stockey]], p. 93.</ref><ref name=\"Alexander206\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 206.</ref> A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain.

The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when [[Battle of France|Germany invaded France]], with [[Italian invasion of France|Italy joining the invasion]] in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and it was decided to [[evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar]] in May 1940.<ref name=\"Jackson-271\"/> Most went to the United Kingdom and others to [[Madeira]] and [[Jamaica]], while some made their own way to [[Tangier]] and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over {{convert|30|miles|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called [[Force H]] was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Jackson-276\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 276.</ref> The airfield, which was now designated [[RAF North Front]], was also extended using soil from the tunnelling works so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa.<ref name=\"Jackson-286\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 286.</ref> The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 293.</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar played a key role. The [[Convoy#World War II|Ocean Convoy System]] adopted by Britain after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 ran on two routes \u2013 an east\u2013west route between the UK and North America, and a north\u2013south route between the UK, Gibraltar and [[Freetown]] in British-ruled [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>[[#Grove|Grove]], p. 30.</ref> Even before the war, Gibraltar had been designated as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe.<ref>[[#Baptiste|Baptiste]], p. 7.</ref> From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region.<ref>[[#Offley|Offley]], p. 371.</ref> A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Morison|Morison]], p. 250.</ref>\n\nGibraltar was directly attacked, both overtly and covertly, on several occasions during the war. [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant.<ref name=\"Jackson-281\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 281.</ref> Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to \"non-belligerence\",<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 11.</ref> which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory.

The immediate problem after [[VJ Day]] was a lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to the southern end of the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.<ref name=\"Jackson-296\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 296.</ref>\n\nIn the war's aftermath, Gibraltar took decisive steps towards implementing civilian self-governance over most issues of public policy. The [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR), led by Gibraltarian lawyer [[Joshua Hassan]], won all of the seats in the first post-war City Council elections in 1945. Women were given the right to vote in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was established.<ref name=\"Alexander-235\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 235.</ref> A two-party system had emerged by 1955 with the creation of the [[Commonwealth Party (Gibraltar)|Commonwealth Party]] as a rival to the AACR. That same year Hassan became the first Mayor of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-236\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 236.</ref> The Governor still retained overall authority and could overrule the Legislative Council.

The old title of \"Colony of Gibraltar\" was dropped and the territory was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 241.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's post-war relationship with Spain was marred by an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted to use military force to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hills-375\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 375.</ref> The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about {{convert|1|km}} wide&nbsp;\u2013 the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control of most of the neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-250\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar border 1977.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two women standing at a closed line of gates, with the British and Spanish flags flying on separate poles on either side.|The closed gates at the border between Gibraltar and Spain, 1977]]\nSpain's push to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar was fuelled by the [[decolonization|decolonisation]] agenda of the United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other \"Overseas Dependent Territories\" in conjunction with the drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence.<ref name=\"Jackson-303\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 303.</ref> Franco's government calculated that Britain would be willing to give up an expensive possession that no longer had a great deal of military value,<ref name=\"Jackson-294\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 294.</ref> but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-295\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 295.</ref> The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|a referendum in September 1967]] in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain and only 44 supported union with Spain.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\"/> Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants \"pseudo-Gibraltarians\"<ref name=\"Jackson-306\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 306.</ref> and stating that the \"real\" Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\"/>\n\nThe dispute initially took the form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-300\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 300.</ref> Further restrictions were imposed in 1964,<ref name=\"Jackson-308\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 308.</ref> and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles.  The following year, Spain closed its airspace to aircraft taking off or landing at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]. In 1969, after the passing of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969|Gibraltar Constitution Order]], to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.<ref name=\"Jackson-316\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 316.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish decision had major consequences not only for the political relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom, but\nfor the people of Gibraltar, many of whom had relatives or homes in Spain. As one of the Gibraltarians who suffered the closure of the frontier explains:\n\n{{quote|The saddest sight was seeing people behind the wire fences on both sides of the land frontier yelling at the top of their voices across the wide dividing space to enquire about the state of relatives, as telephone communications had been cut by the Spaniards. Local housewives with Spanish relatives in the Campo area kept their radios tuned to the nearby Spanish stations for news of family members who were gravely ill. In critical cases the parties concerned would rush to Spain via Tangiers but unfortunately sometimes the patient was dead and buried by the time they arrived. The Spanish authorities would not allow access across the land frontier even on compassionate grounds.<ref>[[#Levey|Levey]], p. 35.</ref>}}\n\nFranco's death in 1975 led to the beginnings of diplomatic movement between Britain and Spain on the Gibraltar issue, though not immediately.
